Yolanda S\u00e1nchez Figueroa, mayor of Cotija in Michoac\u00e1n state,\u00a0was walking from a gym back to her house with her bodyguard when they were shot by people in a white van, the state attorney general said in a statement. Both S\u00e1nchez Figueroa and her bodyguard later died in hospital, it said, adding that an investigation has been launched. Confirmation of S\u00e1nchez Figueroa\u2019s death came hours after Claudia Sheinbaum\u00a0won a landslide victory to become the first female president of Mexico, marking an achievement in a country known for its patriarchal culture and widespread femicide. Widespread violence against politicians loomed large in the election, the bloodiest in Mexico\u2019s history. Dozens of political candidates and applicants were killed by criminal organizations during the campaign season in attempts to influence the vote. Sheinbaum will begin her presidency on October 1, replacing the outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, her longtime ally whose social welfare programs lifted many Mexicans out of poverty, making their leftist Morena party favorite in the polls. But she inherits an epidemic of gang-led violence and unsolved disappearances in the country and faces an urgent task to bolster domestic and border security. Mexico\u2019s\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is among the highest in the world and it remains a dangerous place for women,\u00a0 with figures showing\u00a0around 10 women\u00a0are murdered every day.

{"id": "2024_06_04_asia_cambodia-lloyd-austin-china-intl-hnk", "text": "US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin traveled to Cambodia on Tuesday to meet with the country\u2019s prime minister and defense minister, as Washington becomes increasingly concerned that Phnom Penh\u00a0may grant China\u2019s military exclusive access to a key naval base. Austin\u2019s trip to the Cambodian capital marks his second visit to the Southeast Asian country as Secretary of Defense but is the first time a United States defense chief has traveled to Cambodia specifically to hold a bilateral meeting with his counterpart, Defense Minister Tea Seiha. The outreach reflects the US\u2019 desire to forge a better relationship with Cambodia, defense officials said, particularly as Beijing\u2019s influence over the country has only continued to grow in recent years. \u201cWe believe there is potentially an opportunity, with leadership transition in Cambodia, for us to sit down and talk about how our relationship might have a more positive and optimistic path in the future,\u201d a senior defense official told reporters, referring to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, who took office last year following his father Hun Sen\u2019s nearly four-decade rule. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a visit that is about significant deliverables and achievements.\u201d Austin did express the US\u2019 concerns, however, about China\u2019s funding of and presence at Cambodia\u2019s Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand, officials said. In December, China docked two warships at the base, which is in a highly strategic position close to the South China Sea. Cambodian officials have repeatedly denied the facility would be used by China as a naval base, insisting the project is in line with Cambodia\u2019s constitution, which bars foreign military bases on its territory. Chinese officials, meanwhile, have described the base as an\u00a0\u201caid project\u201d\u00a0to strengthen Cambodia\u2019s navy and called assertions otherwise \u201chype\u201d with \u201culterior motives.\u201d Beijing claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the 1.3-million-square-mile South China Sea, a characterization the US and many of its Indo-Pacific allies reject. Chinese vessels and aircraft have been widely documented harassing others operating in the area, including American ships and planes. The US has been particularly alarmed in recent weeks by China\u2019s attacks on Philippine vessels in the South China Sea using powerful water cannons. China also carried out large-scale military drills around the self-governing island of Taiwan last week as \u201cpunishment\u201d for its inauguration of a new president, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty. The behavior underscores why the US is worried about the possibility that China could establish a new military outpost so close to the key waterway. \u201cThere are no doubts about where our concerns are,\u201d a Pentagon spokesperson said following Austin\u2019s meetings, when asked about Ream. \u201cMeeting face-to-face gives us a chance not only to speak clearly about our concerns, but to talk about how we might work together in the future to strengthen our relationship. And we don\u2019t ask any country to choose between partners.\u201d But as China and Cambodia have reaffirmed their military cooperation, relations between Washington and Phnom Penh have grown increasingly strained. Cambodia canceled military exercises with the US in 2017 and demolished a US-built facility at Ream in 2020, as the US has repeatedly condemned the country\u2019s poor human rights record and democratic backsliding. Last year, the Biden administration\u00a0imposed sanctions on Cambodian individuals in response to Cambodia\u2019s election, which the State Department characterized as \u201cneither free nor fair.\u201d On Tuesday, however, Austin met with former Prime Minister Hun Sen, who now serves as president of Cambodia\u2019s Senate after\u00a0transferring power to his son,\u00a0a military general. Defense officials are particularly hopeful that Austin can forge a relationship with Prime Minister Hun Manet, who, like Austin, attended the US Military Academy at West Point and is seen as more westernized than his father. In a readout following Austin\u2019s meetings, the Pentagon said\u00a0the \u201cofficials\u00a0discussed opportunities to strengthen the US-Cambodia bilateral defense relationship in support of regional peace and security, including through the resumption of military training exchanges on disaster assistance and United Nations Peacekeeping, training and exchanges on de-mining and unexploded ordnance clearance, and Cambodia\u2019s access to US PME [professional military education] programs. They also welcomed continued discussions about these issues between their respective defense establishments.\u201d Austin\u2019s visit to Phnom Penh capped a five-day trip to Asia, where he attended the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore and warned of China\u2019s \u201ccoercive\u201d activities in the region while working to deepen the US\u2019 relationships with key Asian leaders. In a meeting with China\u2019s Defense Minister Dong Jun last week, their first face-to-face, Austin said the US wants to keep military-to-military channels open with the Chinese to avoid misunderstandings and escalation. In a combative speech later on, Dong appeared to agree with that, but he also slammed \u201cexternal interfering forces\u201d for selling arms and having \u201cillegal official contacts\u201d with Taiwan \u2014 a thinly veiled reference to the US, which maintains close yet unofficial ties with the island democracy. In the same remarks, however, Dong said Beijing \u201cnever acts from the so-called position of strength.\u201d A senior US official told CNN that the speech was \u201cat complete odds with the reality\u201d of\u00a0China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s\u00a0\u201ccoercive activity across the region.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/asia/cambodia-lloyd-austin-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

The killing occurred in Bogot\u00e1 in January 2023, and has since captured public attention in Colombia. Before her death, Trespalacios was beginning to gain success at music festivals and had been in a romantic relationship with Poulos since 2021, according to accounts from her family and lawyers who took her case. The Office of the Attorney General of Colombia said in a statement after the ruling that its prosecutors had proven that Poulos struck and suffocated his partner and tried to hide the body. \u201cThe security camera records show that the aggressor wrapped the victim\u2019s body, hid it in a suitcase and abandoned it in a garbage container in the town of Fontib\u00f3n, in the west of Bogot\u00e1. It was found there hours later by the authorities,\u201d the AG office said. During Tuesday\u2019s court proceedings, the judge considered that the evidence presented by the prosecutors was sufficient to determine Poulos\u2019 guilt, imposing a prison sentence of 42 years and eight months \u2013 about five years less than what prosecutors had requested. Additionally, the judge prohibited Poulos from approaching or attempting to communicate with Trespalacios\u2019 family for 20 years, and ordered that he be expelled from Colombia once he completes his sentence. Poulos\u2019 defense team has said it will appeal the judgement. It had argued that Poulos was innocent of femicide and that he should instead be tried for homicide, which would carry a lesser sentence. In Colombia, femicide \u2014 the killing of a woman because of her gender \u2014 is considered a more serious crime than homicide. Under Colombian law, femicide is often punished with a higher penalty. Defense lawyer Fredy Sp\u00edndola told the Focus Noticias channel that he and his client believe the witnesses \u201cwere all in cahoots, that they all said the same thing.\u201d The victim\u2019s legal team, meanwhile, celebrated the sentence, saying it recognizes that Trespalacios was a victim of various types of violence. \u201cIt is a fair decision for us, which is also consistent with the material evidentiary elements, with the theory of the case that we had from the beginning. From the beginning, we established that we were facing objectification, an instrumentalization of a woman through various factors, psychological violence, violence of various types, including physical violence,\u201d lawyer Miguel \u00c1ngel del R\u00edo told Focus Noticias. Poulos was detained in Panama in January 2023, when he was trying to fly to Turkey. He was then deported to Colombia, where he denied the charges against him. He was sentenced almost a year and a half after Trespalacios\u2019 death. Del R\u00edo also pointed out that only until the conviction is made final in a second-instance appellate court will Trespalacios\u2019 family be able to seek reparation for damages.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/americas/american-john-poulos-sentenced-valentina-trespalacios-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

And heat hasn\u2019t peaked yet. July-like high temperatures will top out at 20 to 25 degrees above normal in multiple Western states this week and could break several daily record high temperatures. Thursday will be the hottest day of the week for millions of people. The temperatures will be dangerous for those exposed to the elements and unable to cool off. Relief from the heat won\u2019t be found at night, either \u2013 another symptom of a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. The extreme heat already turned deadly over the weekend with worse to come. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for nearly 19 million people in California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah and South Texas. The warnings are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service and are used when widespread, dangerous heat is expected. The soaring temperatures are being caused by a\u00a0heat dome, a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks. The resulting heat becomes more intense the longer a heat dome lasts. SO HOT: The planet has just lived through a \u2018shocking\u2019 12-month streak of record heat. It\u2019s set to get worse The intense heat began Tuesday in parts of California and the West. Sacramento, California, hit triple digits for the first time this year while Las Vegas ended up just a degree shy of its hottest temperature of the year so far. Numerous daily records were also broken in Texas. Temperatures will soar higher on Wednesday across a larger portion of the Southwest. The most extreme heat will avoid major population centers along the coast, but Los Angeles will still be 5 to 10 degrees warmer than normal this week. TELL US: Worried about affording air conditioning this summer? Share your story Triple-digit temperatures will become widespread in California\u2019s Central Valley Wednesday and stick around into the weekend. Conditions will also sizzle in Southern California\u2019s desert regions. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, will likely reach a high temperature of at least 120 degrees by Thursday. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn\u2019t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. Phoenix will likely hit 110 degrees for the first time this year by Thursday, even though the city doesn\u2019t typically encounter these temperatures until mid-June. High temperatures are forecast to climb into the low 110s in Las Vegas, likely tying this year with 2010 for the earliest such reading on record in the city. Summerlike heat will also send daily high temperature records tumbling. Phoenix; Las Vegas; Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day\u2019s high temperature record could fall on one or more days this week. By Friday, records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Colorado as heat expands north and east. Deadly heat on the US-Mexico border Dangerous heat isn\u2019t new for the far southern US. Brutal heat in Mexico crept north into southern Texas earlier this spring and has been unrelenting for weeks. Several cities along the Texas-Mexico border experienced their hottest May on record. The triple digit temperatures at the border proved deadly last weekend after US Border Patrol agents said four migrants died \u201cfrom heat stroke and dehydration.\u201d The deaths were part of \u201cseveral emergencies\u201d involving heat-related illnesses last weekend, according to the US Border Patrol, El Paso Sector.

{"id": "2024_06_01_europe_netenyahu-ceasefire-hamas-contradiction-biden-intl", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that the conditions for ending the country\u2019s war in Gaza \u201chave not changed,\u201d raising questions over a peace proposal\u00a0laid out by US President Joe Biden which he said Israel submitted. During a speech Friday, Biden said Hamas had been degraded to a point where it can no longer carry out the type of attack seen on October 7 that launched the current war. Part of the agreement, he said, would see a truce and hostage exchange while Israel and Hamas negotiate a permanent end to the fighting. It was perhaps the furthest Biden has gone in telling Israel its stated goals for its operation in Gaza\u00a0have\u00a0been met, and that the time has\u00a0arrived to stop the fighting. The proposal has been welcomed across the international community. The UN, the UK, France, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have all expressed support for Biden\u2019s proposal, while Qatar and Egypt joined the US in calling on Israel and Hamas to \u201cfinalize\u201d the proposed ceasefire agreement. For its part, Hamas said it viewed the plan \u201cpositively\u201d and is ready \u201cto deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire.\u201d But a statement from the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office on Saturday said Israel\u2019s goals \u2014 \u201cthe destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel\u201d \u2014 would need to be met before a permanent ceasefire can begin. \u201cUnder the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent ceasefire is put in place. The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter,\u201d the statement said. Saturday\u2019s statement largely reiterated earlier comments from the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) made less than an hour after Biden detailed the peace proposal on Friday, with Netanyahu insisting the country would not end the war until Hamas is defeated and all hostages had been returned. For all the messaging, however, it is unclear exactly to what degree Israel supports the plan. The earlier PMO statement insisted the \u201cexact outline\u201d of the proposal allows Israel to \u201cmaintain\u201d its goals in the conflict. The Israeli online newspaper The Times of Israel said that Netanyahu\u2019s statement on Saturday was geared towards outlining what kind of ceasefire agreement Israel is prepared to agree to, rather than ruling one out. Domestic pressure mounts for Netanyahu Netanyahu is facing domestic pressure, both from opposition leaders to get a ceasefire agreement on the table, and from ministers within his own party not to back down on Israel\u2019s original war goals. Families of Israelis being held hostage are meanwhile urging him to accept the proposal. Protesters took to the streets of several cities across Israel on Saturday, demanding Netanyahu\u2019s resignation and for early elections to be held. They also demanded the release of all hostages held in Gaza and for the Israeli government to accept the latest proposal laid out by Biden. Families of hostages held in Gaza took part in protests in Tel Aviv, Caesaria, Haifa, Herzeliya, Kfar Saba. At Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, protesters called the names of the 125 hostages still in Hamas captivity. \u201cStart streaming this deal, so that it will start moving\u2026 Start working, start acting,\u201d a woman in Tel Aviv shouted over a loudspeaker. In Caesarea, protesters called for Netanyahu to accept the hostage release deal that Biden presented. \u201cThere is no victory until every last hostage is returned,\u201d people chanted. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid wrote on X Saturday that Israel\u2019s government \u201ccannot ignore President Biden\u2019s significant speech.\u201d Lapid said he was offering\u00a0Netanyahu a \u201csafety net,\u201d saying he would support\u00a0him\u00a0in securing a hostage deal if far-right ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich left the government. Gvir, Israel\u2019s National Security Minister, had previously threatened to leave\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s coalition if a ceasefire is reached before Israel achieves its declared war aims. Also in his speech on Saturday, Biden alluded to the tensions in the Israeli government, making a direct appeal to ordinary\u00a0Israelis\u00a0to voice their support for a hostage agreement that would result in a ceasefire. \u201cI know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some, some are even in the government coalition,\u201d he said. The international pressure Netanyahu\u2019s government is facing to end the war in Gaza has also been mounting, as the conflict approaches its ninth month. The war was triggered by Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7, which left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 200 people taken hostage. The Israeli campaign in Gaza since then has killed more than 36,000 people. Fighting continues. This week, the Israeli military confirmed that it was operating in the centre of Rafah, southern Gaza, while a top Israeli security official warned the conflict could last into next year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/europe/netenyahu-ceasefire-hamas-contradiction-biden-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_europe_ukraine-western-weapons-hit-russian-territory-intl-latam", "text": "Ukrainian forces\u00a0claimed Monday that they had successfully hit a Russian S-300 missile system using Western-supplied weapons inside Russian territory. \u201cIt burns beautifully. It\u2019s a Russian S-300. On Russian territory. The first days after permission to use Western weapons on enemy territory,\u201d Ukrainian government minister Iryna Vereshchuk posted on Facebook alongside a picture purporting to show the strike. This comes just days after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes using US weapons in Russian territory around Kharkiv, after several European nations had removed restrictions on how the weapons can be used. It is unclear if the weapons used in the strike described by Vereshchuk were US-supplied. Ukraine had for months pleaded with Washington to allow it to strike targets on Russian soil with US weapons, as Moscow launched a brutal aerial and ground assault on Kharkiv, safe in the knowledge that its troops could retreat back to Russian soil to regroup and its weapons depots could not be targeted with Western arms. The permission granted by the US was both groundbreaking and bold, but tentative and highly conditional. Ukraine can only hit targets around Kharkiv, and the US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles). For that reason, military analysts praised the decision, but tempered expectations. Franz-Stefan Gady, an associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN the GMLRS cross-border strikes will allow Ukraine \u201cto hit some Russian staging areas, command and control centers, as well as supply depots. It will not stop but complicate Russian military operations against Kharkhiv.\u201d Mathieu Boulegue, a consulting fellow at UK-based Chatham House, told CNN the policy change was \u201cnot a game changer, per se. It\u2019s an add-on, a steroid, an extra booster for Ukraine to defend itself.\u201d While the removal of this taboo appears to mark a new chapter in the war, Russia has already experienced Ukrainian strikes with Western weapons on territory to which it lays claim. Ukraine has frequently targeted occupied Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, using \u201cStorm Shadow\u201d missiles provided by the\u00a0United Kingdom. Ukraine also launched strikes on Kharkiv and Kherson in late 2022, as it sought to liberate the regions occupied by Russia in the early weeks of the war. Then as now, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials rattled the nuclear saber in an attempt to deter Western support. Before Biden gave Kyiv the green light, Putin said the decision could lead to \u201cserious consequences,\u201d particularly for \u201csmall and densely populated countries.\u201d The US joined several other European countries, including the UK, France and Germany, in removing this particular restriction on how Ukraine can use the weapons it has been given. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Biden\u2019s decision to allow some strikes in Russian territory as a \u201cstep forward\u201d that will help his forces defend the embattled Kharkiv region.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/europe/ukraine-western-weapons-hit-russian-territory-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_africa_burkina-faso-most-neglected-crisis-intl", "text": "Burkina Faso has been named the world\u2019s most neglected displacement crisis by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) for the second year. In its\u00a0annual report, released Monday, the NRC said the West African country saw a record-high 707,000 new displacements in 2023, driven by escalating violence and a worsening humanitarian crisis. Nine out of the 10 most neglected crises outlined in the report were in Africa, with Cameroon, Central African Republic, Mali, and Niger holding the second to fifth positions respectively. The NRC said in a\u00a0press release Monday\u00a0its criteria for neglected displacement crises are: \u201clack of humanitarian funding, lack of media attention, and a lack of international political and diplomatic initiatives compared to the number of people in need.\u201d The NCR report said 2023 saw a record-breaking shortfall in aid budgets of around $32 billion, leaving more than half of humanitarian needs worldwide unmet. Neglect now \u2018the new normal\u2019 The report said media coverage of the displacement crisis in Burkina Faso and international political engagement with the crisis were \u201cnegligible\u201d in 2023, adding that only 37% of requested humanitarian funding had been received by the country, leaving a significant gap in aid. \u201cThe utter neglect of displaced people has become the new normal,\u201d said Jan Egeland, Secretary General of NRC. \u201cThe local political and military elites disregard the suffering they cause, and the world is neither shocked nor compelled to act by stories of desperation and record-breaking statistics. We need a global reboot of solidarity and a refocus on where needs are greatest.\u201d The report added that media coverage in Burkina Faso also declined as \u201caccess became more difficult for both journalists and humanitarian organisations.\u201d Burkina Faso is currently under military rule after a junta staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in July 2022. Its junta, headed by acting president Captain Ibrahim Traore, has prioritized security due to the multiple lives claimed by attacks. But in April this year, a Human Rights Watch\u00a0(HRW) report found\u00a0that more than 200 people were killed by the country\u2019s military in a campaign against civilians accused of collaborating with armed groups, alleging these could amount to war crimes. Burkina Faso said it \u201cfirmly rejects and condemns such unfounded accusations,\u201d in a\u00a0government press release. The country\u2019s\u00a0media regulatory body, the Superior Council for Communication, announced in the following days it was temporarily suspending broadcasting and access to websites of some western news organizations including the French\u00a0TV5 Monde and Le Monde, the Guardian,\u00a0as well as BBC Africa and VOA. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remained one of the most neglected crises for the eighth consecutive year, with around 6.9 million people displaced by the end of 2023, mainly in the eastern provinces, the report said. A lack of aid forced people to resort to negative coping mechanisms, including exchanging sexual favors for food, money, and other survival needs, the report stated. Sudan came in at number ten. Although the war which broke out in April last year has resulted in a death toll in the tens of thousands, more than eight million people internally displaced and nearly 25 million people in need of aid, the NRC remarked the crisis has been \u201cgrossly neglected.\u201d Recurrent attacks Violence-related deaths in Burkina Faso doubled in 2023, according to the NRC. The country faces recurrent attacks often blamed on \u201cterrorists.\u201d In February last year, the murder of two Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) aid workers led the organization to suspend activities in the region. By the end of the year, up to two million people were trapped in 36 blockaded towns, with over 40,000 facing catastrophic food insecurity, according to the report. A displaced mother in northern Burkina Faso, Asseta, shared her struggle with NRC researchers: \u201cWhen we have nothing to cook, I pick leaves and boil them in water,\u201d she said, as quoted in the organization\u2019s release. Egeland emphasized the growing difficulty in reaching those in need due to dangerous roads and the prohibitively expensive minimal air services. \u201cDonors and humanitarians must prioritize areas that are out-of-sight to ensure they do not become out-of-mind,\u201d he urged. The NRC says around 6.3 million people will need humanitarian assistance in 2024, with over two million remaining internally displaced. Hundreds of civilians have already been killed in attacks this year, including around 170 in three villages in March, and approximately 30 in separate mosque and church attacks in February. The NRC\u2019s report noted that many neglected crises are interconnected, with ripple effects beyond borders affecting neighboring countries and sometimes causing broader regional impacts. Competition over resources between refugees and local communities, driven by a lack of funds, can also cause tension.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/africa/burkina-faso-most-neglected-crisis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

Military officers from around the world thronged the halls of the luxury hotel, their shoulders dripping with gold braids and epaulets, complicated colored bars lined up on the chests of their dress uniforms like some martial game of Tetris. Every few minutes a defense minister strode purposely through the mix, surrounded by a phalanx of aides and escorts. This gathering is an annual spectacle that to the uninitiated might seem surreal. But the topics being discussed here are deadly serious. The annual Shangri-La Dialogue is one of the few places in the world where you can watch warriors who spend their careers preparing for armed conflict, engaged in polite, carefully-moderated debate. The stakes this year could hardly be higher. War rages in both the Middle East and Europe. Meanwhile China\u2019s increasingly assertive moves has much of the Asia-Pacific on edge. The Singapore summit brought key players together. Where else would you have the President of the Philippines, a nation whichdo has seen its vessels increasingly targeted by Chinese coast guard ships in the disputed South China Sea, deliver a keynote address on the same stage that, two days later, Beijing\u2019s new Defense Minister makes his debut appearance? There was even a surprise appearance from Ukraine\u2019s embattled president Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 and a first face-to-face meeting between US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Adm Dong Jun. Given its location in the city-state of Singapore, events in Asia \u2013 and in particular China\u2019s behavior in the region \u2013 stalked the conference. In his keynote speech, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. issued a stark warning about the ongoing confrontations between Philippine and China Coast Guard vessels in a contested part of the South China Sea. \u201cIf a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war.\u201d Two days later, China\u2019s Adm Dong fired back from the same stage, accusing the Philippines of \u201cblackmail\u201d in the maritime dispute. \u201cThere is a limit to our restraint,\u201d said Admiral Dong Jun. \u201cI saw that as a threat,\u201d said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a research professor at Indonesia\u2019s National Research and Innovation Center who has been attending the Shangri-La Dialogue since its founding twenty-one years ago. \u201cIn decades past, the Chinese only came in a small number and they were extremely quiet,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cNow they\u2019re very self confident\u2026they intervene in all the sessions.\u201d The open nature of the Shangri-La Dialogue provides delegates with a unique opportunity to ask blunt questions of speakers. After his speech on Sunday, China\u2019s Dong received many questions from audience members on Beijing\u2019s increased threats towards self-governing Taiwan as well as its disputed claims in the South China Sea, and he replied in unapologetic terms. The \u201cseparatists\u201d in Taiwan\u2019s newly-elected government would\u00a0be \u201cnailed to the pillar of shame in history,\u201d he said. But equally, Chinese military officers also used Q&A sessions at other key moments to make their views known. Senior Colonel Yanzhong Cao of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army asked US Secretary of Defense asked US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin whether the US was trying to build a NATO-like alliance in the Asia-Pacific region, adding the claim \u201cthe eastward expansion of NATO has led to the Ukraine crisis.\u201d \u201cI respectfully disagree,\u201d Austin replied, the audience in the ballroom then erupting into a rare burst of applause. \u201cThe Ukraine crisis obviously was caused because Mr. Putin made a decision to unlawfully invade his neighbor,\u201d Austin continued. \u201cThis was brought on because of a decision by Mr. Putin.\u201d Later that day, Ukrainian leader Zelensky got a borderline rock star welcome when he made a surprise appearance at the conference, dressed in his trademark fatigues and black t-shirt. \u201cWe stand with you,\u201d Ng Eng Hen, Singapore\u2019s minister of defense, later said to Zelensky. But the large contingent of Chinese army officers present at other sessions was notably absent during Zelensky\u2019s speech and the Ukrainian leader said he failed to secure a one-on-one meeting with Chinese officials during his Singapore visit. He also accused Beijing of aiding Ukraine\u2019s mortal enemy. \u201cWith China\u2019s support to Russia, the war will last longer.\u00a0\u00a0That is bad for the whole world, and the policy of China \u2013 who declares that it supports territorial integrity and sovereignty and declares it officially. For them it is not good,\u201d Zelensky told journalists. It was not clear whether Zelensky succeeded in securing new support for Kyiv from non-aligned south-east Asian countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. Instead, Indonesian president-elect and retired general Prabowo Subianto \u2013 the new leader of the world\u2019s most populous Muslim majority nation \u2013 spent much of his speech calling for an end to the on-going carnage in Gaza and an investigation into recent Israeli attacks that killed dozens of displaced civilians in Rafah. Another political elephant in the room was what direction might the United States be heading in. The Singapore gathering began just hours after a 12-person jury in a court-room in New York City\u00a0convicted former US President Donald Trump on of all 34 counts of falsifying business records in his hush money criminal trial. Asia is watching very closely for whether Trump will return to office in November and what impact that might have on the world\u2019s most populous continent and a region already fraught with very real geopolitical fault lines. Republican Senator Dan Sullivan requested not to discuss Trump during a meeting with journalists, instead directing reporters to a press release. \u201cThis is a very sad day for American and the rule of law,\u201d Sullivan\u2019s statement said, calling the verdict a \u201cgross abuse of our justice system.\u201d But speaking to journalists, the Senator from Alaska also celebrated what he called America\u2019s \u201ccommitment to liberty and democracy,\u201d saying this marked a competitive advantage over \u201cauthoritarian aggression led by China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.\u201d Sullivan was part of a bi-partisan delegation seeking to demonstrate Congressional commitment to US allies in Asia. \u201cThe dictators we are allied against\u2026are ally poor,\u201d Sullivan said. But there are clearly concerns about US reliability. An academic from Japan \u2013 Washington\u2019s closest ally in Asia \u2013 asked defense chiefs from Singapore and Malaysia about Trump\u2019s possible re-election.\u00a0 He called it a \u201cnightmare\u201d scenario. That triggered nervous laughter from the audience and on stage. Singapore\u2019s Dr. Ng Eng Hen gamely responded, \u201cwe will work with any administration in any country if we can find common ground.\u201d I vividly remember collective nervousness at the 2017 Shangri-La Dialogue, held just months after Trump\u2019s inauguration. Trump\u2019s then secretary of defense James Mattis clearly sought to reassure American defense partners worried about the new mercurial president. \u201cBear with us,\u201d Mattis told the audience, after being asked whether the \u201cAmerica First\u201d commander-in-chief would contribute to the destruction of the post-World War II order. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve exhausted all possible alternatives, the Americans will do the right thing.\u00a0 We will still be there.\u201d Seven years later, uncertainty over the political future of the US is just one of many challenges facing policy makers. One by one, the leaders of armies and navies shared their fears about climate change, nuclear proliferation, wars in Europe and the Middle East and concerns that a miscalculation between the US and Chinese militaries could spiral out of control \u201cThe world cannot withstand a third geopolitical shock,\u201d Singaporean defense chief Dr. Ng warned, after invoking the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts. In this tense geopolitical environment, it\u2019s far better for commanders to put on their dress uniforms and rub shoulders in the halls of a five-star hotel, than aim at each other over gun barrels on the battlefield.

{"id": "2024_05_29_tech_ransomware-attacks-hospitals-patients-danger", "text": "A ransomware attack on a major US hospital network that began three weeks ago is endangering patients\u2019 health as nurses are forced to manually enter prescription information and work without electronic health records, nurses at two hospitals affected by the cyberattack told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s putting patients\u2019 lives in danger,\u201d said a nurse who works at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital, a 290-bed facility about 25 miles north of downtown Detroit. \u201cPeople have too many patients for what is safe. Nurses are taking on five or six patients dealing with all of this paper charting.\u201d Another nurse, who works who works at a 409-bed Ascension hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, told CNN: \u201cIt is frightening how many safety guardrails [have been] out of service without any computers.\u201d The nurses spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs. The cyberattack hit Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit that oversees 140 hospitals across 19 states, on May 8, but the healthcare network is still working to bring its systems back online. Ransomware attacks that cut off access to electronic health records are a grimly regular occurrence in American life. The health care sector\u00a0reported\u00a0249 ransomware attacks to the FBI last year, more than any other sector, with some cases affecting patient records. But the Ascension incident is raising concerns about the threat to patient health posed by cybercriminals in a way that numerous other ransomware attacks on US health providers haven\u2019t, according to interviews with nurses and cybersecurity experts. The two Ascension nurses said in separate interviews that they felt overwhelmed by the abrupt shift to paper records following the cyberattack, underwhelmed by their hospitals\u2019 plans for dealing with the situation and worried that they or their colleagues will make mistakes entering a patient\u2019s vital medical information. \u201cI don\u2019t have any orders in the computer,\u201d the Rochester, Michigan-based nurse said. \u201cI can\u2019t see what labs are ordered and their results.\u201d OPEIU Local 40, a union that represents nurses at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital, distributed an online\u00a0petition\u00a0on Friday saying union members were \u201cdeeply concerned about the current challenges faced by our healthcare professionals\u201d because of the cyberattack, and urged the hospital to take a series of remediating steps, including limiting the nurse-to-patient ratio. Mac Walker, Ascension\u2019s director of media relations, did not answer CNN\u2019s questions about the petition or the nurses\u2019 comments on patient safety. Instead, Walker emailed this statement on Wednesday morning. \u201cRestoring EHR [electronic health records] access has been among the top priorities of our recovery process,\u201d Walker said. \u201cDue to the hard work of our teams over the past several days, we have successfully restored EHR access in our first market and are actively progressing against a plan to restore access across our network on a rolling basis.\u201d Walker did not respond when asked what Ascension\u2019s \u201cfirst market\u201d meant. Ascension, the fourth largest hospital network in the country\u00a0by some measures, said in a public statement Friday that it has been working\u00a0\u201caround the clock with industry-leading cybersecurity experts to safely restore operations across our network.\u201d In the wake of the Ascension hack and another ransomware attack in February that disrupted insurance billing at pharmacies across the US, Biden administration officials say they\u00a0are preparing\u00a0to release a set of minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals.\u00a0But the cybersecurity challenges in the health sector are legion and beyond the scope of any one policy prescription, experts say. Senior officials from the White House and Department of Health and Human Services plan to meet with cybersecurity executives from health care companies on Wednesday to discuss how to better protect hospitals from hackers, three sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. \u2018Exorbitant\u2019 wait times for lab results In statements to the press, Ascension has said that its staff are \u201cappropriately trained to maintain high quality care during downtime.\u201d But the nurses interviewed by CNN say that the shift to paper records and manual operations is taking a toll on hospital operations. With computers down, doctors have been writing paper prescriptions for patients that nurses take to a machine to manually enter without a cross-check from the local pharmacy, according to the two nurses. \u201cThey have to put an override in there to get the medication out,\u201d said Dina Carlisle, president of OPEIU Local 40. \u201cThere\u2019s no second safety check from the pharmacy.\u201d It has also taken an exorbitantly long time to get lab results because of the hack, the nurse in Birmingham, Alabama, told CNN. A \u201cstat lab,\u201d or lab work needed to make quick decisions on patient care, that normally takes 30 minutes to an hour to process has taken hours, the nurse said. A growing problem for hospitals Ransomware attacks in the US\u00a0routinely force hospitals\u00a0to divert ambulances and cancel appointments. That causes a strain on neighboring hospitals that pick up the slack. But a lack of clear public understanding of how cyberattacks on hospitals directly impact patient care is undercutting the urgency needed to deal with the problem, according to health advocates and cybersecurity experts. Researchers are increasingly quantifying how lethal ransomware can be. Roughly 3 in 100 hospitalized Medicare patients will die in the hospital under normal conditions, but during a ransomware attack, that number increases to 4 out of 100 because of the strain on hospital resources,\u00a0according\u00a0to scholars at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, who studied 374 ransomware attacks on health providers. Part of the problem,\u00a0experts say, is that some hospitals have failed basic tests of cybersecurity \u201chygiene,\u201d or sound defensive measures, while many small clinics lack the resources to secure themselves. And, perhaps more than any other sector, health care firms hold an enormous volume of sensitive data that is ripe for targeting and extortion schemes. The number of sensitive data records held by the health care sector grew by more than 63% last year \u201cfar surpassing any other industry and more than five times the global average,\u201d according to a study by security firm Rubrik. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue and snarled service at pharmacies across the US. Andrew Witty, the CEO of\u00a0UnitedHealth Group, which owns Change Healthcare,\u00a0apologized\u00a0in a recent congressional hearing for the security lapse and said he authorized a $22 million ransom payment to hackers to try to protect patient data. Yet a third of Americans could have had their data stolen in the hack, he said. \u201cWe routinely decline healthcare entities unwilling to address things like unpatched critical vulnerabilities, misconfigurations or uneven application of MFA [multi-factor authentication] \u2014 the very things hackers leverage to breach systems. And then we regularly see them breached later,\u201d Sezaneh Seymour, head of regulatory risk and policy at cyber insurance firm Coalition, told CNN. (She said her firm had no specific insights into the Change Healthcare or Ascension ransomware attacks.) Health care providers also make attractive targets for cyber extortionists because hospitals can ill-afford to be offline for long because of the disruptions it causes to operations. \u201cWhen we look at ransomware targeting, it\u2019s: who is the most easily targetable, who can afford little downtime and who has the highest willingness to pay,\u201d Bryan Vorndran, the FBI\u2019s senior most cyber-focused official, said in an interview. \u201cAnd where there\u2019s low-downtime environments, you have obviously a willingness to pay more so than in environments where they can afford downtime,\u201d Vorndran told CNN. \u201cI think all of that is relevant not just to the healthcare sector but to some other sectors as well.\u201d He declined to comment when asked about the Ascension hack.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/tech/ransomware-attacks-hospitals-patients-danger/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_donald-trump-conviction-european-allies-reaction-intl", "text": "European allies of former US President Donald Trump have rallied around him in support following his historic conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The conviction \u2013 which has been heralded as a somber moment for America with wide-reaching implications \u2013 has been painted by Trump\u2019s allies in Europe as political persecution, aimed at derailing his bid to return to White House. Italy\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini called Trump\u2019s conviction \u201cjudicial harassment\u201d in a post on X, while Hungarian President Viktor Orban urged him to \u201ckeep on fighting\u201d for the presidency. But other countries declined to comment on the development \u2013 a conventional response for governments when asked about another nation\u2019s domestic matters. A Manhattan jury\u00a0found Trump guilty\u00a0of all 34 charges\u00a0of falsifying business records on Thursday, an unprecedented verdict that makes\u00a0him the first former president in American history to be convicted of a felony. The\u00a0verdict\u00a0was announced after jurors deliberated for nearly 12 hours over two days. It will ultimately be up to voters in November to decide the significance of the guilty verdict delivered by 12 ordinary New Yorkers, which, on a legal basis, does not prevent him from being elected president again. Salvini, who is a long-time supporter of the former president and visited him in Philadelphia,\u00a0Pennsylvania during his first presidential campaign, said Trump was a \u201cvictim of judicial harassment and a process of political nature.\u201d He wrote on X that \u201cin Italy, we are sadly familiar with the weaponization of the justice system by the left,\u201d which he said has for years tried to \u201celiminate political opponents through legal means.\u201d \u201cI hope Trump wins; it would be a guarantee of greater balance and hope for world peace,\u201d he added. Orb\u00e1n said he knew Trump to be \u201ca man of honour.\u201d \u201cAs president, he always put America first, he commanded respect around the world and used this respect to build peace,\u201d he said Friday in a\u00a0post\u00a0on \u2018X\u2019. \u201cLet the people make their verdict this November!

Two people and a firefighter have been confirmed dead in Bavaria state, Juergen Weiss of the Bavarian firefighters\u2019 association told CNN. One of those killed was washed away in her car, while the cause of death for the second civilian is not yet known. The firefighter died when his inflatable rubber boat capsized on Saturday. Meanwhile, two more people died in their basement in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, police said. Authorities believe they perished while trying to pump water out of their basement. Six people and a 22-year-old firefighter remain missing, regional authorities say. After heavy rainfall, the German Armed Forces has sent 800 personnel to the region to help with rescue efforts. The German weather service has forecast no more heavy rainfall. The River Danube is the center of concern for rescue efforts, with high levels of water passing through the city of Regensburg on Tuesday morning, following an evacuation effort the evening before. On Tuesday morning, the level of the Danube had reached 31.5 feet (9.6 meters) in Passau, according to the Bavarian State Environmental Office, almost double the normal level for this time of year. Three rivers meet in the historic university town, where authorities have stopped motorized traffic and emptied underground car parks. In Bavaria, more than 52,000 emergency workers have been deployed, most of them volunteers, the firefighters\u2019 association said. But it added the vast area of flooding posed challenges for them. Climate change to blame German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said during a visit to the flood areas on Monday that increased flooding was an indication of climate change. \u201cWe are very clear about the fact that this is not just an event that has been happening for centuries, but that there are already more and more cases where we have to deal with disasters, floods in particular,\u201d\u00a0Scholz said. Economy Minister and Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck also noted Sunday that climate change is causing more severe weather events. \u201cWhat we are seeing is that the frequency of these events is increasing significantly. Record floods occur every few years \u2026 record rainfall every few years,\u201d Habeck, of the Greens Party, told broadcaster n-tv. Deadly floods hit Western Europe in 2021, with at least 220 people killed between July 12 and 15, mostly in Germany. Analysis into that event by climate scientists found that the record rainfall which triggered the deadly floods was made between 1.2 and nine times more likely by human-caused climate change. Other areas of Europe have also been affected by heavy rainfall in recent days. Firefighters near the city of Udine in Northeastern Italy said Sunday they recovered the bodies of two young women who were swept away by strong currents in the Natisone river, which was swollen by the precipitation. Firefighters say they are looking for the body of a third person. Slovenia was hit by flooding Monday evening. The Radenci and Gornja Radgona municipalities, near the Austrian border, were the worst affected in the country, according to public broadcaster RTV SLO. Likewise, flooding and landslides hit Croatia\u2019s Krapina-Zagorje county, in the north of the country on the border with Slovenia, following heavy rainfall on Monday, according to public news agency HINA.

Cross-border attacks from Lebanon led to large fires blazing through Israel\u2019s northern region this week, consuming swathes of land and leading to the evacuation of residents. Israel attributed the blaze to rocket fire from southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah said it had launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at Israeli military sites. On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the northern city of Kiryat Shmona\u00a0near the Lebanese border, saying that Israel is prepared for \u201cvery intense action\u201d in the north. \u201cWhoever thinks that they can hurt us and that we will sit idly by is making a big mistake,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cOne way or another, we will restore security to the north.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s comments come after Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said the Israeli military is ready to attack targets in the north. \u201cWe are prepared after a very good process of training \u2013 up to the level of a military exercise \u2013 to move to an attack in the north. Strong defense, readiness to attack, we are approaching a decision point,\u201d Halevi said on Tuesday. Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been trading fire since the start of Israel\u2019s war on Hamas in Gaza in October. In April, the IDF said it is \u201cpreparing to move from defense to attack,\u201d referring to operations on the northern border. The Lebanese group has said its attacks on Israel are in protest to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s second-in-command, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that Hezbollah is a front to support Gaza \u201cand that front doesn\u2019t stop until the war (in Gaza) stops.\u201d He said that the group\u2019s assessment was that recent threats from Israel were not serious. \u201cEither way, we have decided not to widen the battle and we do not want an all-out war. But if it is imposed on us, we are ready and we won\u2019t retreat,\u201d he said. The IDF says it has killed around 300 Hezbollah fighters, and Reuters reported that around 80 civilians have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli fire. Ten Israeli civilians and 18 soldiers have also been killed on the border, the Israeli military said. More than 94,000 Lebanese have been displaced from areas and towns close to the border with Israel since the conflict started, according to figures released Tuesday by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. More than 53,000 Israelis have been evacuated from the country\u2019s north since hostilities began in October, the IDF told CNN. \u2018Strategic trap\u2019 \u201cIsrael has been caught in a strategic trap up north,\u201d Amos Harel, a defense analyst, wrote in Israeli newspaper Haaretz on Wednesday. \u201cIt has proven unable to force Hezbollah into a cease-fire as long as the fighting in Gaza continues, whereas the Lebanese organization has managed to create a kind of \u2018security zone\u2019 devoid of residents inside Israeli territory, despite suffering much higher losses than the IDF has.\u201d On Wednesday, far-right Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir said it was now the IDF\u2019s job to \u201csimply to destroy Hezbollah\u201d. \u201cIt cannot be that our land is being targeted and harmed, and people here have evacuated,\u201d he said on Telegram. \u201cAll Hezbollah strongholds must be burned and destroyed. War!\u201d Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said in an interview with Israeli radio station Reshet bet however that the IDF isn\u2019t interested in broadening the war to eliminate Hezbollah. The military is \u201ctelling us right now that it doesn\u2019t want to\u2026 launch an attack in the north, fight and defeat Hezbollah, and overwhelm it and create a security zone.\u201d Amid an uptick in tensions on the border, senior Israeli minister Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet, has said that the country cannot afford to lose another year in the north. \u201cI have been fighting for months with the government, with the prime minister and with everyone, that by September 1 we will finish the job here and be able to start something else. It will happen with either a solution or escalation, but we can\u2019t lose another year here,\u201d he said. Last month, Gantz threatened to leave the national unity government unless a six-point plan was agreed by June 8 that included the return of residents displaced by attacks from Lebanon. An Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, Hezbollah has opened another front against Israel. The group is seen as Iran\u2019s most effective non-state partner, possessing 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses if an all-out war breaks out. A wider conflict could also draw Iran and the United States into the war. Israel and Iran came close to war in April after launching unprecedented direct attacks on each other\u2019s soil. \u201cNot only is there no military solution on the horizon (in northern Israel), but the time that\u2019s passed has led many to consider leaving the area permanently, especially with a new school year due to open in September,\u201d Harel wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/middleeast/israel-lebanon-cross-border-tensions-escalate-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_americas_haiti-mss-pentagon-contracts-intl-latam", "text": "As preparations accelerate for a multinational security force to deploy to Haiti, federal contract opportunities from the US Department of Defense detail the minutiae of US involvement in planning for the mission. The Multinational Security Support mission, widely referred to as the MSS, aims to bolster local police in combatting the gangs currently overrunning Haiti\u2019s capital Port-au-Prince. After several delays, the Kenya-led mission is expected to arrive in the Caribbean nation in the coming weeks. The US \u00a0has championed the mission, offering to\u00a0provide hundreds of millions of dollars\u00a0in funding and resources, though drawing a line at boots on the ground. Recent contract opportunities posted to a US General Services Administration website by\u00a0the Defense Department (DOD)\u00a0illustrate how closely the US is involved in kitting out the multinational security\u00a0force \u2014 from security for their still-under-construction base to toothbrushes and internet. On Tuesday May 21, the Defense Department published a contract opportunity for commercial internet service providers capable of supporting about 1,400 users in Haiti, according to the website. Contract opportunities published the same day also advertise opportunities for vendors to provide \u201csundry items\u201d\u2014shampoo, toothbrushes, lotions, and other items\u2014and bedding for 1,300 people in Haiti. As conditions for the mission come together, US security contractors are already on the ground in Haiti, about 150 people as of now, a source familiar with the operation told CNN. A posting on the same website also shows that the\u00a0DOD awarded a $30 million contract to GardaWorld Federal Services LLC for private security and protection\u00a0services in Haiti for contractors preparing the\u00a0mission\u00a0base. GardaWorld, a Canadian company which\u00a0provides logistical, medical, and security services to government and commercial clients, told CNN\u00a0that they were contracted to provide these services at the housing site. The firm has previously been involved with protecting US diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan\u2014a role that is the subject of ongoing litigation initially brought by a former employee, Justin Fahn, who alleges in a whistleblower lawsuit\u00a0the company misled the US about its\u00a0employees\u2019 training. GardaWorld denies these claims in court records, and a spokesperson for the company\u00a0told CNN that it is employing \u201chighly trained security professionals\u201d to guard the facility in Haiti. \u201cBeyond the contract information made publicly available in the\u00a0sam.gov\u00a0platform, we would not have additional details to provide at this time,\u201d a Pentagon spokesperson said when reached for comment by CNN. A long-delayed mission Gang violence has wreaked havoc in Haiti, stifling civilians\u2019 access to food, water, and fuel. Armed groups control large swathes\u00a0of Haiti\u2019s capital city and forced the international airport in Port au Prince to shut down; after nearly three months, commercial flights resumed in mid-May. The MSS base is expected to be located close to Toussaint Louverture International Airport in capital city Port-au-Prince.\u00a0Satellite imagery captured on May 20 by\u00a0Maxar Technologies, obtained by CNN, shows a significant construction close to the\u00a0airport\u00a0since\u00a0mid-May.\u00a0The\u00a0expansion appears to include at least\u00a0five new structures and newly cleared land at the eastern end of the tarmac. US President Joe Biden\u00a0has said that he is working with Congress to provide $300 million for the mission and an additional $60 million for equipment to the country. \u201cThere\u2019s\u00a0going to be US\u00a0forces not on the ground, but we\u2019re going to supply logistics, intelligence, and equipment. Matter of fact, some equipment has already arrived,\u201d Biden said last week during a joint press conference with Kenyan\u00a0President William Ruto. In response to a question later in the briefing, Biden also sought to explain why the US isn\u2019t putting boots on the ground. \u201cFor the United States to deploy forces in the hemisphere just raises all kinds of questions that can be easily misrepresented about what we\u2019re trying to do\u2026 we want to do everything we can without once again looking like America is stepping over, deciding this is what must be done,\u201d Biden said. According to documents seen by CNN, the mission will be helmed by a Kenyan police commissioner and a Jamaican police lieutenant, with other top posts filled by Kenyan staff. The Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Chad, and Jamaica have also promised to contribute personnel to the mission. May 23 was the informal deadline for a contingent to be on the ground, but the initial deployment was delayed last week after a Kenyan delegation assessed that equipment on the ground was insufficient, according to sources in Haiti and DC. Sources said a primary concern for the Kenyan assessors \u2013 including several high-ranking police commanders \u2013 was whether there would be helicopters at the ready for medical evacuation. The MSS was authorized last year\u00a0by the United Nations Security Council\u00a0to\u00a0assist Haitian National Police in fighting gang violence and provide stability in the Caribbean country, following a request for military intervention by its government.\u00a0Police unions and law enforcement sources in Haiti have however complained about a lack of clear planning for how they will coordinate with the foreign force. CNN has reached out to the Haitian National Police for comment on the delay of the mission and logistical preparations for Haiti.

The announcement comes after US President Joe Biden unveiled executive action that would bar people who cross the US-Mexico border illegally from requesting asylum, during periods when there is a high volume of illegal crossings. Unless they meet certain exemptions, the asylum-seekers would be turned away to Mexico or returned to their home countries. The\u00a0president\u2019s proclamation, announced Tuesday, still allows for the normal flow of commerce and legal immigration across the border. Asked whether Biden\u2019s plan could lead to a potential increase of migrants on the Mexican side of the border, Mexico\u2019s president said, \u201cWe are seeking an agreement that if they (the US) make the decision to deport, they do so directly.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador added that he is not worried about Mexican border towns being overwhelmed by asylum seekers pushed back by the US. \u201cThey come to Mexico. We have no problem. We treat them all very well (\u2026) but why not a direct agreement?\u201d he said. Biden and L\u00f3pez Obrador also held a phone call on Tuesday, which the Mexican president described as \u201crespectful\u201d and \u201cvery amicable,\u201d saying they spoke about the need to support Latin American nations. A \u2018virtual wall\u2019 While some critics argue Biden\u2019s sweeping migration measure\u00a0doesn\u2019t go far enough in responding to the large numbers of people showing up at the US southern border, others warn that closing the\u00a0border\u00a0to\u00a0asylum\u00a0seekers\u00a0will endanger vulnerable people. In practice, the new rule would imply \u201cclosing the border\u201d to the thousands of refugees who are in Mexico waiting to reach the United States, Tonatiuh Guill\u00e9n, professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and former commissioner of the National Migration Institute of Mexico, told CNN. \u201cIt implies a kind of virtual wall because people are going to be in a scenario where they are going to be rejected. On the other hand, if this measure is implemented, it leaves thousands of people without the possibility of shelter,\u201d Guillen said. Mexican authorities have largely played down any expected impact. A source at Mexico\u2019s asylum commission COMAR also told CNN that the agency is not very concerned about a potential increase in refugee applications \u201cbecause normally, the migrants who reached the northern border of Mexico are not interested in requesting asylum in Mexico.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said what he \u201cliked the most\u201d about his call with Biden was the US\u2019 plan to build three new border bridges. \u201cThis is going to help a lot in the economic and commercial development throughout the region,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/americas/mexicos-us-deportation-country-of-origin-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_india_india-general-election-result-modi-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "The opposition obituaries had been written. According to most polls, India\u2019s election was a foregone conclusion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s right-wing, Hindu-nationalist alliance was expected to secure a supermajority \u2013 and with it the power to enact radical change unopposed. To Modi\u2019s critics and opponents, India was on the fast track to becoming a de-facto one-party state. But as Trump\u2019s victory of 2016, Brexit and countless other upsets of recent years have shown, opinion polls and analysts can often get it spectacularly wrong. Going into this election, Modi had set a goal of winning 400 seats in the lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha. But as results began to trickle in Tuesday night, it quickly became clear his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party wouldn\u2019t even have enough to form a simple majority. Instead, for the first time since coming to power a decade ago, Modi will be reliant on longstanding local coalition partners to keep him in government. In what opposition parties have declared as a victory for pluralism, voters in the world\u2019s largest democracy partially rejected Modi\u2019s populist vision for a Hindu-first nation, reducing the BJP\u2019s share of the vote by 63 seats \u2013 bringing its total down to 240, far below the 272 required for a parliamentary majority. Opposition parties meanwhile won 235 seats, while BJP\u2019s coalition partners secured 52\u00a0seats. Tuesday\u2019s result is a humbling moment for a leader who declared he was sent by God and whose lead in the polls was lauded by supporters as unassailable. The BJP\u2019s inability to secure an outright majority \u201cpricks the bubble of Modi\u2019s authority,\u201d wrote political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta Tuesday night. Modi is \u201cnot the indomitable vehicle for History \u2026 Today, he is just another politician, cut to size by the people.\u201d \u2018He will have to tread carefully\u2019 Modi\u2019s victory Tuesday makes him the first leader since India\u2019s founding prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru to secure a third five-year term. Since assuming power in 2014,\u00a0Modi\u00a0has attained levels of popularity not seen in decades, owing to a raft of development and welfare programs, mixed with a strident brand of Hindu nationalism in a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith. Under Modi\u2019s leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power, making strides in technology and space.  Yet, despite these successes, poverty and youth unemployment persist \u2013 particularly in rural areas \u2013 and the wealth gap has widened. Modi has spoken of having a vision of India for the next 1,000 years and wants to turn it into a developed nation by 2047. He has made\u00a0clear\u00a0his ambitions of transforming the\u00a0constitutionally\u00a0secular country into a Hindu-first state, most recently inaugurating a grand temple on the site of a desecrated mosque. He now might have to \u201cgo a little slow on all his ambitious plans,\u201d\u00a0said New Delhi based political commentator Arathi Jerath. \u201cTo push India on a path towards becoming a Hindu country with a major voice on the world stage, he will have to tread carefully. He faces challenges at home.\u201d The BJP has long been accused of using state agencies to stifle opponents. Under Modi\u2019s rule, India\u2019s once boisterous media has been tamed and in the run up to the election, opposition leaders and parties faced a slew of legal and financial challenges. The arrest in March of the popular Aam Aadmi Party leader, chief minister of Delhi and staunch Modi critic Arvind Kejriwal sparked protests in the capital and prompted claims of a political \u201cconspiracy\u201d by his party \u2013 claims the BJP has denied. Kejriwal\u2019s release on interim bail last month galvanized the opposition to put up a tough fight against the BJP, uniting a group of political leaders who were once divided over ideological differences, in what they described as a do or die fight to save the country\u2019s constitution. \u2018Headed towards unchecked domination\u2019 Critics also say a decade of Modi\u2019s governance has led to growing religious polarization, with Islamophobia\u00a0marginalizing much of the country\u2019s\u00a0more than 200 million Muslims, and religious violence flaring up in a nation with a long history of communal tensions. While campaigning Modi was repeatedly accused of using Islamophobic messaging to fire up his base. \u00a0He\u00a0sparked a row\u00a0over hate-speech when he accused Muslims \u2013 who have been part of India for centuries \u2013 of being \u201cinfiltrators.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s results appear to show that large swathes of voters have rejected such brazen rhetoric. If opinion polls had been accurate, India would have been \u201cheaded towards unchecked domination by the BJP,\u201d Mehta, the political scientist, said. \u201cIt was a domination that threatened to end the possibility of all politics, swallowing up all opponents, and colonizing civil society,\u201d he added. \u201cIndia now has once again a deeply competitive political system.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s results, said Sanjay Singh of the opposition-allied Aam Aadmi Party, showed the people had voted against \u201chatred and dictatorship.\u201d The elections, he added, send a message from the public that \u201cthey are tired of the BJP\u2019s 10-year rule and want a change.\u201d As results of the BJP\u2019s shock losses became clear on Tuesday night, Modi took to the stage outside his party\u2019s headquarters. Showered with rose petals, adorned with a massive garland, and speaking over chants of \u201cModi! Modi! Modi!\u201d he made no admission of defeat. \u201cToday is a glorious day,\u201d he thundered. \u201cThe NDA is going to form the government for the third time,\u201d he said in reference to the right-wing BJP-led coalition the National Democratic Alliance. And while there is no doubt the NDA\u2019s grouping of smaller local parties will come together with the BJP to form a government, the election remains a reality check\u00a0for the popular leader. \u201cThis is in some sense a wakeup call\u00a0to a leader who is still very, very popular,\u201d said Neelanjan Sircar, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research. \u201cBut who many voters feel have crossed lines for what should otherwise be a very vibrant democracy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/india/india-general-election-result-modi-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

Five people were trapped in a Gaithersburg home after it collapsed in the storm and have since been rescued, Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Assistant Chief David Pazos told CNN. One of those residents is being taken to the hospital with traumatic injuries. A spokesperson for the county\u2019s fire and rescue service said earlier on X there were several reports of structure collapses with people trapped inside across Gaithersburg, a densely packed suburb with about 70,000 residents. Several people were removed from the damaged structures and transported to hospitals, emergency officials said. Baltimore, Dundalk and Essex, Maryland, are under a tornado warning until 9:30 p.m. ET, the DC-area National Weather Service office said. About 500,000 people are subject to the alert. The office also warned of high waves and winds for the Chesapeake Bay from Pooles Island to Sandy Point, including Baltimore Harbor, until 10:15 p.m. ET. The DC-area National Weather Service office said the tornado was spotted in Montgomery County just after 7:35 p.m. ET, urging residents around Gaithersburg, Olney and Brookeville to take cover immediately. Montgomery County emergency management officials said the tornado was over Gaithersburg, about 22 miles northwest of Washington, DC, shortly after 7:40 p.m. ET. Photos and video from social media showed a moderate to large funnel on the ground as the storm moved east through parts of Gaithersburg toward Olney. The storm crossed I-270 around 7:30 p.m. ET. Weak tornadoes are not uncommon in the DC region, but only a handful in recorded history have been EF3 or stronger. In 2002, an F4 tornado devastated parts of La Plata, Maryland, south of DC. That storm killed three people and caused more than $100 million in damage, according to data from the National Weather Service.

{"id": "2024_06_05_africa_jacob-zuma-comeback-south-africa-elections-intl", "text": "South Africa\u2019s African National Congress (ANC) party faces a mammoth challenge as it needs to form a government with its political rivals after suffering a seismic blow in last week\u2019s election. On Wednesday, the ANC\u2019s national spokesperson insisted that any coalition government would be in the interests of unity and stability and hinted at a government of national unity of some kind. \u201cThe ANC has taken the position that we must all act in the interest of our country and its people, and work on a national consensus on the form of government that is best suited to move South Africa forward at this moment in our history,\u201d Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri told a press briefing. Still, some of the same parties that sought the ANC\u2019s demise will now have to play a part in governing South Africa. For decades, the ANC could rule alone, but support for the the party plummeted to around 40% in last Wednesday\u2019s elections, down from 57% in 2019. Analysts and opinion polls had forecast losses for the ANC but a pivotal factor in the party\u2019s staggering decline was former President Jacob Zuma and his newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party, which capitalized on widespread discontent within the ANC\u2019s traditional voter base. Zuma\u2019s revenge Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of current ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to resign as president in 2018 and has been looking for political revenge ever since. His MK party, named after the ANC\u2019s former armed wing, appears to have achieved just that \u2013 formed just five months ago, it is now the third-largest party in South Africa, receiving almost 15% of the vote. Zuma positioned MK as \u201ca party that is meant to restore the ANC to its former glory,\u201d said political analyst Tessa Dooms, programmes director at the Rivonia Circle non-profit organization/political think tank in Johannesburg. She says many MK voters saw this ballot as a protest vote. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen with the MK party is the use of a vote to send a signal to the ANC of the level of unhappiness, not only of the country itself but within its ranks who\u2019ve supported it over the last 30 years,\u201d Dooms told CNN. Despite Zuma being barred from running for parliament by the Constitutional Court because of a previous contempt of court violation, the 82-year-old\u2019s\u00a0face remained on the ballot paper. Zuma is no stranger to controversy or the courtroom. He\u202fhas faced\u202fhundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u202fover the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \u201cTeflon President\u201d because few politicians could have survived the scandals he weathered. Ramaphosa replaced him as president when Zuma was finally forced to resign. Later revelations of \u201cstate capture\u201d \u2013 or rampant corruption riveted the nation in an anti-corruption commission. Much of the focus was on Zuma\u2019s relationship with the influential and wealthy Gupta brothers. With the ANC\u2019s popularity now at an all-time low and as Ramaphosa\u2019s political future hangs in the balance, Zuma could have the last laugh. But it is too early to tell. Due to the poor election showing, South Africa\u2019s political landscape has been fundamentally altered, leaving the ANC with the daunting task of forming a coalition government. In many countries, coalition talks can take months, but South Africa\u2019s constitution gives rival parties a short window to do something they have never really done before: come together. According to the constitution, rival parties have a mere 14 days to create a coalition after the final election results are announced. The outcome of these talks will likely\u00a0determine Ramaphosa\u2019s future as president. Ramaphosa\u2019s\u00a0allies\u00a0in the party are digging in. On Sunday, ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula warned potential coalition partners that the president\u2019s resignation is \u201cnot going to happen.\u201d \u201cI think the ANC has many factors to consider in terms of how it forms a government \u2013 both the stability of the country at large but also for the sake of having a government that still holds to the values of the ANC that it has long said that it serves,\u201d Dooms told CNN. The potential coalition partners present starkly different political ideologies and policy priorities. A marriage of convenience First, there is the official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), a broadly centrist and pro-business party that has heavily criticized the ANC for many years. Led by John Steenhuisen, it is seen by many\u00a0as a party for White South Africans, something the DA rejects. Steenhuisen has not ruled out going into a coalition with the ANC. A DA-ANC alliance, however it would form, would likely keep Ramaphosa in his job, say analysts. \u201cThe only way Ramaphosa stays is through a DA-ANC coalition.\u00a0Outside that,\u00a0the other parties, MK and EFF\u00a0(Economic Freedom Fighters), have made it clear the first point of negotiation is he must go,\u201d said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance. If the ANC were to pair with the DA, which\u202freceived 21.8% of the vote, their combined support would amount to more than 60%, an outright majority. However, this relationship would require both parties to make some major compromises. While in government, the ANC\u2019s flagship policy for driving economic inclusion and racial equality in post-apartheid South Africa has been its Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment policy, known as triple-BEE or simply BEE. The\u202fBEE policy has been criticized\u202fby some as neither broad-based, nor empowering. In contrast, the DA has\u202fsaid\u202fit would replace BEE with an \u201cEconomic Justice Policy\u201d that \u201ctargets the poor black majority for redress, rather than a small, connected elite.\u201d The DA is also against the ANC\u2019s flagship National Health Insurance Act (NIH) in its current form. The act, which was signed into law two weeks before the election, seeks to provide universal health care for all and gradually limit the role of private health insurers. However, both parties believe in the primacy of South Africa\u2019s constitution and both have promised to crack down on corruption. Awkwardly, the DA is currently\u202fpressing corruption charges\u202fagainst the ANC\u2019s deputy president,\u00a0Paul Mashatile. In a move to appease internal critics, the ANC-DA coalition could be expanded to include smaller parties, or the ANC could form a minority government with a \u201cconfidence-and-supply\u201d agreement with opposition partners like the DA and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), where they remain outside of government but support it on key votes in exchange for policy concessions. A bitter pill to swallow? If the ANC decides\u00a0to pursue coalition talks with MK, then Zuma will want Ramaphosa out, solidifying his revenge. However, if South Africa\u2019s president maintains his grip on the ANC, a coalition with MK is unlikely. The MK party\u2019s manifesto also\u00a0demands an overhaul of the country\u2019s constitution to restore more powers to traditional leaders. Zuma \u201cunapologetically focused his campaign around Zulu nationalism and that was a constituency that was easy for him to target,\u201d\u202fpolitical\u00a0analyst and former ANC\u00a0lawmaker\u00a0Melanie Verwoerd told CNN. By appealing to his Zulu base, Zuma\u2019s party has also stirred ethnic and tribal tensions, a strategy that, while electorally effective, risks deepening divisions in South Africa, Verwoerd added. The ANC\u2019s policies, grounded in the principles of non-racial and non-tribal governance, are at odds with this approach. It is also currently unclear how much MK actually wants to govern. Despite doing well at the polls, the party has demanded a re-run, threatened court action, and suggested boycotting the first sitting of Parliament. However,\u00a0it has provided no evidence of\u00a0voting\u00a0irregularities. The other option for a coalition is the EFF,\u00a0led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema, who was expelled from the party more than a decade ago. The breakaway party espouses land expropriation without compensation and sweeping state nationalism, including nationalizing the Reserve Bank. Malema has said\u202fhe would give the EFF vote to the ANC on the condition that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, becomes Minister of Finance in an effort to control fiscal policy. South Africa\u2019s business community and middle class are broadly nervous about an EFF\u2013ANC coalition and its effect on investor confidence. The DA calls it part of a\u00a0\u201cdoomsday\u201d option because of the potential impact on investment and trade. The EFF won just under 10% of the vote, so any coalition with the ANC would need to include at least another party in the mix to give it a healthy majority. The IFP, with almost 4% of the vote, could be such a kingmaker. Aside from a classic coalition deal or a \u201cconfidence and supply\u201d agreement, another hypothetical option on the table would be a \u201cgovernment of national unity\u201d (GNU), bringing in all the major parties. This scenario would hark back to the post-apartheid era when South Africa operated under a GNU to oversee the new constitution,\u00a0led by Mandela as president and FW de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki as deputy presidents,\u00a0between April 1994 and February 1997. With less than two weeks\u00a0to finalize coalition agreements, South Africa\u2019s political future remains uncertain; the ANC must navigate this complex landscape to form a stable government and address the challenges that have led to its diminished support, while Ramaphosa\u2019s leadership hangs in the balance amidst Zuma\u2019s dramatic comeback.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/africa/jacob-zuma-comeback-south-africa-elections-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 25-year-old\u2019s move to the Spanish capital was confirmed on Monday, ending one of the longest-running transfer sagas in soccer. Mbapp\u00e9 was speaking at a media conference on Tuesday ahead of France\u2019s friendly against Luxembourg and stressed that his long-expected move to Madrid was a \u201crelief,\u201d while also adding that his final season in Paris was filled with mixed emotions. While saying in general that he was happy in his final season, he went to detail one aspect that did make him unhappy. \u201cSo I tried to be as positive as possible. And as I said, the coach, the players, all the employees, everyone at the club helped me a lot,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cBut there were things and [some] people that made me unhappy, of course.\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 did not name or say who and what made him unhappy during his final year at the club. Mbapp\u00e9 had long been connected with a move to Los Blancos, even before he signed a two-year contract extension \u2013 with a player option for a third year \u2013 with PSG in 2022. He played more than 300 games for the French club, scoring his 250th goal in March and winning the Ligue 1 title a month later. But his final season in Paris was overshadowed by speculation around his future. And Mbapp\u00e9 admitted on Tuesday that he had been told by some at the club that he wasn\u2019t going to play at all last season. \u201cIt was told to me, it was made clear to me, it was conveyed through the media, it was said to my face. It was very clear; I was spoken to harshly. So, for me, I was convinced that I wasn\u2019t going to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who saved me were [manager] Luis Enrique and Lu\u00eds Campos, the sporting director. They are the ones who saved me. Without them, I would never have set foot on the field again.\u201d CNN has reached out to PSG for comment on Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s press conference. Last week, before Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s\u00a0move to Madrid was confirmed, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi paid tribute to the French international in an interview with CNN. \u201cI wish him all the best,\u201d told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies at the Globe Soccer Awards Forum in Sardinia, Italy. \u201cHe\u2019s done amazing for us for seven years. He was vice captain, he came to us at 18 years old or less, and now he is a big man, best player in the world. \u201cI am proud of what he has done for the club and I wish him all the best. You never know maybe one day he comes back to France, that\u2019s football. \u201cHe only deserves good things and I wish him all the best,\u201d Al-Khelaifi added. Mbapp\u00e9 on Tuesday described himself as being \u201cvery happy\u201d for finally signing for Real \u2013 saying that \u201ca happy man has more chances of playing better than a sad man\u201d \u2013 although he emphasized that was no excuse for his performances this year and that his immediate focus is on helping Les Bleus win this summer\u2019s European Championship in Germany. \u201cI think that it is the things that you can easily see on the face, as I said it is something I have always wanted, so I am very happy. After the last season, of course, I played much less \u2013 everyone knows why I have played less. But it is like this, you have to adapt,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are difficulties to overcome when you are a high-level athlete and this will absolutely not be an excuse for my competition. At the moment, we are working hard on physicality with the coach, so I know to return with the best form possible. \u201cAnd my objective is to help the French team to go as far as possible and of course to try and bring the cup home.\u201d France\u2019s Euros campaign begins on June 17 against Austria.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/sport/kylian-mbappe-psg-real-madrid-move-comments-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_americas_mexico-election-result-first-female-president-intl-hnk", "text": "Mexico has elected its first female president,\u00a0with preliminary results showing Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and Mexico City\u2019s former mayor, is on track to win the country\u2019s largest election in history. Sheinbaum has won between\u00a058.3% and 60.7% of the vote,\u00a0according to what is known as Quick Count, an exercise that the National Electoral Institute (INE) carries out based on a statistical sample of ballots from polling stations. The 61-year-old rode the wave of popularity of her\u00a0longtime political ally, the outgoing leftist Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and their Morena party. Sheinbaum is not only set to be Mexico\u2019s first female president, but also the country\u2019s first Jewish leader, although she rarely speaks publicly about her personal background and has governed as a secular leftist. Sheinbaum said her administration would govern all Mexicans \u201cwithout distinction.\u201d \u201cEven though many Mexicans do not fully agree with our project, we will have to walk in peace and harmony to continue building a fair and more prosperous Mexico,\u201d she told crowds of supporters that filled the main square in Mexico City, the Z\u00f3calo, in the early hours of Monday. She spoke about the historical significance of becoming the first female president of the country. \u201cI am also grateful because, for the first time in 200 years of the republic, I will become the first woman president of Mexico,\u201d she said. Trailing Sheinbaum is opposition candidate X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, backed by a coalition of the National Action (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary (PRI) and Democratic Revolution (PRD) parties,\u00a0with between 26.6% and 28.6% of the votes. In third place is the Citizens\u2019 Movement candidate, Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez, with\u00a0between 9.9% and 10.8% of the votes. According to the quick count results, participation in the presidential election\u00a0was\u00a0between 58.9% and 61.7% of the electorate of nearly 100 million people. Obrador, the outgoing president and Sheinbaum\u2019s political mentor, congratulated Sheinbaum on her win. \u201cWith all my affection and respect I congratulate Claudia Sheinbaum who came out victorious with an ample margin. She will be the first (female) President of Mexico\u2026 but also the President, possibly, with most votes obtained in all of the history of our country,\u201d he said in a\u00a0video\u00a0posted on X. Sheinbaum\u2019s projected win is a remarkable moment for a country that is a world leader when it comes to gender equality in elected office, a position it cemented in 2019 with constitutional reform. It\u00a0outflanks\u00a0several countries in\u00a0terms of women\u2019s\u00a0parliamentary representation. Yet Mexico remains a dangerous place to be a woman: it has\u00a0sky-high femicide\u00a0rates with around 10 women\u00a0murdered in Mexico every day. Sheinbaum ran Mexico\u2019s most important city for\u00a0five years until her resignation last June to run for the presidency. She is also the co-author of a Nobel-winning\u00a0Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report\u00a0and is married to Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Tarriba Unger. She is seen as a continuation of the status quo left by L\u00f3pez Obrador, whose\u00a0social welfare programs boosted the Morena party\u2019s\u00a0popularity and had a positive impact on the lives of poorer Mexicans. Under the Mexican constitution, presidents can only be elected to one term and cannot run again. Sheinbaum has pledged to continue her predecessor\u2019s policies, including a pension for all senior citizens, scholarships for more than 12 million students and free fertilizers for small farm owners, but has rejected criticism of her close political alignment with\u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador. She is set to be replaced as the mayor of Mexico City by another women, Clara Marina Brugada Molina from Scheinbaum\u2019s Morena party. She secured between 49% and 52.8% of the votes, according to the Quick Count, while the opposition Santiago Taboada got 37.2% to 40.5% of the votes. Largest election Sunday\u2019s poll was the largest election in the country\u2019s history. More than 98 million voters were registered to cast a ballot, and 1.4 million Mexicans were eligible to vote abroad. In addition to the presidency, more than 20,000 positions\u00a0were being contested by an estimated 70,000 candidates vying to become senators, mayors and governors. But the elections were plagued by immense violence. There have been more than 20 political killings since September, according to the Mexican government. By some estimates though, that number is even higher. According to Mexican consultancy firm Integralia, at least 34 candidates were murdered in the run-up to the vote. Voting was suspended for several hours on Sunday in the southeastern Mexican town of Coyomeapan due to violence at the polling centers, according to state electoral authorities. And while\u00a0the murder rate fell\u00a0in Mexico\u00a0between 2019 and 2022, in absolute numbers the country is still reeling from historically high levels of around 30,000 homicides\u00a0each year. The true number is likely higher, experts say. The violence appeared to have been a top concern for voters as cartels extend their grip through Mexico. Sheinbaum has been coy about her security proposals but has pointed to her record as Mexico City mayor, when, according to her team, she improved the police force\u2019s working conditions and intelligence-gathering abilities. One big challenge for her will be\u00a0convincing voters that she can end the culture of impunity in Mexico, where around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved in\u00a02022, according to think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua. After the final results come in, the Electoral Tribunal of the Judicial Branch of the Federation (TEPJF) must receive and analyze any possible challenges to the process, as well as qualify the presidential election no later than September 6. If the court validates the election, Sheinbaum will take office on October 1. Her term will last six years, from 2024 to 2030.

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_tech_fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close", "text": "The Affordable Connectivity Program, which helped low-income Americans get online, is no more. On Friday, the US government announced the final closure of the broadly popular federal program, which has helped tens of millions of households afford internet service, after Republicans in Congress ignored calls by consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers to approve more funding this spring. The program\u2019s lapse threatens to throw nearly 60 million Americans into financial distress,\u00a0CNN has reported. The program officially ends on June 1, said the Federal Communications Commission, which administered the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) to approximately 1 in 5 households\u00a0across the country and\u00a0on tribal reservations. The 2.5-year-old ACP provided eligible low-income Americans with a monthly credit off their internet bills, worth up to $30 per month and as much as $75 per month for households on tribal lands. The pandemic-era program was a hit with members of both political parties and served tens of millions of seniors, veterans and rural and urban Americans alike. Program participants received\u00a0only partial benefits\u00a0in May ahead of the ACP\u2019s expected collapse. \u201cThe Affordable Connectivity Program filled an important gap that provider low-income programs, state and local affordability programs, and the Lifeline program cannot fully address,\u201d said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement, referring to the name of another, similar FCC program that subsidizes wireless and home internet service. \u201cThe Commission is available to provide any assistance Congress may need to support funding the ACP in the future and stands ready to resume the program if additional funding is provided.\u201d Some US lawmakers proposed bipartisan legislation to extend the ACP in the months leading up to the deadline. But the bills languished in the face of inaction by Republican leaders who showed little interest in engaging with the issue. President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers have\u00a0publicly blamed\u00a0GOP leadership for allowing the ACP to end. A spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. On Friday, Biden reiterated his calls for Congress to pass legislation extending the ACP. He also announced a series of voluntary commitments by a handful of internet providers to offer \u2014 or continue offering \u2014 their own proprietary low-income internet plans.The list includes AT&T, Comcast, Cox, Charter\u2019s Spectrum and Verizon, among others. Those providers will continue to offer qualifying ACP households a broadband plan for $30 or less, the White House said, and together the companies are expected to cover roughly 10 million of the 23 million households relying on the ACP. The ACP was initially funded by Congress with a one-time budget of $14 billion. Biden has asked for $6 billion to continue the program and one bipartisan bill proposed renewing the ACP with $7 billion in additional funding. Kathryn de Wit, director of the Pew Charitable Trust\u2019s broadband access initiative, said reaching the deadline without a solution from Congress was a \u201cdisheartening\u201d outcome. \u201cWithout intervention, households participating in the program will immediately see their internet bills go up,\u201d de Wit said. \u201cWe know cost is a key barrier to connecting low-income families to the internet, so without ACP we can expect most participating households to either downgrade or drop their plans altogether.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/tech/fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

And on Sunday, she became the first woman, and the first Jewish person, to be elected president of Mexico. Sheinbaum won around 60% of the vote in the largest election in Mexico\u2019s history, marking a historic achievement in a mostly Catholic country known for its deeply patriarchal culture. The 61-year-old is set to replace the outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, her longtime ally whose social welfare programs lifted many Mexicans out of poverty, making their leftist Morena party favorite in the polls. \u201cOur duty is and will always be to look after every single Mexican without distinction,\u201d Sheinbaum said in a speech early Monday morning. \u201cEven though many Mexicans do not fully agree with our project, we will have to walk in peace and harmony to continue building a fair and more prosperous Mexico.\u201d After her maternal grandparents emigrated from Europe to escape the Holocaust, Sheinbaum was born in Mexico City in 1962 \u2013 a city she would go on to serve in various roles across decades. While studying for her undergraduate degree at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), she became immersed in student politics, protesting against the privatization of public education. After graduating, she studied energy engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, where she became fluent in English and earned a Master\u2019s degree, before returning to UNAM for doctoral studies. Sheinbaum entered politics in 2000, when she was appointed environment secretary of Mexico City by Obrador, then the head of the city\u2019s government. After leaving the role in 2006, Sheinbaum committed herself to the study of energy, joining the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and becoming part of the team that received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. In 2015, she became the first woman elected head of the Tlalpan district of Mexico City, serving until 2017. The next year, she was elected head of the government of the whole city \u2013 again, the first woman to do so \u2013 only stepping down in June 2023 to embark on her run for president. Sheinbaum has two children and one grandchild. Her partner, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Tarriba, whom she met at university while both were studying physics, is a financial risk specialist at the Bank of Mexico. What challenges lie ahead? Had the constitution allowed it, Mexico would likely have re-elected Obrador, one of those rare politicians who \u2013 like FDR and JFK \u2013 is known simply by his initials, AMLO. After riding the wave of AMLO\u2019s popularity, some have questioned whether Sheinbaum will be able to distance herself sufficiently from her longtime ally. One of Sheinbaum\u2019s biographers, journalist Jorge Zepeda, has argued that, once in office, Sheinbaum will likely unfurl her own platform gradually: she will first act as \u201cthe faithful disciple of the leader,\u201d before offering \u201cglimpses\u201d of her own program, taking care not to stoke instability in the movement\u2019s base. But Zepeda has also noted clear differences between the two leaders. In an article for the Spanish daily El Pais, Zepeda recalled asking Sheinbaum what sets her apart from other politicians. \u201cI\u2019m someone who makes decisions based on the data,\u201d she told him. By contrast, Zepeda claimed Obrador could sacrifice data for party loyalty. \u201cIf (a piece of) data gets in the way, another piece is chosen,\u201d he said, whereas Sheinbaum allows herself to be guided by the science. Obrador will leave office with broad support and an impressive record of alleviating poverty, but his premiership was marred by his \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d policy of not confronting cartels, allowing violence to spiral. Violence has loomed large in this election, the bloodiest in Mexico\u2019s history. Dozens of political candidates and applicants have been killed by criminal organizations\u00a0trying to influence\u00a0those coming into power. Mexico\u2019s\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is among the highest in the world, and\u00a0more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country. It also remains a dangerous place to be a woman, with\u00a0sky-high femicide\u00a0rates for\u00a0the region \u2013 with figures showing around 10 women\u00a0are murdered every day. Sheinbaum will have to act quickly on Mexico\u2019s organized crime and security issues, said Will Freeman, a fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning that the governing party could win re-election by a landslide as it seems\u2026 given the sweeping violence, the thing is the opposition didn\u2019t seem to put\u00a0together a much more credible\u00a0set of proposals about what\u00a0they would do,\u201d Freeman said. Sheinbaum comes with a team from her time as Mexico City mayor that has a proven record on improving security but it remains to be seen if she can replicate that on a national scale, Freeman said. US-Mexico relations Both Mexico and the US are holding elections in 2024, something that happens only once every 12 years \u2013 and comes at a time of transition in the relationship between the two countries. Sheinbaum will assume office just a month before Americans head to the polls in November, where immigration is a top issue on the ballot for Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Mexico is a key US ally on a range of issues, from trade to cracking down on drug trafficking to managing migration. Current and former US officials have frequently described the relationship between President Joe Biden and Mexico\u2019s President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador as friendly and professional \u2014 and anticipate a productive relationship with Mexico\u2019s next president. But Mexico\u2019s election also comes at a critical time for the Biden administration. In recent months, the US has relied heavily on Mexico to step up immigration enforcement and help stem the flow of migration to the US southern border. The election in Mexico has raised uncertainty in the minds of some Biden officials about what, if anything, will change with a key partner when it comes to border cooperation. One of the considerations in rolling out a new border executive action was doing so after Mexico\u2019s election. The administration will likely need buy-in and assistance from Mexico to execute the order. Officials expect that a new administration in Mexico would likely continue cooperating with the US on migration given years of partnership, but it\u2019s unclear how migrants \u2014 and especially, smugglers \u2014 might plot their next moves in a moment of government transition.

{"id": "2024_06_05_middleeast_turkey-israel-hamas-war-politics-mime-intl", "text": "Since the war in Gaza began, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been one of Israel\u2019s harshest and most vocal critics \u2013 routinely branding it a terror state, comparing its prime minister to Hitler and heaping praise on Hamas. The Palestinian militant group is considered a terror group by most members of NATO, but not Turkey. Some Western critics might accuse Erdogan of going too far in supporting Hamas, but recent events suggest he has not yet appeased his domestic political base. After Erdogan\u2019s ruling party was handed a humbling defeat in local elections in March, he promised to think hard about what went wrong. Beyond the sputtering Turkish economy \u2013 many pundits blamed the electoral setback on his stance on Israel and its war in Gaza. Political challengers, like the smaller, ultra-conservative New Welfare party, managed to siphon off votes from the president\u2019s ruling AK Party by taking a tougher stance against Israel and demanding concrete actions beyond the fiery rhetoric Erdogan is known for. \u201cWe do not see (the government) doing anything other than speaking and condemning. There are no sanctions, no concrete steps taken, trade with Israel still continues,\u201d said New Welfare\u2019s leader Fatih Erbakan in March. The president may have believed that strong rhetoric against Israel was enough, Seda Demiralp, a political scientist at Isik University, told CNN after the election. \u201cErdogan really underestimated New Welfare and how much New Welfare could mobilize conservative voters.\u201d Correcting course After the election, Erdogan wasted little time correcting course, swiftly moving to match words with actions. In a matter of days, some trade with Israel was cut off. Three weeks later, all trade was cut off. Some $7 billion worth of annual trade \u2013 mostly Turkish exports \u2013 is now on pause until the war is over. That wasn\u2019t all. Last month, Turkey announced its intention to join the genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. Already warm ties with Hamas were made even warmer when Erdogan hosted the group\u2019s political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Istanbul on April 20, and posed with him for pictures. Erdogan has compared Hamas to the \u201cKuvayi Milliye,\u201d the nationalist militias that fought against foreign occupation during the Turkish War of Independence after World War I. \u201cBelieve me, if it were 100 years ago, they would also call Kuvayi Milliye a terrorist organization, a rebel, a joke, a traitor,\u201d Erdogan said in a speech to party lawmakers in May, according to state broadcaster TRT. \u201cThis nation has always stood by the oppressed.\u201d The gap between how Turkey and its NATO allies view Hamas was on full, awkward display when Erdogan hosted Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis last month in Ankara. \u201cI don\u2019t see Hamas as a terrorist organization,\u201d Erdogan declared. \u201cOn the contrary, Hamas is an organization of resistance, whose territories have been occupied since 1947 and which has been defending its territories after the occupation\u2026 If you call them a \u2018terrorist organization,\u2019 it will upset us.\u201d \u201cWe can agree to disagree on this topic,\u201d Mitsotakis replied. Erdogan went on to claim that \u201cover 1,000 Hamas members are now under treatment in our hospitals in Turkey.\u201d A Turkish official with knowledge of the situation has since told CNN the president misspoke.\u00a0\u201cHe meant 1,000 Gazans are under treatment, who aren\u2019t Hamas members,\u201d the official said. Since the war began, the Turkish Ministry of Health has made several medical airlifts of injured Gazans and their family members to hospitals in Turkey. For Erdogan, \u2018Hamas is Palestine\u2019 Experts say the comment made by Erdogan in the presence of the Greek leader may have in fact been intended for an audience closer to home. \u201cWestern leaders right now are very aware that Erdogan is basically talking for his domestic audience and for the Muslim neighborhood,\u201d said Evren Balta, an international relations professor at Ozyegin University in Istanbul. Domestically, she said, the president has managed to link Hamas and the Palestinians to the point that \u201cwhen you are criticizing Hamas publicly, it is as if you\u2019re criticizing the Palestinian cause.\u201d That, coupled with the strong affinity the Turkish public has with Palestinians, has led politicians of all stripes to tread carefully on the issue, particularly some secular and nationalist opposition parties. \u201cFor Erdogan, Hamas is Palestine. For the opposition, Hamas is not Palestine, but they are having difficulties framing the political discourse,\u201d Balta said. At a political rally ahead of the March local elections, Ozgur Ozel, leader of the secular CHP party established by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, highlighted his party\u2019s longstanding support for the Palestinian cause and sought to counter claims that he regards Hamas as a terrorist organization. \u201cI have not called Hamas a terrorist organization, but I have condemned its terrorist attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cI also condemned Israel\u2019s state terrorism.\u201d He then went on to taunt the president. \u201cNow come on, Erdogan. If you are on Palestine\u2019s side, stop the trade that your relatives, children, supporters and friends do with Israel every day.\u201d After the elections, Istanbul\u2019s CHP mayor Ekrem Imamoglu \u2013 widely touted as a future presidential contender \u2013 took fierce criticism from political rivals and in the Turkish press for branding Hamas as a terrorist organization in an interview with CNN in April. This was despite his harsh condemnation of Israel and its \u201cbrutal oppression\u201d of Palestinians. \u2018No influence\u2019 on NATO Turkey\u2019s NATO allies in the West have been quick to condemn Hamas, but they\u2019ve been largely silent on Ankara\u2019s cozy relations with the group. \u201cI think there is a degree of discomfort,\u201d about the relationship, said Fabrice Pothier, a former NATO policy chief, who now leads the Rasmussen Global political consultancy. \u201cIt is not benign, that there is one major ally that is far away from the others, but I think NATO manages \u2013 up to a point \u2013 to compartmentalize between the bilateral positions or issues of allies, and the NATO collective positions and issues.\u201d A case in point, in October, NATO leader Jens Stoltenberg told the German Press Agency that Turkey-Hamas relations are not a problem because \u201cin some ways it has no influence on what we do or don\u2019t do because we don\u2019t play a role in this particular conflict.\u201d Hamas members can freely come and go from Turkey and have a regular presence in the country. In fact, in December, Erdogan\u2019s chief foreign policy and security adviser, Akif Cagatay Kilic told CNN that Hamas\u2019 political leader Haniyeh \u201cmight have been\u201d in Turkey on October 7, the day the militant group led an attack on Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages. But he claimed that historically, Turkey\u2019s relationship with Hamas hasn\u2019t merely been tolerated by Israel, but has even been encouraged. He said former Turkish leaders \u201chave been asked \u2013 even by (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu \u2013 to engage with Hamas.\u201d Turkey\u2019s aim is to bring peace to the region, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing whatever it takes to achieve that.\u201d \u2018Inflation of mediators\u2019 Although it isn\u2019t officially a mediator in the Gaza conflict, there are indications that Ankara is involved on some level. In April, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Hamas was willing to dissolve its military wing if a Palestinian state was created within the 1967 borders. This was later confirmed by an Istanbul-based Hamas member, marking the first time the group has offered to lay down its arms. Fidan also helped relay messages between Washington and Tehran ahead of Iran\u2019s barrage of missiles fired at Israel in April, and there is some indication that Ankara may be playing a similar conduit role between Washington and Hamas. \u201cWe have been in touch with both the US and Hamas. We have been advising and encouraging both sides for an immediate and permanent ceasefire,\u201d a Turkish official told CNN \u2013 pointing to calls that Fidan held with both Haniyeh and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the same day in mid-May. With Qatar mulling a possible exit from its mediation role, Balta says Turkey could potentially help fill the gap, despite its Hamas ties increasing distrust with Israel and the West. But, she says, the West would much prefer to deal with Turkey than with, say, Iran, which could become a future refuge for Hamas leaders if the group is forced to leave Qatar, where its political office is based. \u201cWestern governments know how to deal with Turkey\u2026 so when it comes to Middle Eastern conflicts, who else is going to be a reliable partner? Really, there are not many other reliable partners,\u201d she said. For now, Turkey isn\u2019t interested in playing a formal role in trying to bring an end to the war in Gaza. \u201cWe do not want to create an inflation of mediators,\u201d a Turkish Foreign Ministry source told CNN in April. Despite some discomfort with Turkey\u2019s close ties to Hamas, Western states, Pothier believes, figure it\u2019s better just to tolerate it. \u201cI think the West is finding it useful to have countries who can be between us and Hamas,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/middleeast/turkey-israel-hamas-war-politics-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_style_julie-satow-department-stores-fifth-avenue-women", "text": "Before the nationwide influx of suburban malls and the convenience of online shopping, there was a golden age of American department stores. More than merely local shopping hubs, these ostentatious emporiums offered tea rooms, child care, beauty services and exotic animals for sale, if you could afford a pet monkey or a baby puma. Though the buildings belonged to billionaire men, it was women who strategized and oversaw the commercial and cultural success of some of the biggest and best department stores in America: Hortense Odlum at Bonwit Teller, Dorothy Shaver at Lord & Taylor and Geraldine Stutz at Henri Bendel among them. This trio are among the subjects of Julie Satow\u2019s new book, \u201cWhen Women Ran Fifth Avenue: Glamour and Power at the Dawn of American Fashion.\u201d As Satow illustrates, department stores were places where women gathered, gossiped and dreamed of more luxurious lives.\u00a0In Europe, there was Harrods (or Liberty) in London and Le Bon Marche Rive Gauche in Paris \u2014 stores that had established the culture of shopping as an event, buzzing with a life of their own. And from the Depression era through to the swinging Sixties in New York, Odlum, Shaver and Stutz built their domains into similar fashion and cultural destinations. Satow knits their stories together to explore how the evolution of department stores reflected the changing values of women as business leaders, how closely our identities are tied to where we shop (and what we buy) and how the role of humans is integral to the experience of shopping \u2014 or, perhaps, any service industry threatened by automatization. \u201cWhen department stores originally opened, (they represented) one of the rare opportunities for women to congregate together in public,\u201d\u00a0Satow told CNN. \u201cIt was almost a fantasy world, and a place for women to come together for advice and a sense of community. Shopping was a sentient, sensual experience.\u201d Even for those on the other side of the counter, it was momentous: Employment gave many women their first taste of independence, and aspirations to careers in retail, fashion and hospitality. And the stores also offered something much greater to the women Satow profiles. In a period in which it was nearly impossible for women to pursue business leadership, independently or at all, Odlum, Shaver and Stutz were largely unsung pioneers. \u201cNone of these women have biographies,\u201d Satow noted. \u201cDorothy Shaver paved the way for many other women who rose through the ranks in the retail industry. She broke so many ceilings in terms of women at work\u2026 In 1947, she was named \u2018the No. 1 career woman\u2019 in TIME magazine, which was a rarity.\u201d That year, Shaver was overseeing a $40 million business, and by the time she died in 1959 \u2014 still president of Lord & Taylor to the end \u2014 annual sales had reached $100 million. Shaver was also a founding member of the organization of women within the American fashion\u00a0industry, Fashion Group (now known as the Fashion Group International) alongside\u00a0Elizabeth Arden\u00a0and\u00a0Helena Rubinstein in 1930, and the architect of the \u201cAmerican Look,\u201d which in the 1940s transformed the national fashion industry and instilled a sense of pride in less restrictive, affordable American clothing, the forerunner of modern sportswear. Until that point, American women had become accustomed to buying European fashion or cheaper, locally produced copies of what appeared on Parisian runways. \u201cWomen running department stores (had) an innate understanding that men lacked,\u201d Satow explained. \u201cHortense Odlum was very much trying to make the department store a welcoming place\u2026 She saw herself as a hostess, in a way.\u201d (Odlum\u2019s perspective was, in large part, driven by her own experiences; until her husband\u2019s law career flourished with the couple\u2019s move to New York, she had been all-too-budgeted in her fashion choices and all-too-conscious of clothes as a status symbol. Her motivation was to make department stores enticing \u2014 and accessible \u2014 for women of all means.) And Geraldine Stutz, who transitioned into the retail business after roles in fashion media, implemented concepts still relevant to the industry today. Henri Bendel recruited her in 1964 as a last ditch attempt to save their store from bankruptcy \u2014 there, \u201cshe originated the boutique experience that we still see today, including the divisions of brands within a store,\u201d Satow said. Within three years, Stutz had doubled sales; she was elected to the Fashion Industry Hall of Fame in 1985. \u201cAll three women created a special atmosphere and ambiance within their stores. Today, shopping is not nearly as immersive and experiential as it was,\u201d Satow explained. \u201cI think there is a nostalgia for the golden era of the department store, and it is always bittersweet when an era like that ends,\u201d she continued. \u201cNow, with everything from Etsy to TikTok, nearly anyone with (the) will and a small budget can start their own brand. The opportunities department stores afforded women are less critical than they once were.\u201d Add to queue: Shop it like it\u2019s hot Read: \u201cThe Women In Black\u201d by Madeleine St. John (1993) This novel is set within the fictional F.G. Goode department store in 1950s Sydney, Australia. The titular women in black are the saleswomen, whose personal and professional dramas intersect as they weather the politics of the womenswear department. Considered an Australian classic, the book has been translated onto the big screen and stage. Watch: \u201cMannequin\u201d (1987) In this quintessentially \u201880s cult classic, Kim Cattrall plays, wait for it, a mannequin seemingly dreamed into life by jack-of-all-trades Jonathan Switcher (Andrew McCarthy). The pair build a partnership, both professionally \u2014 staging attention-grabbing window displays at a failing department store \u2014 and romantically. The catch to this love story: Emmy only comes to life for Jonathan. Is it ridiculous and campy? Of course, but Hollywood Montrose would have it no other way. Read: \u201cThe Dallergut Dream Department Store\u201d (2024) A bestseller in Korea, the debut novel (and first of a two-book series) from author Miye Lee weaves a fantastical narrative around, as its title suggests, a department store selling consumers\u2019 perfect dreams. In lieu of traditional store floors and sections like womenswear or home furnishings, shoppers can browse well-curated dream worlds \u2014 nostalgia, travel, fantasy and even nightmare \u2014 to find the perfect fit for their slumber; promoting the value of bedtime like any good sleep salesman would, the book also highlights the importance of quality shut-eye on the subconscious. Watch: \u201cThe Devil and Miss Jones\u201d (1941) It was common practice in department stores of the 1930s and 40s to employ undercover shoppers and in-store detectives to keep an eye on both customers and employees, identifying union organizers in particular \u2014 as American workers today are increasingly looking to unions to combat stagnant wages and layoffs, the 1941 film \u201cThe Devil and Miss Jones\u201d feels remarkably prescient. Its plot sees John P. Merrick (Charles Coburn) as the New York retail tycoon who pretends to be a shoe clerk at one of his stores where he suspects his workers are attempting to form a union, opposite Mary Jones (Jean Arthur) as the captivating salesgirl who somehow wins her boss over to sympathizing with their cause.

His ribs and collarbones are sticking out, his belly is sunken, his shoulder and hip joints clearly visible under his pale skin. Gorilyk\u2019s extreme emaciation appears to be the result of the two years he spent in Russian captivity. The former checkpoint guard at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in northern Ukraine was detained by Russian troops in March 2022, shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He was finally released on Friday, one of 75 Ukrainians exchanged for 75 Russian prisoners of war. The Ukrainian authorities released several photographs of Gorilyk, 40, on Wednesday to show the toll they say Russian captivity has taken on him. \u201cThe condition of Roman and other Ukrainian prisoners of war evokes horror and associations with the darkest pages of human history \u2013 Nazi concentration death camps,\u201d the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, a Ukrainian government body, said in a statement posted on Telegram alongside the photos. The National Guard of Ukraine told CNN that almost all of the released prisoners have suffered weight loss, sores and lesions and chronic conditions stemming from untreated injuries. Ukrainian presidential adviser\u00a0Mykhailo Podolyak said the prisoners returned to Ukraine in a \u201chorrifying\u201d state. \u201cThe torture by starvation is monstrous, the beatings and violence are sophisticated,\u201d he said in a statement posted on X, accusing Russia of ignoring international human rights agreements. \u201cThere are no Geneva Conventions anymore\u2026 Russia again thinks it can avoid being held accountable for massive war crimes,\u201d he said. CNN has asked the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment. Under the Geneva Conventions, the set of international laws that regulate armed conflict, prisoners of war must be treated humanely and with dignity, and must be provided with basic daily food rations that are \u201csufficient in quantity, quality and variety to keep prisoners of war in good health and to prevent loss of weight or the development of nutritional deficiencies.\u201d The Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said Gorilyk was among 169 guards who were taken by the invading Russian forces and transported to Russia via Belarus. It said that 89 of these people are still being held captive, and that Moscow is using them in exchange for Russian servicemen captured in battle.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/europe/emaciated-ukrainian-pow-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2021_10_10_travel_bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness", "text": "You\u2019re out for a hike, reveling in glorious nature. Suddenly, you spot a bear. And the bear has spotted you, too. Would you know what to do next? Beth Pratt sure would. She was once on the Old Gardiner Road Trail in Yellowstone National Park, enjoying her run in wild nature. Her reverie came to an end when she came upon a grizzly bear eating flowers.  \u201cI stopped. It stood on its hind legs and looked at me. I knew that wasn\u2019t a threatening gesture,\u201d she told CNN Travel. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding, it waved its paw at me as if to say, \u2018just go on your way,\u2019 and went back to eating.\u201d \u201cAnd I walked slowly away and put some distance between us, and the encounter ended fine.\u201d When it comes to dealing with bears, Pratt does have a thing or two on almost all the rest of us, though. She is the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation, a job she\u2019s had for more than 10 years. She worked in Yellowstone for several years \u2013 and once saw nine grizzlies in one day there.    Finally, she lives on the border of Yosemite National Park, and bears will pass through her yard, including this one seen in the footage above in late September 2021. You can hear the enthusiasm in Pratt\u2019s voice as she shares her bear bona fides and advice to make sure bear/human encounters are delightful, not dangerous. \u201cA wild bear is a beautiful sight to see. It\u2019s incredible to see them in the wild. I never had a bad experience with bears. What I try to get people to feel is respect, not fear, for bears. The animal usually wants to avoid the encounters.\u201d  Bears in the news   Bear attacks are rare, Pratt and US National Park Service websites point out, but they do happen:  \u2022 A disable veteran survived an attack from a mother grizzly at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in May 2024. \u201cIt was the most violent thing I have ever experienced.\u201d \u2022 A hunter suffered serious injuries in a grizzly bear attack in British Columbia in May 2024. \u2022 Bear attacks are on the increase in Japan. \u2022 A man lost part of his jaw in a grizzly bear attack in Montana in September 2023. \u2022 Two people died in a suspected grizzly bear attack in Canada\u2019s Banff National Park in late September 2023. \u2022 Two collegiate wrestlers were mauled by a grizzly bear near Cody, Wyoming, in October 2022; they had serious injuries but survived. They illustrate the point that rare doesn\u2019t equal never. Feasts for beasts  While it pays to be diligent at any time, autumn is a particularly good season to bone up on bear facts and safety when many bears are in a phase known as hyperphagia, Pratt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a period in the fall where bears are eating anything and everything to fatten up for hibernation.\u201d  She noted mountain lions are comparatively picky eaters. Not bears.   \u201cThey eat everything: Ants. Roadkill. Flowers. Nuts. And unfortunately, human food that\u2019s not secured. Our food is very attractive to them; it\u2019s easy calories.\u201d   Combine that with the fact that some national and state parks have become very popular and crowded, and you have a recipe for potential trouble. \u201cIf more people are using public lands and more people are in the mix, there\u2019s more potential for encounters and conflict. It does concern me a little bit,\u201d Pratt said. The key is being prepared \u2013 and that\u2019s where Pratt and others in the know come in. First rule of \u2018bear fight club\u2019: Don\u2019t fight The best strategy is to never get in harm\u2019s way by enticing or provoking a wild bear. Trying to give a bear food or approaching cute cubs are particularly terrible ways to start an encounter. That\u2019s just looking for trouble. The US National Park Service site points out each bear and each encounter is different, but there are general guidelines useful in most situations. First of all, keep your distance if you happen upon a bear. Don\u2019t approach it, and give it plenty of room to walk away from you. Yellowstone tells you to stay at least 100 yards (300 feet or 91 meters) away; Shenandoah National Park in Virginia suggests 200 feet (61 meters) for its black bears. You can run afoul of the law as well as the bears if you get too close and end up paying a fine.   Other tips: \u2022 Talk calmly to yourself in low tones to identify yourself as human. \u2022 Walk with a group (we\u2019re smellier and noisier in packs) and stay on designated trails. \u2022 If you have a small child or dog, pick it up. \u2022 Don\u2019t put yourself between cubs and their mother. \u2022  Avoid direct eye contact and move away slowly, sideways if possible. Pratt said don\u2019t be alarmed if a bear stands on its hind legs; it\u2019s not considered an aggressive move. Almost all encounters are peaceful, Pratt said. Many times, people never knew they were even close to a bear, as in this YouTube video that shows two people emerging from a basement oblivious to a nearby bear.  What if a bear starts coming at you anyway?  If a bear starts making assertive moves in your direction, you have important decisions to make \u2013 and fast. First thing is: Stand your ground with bears. With either grizzlies (a subspecies of brown bears) or black bears, \u201cplease don\u2019t run. Bears can outrun anybody,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cDon\u2019t climb a tree either. They can also climb trees better than you.\u201d  New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife (where the black bear population is growing) also has some tips: \u2022 Make loud noises by yelling, banging pots and pans or using an airhorn to scare bears away. \u2022 Make yourself look as large as possible by waving your arms.  \u2022 If you\u2019re with other people, stay together. Pratt said you can usually intimidate or bluff your way out of sticky bear situations, depending on the bear species and the situation.  But what if a bear is about to attack? You\u2019re now in the rarest of situations \u2013 you\u2019ve attracted a bear\u2019s attention. It didn\u2019t move off. It\u2019s started coming at you aggressively and fast. You think you\u2019re about to be attacked. What\u2019s next? One very crucial thing is to make a quick ID of the kind of bear, because your strategy is going to be different depending on the type of bear.  If it\u2019s a black bear, the NPS and Pratt have a clear message: Do not run. Do not play dead. \u201cYou want to stand your ground with black bears. Look as intimidating as possible,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cThrow things not at it but near it. Make that black bear intimidated by you. Let it know you are a big person. Pick something up; yell at it. If it attacks, fight back \u2013 aim for the face.\u201d It\u2019s a different situation with grizzlies If you\u2019re dealing with a grizzly that won\u2019t back off and an attack is imminent, you\u2019re advised to do the opposite. You should play dead. \u201cAct as unthreatening as possible with a grizzly. Play dead with a grizzly if it starts to attack,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cTuck and cover. Get into a fetal position. Wrap your hands around your neck. Lay on your stomach. Once you do that, 99 percent of the time the grizzly will move on.\u201d  NPS elaborates: \u201cRemain still until the bear leaves the area. Fighting back usually increases the intensity of such attacks. However, if the attack persists, fight back vigorously.\u201d   Fighting back a grizzly bear is the last resort \u2013 \u201cyour Hail Mary pass\u201d as Pratt called it \u2013 when all other options are out. An exception to this rule: If you\u2019re camping in a tent and are attacked, that bear likely sees you as food. NPS and Pratt say this is a time to fight. How do you tell a black bear from a grizzly? First off, know your area and read up on the bears there. In North America, grizzlies have a much more limited range than black bears do. In the Lower 48, they are in Washington, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. And then in Alaska, too. They also cover large parts of western Canada. Black bears have more territory. They can be found in as many as 40 US states, much of Canada and even parts of northern Mexico, the National Wildlife Federation says. So say you\u2019re in Quebec, the Appalachians, the Ozarks, California or even parts of Florida, that\u2019s going to be a black bear. But if you\u2019re in Yellowstone or Glacier National Park, for instance, that could be a black bear or a grizzly. That\u2019s when it\u2019s crucial to know how to make a quick visual ID. You can\u2019t go by the color of the fur. Black bears can be black, brown, cinnamon, blond, blue-gray or white, according to Bear.org.  One of the best ways to tell the difference, Pratt said, is to look for a hump at the shoulders. Grizzlies have them. Black bears don\u2019t. She also said the face shapes are different. \u201cBlack bear faces look a little more cuddly to me, a little rounder, with a straight nose. A grizzly bear face looks more like a wild predator and has a dished shape.\u201d This NPS webpage has more helpful ways to tell the differences. Fun facts: Eight bear species can be found all over the world \u2013 from tropical Sri Lanka to the frigid reaches of Russia, Norway and Canada. And European websites such as Bear Watching Slovenia give many of the same safety tips as North Americans get. Bear spray and weapons Some people like to carry bear spray and/or a weapon with them when venturing into bear country.  Pratt is an advocate of the former and says be sure to practice using it first before going into the wild. NPS has helpful tips on using spray to ward off bears. She\u2019s more cautious about bringing firearms with you, especially if you\u2019re inexperienced. \u201cTaking a grizzly out with one shot would be tough. You need to be very experienced with a gun to increase your chance of safety.\u201d A Brigham Young University study in 2008 found spray more effective than a firearm. And spray doesn\u2019t permanently harm a bear. Some people like to carry bear bells on their hikes, hoping the noise will ward off the animals. But the park service says that \u201cYelling, clapping and talking are more effective ways of alerting a bear to your presence.\u201d What campers need to know If you\u2019re out camping overnight, you have extra considerations to take. Kyle Patterson, management specialist and public affairs officer at Rocky Mountain National Park, emailed CNN Travel some ways to keep hungry bears away. Patterson advised using a food storage locker if provided in campgrounds and picnic areas. Also, \u201cavoid storing food and coolers in your vehicle. If you must, store food in airtight containers in the trunk or out of sight. Close vehicle windows completely.\u201d Other tips and cautions: \u2022 Don\u2019t store food in tents or pop-up campers in campgrounds or in vehicles at trailheads. \u2022 Don\u2019t leave food, coolers and dirty cookware unattended. Park rangers may confiscate them and cite you. \u2022 Get rid of garbage in bear-resistant dumpsters and trash cans. Human-fed bears usually end up as chronic problems and need to be removed, Patterson said. \u201cA fed bear is a dead bear.\u201d The ball is in our court Pratt emphasized it\u2019s up to humans to be responsible to these creatures. \u201cThe bears are just being bears. We are way more of a threat to them. Bear attacks are so rare. And fatalities are even rarer,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bears\u2019 lives are more at threat than ours in encounters. I want people to have magical, wonderful experiences in the wild. I want people to feel OK about having these encounters.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2021/10/10/travel/bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_style_taiwan-celebrities-political-pressure-china-intl-hnk", "text": "As Taiwan\u2019s biggest rock band took to the stage in Beijing late last month, their home island was reckoning with the latest act of Chinese aggression. For two days, the self-governing democracy was encircled by Chinese warships and fighter jets in the largest military exercises in over a year. Addressing the tens of thousands of fans at the sold-out Bird\u2019s Nest stadium, Mayday\u2019s lead singer Ashin did not mention the aggression. But what he did say has since caused no less friction. \u201cWe Chinese people must eat roast duck when we come to Beijing!\u201d he said. It may sound like an innocuous travel tip, but his choice of words was freighted with political meaning. Ashin \u2013 one of Taiwan\u2019s biggest music stars \u2013 had referred to himself as Chinese, instead of Taiwanese. The choice of words delighted the crowd, but sparked immediate anger back home \u2013 reflecting the precarious position of Taiwanese stars with mainland appeal. Growing numbers of people in Taiwan \u2013 especially the younger generation \u2013 view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese. Many have no desire to be part of China, whose authoritarian ruling Communist Party views the self-ruled island as its territory, despite having never controlled it. Beijing has long sought to bolster its claims by emphasizing the cultural and historical ties between the two sides, but polls show only\u00a03% of Taiwan\u2019s population identify primarily as Chinese\u00a0\u2013 while 67% see themselves as primarily Taiwanese, and less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification with China. Under the leadership of Xi Jinping,\u00a0Beijing has become more aggressive toward Taiwan, and has abandoned official ties since the island\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive Party came to power in 2016. But there is still considerable cultural overlap. Both sides speak Mandarin, meaning musicians from Taiwan \u2013 population 23 million \u2013 often seek to enter the lucrative market of 1.4 billion across the strait. As Beijing and Taipei have drifted further apart politically, these artists have come under increasing pressure to toe Beijing\u2019s political line. The same evening that Mayday was playing in Beijing,\u00a0Taiwanese pop queen Jolin Tsai proclaimed on stage that fans in \u201cour Chinese city of Nanchang\u201d were the most passionate, as she performed in the southern city. The phrase was taken by some Chinese fans as implying she and her audience were compatriots. Meanwhile on Weibo, China\u2019s X-like platform, dozens of Taiwanese actors, musicians, and celebrities reposted a state media post championing Beijing\u2019s claims of sovereignty over the island. \u201c\u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 is a dead end, and the reunification of the motherland is unstoppable!\u201d broadcaster CCTV said in the post, which has been retweeted nearly\u00a018 million times since it was published last Wednesday. On Douban, a popular site for reviewing movies, books and music, users compiled a list of nearly 100 Taiwanese celebrities, detailing whether each of them had shared the post. Despite her on-stage expression of kinship, some lashed out at Tsai for not reposting it. A comment with 14,000 upvotes called for authorities to suspend her concerts in China, because she \u201chad never spoken out directly.\u201d CNN has reached out to Tsai for comment. On Saturday, CCTV publicly endorsed Taiwanese celebrities who shared its post, sharing the screenshots of 36 such reposts \u2013 fueling a further backlash against those who hadn\u2019t. \u201cThose who didn\u2019t endorse and take a stand, can you not come to the mainland to make money?\u201d said a top comment with 55,000 upvotes. Lin Chen-yu, a lecturer at Cardiff University who specializes in China\u2019s censorship of Taiwanese music, said acts such as Tsai and Mayday were facing problems because \u201cboth the government and private sectors are increasingly reacting to and engaging with digital nationalism.\u201d And the marketing apparatus that can launch mainland careers is equally set up to avoid upsetting Beijing authorities. \u201cFor instance, management or touring contracts for activities in China increasingly include clauses that ban celebrities from making statements against the ideologies of the Chinese state,\u201d she said. \u201cThis, of course, includes any pro-Taiwan statements.\u201d Celebrities deemed as crossing Beijing\u2019s political red lines are often blocked from the Chinese market, with their names and works erased from television and online platforms. \u201cFor example, musicians\u2019 work can be easily removed from streaming platforms (in China), often automatically, if their names become keywords for censors on these platforms and media,\u201d Lin said. Backlash at home Mayday appear to have avoided upsetting officials in China during their Beijing show, but many Taiwanese fans say they are deeply disappointed. A whole generation of Taiwanese people grew up listening to the band\u2019s happy-go-lucky, pop-infused rock songs about the hope and heartbreak of youth, so much so that the 25-year-old band is sometimes dubbed the \u201cAsian Beatles.\u201d \u201cAs much as I used to like you, now I\u2019m just as disappointed,\u201d said a comment on Mayday\u2019s Facebook page, after the Beijing concert. \u201cI\u2019m Taiwanese. Goodbye.\u201d a fan said on Ashin\u2019s Facebook page. CNN has reached out to Mayday\u2019s record company B\u2019in Music for comment. On Monday, Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council weighed in, accusing the Chinese Communist Party of requiring Taiwanese artists to express a political stance. \u201cSuch political maneuvers will not win over the hearts and minds of Taiwanese people, and will only deepen Taiwanese society\u2019s resentment towards the Chinese Communist regime,\u201d the council said in a statement. The remarks and retweets by Taiwanese artists of the CCTV unification post came against the backdrop of China\u2019s largest show of force around the island in more than a year. The Chinese military called the drills a \u201cstrong punishment\u201d for Taiwan\u2019s so-called \u201cseparatist acts\u201d and said they were designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power.\u201d That military muscle-flex was sparked by the inauguration of Taiwan\u2019s new President Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. As the backlash mounted in Taiwan against the musicians, Lai struck a conciliatory tone. \u201cThis is not the first time, and probably not the last, that Taiwanese artists are forced to make a political stand in China,\u201d said the leader. \u201cUnder the roof of others, it\u2019s one thing what our artists say, but what\u2019s more important is what they truly feel in their hearts. We should offer them understanding and empathy.\u201d Beijing officials said the Taipei administration was wrong to say artists were being coerced. Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said Taiwanese celebrities who reposted the Weibo \u201creunification\u201d message wanted \u201cto express that both sides of the Taiwan Strait are both Chinese.\u201d \u201cThese are natural expressions of true feelings,\u201d Zhu said. Taiwanese acts in the Chinese market will continue to endure an invidious position, said Lin, of Cardiff University. \u201cHowever, it is time for the industries in Taiwan to re-evaluate what this means for our society,\u201d she said. \u201cThe circulation of these works comes with a price \u2013 a significant loss of freedom and autonomy.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/style/taiwan-celebrities-political-pressure-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_europe_slovenia-recognizes-palestinian-state-intl-latam", "text": "Slovenia has become the latest European country to formally recognize Palestinian statehood, after the country\u2019s parliament approved the move with a majority vote on Tuesday. The decision follows those of Spain, Ireland and Norway, who formally recognized Palestinian statehood in late May. The growing momentum in Europe is likely to bolster the global Palestinian cause, but could further strain relations with Israel. Most of the world already recognizes Palestinian statehood. More than 140 out of 193 member states of the United Nations have made their recognition official. But only some nations in the 27-member European Union are among them. The vote passed with 52 votes in favor and zero against, Slovenia\u2019s national broadcaster RTV Slovenija reported. The vote passed during an extraordinary parliament session after numerous procedural hurdles, according to the outlet. \u201cToday is a historic day! The National Assembly of Slovenia has officially recognized Palestine, making Slovenia the 147th country to do so,\u201d Slovenia\u2019s Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said in a series of posts on social media. \u201cThis recognition is an expression of our commitment to peace and justice. Slovenia is on the right side of history, contributing to the two-state solution for lasting peace,\u201d Fajon said. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed at least\u00a036,550\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a082,959\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures. Amid the rising toll, Israel has come under increasingly fierce criticism. Earlier this month, a panel of independent UN experts\u00a0condemned\u00a0\u201cthe continued and systematic onslaught of violence committed against Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d The agency has repeatedly called for a ceasefire\u00a0in Gaza\u00a0and the release of hostages taken\u00a0by Hamas. Slovenia\u2019s foreign minister said the country believes only a two-state solution can lead to a lasting peace in the Middle East and that her country \u201cwill tirelessly continue to work on the security of both nations, Palestinians and Israelis.\u201d The two-state solution has been the goal of the international community for decades, with many nations believing it is the only way out of the long-running conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsed the idea of two states in 2009 under pressure from the Obama administration, but more recently has said that recognizing a Palestinian state post-October 7 would be a \u201creward for terror.\u201d Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of Israel\u2019s ambassadors to Spain, Norway and Ireland after the countries\u2019 decision last month. The vast majority of the population in Gaza are descendants of 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were\u00a0forcibly expelled\u00a0from their homes during what Palestinians call\u00a0al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d of the 1948-49 war, in what is now Israel.

The flames consumed some 4,000 dunams (1,000 acres or 400 hectares) of the northern region, chief of the Tiberias fire station Boris Eisenberg said. Israel Fire and Rescue Services said multiple firefighting teams, including an air firefighting squadron, had been deployed, working through the night. On Tuesday, Israel Fire and Rescue Services in the north of the country dealt with two blazes. Twelve teams were deployed to Keren Naftali, where a fire had spread in several directions, while 10 teams had been deployed to the Biria Forest in the Upper Galilee area, where a falling Israeli interceptor missile caused a second blaze.  \u201cWe saw the interception and responded with increased forces and high intensity, we are operating on the spot and trying to contain the fire,\u201d spokesperson Uri Cohen told CNN. \u201cWe are dealing with extreme weather conditions, changing winds, high dryness with low humidity, high temperature. All these conditions together accelerate the development of the fire,\u201d Cohen said. By late Tuesday, all major fires in the north had been brought under control, according to the rescue authority. Authorities had begun evacuating residents as fires broke out at noon local time on Monday in the mountainous Galilee region, Israeli police said. Israeli police said they helped to evacuate homes in Kiryat Shmona, a northern city near the Lebanese border. The blazes came after authorities warned the public Monday that a heatwave was expected and cautioned against lighting fires in forests. Lebanon-based Islamist group Hezbollah said Monday that it launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at an Israeli military command center in the Galilee, causing fires in the building. The group said they were a response to Israeli strikes on Hezbollah forces as well as homes in southern Lebanon, adding that three Hezbollah fighters were killed on Monday. Thousands of Israeli residents have been displaced after cross-border hostilities began between Hezbollah and the Israeli military in October. The Lebanese group said its attacks on northern Israel were in response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.

The official start of summer is just a few weeks away, but it will feel like July in much of the West as temperatures climb 20 degrees or more above average, the highest temperatures of the year so far for many locations. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for more than 17 million people in California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona this week. The warnings are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service and are used when widespread, dangerous heat is expected. The soaring temperatures are being caused by a heat dome, a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks. The resulting heat becomes more intense the longer a heat dome lasts. TELL US: Worried about affording air conditioning this summer? Share your story Dangerous heat will get underway Tuesday afternoon in parts of California and expand its reach into more of the Southwest by Wednesday and as a heat dome parks over the West. It will then reach the Pacific Northwest by late-week. The most extreme heat will avoid major population centers along the coast, but Los Angeles will still be 5 to 10 degrees warmer than normal this week. Temperatures will soar into the upper 90s and low 100s Tuesday in California\u2019s Central Valley \u2013 including where the Corral Fire is burning near Tracy.

California\u2019s capital typically hits this threshold in early June, but last year it didn\u2019t happen until the end of the month. Triple-digit temperatures will become widespread in the Central Valley Wednesday and stick around into the weekend. Conditions will also sizzle in Southern California\u2019s desert regions. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, is likely to reach a high temperature of at least 120 degrees by Thursday. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn\u2019t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. The Southwest will start to bake by Wednesday as temperatures in parts of southern Arizona and far southern Nevada approach 110 degrees. Phoenix will likely have hit 110 degrees for the first time this year by Thursday even though the city doesn\u2019t typically encounter these temperatures until mid-June. High temperatures are forecast to climb into the low 110s in Las Vegas, more than three weeks earlier than the city typically exceeds this threshold. The early summerlike heat will threaten daily high temperature records across a significant portion of the West this week. Phoenix; Las Vegas; Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day\u2019s high temperature record could fall. By Friday, records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Colorado as heat expands north and east. Fire danger will also rise while the heat is at its peak. Sizzling temperatures and low levels of humidity will dry out short-fuse fuels such as grasses and brush, making them more prone to burn. Breezy winds will develop at times, especially in California into midweek. The combination of these factors will make it easier for fires to ignite and spread. Corral Fire blazing in California\u2019s Central Valley The Corral Fire has consumed more than 14,000 acres of land in California\u2019s San Joaquin county since it ignited south of Tracy Saturday afternoon. Residents were ordered to evacuate over the weekend as the fire \u2013 initially fueled by gusty winds and dry, hot conditions \u2013 threatened communities. Firefighters gained an upper hand as winds eased Sunday and Monday and the blaze was\u00a090% contained by Tuesday morning, according to CAL Fire. Evacuation warnings were lifted Monday evening as containment increased, according to CAL Fire. Officials urged residents to remain vigilant and be ready for potential changes to the fire risk level. Two Alameda County firefighters were injured while responding to the\u00a0fire,\u00a0Cal Fire Battalion Chief Josh Silveira told CNN early Sunday morning. They had minor to moderate injuries and were transported to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment, Silveira said. A section of I-580 was closed in both directions over the weekend as the fire\u2019s thick smoke enveloped the roadway. All lanes were reopened Sunday night, according to the California Department of Transportation. The cause of the fire is under investigation, according to CAL Fire. Gusty winds up to 30 mph are possible Tuesday, which could complicate ongoing containment efforts. Temperatures will also surge well into the 90s from Tuesday through the weekend. An excessive heat warning is in effect for the region from Tuesday through Thursday.

{"id": "travel_airline-passenger-tracks-missing-bag-felony-theft", "text": "A Florida man is facing a felony grand theft charge in Broward County after a plucky airline passenger scheduled to fly out of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in March tracked her stolen luggage to the man\u2019s home, according to the probable cause affidavit in the case. Junior Geneus Bazile, 29, of Fort Lauderdale has been charged with grand theft in the third degree. The victim was slated to leave the airport on a Spirit Airlines flight the evening of March 3, but the airline canceled the flight and told all passengers they could retrieve their checked luggage on the baggage belt at Terminal 4, the affidavit said. Paola Garcia told CNN affiliate WPLG in Miami that she usually takes her suitcase onboard, but this time, she was told she had to check it. Garcia said waited at least two hours for her pink roller bag, which contained an Apple MacBook, Apple iPad, Apple Watch, jewelry, high-end woman\u2019s clothing and toiletries. It never came out on the luggage belt. In her WPLG interview, Garcia said that Spirit Airlines told her that her luggage had been sent to her house. The luggage never came. But Garcia explored another avenue with her own electronic tracker. Garcia, not named in the affidavit, later pinged the electronic items inside the bag to try and locate them, and the ping showed them at an address in Fort Lauderdale, the affidavit said. Tracking down her luggage She then went to retrieve her things from the address, but she couldn\u2019t contact anyone inside the home, the affidavit said. While at the house, she took video and still pictures, where she saw \u201cseveral pieces of luggage in the front of the home,\u201d none of which were her own, the affidavit said. Garcia told WPLG that she dialed 911. \u201cThe first thing I remember the police told me is: \u2018What are you doing here? This is so dangerous for you to be here.\u2019 \u201c When a detective with the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office searched the address within the airport\u2019s employee databases, he found that Bazile reportedly lived at the address. Bazile was listed as working at a Paradies Lagard\u00e8re Travel Retail store at the airport and was working on the day of the theft, according to the affidavit. The store\u2019s loss prevention manager was contacted, and he provided the detective with internal CCTV footage from the day of the incident, which allegedly showed Bazile entering the store\u2019s storage room with a pink shell roller bag, matching the description of the stolen bag, and rummaging through the luggage, the affidavit said. \u00a0He then appeared to take the MacBook and other smaller items out of the luggage and put\u00a0them in other bags. A WPLG video shows pictures of a man holding a plastic bag containing a pink suitcase and holding a laptop. \u201cParadies Lagard\u00e8re takes this matter very seriously. Immediately upon learning of the incident, this employee was terminated. As this is an ongoing police matter, we have cooperated with the investigation and recommend reaching out to the Fort Lauderdale Police Department for more information,\u201d the company told CNN on Wednesday afternoon. After being charged with grand theft in the third degree, Belize pleaded not guilty and posted $30,000 bond. His next court date is scheduled for August 23, court records show. CNN has reached out to Bazile and his public defender for comment. In a statement, Spirit Airlines told CNN that even though they are \u201cnot aware of any evidence that any Spirit employee was involved,\u201d the airline issued a reimbursement check to the woman whose luggage was stolen, \u201cas a courtesy.\u201d CNN\u2019s Melissa Alonso contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/airline-passenger-tracks-missing-bag-felony-theft/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_20_style_park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli", "text": "Everyone knows the familiar shapes that make up New York\u2019s skyline. There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_asia_japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk", "text": "Wearing a toy whale hat, whale tie and a whale motif shirt, Hideki Tokoro spends much of his days thinking about the world\u2019s largest mammals. But he doesn\u2019t want to protect them. He wants to hunt them. To do that his company Kyodo Senpaku has built and launched a brand-new whaling $48 million \u201cmothership\u201d \u2013 the Kangei Maru. \u201cWe are proud of catching whales and are very proud of this ship which will allow us to begin offshore mothership-style whaling this year,\u201d Tokoro told reporters as he escorted them around the 370-foot, 9,300-ton vessel that set sail last Saturday for an eight-month tour of the country\u2019s northern waters. The new ship replaces the Nisshin Maru, the infamous whaling factory vessel dubbed by activists as a \u201cfloating slaughterhouse\u201d that was decommissioned in 2020 after more than 30 years of service, during which it frequently clashed with anti-whaling activists. The Kangei Maru is bigger and faster than its predecessor, the company says, and is equipped with state-of-the-art drones able to travel a reported 100 kilometers (62 miles) to allow crews of smaller boats to quickly locate and kill whales. But some activists say the ship\u2019s high-powered features, including a cruising range of 13,000 kilometers (more than 8,000 miles) and its ability to sail for up to 60 days, suggests that Japan could set its sights on whales far beyond its northern waters. \u201cJapan has never given up on its whaling ambitions,\u201d veteran anti-whaling activist Paul Watson told CNN. \u201cThe only purpose of a vessel like that is so it can travel long distances to the Southern Ocean to hunt whales, (and) what the whalers are doing right now is really just a test run. They are testing out the new ship in their waters.\u201d \u2018We need to cull whales\u2019 The Kangei Maru boasts a slipway large enough to haul 85-foot whales from the sea that leads to an indoor flensing deck the size\u00a0of two basketball courts. There, workers will strip away the blubber before cutting up the whale flesh on enormous cutting boards, before vacuum-packing and storing the meat in 40 industrial freezers, ready for sale. \u201cWhales are at the top of the food chain. They compete with humans by eating marine creatures that should be feeding other fish,\u201d Tokoro said on the tour. \u201cWe need to cull whales to keep the balance of the ecosystem \u2013 it\u2019s our job and mission to protect oceans for the future.\u201d He also told CNN that most of the ship\u2019s catch would be killed \u201calmost instantly\u201d by cannons at sea. \u201cWe aim for perfection, but some of them may suffer. In such cases, we will use a rifle to finish the job.\u201d Besides objecting to the slaughter one of the ocean\u2019s most majestic creatures, marine conservation groups and scientists have highlighted the important role which whales play in helping to tackle the climate crisis through sequestering and storing planet-heating carbon emissions. \u201cWhales are not just consumers in ocean eco-systems \u2013 they recycle a ton of nutrients into the environment which helps stimulate plant-life growth,\u201d\u00a0said marine ecologist Ari Friedlaender, also rejecting pro-whaling arguments that commercial hunts could be \u201csustainable.\u201d \u201cHumans have a very long history of killing whales and have not done a good job of being able to sustainably harvest animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to sustainably harvest a wild animal like that.\u201d Why is Japan so determined to keep whaling? Commercial whaling was banned in 1986 under a moratorium by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) after whale populations were almost driven to extinction by humans. Japan is one of three countries \u2013 along with Norway and Iceland \u2013 that continues to hunt whales, and officials argue that the industry is an important part of its culture and history \u2013 and also provides food security. Iceland, which has fiercely defended commercial whaling, said it would end whaling in 2024, citing falling demand for whale meat as well as \u201chigh operation costs and little proof of any economic advantage.\u201d Commercial whaling continues in Norway, which experts say has quietly become the world\u2019s leading whaling nation \u2013 killing more whales than Japan and Iceland combined. For decades, Japan has justified whaling under the guise of \u201cscientific research.\u201d In 2018, it tried one last time to persuade the IWC to allow it to resume commercial whaling \u2013 and failed. So, it withdrew from the body and resumed commercial whaling months later, in defiance of international criticism. \u201cJapan is no longer party to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and can argue that it is no longer bound by provisions and constraints,\u201d Donald Rothwell, an international law professor at the Australian National University (ANU), told CNN. \u201cWithin its waters, it\u00a0has the absolute authority to control the management of living resources \u2013 and that includes whales.\u201d Under Japanese law, three species of whale are permitted to be hunted in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones \u2013 endangered sei whales and threatened minke whales and Bryde\u2019s whales, with endangered fin whales set to be added to kill lists. \u201cWhales are important food resources and should be sustainably utilized based on scientific evidence,\u201d said government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi this month, as he announced a proposal to hunt fin whales, the second-largest species of whales after blue whales. The World Cetacean Alliance (WCA) marine conservation group said that whale watching in Japan was \u201ca far more successful industry\u201d than harvesting whale meat. \u201cCommercial whaling in the 21st century is unjustifiable,\u201d it said. \u00a0\u201cThe whaling industry in Japan recognizes that it is a challenge to increase whale meat consumption and there is currently no market,\u201d WCA said. \u201cSo why keep slaughtering these wonderful and intelligent animals?\u201d Tokoro ruled out whale watching. \u201cWe will not switch to whale watching but eating whale meat while watching whales might be quite a nice touch,\u201d he told CNN. Demand for whale meat in Japan Over the years, Kyodo Senpaku has launched aggressive public relation campaigns to promote whale meat and win over new generations of young diners. Tokoro says he eats whale meat every day. \u201cWhale meat is not only delicious, it\u2019s good for you,\u201d Tokoro told reporters during the tour of his ship, as he talked\u00a0up the purported \u201chealth benefits\u201d of eating whale, claiming that the meat could cure hair loss and cancer. \u201cI can definitely say whale meat and rice is a really good (combination) for Japanese people. There is no doubt about that, much better than beef and bun.\u201d Last year Tokoro, again wearing his whale hat, launched controversial whale meat vending machines, offering whale sashimi, whale steak and whale bacon. The company has also sponsored influencers from countries such as Russia, Thailand and South Korea \u2013 hosting them at a local izakaya in Osaka, where they sampled dishes like whale sashimi and skewers and encouraging them to take the message back to their followers that whale meat was delicious and acceptable. Japan may have a long and storied history of whaling dating back to the Edo period in the 1600s, but experts say whale meat consumption only really peaked after World War II \u2013 when food sources, especially protein, were scarce. Today, whale meat is now\u00a0considered more of a \u201cluxury\u201d dish, said Nobuhiro Kishigami, a professor at the National Museum of Ethnology, one of the country\u2019s largest research institutes. \u201cThe fact is that there is little interest in whaling and whale meat among Japanese people as a whole,\u201d Kishigami told CNN. \u201cMost young people, especially the majority that live in cities, do not know or care much about whaling and its history and remain indifferent.\u201d The same goes for dolphin meat, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just a sign of the times. But if we were asked to stop eating blue fin tuna, there would be a huge uproar. We would react very badly to that.\u201d Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry estimates that between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of whale meat are consumed annually in the country, compared to average annual totals of more than 230,000 tons during the 1960s. \u201cThere is still certainly a market (for whale meat in Japan) but market size and production volume have shrunk dramatically,\u201d economics professor Mitsuhiro Kishimoto from the Shimonoseki City University told CNN, noting that several major whaling companies had since withdrawn from the trade. \u201cThe demand for whale blubber disappeared after the discovery of oil and petroleum products, so many countries stopped whaling and with international regulations, the number of caught whales decreased and as a result, whale meat production decreased while beef, pork and chicken became more popular,\u201d he said. Scientists have also expressed\u00a0concern about the risks of consuming whale meat, with studies pointing to high levels of mercury found in whale and dolphin meat, which could prove dangerous to consumers \u2013 especially pregnant women and young children. Could Japanese whalers return to the Southern Ocean? Located in deep waters surrounding the entire continent of Antarctica, the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary hosts dozens of whale species including humpbacks, blue whales and fin whales. It was established by the IWC in 1994 to protect whale species after centuries of hunting, but until 2019 Japan took regular trips to the region to hunt for self-stated \u201cscientific research\u201d purposes. Japanese whalers killed 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean in 2018/2019, according to the IWC, before abandoning the region after it left the international body. Takaaki Sakamoto, director of the Whaling Affairs Office in Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency, told CNN that Japan sent ships to the Antarctic last year to collect numbers and skin surface samples, but those expeditions did not involve killing whales. He said they planned to return this year to do the same. Tokoro told CNN that the Kangei Maru is not planning on killing whales beyond Japanese waters because it doesn\u2019t make economic sense. \u201cCommercial whaling is not profitable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take 50 days to get to the Antarctic and back and we are not confident we can make a profit by paying the wages of employees and fuel for 50 days. However, I will go only when the government orders me to go \u2026 Until then, I will not go commercial whaling at all.\u201d Sea Shepherd, an international marine conservation activist group which spent years confronting Japanese whaling ships in the past, told CNN that it believes Japan is unlikely to return to the Southern Ocean because that would require it to rejoin the IWC \u2014 whose members are fiercely opposed to commercial whaling. But\u00a0other activists aren\u2019t so confident. \u201cGiven the ship\u2019s long-range capabilities and drones, and recent announcements from Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry that it is keen to start hunting fin whales, we believe there is a high likelihood that Japanese whalers will return to the Southern Ocean,\u201d said James Anderson, activist and founder of the Whale Defense Agency (WDA). \u201cThe Southern Ocean is a critical habitat for many whale species that provides a safe haven for breeding and feeding \u2026 protecting it is more important than ever due to the increasing threats posed by climate change and illegal whaling.\u201d Rothwell, from ANU, said that if Japan looks to kill whales beyond its territorial waters, it can expect an international response. \u201cIt would immediately trigger global interest and action about the conservation and protection of whales, especially in waters sanctioned by the IWC as a whale sanctuary,\u201d Rothwell said. Watson, the veteran anti-whaling activist who founded Sea Shepherd but has since left, told CNN he\u2019s prepared to mount a physical response \u2013 with a former Japanese fisheries patrol vessel he\u2019s acquired in anticipation of Japanese whalers returning to the Antarctic by the end of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary for a reason \u2013 you don\u2019t kill whales there,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe want to be able to track them down and intercept them like we\u2019ve done before \u2013 and we are more than prepared to do it again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/asia/japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_middleeast_israel-top-court-sde-teiman-hearing-intl", "text": "Israel has transferred hundreds of Palestinian detainees out of the shadowy detention facility of Sde Teiman in Israel\u2019s Negev desert, a state attorney told Israel\u2019s Supreme Court on Wednesday during a first-ever hearing about the facility where prisoners from Gaza have allegedly been held under conditions of extreme abuse. State attorney Aner Helman told the court that 700 inmates had been moved to Ofer military facility in the occupied West Bank, with another 500 set to be transferred in the weeks to come. Around 200 detainees will remain in Sde Teiman, said Helman, who added that the state would provide an update on their status within three days. The hearing comes in response to a petition by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) and other human rights groups, which drew heavily on CNN reporting about the makeshift prison to make a case for it to be shut down. During a tense exchange, one of the Supreme Court justices, Judge Barak Erez, pressed the state\u2019s legal team on the legality of the way the facility was being run. \u201cThe question is whether or not the Israeli law for the imprisonment of unlawful combatants applies or not. That you did not answer,\u201d said Erez. Avi Segal, an attorney representing the right-wing, Israeli legal organization Shurat HaDin which had asked to join the procedure, said the hearing was based on \u201cnewspaper rumors.\u201d \u201cThe court should be worried about setting up a hearing, and even asking for a response to petitions based on newspaper rumors,\u201d said Segal. CNN\u2019s investigation, in which Israeli whistleblowers as well as Palestinian former detainees and eyewitnesses described horrific conditions at the facility, including continuous blindfolding and handcuffing, sparked an international outcry. The White House called the allegations detailed in CNN\u2019s report \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and said it was reaching out to Israeli officials for answers. Germany\u2019s Foreign Office condemned the reported practices and said it was campaigning for the International Committee of the Red Cross to access the camp and other prisons. In the wake of CNN\u2019s investigation, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Unlawful Combatants, Alice Jill Edwards, called for Israel to investigate allegations of\u00a0torture and\u00a0mistreatment of detained Palestinians. Last week, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said the military launched a probe into the allegations of mistreatment at Sde Teiman, as well as at Anatot and Ofer, two other military detention camps for Palestinians from Gaza. The committee tasked with examining the conditions of Palestinian detainees from Gaza is set to submit its recommendations to Halevi this month. \u201cThey cannot keep holding people there, not even for a short while, not even only 200, and not even one week,\u201d ACRI\u2019s attorney Roni Pelli told CNN after the hearing. Since the start of the war on October 7, 36 prisoners held at military detention camps have died, according to the IDF spokesperson\u2019s office. The dead included prisoners \u201cwith previous illnesses or injuries caused to them as a result of the ongoing hostilities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn accordance with the law and IDF directives, in each case of death of a detainee in an IDF detention facility, a criminal investigation is opened by the Military Police,\u201d the statement added. On May 10, CNN released an investigation into Sde Teiman, a military base in the Negev desert which has doubled as a detention center for Palestinians detained over the course of Israel\u2019s\u00a0war in\u00a0Gaza which was launched after the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Three Israeli whistleblowers told CNN that Palestinian detainees at the facility were constantly blindfolded and held under extreme physical restraint. Doctors sometimes amputated prisoners\u2019 limbs due to injuries sustained from continuous handcuffing, one whistleblower said.\u00a0The account tallied with details of\u00a0a letter authored by a doctor\u00a0working at\u00a0Sde Teiman published by Ha\u2019aretz\u00a0in April. According to the accounts, the camp some 18 miles from the Gaza frontier is split into two parts: enclosures holding scores of detainees from Gaza, and a field hospital where wounded detainees are blindfolded, strapped to their beds, wearing diapers and fed through straws. In a May 20 response to a petition led by the rights group Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI), the Israeli government said it is set to \u201creduce the number of inmates held in military facilities in general and the facility of Sde Teiman in particular, with the intention that this facility will be used as a reception, interrogation and initial sorting facility, for keeping prisoners for short periods only.\u201d Responding to CNN\u2019s request for comment on all the allegations made in its May 10 report, the Israeli military, known as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said in a statement: \u201cThe IDF ensures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, MPCID (Military Police Criminal Investigation\u2019s Division) investigations are opened when there is suspicion of misconduct justifying such action.\u201d \u201cDetainees are handcuffed based on their risk level and health status. Incidents of unlawful handcuffing are not known to the authorities.\u201d The IDF did not directly deny accounts of people being stripped of their clothing or held in diapers. Instead, the Israeli military said that the detainees are given back their clothing once the IDF has determined that they pose no security risk.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/middleeast/israel-top-court-sde-teiman-hearing-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_china_china-change6-moon-lift-off-intl-hnk", "text": "China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-6 lunar probe departed from the far side of the moon on Tuesday, moving a step closer to completing an ambitious mission that underlines the country\u2019s rise as a\u00a0space superpower. In a symbolic moment before takeoff, China also reportedly became the first country to display its national flag on the moon\u2019s far side, which permanently faces away from Earth. The probe, carrying the first lunar rocks ever collected from the far side of the moon, took off and entered lunar orbit early Tuesday\u00a0Beijing time, following successful sample collection over the previous two days, according to a statement from the China National Space Administration (CNSA). Its return journey to Earth is estimated to take about three weeks, with a landing expected in China\u2019s Inner Mongolia region around June 25. The successful return of the samples would give China a head start in harnessing the strategic and scientific benefits of expanded lunar exploration \u2013 an increasingly competitive field that\u00a0has contributed to what\u00a0NASA chief Bill Nelson calls\u00a0a new \u201cspace race.\u201d This is the second time China has collected samples from the moon, after the Chang\u2019e-5 brought back rocks from the near side in 2020. Earlier this year, Nelson appeared to acknowledge China\u2019s pace \u2013 and concerns about its intentions \u2013 were driving the American urgency to return to the moon, decades after its Apollo-crewed missions. A photo posted by CNSA Tuesday and trending on China\u2019s X-like Weibo platform shows the drilled surface in a shape resembling the Chinese character \u201czhong,\u201d or \u201cmiddle\u201d in English\u00a0\u2013 the first character in the Chinese word for \u201cChina.\u201d The Chang\u2019e-6 probe withstood \u201cthe test of high temperatures\u201d and collected the samples by drilling into the moon\u2019s surface and scooping the soil and rocks up with a mechanical arm, CNSA said. After collecting the specimens, Chang\u2019e-6 extended a robotic arm to raise the Chinese flag, according to an animation released by CNSA. The flag, made from the volcanic rock basalt, was designed to resist corrosion and the extreme temperatures on the far side of the moon with an eye on future lunar missions, a Chang\u2019e-6 engineer told state-broadcaster CCTV. The rock \u201cwas crushed, melted and drawn into filaments about one third of the diameter of a human hair, then spun into thread and woven into cloth,\u201d said engineer Zhou Changyi. \u201cThe lunar surface is rich in basalt,\u201d Zhou added. \u201cSince we\u2019re building a lunar base in the future, we will most likely have to make basalt into fibers and use it as building materials.\u201d Historic mission Chang\u2019e-6 successfully landed on Sunday morning in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the moon\u2019s oldest impact basin formed some 4 billion years ago. It marked the second time a mission has successfully reached the far side of the moon, after China first completed that historic feat in 2019 with its Chang\u2019e-4 probe. If all goes as planned, the mission \u2014 which began on May 3 and is expected to last 53 days \u2014 could be a\u00a0key milestone in China\u2019s push to become a\u00a0dominant space power. The country\u2019s plans include landing astronauts on the moon by 2030 and building a research base at its south pole, a region believed to contain water ice. Samples collected by the Chang\u2019e-6 lander could provide key clues into the origin and evolution of the moon, Earth and the solar system, experts say\u00a0\u2013 while the mission itself provides important data and technical practice to advance China\u2019s lunar ambitions. \u201cThe enigmatic lunar far side is so different from the lunar nearside in so many ways, that without returned samples, lunar scientists can\u2019t fully understand the moon as an entire planetary body,\u201d said\u00a0James Head, a professor emeritus at Brown University who has\u00a0collaborated with\u00a0Chinese scientists leading the mission. \u201cReturned samples from Chang\u2019e 6 will permit major strides to be made in solving these problems.\u201d The far side of the moon is out of range of normal communications, which means Chang\u2019e-6 must also rely on a satellite that was launched into lunar orbit in March, the Queqiao-2. China plans to launch\u00a0two more missions\u00a0in the Chang-e series as it nears its 2030 target of sending astronauts to the moon. Space race Multiple nations are expanding their lunar programs, with a growing focus on securing access to resources and further deep-space exploration. Last year,\u00a0India landed\u00a0a spacecraft on the moon for the first time, while Russia\u2019s first lunar landing mission in decades ended in failure when its\u00a0Luna 25 probe crashed\u00a0into the moon\u2019s surface. In January, Japan became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, though its\u00a0Moon Sniper lander\u00a0faced power issues due to an incorrect landing angle. The following month, IM-1, a\u00a0NASA-funded mission\u00a0designed by Texas-based private firm Intuitive Machines, touched down close to the lunar south pole. That landing \u2013 the first by a US-made spacecraft in over five decades \u2013 is among several planned commercial missions intended to explore the lunar surface before NASA attempts to return US astronauts there\u00a0as soon as 2026\u00a0and build its scientific base camp.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/china/china-change6-moon-lift-off-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_americas_mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-challenges-intl-latam", "text": "Claudia Sheinbaum won a landslide victory to become the first female president of Mexico and first Jewish person in the role, adding to the growing list of accolades to the climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City. But\u00a0when\u00a0she formally takes office in October,\u00a0how\u00a0will\u00a0she\u00a0tackle the biggest challenges facing the country as concerns about its security and the future of its democracy loom large? Complicating her administration\u2019s debut,\u00a0Sheinbaum will also have to contend with the shadow of her polarizing mentor, the outgoing President Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, from the same Morena party. Sunday\u2019s vote was widely seen as a referendum on L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s term. And while his popular social welfare policies have helped push many Mexicans above the poverty line, experts say his security measures have done little to address the expanding reach of organized crime in the country. In a speech following the election, Sheinbaum promised to govern for all and to be an investor-friendly president. \u201cWe know that dissent is part of democracy. And although the majority of the people support our project, our duty is and will always be to look after each and every one of the Mexicans without distinction,\u201d she said as she struck a conciliatory tone at the end of the highly partisan race. \u201cSo, although many Mexicans do not fully agree with our project, we will have to walk in peace and harmony to continue building a fair and more prosperous Mexico.\u201d She promised a government \u201cwithout corruption or impunity\u201d and guided by \u201crepublican austerity, financial and fiscal discipline and autonomy of the Bank of Mexico.\u201d A victory for the Morena party While Sheinbaum\u2019s victory was widely expected this weekend, the \u201cbiggest story of last night\u201d was that the Morena party looked set to gain supermajorities in both houses of Congress,\u00a0said\u00a0Carin Zissis, a Mexico expert, and editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council\u2019s website. On Monday morning, the Mexican peso slipped roughly 3% against the US dollar amid rising concern that the ruling party will have a clear path to pass controversial constitutional reforms sought by L\u00f3pez Obrador. The reforms include a range of issues in areas like pensions and the energy sector, but they also include controversial judicial and institutional reforms,\u00a0which critics say\u00a0would weaken the separation of powers and see the disappearance of some independent regulatory agencies. \u201cWe have to see what happens when she comes into office: There has been a history of Mexican presidents breaking the path of their predecessors, even when their predecessors more or less selected them,\u201d Zissis said, adding: \u201cThough, [Sheinbaum] has pledged throughout her campaign to continue his legacy.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador has pushed back on suggestions that he would be giving Sheinbaum cues, saying on Monday that he would not \u201cinfluence\u201d his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\u00a0Sheinbaum is now \u201cthe one empowered to make all the decisions,\u201d he said. One of Sheinbaum\u2019s biographers, journalist Jorge Zepeda, has\u00a0speculated\u00a0that, once in office, Sheinbaum will unfurl her own platform gradually: she will first act as \u201cthe faithful disciple of the leader,\u201d before offering \u201cglimpses\u201d of her own program, taking care not to stoke instability in the movement\u2019s base. Gang violence and security Violence has dominated this year\u2019s election, with dozens of candidates murdered in the run-up to the vote and gangs trying to influence who was coming to power. Sheinbaum inherits a tragic epidemic of unsolved disappearances in the country:\u00a0More than 100,000 Mexicans and migrants have disappeared, with no explanation of their fate for families.\u00a0According to the think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua,\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved\u00a0in the country in\u00a02022. Mexico also remains a dangerous place to be a woman and is \u201csadly, known for high levels of femicide gender-based violence where the number of disappeared women has gone up and up year to year,\u201d Stephanie Brewer, Mexico Director at the Washington Office for Latin America (WOLA), told CNN. With security at the top of voters\u2019 concerns, Sheinbaum\u00a0has pointed to her record as Mexico City mayor, with her team crediting her for improvements to the police\u2019s pay, working conditions and intelligence-gathering capabilities \u2013 although there is some debate as to how much impact these measures had on bringing down the crime rate, experts said. But will\u00a0Sheinbaum\u2019s tactics as mayor of\u00a0Mexico City\u00a0be replicable\u00a0at the federal level and in Mexico\u2019s 31 states, home to more than 126 million people?\u00a0She will have to tackle a landscape\u00a0where criminal groups have expanded their reach. An hour away from Mexico City, in the state of Morelos, Will Freeman, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said he was told that organized criminal groups had \u201ctheir own political candidates\u201d in the town of Cuautla who could rely on armed wings to intimidate other people. Gangs in the country have also diversified to sectors beyond the illicit manufacture of drugs.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re doing illegal logging, illegal mining. They\u2019re taking control of the water supply, which is increasingly scarce,\u201d Freeman said. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s\u00a0term saw the expansion of the militarization of public security to tackle crime, a two-decades-long approach that\u00a0has coincided with historically high levels of homicides. A\u00a0May\u00a0report by the Crisis Group\u00a0found official corruption and collusion was hampering effective law enforcement. (CNN has yet to receive comment from Mexican Secretary of Defense and the president\u2019s office over the findings.) Sheinbaum has largely remained coy about her security programs, but has said \u201cthat at the national level we can advance even more in terms of security,\u201d she said in a\u00a0tweet on X, which listed out her security strategy that included the consolidation of the National Guard, strengthened intelligence and research, and better\u00a0coordination between the police, state prosecutors\u2019 offices and the attorney general\u2019s office. Where Washington and Mexico City meet Sheinbaum has\u00a0previously signaled\u00a0the importance of the US-Mexico relationship, especially around trade. \u201cWith the United States there will be a relationship of friendship, respect, mutual respect and equality as it has been until now, and we will always defend the Mexicans who are on the other side of the border,\u201d she said late on Sunday, local time. But analysts note there will probably be differences between US and Mexico when it comes to foreign policy.\u00a0Sheinbaum is from the ideological and political left, and \u201cI think she will be as friendly as L\u00f3pez Obrador towards Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua [and] will not probably take the geopolitical positions the US would hope for\u201d over Gaza and Ukraine, Freeman said. L\u00f3pez Obrador has angered advocates\u00a0on both sides\u00a0of the Israel and Gaza conflict.\u00a0Mexico has ruled out breaking diplomatic relations with Israel, in contrast to some of its Latin American counterparts, but it has also sought to join South Africa\u2019s genocide case against Israel. Sheinbaum\u00a0condemned\u00a0the violence following Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel and has\u00a0previously\u00a0called for a Palestinian state. In a 2009 letter to the editor of a Mexican newspaper, Sheinbaum wrote that many of her relatives from her grandparent\u2019s generation \u201cwere exterminated in the concentration camps.\u201d She added that \u201cbecause of my Jewish origin, because of my love for Mexico and because I feel like a citizen of the world, I share with millions the desire for justice, equality, fraternity and peace, and therefore, I can only see with horror the images of the state bombings,\u201d referring to an Israeli bombing campaign of Gaza that year. \u201cNo reason justifies the murder of Palestinian civilians,\u201d she wrote in\u00a0La Jornada. A partner to the US on migration? Sheinbaum will assume office just a month before Americans head to the polls in November, where immigration is a top issue on the ballot for candidates President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump \u2013\u00a0both of whom have\u00a0relied heavily on Mexico to step up immigration enforcement and help stem the flow of migration to the US southern border. While migration across the countries\u2019 1,933 miles long border is a shared concern,\u00a0migration is not a major issue among Mexican voters, Zissis said. Still, under L\u00f3pez Obrador, the Mexican government has accepted US deportations of tens of thousands of non-Mexican citizens under a 2023 Biden administration rule.

{"id": "2024_06_04_style_gregory-crewdson-photos-suburbia-retrospective", "text": "By now, the famed photographer Gregory Crewdson\u2019s well-oiled, large-scale shoots are well documented. He has shut down areas of small towns and built soundstages of shadowy home interiors to get at what lays beneath the suburban facade, encapsulating a disquieting view of America. His weekslong productions include a full crew (and costs) comparable to small independent films,\u00a0as well as a casting process to find subjects who have a particular sense of melancholy. But for his earliest bodies of work, made in the late 1980s and early \u201990s, Crewdson hacked it the best he could. As a student at Yale\u2019s MFA photography program, he shot what he could find in homes in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts, directing families to act out scenes of creeping unease. He built uncanny table-top sets and tableaus of animals in nature akin to museum dioramas, using forced perspective to make them seem larger-than-life. For his formative images of small-town landscapes, he procured a tree surgeon\u2019s crane to get high above the rooftops, and \u2014 dangerously \u2014 pirated electricity from homes to light scenes rather than rent generators. \u201cIt was such a ragtag team,\u201d Crewdson recalled in a video call with CNN. \u201cIt was a bit like the Wild West \u2014 we had very few permissions or permits. We were just out there improvising, and it felt so exciting.\u201d Three decades later, Crewdson is reflecting across all his work as a major retrospective opens at the Albertina museum in Vienna, showing all his series together (minus his commercial work) for the first time. Among them, the self-titled show\u00a0brings together his grand, eight-year endeavor \u201cBeneath the Roses\u201d from the mid-2000s, his earlier low-budget black-and-white images of \u201cHover\u201d from 1996, and his meditative return to photography after a difficult period of divorce and transition, \u201cCathedral of the Pines\u201d in 2013. The show\u2019s curator, Walter Moser, framed the exhibition and catalog around Crewdson\u2019s long dialogue with cinema, including inspirations such as David Lynch, Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock. \u201cHe really is quoting popular culture,\u201d Moser said in a phone call with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a visual language we all know\u2026 so we can connect to that. At the same time, his topics are very in the present.\u201d When Crewdson began his career, he was among a set of postmodernist photographers \u2014\u00a0including Jeff Wall, Cindy Sherman and Philip-Lorca diCorcia \u2014 who were concerned with the artificiality of photography, often blurring truth and fiction. \u201cThey analyze how we perceive reality, and how reality is constructed in photography,\u201d Moser said. With Crewdson\u2019s work, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s completely staged, and every detail is thought through. But at the same time, it\u2019s also documentary in the sense that he\u2019s really reflecting the state of society.\u201d From the beginning, the now-familiar elements in his work were already present. Consider an image taken in the late \u201980s made in Pittsfield, Massachusetts \u2014 a city he has continually returned to, including amid its industrial decline for 2018\u2019s \u201cAn Eclipse of Moths.\u201d In the cool glow of nighttime, he photographed the view of a lit baseball field outside of a bedroom window, gauzy curtains pushed back. The composition of mysterious lighting, nighttime stillness and window \u2014 motifs that he\u2019s often returned to in the years since \u2014 clicked something into place, he said, a sense of something \u201cthere but not there\u201d that he\u2019s strived for ever sense. (The phrase is also the title of a 2017 documentary short directed by his studio manager and romantic partner, Juliane Hiam.) \u201cI remember taking it and knowing that it felt meaningful to me. There was something beautiful to me about looking through a window at something that\u2019s slightly outside of reach,\u201d Crewdson explained. \u201cWhen I look at the work I made when I was 25 or 26, it\u2019s like \u2014 in a very early stage \u2014 it\u2019s not that far from what I even did last week,\u201d he added. A \u2018hyperreal\u2019 environment Desire and disconnection have served as the architectural foundations on which neighborhoods are built in Crewdson\u2019s world, which he described as sitting \u201cpartially outside of reality.\u201d His final images are composites of multiple frames, allowing\u00a0for every area of the image\u00a0to be sharp, making them appear \u201chyperreal,\u201d as Moser described. Lost in thought or memory, the characters Crewdson places together rarely interact in these exaggerated environments. Instead, they are often confronted with strangeness cutting through the banality of the day in the form of a blinding spotlight, blazing fire or blood in the sink\u00a0\u2014 a callback to Spielberg\u2019s aliens lurking off-screen in \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d or the found severed ear in Lynch\u2019s \u201cBlue Velvet.\u201d Artists such as Sherman, Edward Hopper and William Eggleston, who played a role in Crewdson\u2019s take on the American psyche, are also all apparent. But by now, the photographer\u2019s highly recognizable and inimitable style has helped shape the country\u2019s image, too. Some of his forays into pop culture were by his own hand, like when he teamed up with HBO\u2019s \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d \u2014 another uncanny, iconic study of the American family \u2014 to shoot a verdant kitchen scene with the cast for the promotion of the show\u2019s third season. Another, his lone editorial commission, \u201cDream House,\u201d for the New York Times Magazine in 2002, cast A-List actors Julianne Moore, Tilda Swinton, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Gwyneth Paltrow as nameless residents of a\u00a0Vermont home, nearly obscuring their celebrity. But\u00a0his vision permeates elsewhere, too, through direct or presumed nods from other creatives: the eeriness of life in the small town of \u201cStranger Things,\u201d or the surreal floral-laden bedroom scenes of Taylor Swift\u2019s music video \u201cLavender Haze\u201d (with the latter parallels spotted by Swifties on TikTok). \u201cThat\u2019s the way culture works; it\u2019s like a two-way street,\u201d Crewdson said of unexpected references to his work. \u201cAnd sometimes it can be a little beguiling, but\u2026 you just have let that be part of the equation.\u201d Though Crewdson\u2019s body of work spans societal shifts that have included political polarization, an epidemic of loneliness, suburban anxiety and rural decline, he refrains from making specific commentary \u2014 though he contends \u201cit\u2019s in the work.\u201d He also avoids markers of place or time, switching out street signs or storefront text, and favoring non-distinct cars and clothing. Nor is his view of America a particularly wide one, shot primarily in Massachusetts, as well as New York and Connecticut, in the areas where he\u2019s lived, studied and taught his whole life. (Crewdson is\u00a0now the director of the graduate program he attended at Yale in New Haven, and resides in the Berkshires). Over time, he\u2019s revisited streets or buildings he\u2019s previously photographed and recast some of the same characters, creating subtle narrative connections across his series. \u201cThere are photographers who chronicle the American landscape in a vast way \u2014 for me, it\u2019s always been going back over and over again to the same towns,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of that\u2019s practical, because once you become a known figure in the town you can shut down streets and work with the fire department for wet downs,\u201d he explained, referring to the method to drench a set for atmospheric or weather effects. \u201cBut the bigger part is psychological. I have a connection to this place in terms of an aesthetic response \u2014 it feels familiar to me.\u201d Chasing stillness Even when Crewdson began his career, he knew his love for cinema would guide his work, though he has always stuck with teasing out the enigmatic narratives of still pictures rather than moving into film. But he didn\u2019t foresee that his productions would eventually become so immense. \u201cIt built slowly and organically, until all of the sudden you realize, \u2018This is kind of crazy, all these people,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to block all that out and think about the picture in the end.\u201d He hasn\u2019t been behind the camera himself since \u2018Hover\u2019 in the 1990s; Instead, his longtime director of photography, Rick Sands, has that honor, while Crewdson prefers to have the scene come together in front of his eyes. \u201cThis might sound disingenuous, but it\u2019s the only way I really know how to make a picture now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s how I\u2019ve figured out how to reflect what I see in my head.\u201d In the 2017 documentary short \u201cThere But Not There,\u201d he describes the tranquility that occurs as the chaos of production comes together into that \u201celusive\u201d moment \u201cwhen the picture actually works,\u201d he said. It\u2019s that moment \u2014 not the final picture \u2014 that he\u2019s always chasing, he reiterated on the call. It doesn\u2019t always come easily, though; in a recent shoot, it happened, \u201cbut barely,\u201d he added with a laugh. Crewdson acknowledges that many of the themes he\u2019s returned to repeatedly, including the sense of being both \u201cpresent yet absent,\u201d are reflections of himself. His desire for a moment of stillness has wider implications in his own life. \u201cWe live our lives in like partial chaos. There are so many things that are destabilizing in life, and I have a lot of anxiety day to day \u2014 that\u2019s just a condition of being alive,\u201d he said. \u201cI think part of why we are drawn to art in general is to feel a certain sense of order or meaning. Even though my pictures can feel dystopic or sad, there\u2019s that moment where everything just comes together, and it feels like it makes sense.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/style/gregory-crewdson-photos-suburbia-retrospective/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "style_worlds-largest-3d-printer-homes-maine-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "Dozens of 3D-printed homes have been built across the world \u2013 to house a family in the US state of Virginia or members of an impoverished community in rural Mexico. The world\u2019s largest 3D-printed neighborhood is currently under construction outside of Austin, Texas. The technology could be especially handy in a place like the US state of Maine, where approximately 80,000 new homes will be needed by 2030 to address a shortage, according to a report released last year by three state agencies. \u201cPeople can\u2019t find homes, they\u2019re very expensive. We also have an aging population \u2026 so there\u2019s less and less people who are electricians, plumbers, or builders,\u201d Habib Dagher, the executive director of the University of Maine\u2019s Advanced Structures and Composites Center (ASCC), told CNN via video call. He says he\u2019s got a solution. Last month, the ASCC unveiled what it says is the world\u2019s largest polymer 3D printer. Dagher hopes the-so-called \u201cFactory of the Future 1.0\u201d can help address the state\u2019s housing crisis \u2013 and revolutionize 3D-home-printing in the process. \u201cThe approach we\u2019ve taken is quite different from what you\u2019ve seen, and you\u2019ve been reading about for years,\u201d he says. A home every 48 hours In recent years, 3D-printing has been used to build everything from businesses to bridges to mosques. One non-profit is even working on printing schools in a war zone. Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, holds the Guinness World Record for the world\u2019s biggest 3D-printed structure and aims to have 25% of new buildings constructed with 3D printing technology by 2030. A great majority of current printing relies on concrete, with a robotic arm equipped with a nozzle layering wet concrete into the right shape. ASCC is flipping the script. Its giant printer, and its predecessor, which in 2019 was certified by Guinness World Records as the \u201clargest prototype polymer 3D printer,\u201d are the only printers building homes with wood residuals, says Dagher. The technology has already been tested. In late 2022, the university unveiled the \u201cBioHome3D,\u201d a 600-square-foot single-family unit which it says is the world\u2019s first 100% bio-based 3D-printed home, built from local wood fiber and bio-resin materials. \u201cWhen they\u2019re doing concrete, they\u2019re only printing the walls,\u201d says Dagher. He adds that the floor, roof and walls of the BioHome3D were all printed. Concrete homes also need to be built on site, he says. That can be problematic, especially during the snowy New England winter. \u201cWhen the weather goes bad for two weeks at a time, you can\u2019t print,\u201d he adds. By contrast, ASCC printed prefabricated modules at the university and bolted them together on site to create BioHome3D. The new printer can produce objects as large as 96 feet long by 32 feet wide by 18 feet\u202fhigh and can print up to 500 pounds per hour. Dagher says that the goal is to be able to print 1,000 pounds of material in an hour. At that rate, it could reproduce the BioHome3D in 48 hours, he says. If they can reach that target, their 3D-printed homes will be \u201cvery competitive with current housing construction costs,\u201d he adds. But it can be difficult to process wood materials at such a high speed. Even ASCC\u2019s record-breaking printers sometimes jam. While printing BioHome3D, for example, the printer stopped working due to a dust buildup. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever done this before with these kinds of materials,\u201d says Dagher. \u2018When can I have one?\u2019 The BioHome3D\u2019s warm wooden floors and walls give it the look of a sleek, modern Scandinavian-inspired log cabin. \u201cMany people feel concrete is a cold thing to look at and it\u2019s not necessarily where you want to live,\u201d says Dagher. The BioHome3D, however, is \u201cvery warm and inviting.\u201d It\u2019s also sustainable. When a home is no longer needed or wanted it can be ground up and used to print something else. ASCC is using wood residuals from Maine\u2019s sawmills in its research, and looking into scaling up production using these local byproducts. Thousands of people have toured the prototype on the university\u2019s Orono, Maine campus, and Dagher says it\u2019s a rare occurrence when a visitor doesn\u2019t ask, \u201c\u2019When can I have one?\u2019\u201d \u201cWe hear, \u2018You know, I\u2019m retiring, and I want to downsize. Can I put one of these up?\u2019\u201d Dagher says. There are some obstacles to overcome first. \u201cIt takes years for codes to change,\u201d says Dagher, referring to building codes that construction companies must meet. The printer won\u2019t displace traditional home construction, but in the future 3D printed homes are likely to comprise a larger share of the world\u2019s housing stock, he predicts. The ASCC is now doing work on how to incorporate conduits for wiring and plumbing \u201cexactly where an architect would want them\u201d into the printing process, he adds. The printer\u2019s next big project is a nine-home neighborhood for people experiencing homelessness. ASCC is partnering with a local NGO to design the structures, and printing is set to kick off in 2025.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/worlds-largest-3d-printer-homes-maine-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

Reese earned her first technical after she appeared to say something to referee Charles Watson following a foul call, before being hit with the second for waving her hand as she walked away. The WNBA pool report states Reese received the technical fouls for \u201cdisrespectfully\u201d addressing the official and then for waiving off the referee \u201cin resentment to the call.\u201d \u201cShe said something to the ref,\u201d Sky guard Marina Mabrey told reporters. \u201cWhatever he felt like was the correct call is what he made. It\u2019s more about composure for us in our young years in the WNBA. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get to know refs and how they respond to things.\u201d Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon said she \u201ctried to get an explanation\u201d from the officials for the ejection, but \u201cdid not\u201d get one. \u201cI don\u2019t know to this moment what has happened,\u201d she told reporters.

Reese finished the Commissioner\u2019s Cup game with 13 points and 10 rebounds but shot 25% from the field. Breanna Stewart had a huge game for the Liberty, putting up a game high 33 points to go with 14 rebounds and three assists.

{"id": "2024_06_03_china_tiananmen-square-tank-man-photo-intl-hnk", "text": "The shot is iconic: an unidentified man in a white shirt, hands full of bags, facing off against a column of tanks on Beijing\u2019s Avenue of Eternal Peace, after the Chinese Communist Party ordered a bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. The photo and footage of the so-called \u201ctank man\u201d became the defining image of the Tiananmen Square crackdown whose 35th anniversary passed on Tuesday. On the night of June 3, 1989, after nearly two months of demonstrations by students and workers demanding faster political reform and an end to corruption, convoys of armed troops entered central Beijing to clear the square. It was a bloodbath; witnesses described tanks driving over unarmed protesters, and soldiers firing indiscriminately into the crowd. To this day the massacre remains one of the most sensitive political taboos in mainland China, with all mention of it strictly censored. Commemoration can lead to imprisonment. Chinese authorities have not released an official death toll, but estimates range from several hundred to thousands. Still, each June 4 since, diaspora communities and surviving protesters in exile around the world have commemorated the event\u00a0\u2013 often resharing the historic photo by Jeff Widener, then a photographer for the Associated Press (AP), as well as footage shot by CNN\u2019s crews. The journey of the photograph, too, captured the tension and fear of the time \u2013 involving smuggling equipment and film past authorities and across borders. By that point, the Chinese government was trying desperately to control the message going out to the world \u2013 and was trying to stop all American news outlets, including CNN, from broadcasting live from Beijing. These interviews, excerpted from \u201cAssignment China: An Oral History of American Journalists in the People\u2019s Republic\u201d by Mike Chinoy, CNN\u2019s Beijing bureau chief during the crackdown, offer the behind-the-scenes story of perhaps the most famous moment in the crisis. Chinoy was there, broadcasting live from a balcony overlooking the scene, and spoke to witnesses during and after the historic event. Sneaking in and smuggling equipment It was Monday, June 5, 1989, and Beijing was reeling from the crackdown the day before. Liu Heung-shing, the photo editor for the AP in Beijing, asked Widener to help get photos of Chinese troops from the Beijing Hotel \u2013 which had the best vantage point of the square, now under military control. Widener had flown in from the news agency\u2019s Bangkok office a week before to help with coverage, and was hurt when the crackdown began, he told CNN previously \u2013 after having been hit in the head by a rock, and laid low with the flu. He set off, with his camera equipment hidden in his jacket \u2013 a long 400-millimeter lens in one pocket, a doubler in another, film in his underwear and the camera body in his back pocket. \u201cI\u2019m biking towards the Beijing Hotel and there\u2019s just debris and charred buses on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden, there\u2019s four tanks coming, manned by soldiers with heavy machine guns. I\u2019m on my bicycle thinking I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this.\u201d \u201cI hear rumors that other journalists had had their film and cameras confiscated. I had to figure out a way to get into the hotel,\u201d he added. \u201cI look inside the darkened lobby, and there\u2019s this Western college kid. I walked up to him and whispered, \u2018I\u2019m from Associated Press, can you let me up to your room?\u2019 He picked up on it right away and said, \u2018Sure.\u2019\u201d That young man was Kirk Martsen \u2013 an American exchange student who snuck Widener into his sixth-floor hotel room. From there, Widener began photographing the tanks rolling by on the roads below \u2013 sometimes hearing the ring of a bell that signified a cart passing by with a body, or an injured person being taken to the hospital, he said. Capturing the shot Other journalists were at the hotel, too \u2013 including Jonathan Schaer, CNN\u2019s US-based cameraman who flew into Beijing to support his exhausted colleagues. He\u2019d set up a camera on the balcony of CNN\u2019s room at the hotel, where the network had been broadcasting live reports of the crackdown throughout the weekend. \u201cAnother cameraman said, \u2018Hey, look at the guy in front of the tanks!\u2019 I just zoomed in and started videotaping,\u201d Schaer recalled. \u201cWhen the column stopped and the man blocked the tanks, they were trying to scare him off by shooting over his head. Well, shooting over his head was basically where our position was. The bullets were so close you could hear them whizzing by.\u201d Back in Martsen\u2019s room, Widener was at the window, preparing to photograph the column of tanks coming down the road, when \u201cthis guy with shopping bags walks out in front and starts waving the bags,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for him to get shot, holding the focus on him, waiting and waiting.\u201d The tank stopped and tried to go around the man. The man moved with the tank, blocking its path once again. At one point during the standoff, the man climbed aboard the lead tank and appeared to speak to whoever was inside. But Widener had a problem \u2013 the scene was too far away for his 400-mm lens. His doubler, which would allow him to zoom in twice as much, lay on the bed, leaving him a choice: Should he go grab the doubler, and risk losing the shot in those precious seconds? He took the chance, got the doubler on the camera, took \u201cone, two, three shots. Then it was over,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people came, grabbed this guy, and ran off. I remember sitting down on this little sofa next to the window and the student (Martsen) said, \u2018Did you get it? Did you get it?\u2019 Something in the back of my mind said maybe I got it, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Liu remembers getting the call from Widener, and immediately firing off instructions: roll up the film, go down to the lobby, and ask one of the many foreign students there to bring it to the AP office. The pictures were soon transmitted over telephone lines to the rest of the world. Widener did, sending the student bicycling away with the film hidden in his underwear. Forty-five minutes later, \u201can American guy with a ponytail and a backpack showed up with an AP envelope,\u201d said Liu. They quickly developed the film, \u201cand I looked at that frame \u2013 and that\u2019s the frame. It went out.\u201d Schaer, the CNN photojournalist, didn\u2019t initially realize what they had captured on tape. This was in the early days of email, which didn\u2019t yet handle large video \u2013 so CNN was using a \u201cgizmo that could send video \u2026 a prototype that Sony had given us to try out,\u201d which took an hour to scan one frame of video and send it over a phone line, he said. So they sent five frames, made copies of the tape and sent it to the airport in Beijing \u2013 where they enlisted a tourist to take the tape to Hong Kong, which at the time was still a British colony and not subject to Chinese rule.

{"id": "2024_06_04_europe_d-day-normandy-landings-explainer-scli-intl", "text": "June 6, 2024 marks 80 years since D-Day, the first day of the\u00a0Normandy landings that laid the foundations for the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. The invasion \u2013 codenamed Operation Overlord \u2013\u00a0saw of\u00a0tens of thousands of troops\u00a0from countries including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada landing on five stretches of the\u00a0coastline of Normandy, France \u2013 codenamed Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword beaches. Planning for\u00a0D-Day began more than a year in advance, and the Allies carried out substantial military deception to confuse the Germans as to when and where the invasion would take place. When was D-Day? The operation was originally scheduled to begin on June 5, 1944, when a full moon and low tides were expected to coincide with good weather, but storms forced a 24-hour delay. Allied divisions began landing on the five beaches at 6:30 a.m. on June 6. What does D-Day stand for? The term \u2018D-Day\u2019 was military code for the beginning of an important operation, with the first \u2018D\u2019 being short for \u2018Day.\u2019 This means that D-Day actually stands for \u2018Day-Day.\u2019 According to the Royal British Legion, the phrase \u2018D-Day\u2019 was used fairly often before the Allied invasion in June 1944. After this, however, the two became synonymous, and now D-Day is commonly understood to refer to the beginning of Operation Overlord. Which Allied countries were involved? D-Day saw unprecedented cooperation between international armed forces, with more than 2 million troops in the UK in preparation for the invasion, according to the Imperial War Museums (IWM). Most of these troops were American, British and Canadian, the IWM reports, but troops also came from Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and Poland to participate in Operation Overlord. What preparations were made? The Allied troops\u2019 invasion was coordinated across air, land and sea, in what can be described as amphibious landings. These were preceded by an extensive bombing campaign to damage German defenses, as well as the employment of deception tactics. Operation Bodyguard was an umbrella term for the deception strategy leading up to the Allies\u2019 invasion of Europe in June 1944. Operation Fortitude was a tactic under this umbrella specifically related to the Normandy invasion, and was intended to make Nazi Germany believe that the initial Normandy attacks were merely a diversion and that the true invasion would take place elsewhere. According to the IWM, Fortitude North intended to trick the Germans into believing that the Allies would attack Norway, and Fortitude South was designed to convince the Germans that the Allies were going to invade Pas de Calais, a French department northeast of Normandy that is closer to the UK. What happened on D-Day? The US troops were assigned to Utah beach at the base of the Cotentin Peninsular and Omaha Beach at the northern end of the Normandy coast. The British subsequently landed on Gold Beach, followed by the Canadians at Juno, and finally the British at Sword, the easternmost point of the invasion. By midnight, the troops had secured their beachheads and moved further inland from Utah, Gold, Juno and Sword. However, not all the landings were successful; US forces suffered substantial losses at Omaha Beach, where strong currents forced many landing craft away from their intended positions, delaying and hampering the invasion strategy. Heavy fire from German positions on the steep cliffs, which had not been effectively destroyed by Allied bombing before the invasion, also caused casualties. How did the Germans try to defend themselves? According to the IWM, Germany\u2019s reaction to Operation Overlord was \u201cslow and confused.\u201d Weather conditions on June 6 were still poor, many senior commanders were not at their posts, and Operation Fortitude convinced Adolf Hitler that the Normandy invasion was a feint before a bigger attack at Pas de Calais. Germany\u2019s air force was in action elsewhere, countering American bombing operations over Germany. Its navy ships were docked in ports or already destroyed by the Allies. This left only the German army to defend against Operation Overlord, according to the IWM. On top of this, the success of Operation Fortitude meant that many army units were kept away from the Normandy battlefield until July, as an attack in Pas de Calais was still expected. German troops manning coastal defenses \u201cdid as much as they could have been expected to,\u201d the IWM says, before eventually being \u201csilenced\u201d and Allied units advanced inland. How many people died on D-Day? On D-Day alone, around 4,440 Allied troops were confirmed dead, according to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), with more than 5,800 troops wounded or missing. Because Omaha Beach was the bloodiest landing beach, the US Army lost the most men in the amphibious landings. Some 2,500 American troops died in the beach assault and airborne operations on D-Day, according to the CWGC. The precise number of German casualties on the day is unknown, but they are estimated to be between 4,000 and 9,000. Who were the Bedford Boys? Of the tens of thousands of troops that stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-Day, 44 were soldiers, sailors and airmen from Bedford, Virginia, in the US. Within minutes of reaching Omaha Beach, 16 of these men were killed and four were wounded. Another Bedford soldier was killed elsewhere on Omaha Beach, and three others were presumed killed in action, bringing Bedford\u2019s D-Day fatality figure to 20 men. According to the National D-Day Memorial Foundation, Bedford suffered the highest known per capita D-Day loss in the US. What followed D-Day? Despite securing a stronghold on the French coast on\u00a0D-Day, the Allied forces faced the risk that German bombardment could push them back into the sea. They needed to build up troop numbers and equipment in Normandy faster than the Germans, allowing for a continued invasion into mainland Europe. The Allies used their air power to slow the German advance toward Normandy by blowing up bridges, railways and roads across the region. This allowed the Allies to gain total control of Normandy 77 days later and move on toward Paris, which they liberated in August 1944. What impact did the operation have on the war? The US Department of Defense calls D-Day the \u201csuccessful beginning of the end of Hitler\u2019s tyrannical regime.\u201d The IWM calls it the \u201cmost significant victory of the Western Allies in the Second World War.\u201d By being able to get forces into Normandy, the Allies were able to begin their advance into northwest Europe. Though World War II lasted nearly another year in Europe, the success of Operation Overlord led to the liberation of France and allowed the Allies to fight the Germans in Nazi-occupied Europe. The US\u2019 National World War II Museum says that a good way to appreciate the significance of D-Day is to imagine what would have happened if the operation had failed. According to the museum, another landing would have not been possible for at least a year. In this time, Hitler could have strengthened Nazi-occupied Europe\u2019s coastal defenses, developed aircraft and weapons, bombed the UK even more heavily and continued his killing campaign, the museum says. Fighting by the Allies on the western front and Russian soldiers on the eastern front eventually led to the defeat of the German Nazi forces. On May 7, 1945, the German Third Reich signed an unconditional surrender at Reims, France. Victory in Europe (V-E) Day is celebrated the following day as that\u2019s when the armistice went into effect.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/europe/d-day-normandy-landings-explainer-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_03_africa_nigerian-workers-declare-nationwide-strike-intl", "text": "A nationwide strike in Nigeria brought air travel to a standstill and plunged the country into darkness on Monday as union workers stormed the national grid and shut down the nation\u2019s power supply, according to the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). Tens of millions are without power and flights have been disrupted, as the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) initiated an indefinite strike. Operators from TCN were beaten and injured while they were forcibly removed from control rooms, the company said. Cane-swinging\u00a0union workers were also seen in photos circulating on social media Monday ordering personnel of the country\u2019s tax agency out of their offices. This strike comes after failed negotiations with the government to raise the federal minimum wage. The unions are also protesting a recent hike in electricity tariffs. The unions\u2019 demands include raising the minimum wage from 30,000 naira ($22.4) to 494,000 naira ($369.6). Presidential aide Bayo Onanuga dismissed these demands as \u201cunreasonable,\u201d in a post on the social media platform X. The government had proposed a 100% increase to 60,000 naira ($44.89), which the unions rejected, seeking a 1,547% increase instead, Onanuga added. Despite being Africa\u2019s fourth-largest economy, Nigeria\u2019s minimum wage is not among the continent\u2019s top ten, lagging far behind countries like Seychelles, where workers receive a minimum wage of $465.4 monthly. Health care system disrupted The strike has severely affected travel, leaving passengers stranded at major airports in Lagos and Abuja. Airport workers confirmed to CNN that all incoming and outgoing flights have been grounded, further compounding the crisis. Healthcare services have also been severely impacted, a Nigerian doctor Olusina Ajidahun told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m worried because the state of the healthcare system is on the verge of collapse,\u201d he said, adding that his medical facility located in southwest Nigeria was unable to power crucial hospital equipment due to the shutdown of the national grid. \u201cComing in the morning, the emergency (unit) and everywhere was dark. Patients and healthcare workers were all in darkness.\u201d Nigerian Justice Minister Lateef Fagbemi has declared the strike illegal in a letter to the labor unions, calling it \u201cpremature and ineffectual,\u201d in a statement posted by Onanuga. The strike has elicited mixed reactions from Nigerians on social media, with some declaring support, others saying it is detrimental to citizens. \u201cI support the strike action by the NLC. 30k or 60k minimum wage in 2024 Nigeria is unsustainable and unacceptable,\u201d wrote lawyer Festus Ogun in a post on X. \u201cThe NLC should refrain from actions that punish the common man \u2013 the average Nigerian. Electricity, roads, airports and other critical infrastructure should be left to function as normal,\u201d argued management consultant Dipo Awojide. Controversial expenditure Nigeria faces numerous economic challenges, including the devaluation of its currency which has dropped to record lows in recent months, as well as a cost-of-living crisis marked by soaring prices for food, transport, and health care. Inflation has reached 33.69%, according to the country\u2019s data office, the highest in nearly three decades. President Bola Tinubu\u2019s administration has faced criticism for controversial spending of public funds which has fueled public anger. Last month, the president approved a 90 billion-naira ($67 million) subsidy for Muslims attending the Hajj pilgrimage, and previously, he authorized multimillion-dollar budgets for luxury SUVs and renovations for presidential residences, as well as vehicles for the First Lady\u2019s office, which is not formally recognized under Nigerian law. Presidential spokesman Ajuri Ngelale admitted that the current wage is \u201cunsustainably low\u201d but warned that the unions\u2019 proposed increase would have severe economic consequences, including significantly higher school fees and potential mass retrenchment if schools and other institutions cannot afford the increased wages. \u201cNigerian parents will now have to grapple with school fees that are 10 times more than what they are paying today \u2026 you are going to mandate schools to pay cooks, janitors, and others 20 times more in wages?\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/africa/nigerian-workers-declare-nationwide-strike-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_style_how-the-super-rich-ship-their-cars", "text": "Ameerh Naran is relentlessly international. Born and raised in Zimbabwe to an Indian family of shoemakers, he once became Harare\u2019s first importer of sex toys. After going on to make millions in private aviation (his planes have been used by celebrities, politicians and on \u201cKeeping Up With The Kardashians\u201d), he now spends most of his time in Dubai and London \u2014 which can present logistical challenges for driving his fleet of cars. \u201cI have a rare Porsche Carrera GT that cost me \u00a31.5m ($1.9m) and I keep it at the airport in Dubai,\u201d says Naran, whose company, Vimana Private Jets, also has offices in Los Angeles and New York. \u201cIf I fly anywhere, Emirates will put it on the earliest flight to wherever I\u2019m going so my car meets me there.\u201d Naran, who\u2019s 38, is one of thousands of wealthy car owners who think little of buying plane tickets for their automobiles, taking advantage of specialist freight services for cars that many of the major airlines offer, particularly those based in the Middle East. An ecosystem of car transport specialists has evolved to work with the airlines and the family offices of the ultra-rich so that favored vehicles magically follow them around the globe. It\u2019s traditionally a busy time of year for these services as the richest residents of the Gulf states prepare to jet off to cooler climes for the summer after Ramadan. The last time Naran flew his Porsche from Dubai to London on Emirates, he says it cost \u00a328,000 ($36,000) \u2014 a little more than he could have paid after landing for a brand-new Golf at a West London Volkswagen dealership. But then serious car guys tend not to want to be seen in family hatchbacks. \u201cI also have jet clients who are very wealthy and less price sensitive than me and don\u2019t want to put their cars on commercial airlines, in which case they\u2019ll charter a cargo plane from us, which costs in the millions,\u201d Naran tells me from Cape Town where\u2019s he\u2019s just arrived for a wedding, without the need for a car. The ultra-wealthy will often take whole fleets of cars with them when they travel, loading vehicles, along with motorbikes and other toys, onto chartered cargo aircraft that follow their private jets. Covered trucks are used to complete journeys to clients\u2019 addresses or garages; owners baulk at the idea of random delivery drivers adding mileage to their beloved cars. Naran says his richest clients barely blink at such excesses; one recently chartered a cargo plane to be ready to fly straight away when his newly acquired Samsung TV wouldn\u2019t fit through the door of his own jet. Rare cars can be worth millions, but not always. \u201cI have one client who transports a Nissan Patrol 4x4\u201d Naran says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s worth anything, but he likes it and it\u2019s costing him millions to fly it around with his Bugatti.\u201d Dan Hallworth started shipping cars about 15 years ago after cutting his teeth at his uncle\u2019s freight firm in Manchester, England, after finishing school. Back then he says most of the business was in the summer and tended to involve cars coming from the Middle East to London. Newspapers used to be full of reports of hypercars roaring around chichi parts of the British capital at the hands of Qatari princes who cared little for speed limits or the parking fines they collected outside luxury department store Harrods. Hallworth, who says he can send a car between Dubai and London for around \u00a310,000 ($13,000) on cheaper airlines, says the market has changed since then. Police and councils in London started to clampdown on the showiest drivers, and viral videos of watch muggings and other crimes have put many of his clients off London. \u201cNow they go skiing and everything like that and it\u2019s much more all-year-round,\u201d says Hallworth, whose company, Dan Car Logistics, now ships more than 100 vehicles a year by air and thousands more by road. His clients are still mostly based in the Middle East and include royal families. He recently transported a \u201chumongous\u201d Mercedes to Los Angeles for \u00a320,000 ($25,000) and a \u00a312m ($15.3m) bespoke Bugatti Chiron Hermes edition to Marbella, Spain, for a Qatari prince. If anything, he says, the flow of wheels has reversed; he\u2019s often transporting cars from London to Dubai for people travelling or doing business there. It\u2019s a trend the airlines are noticing too; Etihad Cargo tells me the greatest demand for its FlightValet car shipping service is now in the UK. More than half of the 139 shipments of 151 cars it flew in 2023 originated from Heathrow, mostly bound for Abu Dhabi and Dubai. December was the busiest month, and the biggest destinations for cars leaving the UAE were Frankfurt, Zurich and Chicago. Etihad will only deal with registered freight agents rather than individuals \u2014 cars are considered to be \u201cdangerous goods\u201d and the paperwork required for them to clear customs can be extensive. Hallworth, who\u2019s 33, says an annual insurance policy covers all his work, the cost of which he includes in his fees. Occasionally he politely declines new customers if things seem, well, a little off. \u201cWe always want the owner\u2019s ID, the registration documents of the cars and to get a feel of the customer,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be just, like, \u2018yeah I can do that\u2019, and the next minute you\u2019ve got a stolen car on a plane and some serious questions to answer.\u201d Like Naran, who is now developing his own hypercar (the Naran will be yours for north of \u00a32m or $2.6m), Hallworth has grown his business thanks to word-of-mouth marketing at the highest levels. This can occasionally present him with tricky requests. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to transport horses and camels,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my bag, and I would never say yes to a job if I\u2019m not 100% sure the cargo is going to be alive when it arrives.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/style/how-the-super-rich-ship-their-cars/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

The IDF claimed Tuesday afternoon local time that fighter jets were attacking Hamas targets in the Bureij area \u201cat the same time as ground forces that are operating in a targeted manner and with intelligence guidance,\u201d in the same area. CNN cannot independently verify the IDF\u2019s statement. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said that 15 people had been killed and dozens injured during the Israeli operation, with the casualties occurring east of the Bureij and Al-Maghazi displacement camps. It said the local Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital was overwhelmed with admissions. A CNN producer in the area said that at least six bodies had been brought to the hospital, along with more than 30 injured people. Among those killed were a father and his 12-year-old son, when an artillery shell hit an apartment building east of Al Bureij, according to the CNN producer, as well as a boy and a girl. A woman in her 20s was also killed. The ministry said the number of patients was more than three times the hospital\u2019s normal capacity and that it was unable to bear receiving more martyrs and injuries in light of this dangerous aggression against civilians, children and women.\u201d It called on the World Health Organization to visit the hospital. Witnesses say civilians started to leave the Bureij area \u2013 heading towards the coast \u2013 after military activity there intensified. Another CNN producer reported tank-fire in recent days from the east-west Netzarim corridor that the IDF has carved through central Gaza towards neighborhoods south of Gaza city. He said there had been a limited ground incursion in the same neighborhoods over the past three days. News of the latest assault comes as the former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told CNN the war with Hamas had lost momentum and that Israel should pressure Hamas by pushing on with its controversial operations in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah. \u201cWe need to act much quicker. This whole war is going on way too long. We could\u2019ve done Rafah three, four months ago. I think a combination of poor execution of the Israeli government and the American administration\u2019s constant slowing down of Israel coupled together made for a very slow and prolonged war,\u201d Bennett told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. He said that prolonging the war is what Hamas wants, and the only way to get a ceasefire and hostage deal on the table is to put more pressure on Hamas and push harder in Rafah, adding that operations there have not concluded. He said Israel is \u201cpaying an international price\u201d as other countries criticize the war\u2019s humanitarian toll. \u201cWe are trying to conduct the most just war in history,\u201d Bennett said, but \u201ceverybody in the world is double-guessing and telling us how to do it and how they would do it better, but they\u2019re not in our shoes, and we have to defend our citizens first.\u201d Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed at least\u00a036,550\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a082,959\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there.

His powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had set out to win a supermajority in the lower house of parliament \u2013 or Lok Sabha \u2013 a goal which, if successful, would give it an unstoppable mandate to further enshrine its Hindu-nationalist agenda, deepening India\u2019s move away from its secular foundations. But as preliminary results began rolling in throughout Tuesday, that ambitious goal appeared to be at risk, with the main opposition Indian National Congress performing better than some analysts expected \u2014 despite the BJP still in a comfortable lead. For real-time election results and analysis, follow CNN\u2019s live coverage here. Given India\u2019s strategic position in Asia and its booming economy, the election result will reverberate far beyond its borders, capturing the attention of the United States, China and Russia in particular. Some 642 million people cast their vote in the world\u2019s largest election, as swathes of the country was blanketed in searing heat, making people sick and killing dozens. Hoping to unseat India\u2019s charismatic but divisive leader is an alliance of more than two dozen parties, led by the Congress party, which is running on a platform of reducing inequality and upholding democratic institutions which it argues are at risk. Since assuming power in 2014, Modi has attained levels of popularity not seen in decades, owing to a raft of development and welfare programs, mixed with a strident brand of Hindu nationalism in a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith. Under Modi\u2019s leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power, making strides in technology and space. Yet, despite these successes, poverty and youth unemployment persist \u2013 particularly in rural areas \u2013 and the wealth gap has widened. Critics also say a decade of Modi\u2019s governance has led to growing religious polarization, with Islamophobia marginalizing much of the country\u2019s more than 200 million Muslims, and religious violence flaring up in a nation with a long history of communal tensions. Polling began on April 19 and ended on June 1. Nearly 1 billion Indians were eligible to vote for 543 seats in the lower house of parliament. The leader of the party that wins a majority will become prime minister and form a ruling government. Modi has set an ambitious target of securing a 400-seat supermajority, with 370 directly controlled by his BJP \u2013 up from 303 in 2019 \u2013 and the others from its National Democratic Alliance. His BJP centered its manifesto on job creation and anti-poverty programs, with a focus on women, the poor and farmers. He\u2019s promised to turn India into a developed nation by 2047 and transform the country into a global manufacturing hub. Yet, on the campaign trail, he has been accused of deploying openly divisive rhetoric that has been condemned as Islamophobic, while casting himself as an instrument chosen by God. Modi sparked a row over hate speech when he accused Muslims \u2013 who have been part of India for centuries \u2013 of being \u201cinfiltrators,\u201d and echoing a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists that Muslims are displacing the country\u2019s Hindu population by deliberately having large families. His BJP released several political videos targeting Muslims, one of which is under investigation by police. Congress has governed India for much of its independent history, having been instrumental in ending nearly 200 years of British colonial rule. But over the last decade, it has struggled to find relevance \u2013 partly due to a series of corruption scandals and infighting \u2013 unable to break through Modi\u2019s popularity. Rahul Gandhi, the son of the famed Gandhi dynasty, is the face of the party but lost the past two elections to Modi. He is contending once again from the southern state of Kerala and the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh in the north, also India\u2019s most populous. Opposition leaders and parties have faced a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year\u2019s election, with many accusing the BJP of using state agencies to stifle opponents. The arrest in March of the popular Aam Aadmi Party leader, chief minister of Delhi and staunch Modi critic Arvind Kejriwal sparked protests in the capital and prompted claims of a political \u201cconspiracy\u201d by his party \u2013 claims the BJP has denied. Kejriwal\u2019s release on interim bail last month galvanized the opposition to put up a tough fight against the BJP, uniting a group of political leaders who were once divided over ideological differences. The Congress\u2019 manifesto has also been dubbed one of India\u2019s most progressive, pledging \u201cfreedom from fear\u201d and vowing to protect freedom of speech, expression and religious belief espoused in the constitution. Turnout across all seven phases has slightly dipped from the record highs of 2019, yet India\u2019s general election remains the largest exercise in democracy, with hundreds of millions showing up to determine who will lead the world\u2019s most populous country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/india/india-general-election-vote-counting-day-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_tech_elon-musk-byd-china-nightcap", "text": "The most important carmaker in the world right now is the Chinese-owned, Warren Buffett-backed company that has Elon Musk in a pickle. BYD, a carmaker Musk once laughed at, overtook Tesla at the end of last year as the top seller of electric vehicles on the planet (Tesla overtook it in the first quarter of this year, but they\u2019re neck and neck). And now it\u2019s giving Toyota a run for its money, unveiling a new hybrid powertrain that BYD says is capable of taking you from New York to Miami without refueling. That\u2019s 1,300 miles in one go \u2014 hundreds of miles beyond the standard ranges for other hybrids on the market. According to The Wall Street Journal, ranges of major global hybrid carmakers typically top out just above 680 miles. BYD\u2019s Hong Kong shares shot up more than 5% on Wednesday. There are a few reasons why all of that matters. One: Tesla is America\u2019s best-selling EV, but it\u2019s losing market share overseas to foreign competitors that can make their cars cheaper. And while Tesla is an EV pioneer, it hasn\u2019t rolled out any significant innovations in recent years that would help justify its loftier price point. That\u2019s why BYD \u2014 which makes both EVs and hybrids \u2014 is now eating Tesla\u2019s lunch on the global stage. China is the world\u2019s biggest auto market, and BYD is its top seller, surpassing Volkswagen last year. On top of all that, BYD\u2019s sedans are cheap. The two models that will boast the new drivetrain start at around $14,000. (For comparison, the best-selling hybrid in the US, the Toyota Prius, starts at $28,000.) BYD\u2019s evolution from a small producer of clunkers to a global powerhouse brand has surprised its skeptics, including Musk, who roundly dismissed BYD in a 2011 Bloomberg interview. In that exchange, Musk responds to an honest question about BYD rivaling Tesla with a smug laugh. \u201cHave you seen their car?\u201d he asks the interviewer rhetorically. When the reporter presses him, he clarifies that he thinks BYD\u2019s product is not \u201cparticularly attractive\u201d and that the technology is \u201cnot very strong.\u201d Of course, a lot happened in the decade that followed, and Musk ate his words this January, saying on an earnings call that he believes Chinese EV makers could \u201cpretty much demolish most other car companies in the world\u201d unless stronger trade barriers are put in place. (They were two weeks ago.) Meanwhile, BYD has another edge that Tesla lacks: It makes hybrids. Hybrid cars like the Prius were supposed to be the short-lived stepping stone to our all-electric future. But in the United States, at least, EV sales are flagging in part because the nation\u2019s roads lack the infrastructure to support them. EV ranges have come a long way \u2014 most get more than 300 miles of range per charge, which is more than most people would drive before stopping even in a traditional car. Problem is, we don\u2019t have enough charging stations along the roads or within cities to make customers comfortable with the idea. The top reason US customers won\u2019t consider an EV \u2014 cited by 52% of consumers in a recent JD Power survey \u2014 is lack of charging station availability. Instead, we\u2019re buying more hybrids, which are largely cheaper than EVs, reduce the cost of fuel over the long term and are ever so slightly better for the environment than regular engines. (Emphasis on slightly\u2026 Hybrids still run on fossil fuels, they\u2019re not doing much to help the world meet its climate goals the way mass adoption of EVs would.) For now, Tesla and other US carmakers are being thoroughly shielded from Chinese competition via strict tariffs and major regulatory hurdles. But it\u2019s not clear how long those protections will hold if American consumers begin demanding the cheaper options available overseas.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/tech/elon-musk-byd-china-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_middleeast_iran-military-adviser-killed-israel-syria-intl", "text": "Israeli airstrikes near the Syrian city of Aleppo early Monday killed an Iranian military adviser, Iranian media reported, two months after the Middle East came to the brink of a major war as Israel and Iran engaged in unprecedented direct attacks on each other\u2019s soil. Saeed Abiyar, an adviser to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) in Syria, died in the attack, Iran\u2019s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. Syrian state news agency SANA said the incident occurred around 12.20 a.m. local time on Monday after Israel launched an aerial attack with missiles, targeting \u201ca number of points\u201d in the vicinity of Aleppo, without providing information on fatalities. CNN has requested comment from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which does not usually acknowledge such strikes. Abiyar is the first member of the IRGC to be reported killed by Israel since April, when Israel is suspected to have bombed the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus, killing several commanders, including the top IRGC commander in charge of relations with Syria and Lebanon. The Islamic Republic retaliated to that attack by launching a barrage of drones and missiles toward Israel, most of which were intercepted. Israel fired back, a US official told CNN, targeting a major Iranian military airbase near the city of Isfahan. Iran has deployed military advisers to Syria in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad since civil war broke out there in 2011. Israel is believed to have launched several strikes on Iranian and Hezbollah targets in Syria in recent years, particularly since the start of its war with Hamas in Gaza. It has warned that Iran is turning it into \u201ca base for aggression against Israel.\u201d What happens next? After the tit-for-tat exchange in April, Iran said it had created \u201ca new equation\u201d with Israel, pledging to retaliate every time Israel attacks its interests in the future. \u201cThe era of strategic patience is over,\u201d said Mohammad Jamshidi, deputy chief of staff to the Iranian president. Monday\u2019s attack suggests that Iran\u2019s \u201cnew equation,\u201d indicating that it has restored deterrence, may not have been achieved, said Trita Parsi, a Washington DC-based Iran analyst and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute think tank, adding that this is the first attack of its kind since April\u2019s exchange of fire. It took place at a time of domestic turbulence for Iran. Former President Ebrahim Raisi was killed last month in a helicopter crash along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other Iranian officials. Iran is now in the process of electing a new leader. \u201cThe Israelis may very well have calculated that this is an opportune time to strike,\u201d Parsi told CNN, adding that the attack may leave Iranian officials in a quandary on how to respond. The killing also occurred as Israel faces growing isolation on the world stage for its devastating war in Gaza, as pressure mounts from multiple fronts for it to end hostilities. Last week, US President Joe Biden joined the chorus of world leaders to call for an end to the war. Abiyar\u2019s killing raises the stakes of a repeat of April\u2019s unprecedented tit-for-tat direct strikes between Iran and Israel. But escalation is not a given. What triggered Iran\u2019s ire in April was likely a combination of escalatory factors, that the strike took place on its consulate in Damascus, which is technically Iranian soil. Israel contested this, claiming the target was an Iranian military headquarters. Monday\u2019s strike doesn\u2019t reach the same threshold. Neither country, in April or now, appears to want escalation. Tehran will have a choice to make, Parsi said. \u201cOn the one hand, they\u2019re going to have pressure to respond in order to claim that their deterrence has been restored. On the other hand, do they want to have an escalation in the midst of this very sensitive election?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/middleeast/iran-military-adviser-killed-israel-syria-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_04_uk_london-abandoned-babies-gbr-intl", "text": "Police are searching for the parents of three babies who were wrapped in shopping bags and blankets, then abandoned in east London over the past seven years. A court revealed on Monday that baby Elsa, who was found left in a park in cold weather in January, is a sibling of two other newborns, PA Media reported. Elsa\u2019s sister and brother, who were named in local media by the pseudonyms Roman and Harry, were discarded nearby in 2017 and 2019. All three infants were found alive and were quickly cared for, with the oldest two since being adopted, according to PA Media. Yet Monday\u2019s court ruling sheds light on a chilling pattern in the London borough of Newham. It began in September 2017, when Harry was found wrapped in a blanket in a small park. Police appealed for the mother to come forward, but she never did. A year and a half later, Roman was found in another park nearby, wrapped in a blanket and a shopping bag. \u201cThe child had a frosty forehead\u2026 (it was) snowing shortly afterwards,\u201d the man who discovered her and alerted police told the BBC in 2019. And in January this year, Elsa was found a very short walk away from the same location. She was discovered, wrapped in towels, by a dog walker just after 9 p.m., police said at the time. \u201cThinking fast, that person kept the baby girl warm until London Ambulance Service paramedics arrived and checked her over before taking her to hospital,\u201d Chief Superintendent Simon Crick said in a statement. \u201cI am grateful to the members of the public who stayed at the scene to speak with officers and medics \u2013 your actions contributed to saving the baby\u2019s life,\u201d Crick added. Like her sister Roman, she was left in very cold January temperatures. The Metropolitan Police said at the time it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that Elsa was born after a \u201cconcealed pregnancy,\u201d according to PA Media. A week after Elsa was found, police appealed for help to identify \u201ca woman seen wearing a large dark coat with a light coloured scarf or hood around her neck,\u201d and a rucksack on her back, shortly before the discovery of the baby. \u201cIt is still believed she could hold important information about how Elsa came to be where she was found,\u201d police said. DNA testing revealed that the three babies are related. Police knew that the three children, who are Black, were siblings, but a judge decided on Monday that reporting restrictions \u2013 which limit what can be said about children who are victims of crimes \u2013 could be lifted, allowing the media to publish details. \u201cThe abandonment of a baby in this country is a very, very unusual event and there are years where there are no children abandoned, and because of that it is the story of the abandoning of a child that is of public interest,\u201d PA Media quoted the judge as saying.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/04/uk/london-abandoned-babies-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_africa_aliko-dangote-oil-refinery-nigeria-spc", "text": "Over the past eight years, Aliko Dangote, Africa\u2019s richest man, has built one of the world\u2019s largest oil refineries. Spanning nearly 4,000 football fields, construction of the refinery began in 2016 at the Lekki Free Zone outside of Lagos, Nigeria, and it opened in May 2023. Dangote\u2019s company says the plant will have the capability to produce 650,000 barrels per day once fully operational. Nigeria is one of Africa\u2019s largest oil producers, yet the country has lacked the capability to refine its oil forcing it to rely on imported fuel. With the opening of this refinery, Dangote Industries Ltd., a massive conglomerate that also operates cement plants, a fertilizer plant, and sugar refinery, says it aims to process enough oil to not only make Nigeria self-sufficient but supply petrol, diesel, and jet fuel to other African countries. Now that the $19 billion facility is complete, Dangote stressed it will take time for local oil producers to shift away from relying on overseas refineries, but it\u2019s a challenge he\u2019s confident he can overcome: \u201cI\u2019ve been fighting battles all my life, so I don\u2019t get scared of anything,\u201d he told CNN. In May, CNN\u2019s Eleni Giokos got an inside look at the refinery and spoke with Dangote about what it took to bring this massive project to life and what impact it will have within the continent. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: Do local oil companies, oil producers want to sell crude to you? Aliko Dangote: Nobody thought we were going to appear in this industry. So with that, we know there are challenges and that\u2019s the truth, I have to be very open to you, but NNPC, [Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation], they\u2019ve been very helpful. They do their own bit, but some of the IOCs [international oil companies] they\u2019re struggling to give us crude because everybody\u2019s used to exporting and nobody wants to stop exporting, which does not make sense. CNN: What\u2019s the timeline of Nigeria being completely self-sufficient producing oil, refining oil locally and exporting? Dangote: Well, if the NNPC put all their refineries to work, Nigeria will be the largest petroleum products export country in the continent. Not only in the continent - it\u2019ll be one of the biggest (worldwide), not as much as India but almost. So let me talk about Dangote Refinery: 40% of our refining products will go outside Nigeria. So that is after meeting the entire demand of Nigeria. We will meet the demand 100%. By June or so, we should be able to fully meet Nigeria\u2019s demand and then because we\u2019re ramping up already, we\u2019re a little bit over 420,000 barrels per day already. So, as we go along, ramping up, I believe by July/August we should be at almost 550,000 barrels per day. Then maybe before end of the year we\u2019ll be at about 650,000. CNN: In addition to building the oil refinery, you also built a cement manufacturing plant and have become one of the largest cement producers in sub-Saharan Africa. Did it make economic sense at the time to build a cement plant and compete effectively with imported cement prices? Dangote: We didn\u2019t have much challenge because we were also the importers and there was massive demand in terms of cement. So, what we did was actually to continue with the trading by building capacity. When we started, our first plant was 5 million metric tons, and at that time, the entire production in Nigeria was 2.1 million metric tons. But we went ahead very aggressively \u2013 we invested our money, we risked our capital, and we made the country self-sufficient. CNN: I\u2019ve heard you talk a lot about the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and whether it\u2019s viable. You have experience doing cross-border trade and even you\u2019ve got issues getting your cement across borders in certain parts of the continent, so what\u2019s happening? Dangote: The AfCFTA will be very, very beneficial and if you\u2019re thinking about benefit, our company will almost be one of the top five in terms of benefiting from the free trade agreement. But I have not seen any improvement [yet]. That\u2019s the truth because we have 3 million tons of urea [a type of fertilizer] to export to African countries. It\u2019s too much for Nigeria\u2019s consumption. We have petroleum projects to export. We have cement also to export. So what makes sense is to have the free trade agreement work. For us to cross that hurdle \u2013 because the trade between us [African countries] is only about 16%, which is too low \u2013 we have to make sure that all the regional markets work. We have to remove requirements of visas. We have to allow free movement of people, free movement of goods and services, then the AfCFTA will work \u2013 without that it\u2019s almost impossible. I mean, you look at it today, I\u2019m going to Egypt tomorrow, but I need a visa. They\u2019re saying that yes, okay, fine, they\u2019ll give me visa on arrival if I have an American [passport]. I have an African passport, so they\u2019re discounting me being an African. So how do we trade if you are not allowing me into your own country? CNN: So how are imports affecting industrialization and local growth of value chains? Dangote: Well, it will actually destroy the industrialization of Africa, if we continue to import. The more you import, you are importing poverty into your continent and exporting jobs. Because wherever you are importing from, you are encouraging them to keep expanding. When they expand, they recruit more people, give more jobs to their people. But here, the little jobs that we need to create, they destroy that. So, I\u2019m not a big fan of imports. I\u2019m a big fan of industrialization and Africa can be industrialized, but we, Africans, are the only ones that can industrialize Africa. Nobody is going to come and do it for us. We have to have good policies and the policies have to be consistent, and then we have to make sure that the investment climate is good.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/africa/aliko-dangote-oil-refinery-nigeria-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_05_sport_manchester-city-legal-action-premier-league-spt-intl", "text": "Manchester City has initiated legal action\u00a0against the English Premier League (EPL) over commercial rules, the UK\u2019s Times reported on Tuesday. City, which won a fourth successive Premier League title last month, is\u00a0looking to end the\u00a0league\u2019s\u00a0Associated Party Transaction (APT) rules, according to The Times, which reported on specific excerpts of the lawsuit. Those rules require commercial and sponsorship deals involving companies owned or associated with the same club\u2019s owners to be independently assessed by the EPL board on whether they are of fair market value. Between 2008 and 2015, City was wholly owned by Abu Dhabi United Group, a company belonging\u00a0to Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed, according to\u00a0the\u00a0website\u00a0of City Football Group, the club\u2019s parent company, which is majority owned by Newton Investment and Development LLC. Newton is also owned by Sheikh Mansour, who is UAE Vice President, Deputy Prime Minister and President of the Presidential Court. The company is registered in Abu Dhabi. Effectively owned by a nation state, City has attracted criticism from some who argue that it is an entity that has an unfair advantage over its rivals given the value of sponsorship deals with companies that are owned by the club\u2019s owners. The APT rules came into effect in December 2021 after the Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle\u00a0United. According to The Times, City claims\u00a0the APT rules are unlawful and are seeking damages from the league. According to The Times\u2019 reporting,\u00a0City argues that it\u2019s the victim of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and has been subject to the \u201ctyranny of the majority,\u201d a reference to the way the Premier League reaches decisions \u2013 a minimum of 14 of its 20 clubs are required to approve any regulatory changes. The matter will be heard in a two-week private arbitration\u00a0hearing, scheduled to begin on June 10, The Times reports. CNN has reached out to the EPL which declined to comment while City has yet to respond to CNN\u2019s request for comments. CNN hasn\u2019t been able to verify the litigation document, which the Times reported consists of 165 pages. The ruling in the APT case could have a significant impact on another legal matter involving City \u2013 an independent hearing into\u00a0alleged\u00a0financial breaches. A conclusion to that case reportedly remains some time away. In February 2023, the\u00a0Premier League accused City of breaching more than 100 financial rules,\u00a0and allegations included failing to provide accurate financial information, failing to comply with UEFA\u2019s financial fair play (FFP) regulations and failing to follow Premier League rules on profit and sustainability. At the time, the club said it had a \u201ccomprehensive body of irrefutable evidence\u201d to support its position, and City manager Pep Guardiola said he hoped for a swift ruling so that \u201cif we did something wrong, everyone will know it.\u201d Despite City\u2019s legal woes, the club made history in May, becoming the first English team to win four consecutive league titles.\u00a0In 2023, City won the Champions League for the first time. But with every trophy comes constant referencing of City\u2019s alleged financial breaches, much to the chagrin of chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s frustrating. I think the\u00a0(referencing)\u00a0is always frustrating,\u201d\u00a0Al Mubarak said in his end of season interview released on City TV on Wednesday. \u201cI can feel, of course,\u00a0for our fanbase,\u00a0for everyone associated with the club, to have these charges constantly referenced. \u201cI think we as a club have to respect that there is a process that we have to go through, and we\u2019re going through it. \u201cIt\u2019s taking longer than what anyone hoped for, but it is what it is, and I\u2019ve always repeated \u2026 let\u2019s be judged by the facts, and not by claims and counterclaims,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/sport/manchester-city-legal-action-premier-league-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

The circumstances of their deaths in Hamas captivity are still under examination, according to the IDF, which says it uses a \u201ca wide variety of methods to gather information about the hostages who remain in the Gaza Strip.\u201d Chief spokesperson for the IDF, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said \u201cTheir loved ones were killed a few months ago during Hamas captivity in Gaza and their bodies are still being held by Hamas. We assess that the four of them were killed while together in the area of Khan Younis during an operation there against Hamas.\u201d In May, Hamas said Popplewell, an Israeli-British citizen, had died from wounds following a strike by Israeli fighter jets on his place of detention over a month earlier. CNN is not able to independently verify the claim by Hamas. More than 250 people were taken hostage and moved to Gaza during Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel but more than 100 were released during a temporary truce last year. The Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office believes there are still 124 hostages, living and dead, in Gaza \u2013 four of whom were taken before October 7. Of the remaining 120 who were taken on October 7, Israel now believes 41 are dead. Israeli War Cabinet minister and Chairman of Israel\u2019s National Unity Party, Benny Gantz sent condolences to the families of those declared dead on Monday, saying on his Telegram channel the news was \u201ca painful reminder of our supreme moral duty to continue to fight against terrorism and to do everything to return all the hostages home as soon as possible, even at painful costs.\u201d The latest deaths are likely to increase pressure on the Israeli leadership to secure a ceasefire proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden last week. Following news of the four deaths, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum in Israel reiterated its demand to the Israeli government to immediately approve the proposal. The organization called the news of the four deaths a mark of disgrace and a sad reflection on the significance of delaying previous deals. \u201cThe Israeli government must send out a negotiating delegation this evening and return all 124 hostages, both living and murdered, to their homes,\u201d the group said in a statement Monday. \u201cChaim, Yoram, Amiram, and Nadav were kidnapped alive, some of them were with other hostages who returned in the previous deal \u2013 and they should have returned alive to their country and their families,\u201d the statement added. The three-phase proposal outlined by Biden on Friday would secure the release of hostages paired with a ceasefire. The US president outlined the plan \u2013 which he said was proposed by Israel \u2013 in unusual detail in what appears to have been an attempt to pressure both Israel and Hamas into an agreement. On Monday, leaders from the Group of 7 (G7) nations added to that pressure by endorsing the proposal, calling on Hamas to accept it, and claiming that \u201cIsrael is ready to move forward\u201d with it. However, whether Israel is, in fact, \u201cready to move forward\u201d with the plan laid out by Biden remains something of an unknown, as the Israeli government has offered a series of non-committal statements that have created a degree of uncertainty about the plan. British Foreign Secretary David Cameroon also noted the proposal in a post on the social media platform X, in which he said he was \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d by the death of Israeli-British citizen Popplewell. \u201cMy thoughts are with his loved ones at this terrible time for them,\u201d Cameron\u00a0wrote. \u201cWith a new deal on the table, we reiterate our demand for Hamas to send all hostages home.\u201d Husbands, fathers, brothers The Hostage and Missing Families Forum released the following information on the four hostages declared dead Monday. Nadav Popplewell: 51, from Kibbutz Nirim, a family man of distinction and a generous friend, a lover of books and science fiction. Nadav was kidnapped from his home\u2019s safe room along with his mother, Channa Peri, who was released after 49 days in captivity. His older brother, Roy, was murdered on October 7. Amiram Cooper: 84, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz. He was kidnapped together with his wife, Nurit, who was released from Hamas captivity after 17 days. Amiram saw the establishment of the kibbutz as his life\u2019s mission. He was an economist, poet, and composer. He is survived by his wife, three children, and nine grandchildren. Yoram Metzger: 80, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, kidnapped from his home along with his wife, Tamar, who was released from Hamas captivity after 53 days. Yoram was a man of family and people, stories and humor. He was one of the founders of the Nir Oz Winery. Yoram is survived by his wife Tamar, three children, and seven grandchildren. Chaim Peri: 80, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, a man of peace, art, and cinema. He taught in schools in the area and at Sapir College. He established and built the art gallery in the kibbutz and the sculpture garden. He was one of the founders of the Nir Oz Winery. Chaim was abducted from the safe room in his home while protecting his wife, Osnat. He is survived by his wife, five children, and 13 grandchildren.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday posted a photo of Lavrov in Ouagadougou, noting that he had been received by acting President Ibrahim Traor\u00e9. Lavrov was accompanied on the trip by Russian Deputy Defense Minister Yevkurov. Burkina\u00a0Faso is\u00a0currently under military rule\u00a0after a junta staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in July 2022. Its junta, headed by Traor\u00e9, has said it is prioritizing building up security\u00a0amid an ongoing and deadly internal conflict. Violence-related deaths in\u00a0Burkina\u00a0Faso doubled last year, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). So far in 2024, hundreds of civilians have already been killed in attacks this year, including around 170 in three villages\u00a0in March, and approximately 30 in separate mosque and church attacks\u00a0in February. Engulfed in violence, Burkina\u00a0Faso has been named the world\u2019s most neglected displacement crisis for the second year, by the NRC. In 2024, 6.3 million people in the country will need humanitarian assistance, the aid organization said, with over two million people internally displaced. US officials have warned for years now that both Russia and China are working to build influence in Africa. In 2019, the former head of US Africa Command, Gen. Thomas Waldhauser also said that Russia was using mercenaries and arms sales to gain access to natural resources in Africa. Isolated from much of the world due to its invasion of Ukraine, Russia appears to be renewing overtures in the continent. In early March of this year, Africa Command again warned Congress that Russia was aggressively working to expand its footing in Africa, and that several countries were \u201cat the tipping point\u201d of falling under its influence. In his comments this week, Lavrov also thanked Burkinabe leaders for their \u201ceffective assistance in resolving issues that allowed us to resume the activities of our embassy in Ouagadougou.\u201d \u201cWe are implementing a program to resume the activities of Russian diplomatic missions in Africa.\u00a0Burkina\u00a0Faso was the first country to do this quickly and effectively,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/05/africa/russia-burkina-faso-military-instructors-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_ukraine-war-map-kharkiv-avdiivka-robotyne-intl", "text": "Russia has opened up a new front in its invasion of Ukraine, launching a surprise offensive in the northeastern region of Kharkiv after focusing much of their forces this year on the east. The assault,\u00a0which began earlier this month,\u00a0saw thousands of Russian soldiers punch through the northern border, and forced Ukraine to move in troops from other areas to defend positions. It serves as an example of how Russia has been exploiting Ukraine\u2019s main vulnerabilities: insufficient manpower, artillery shortages, sparse air defenses and inadequate defensive fortifications. Ukraine\u2019s frontline brigades are clinging on as they desperately await munitions\u00a0from allies and fresh recruits to provide some much-needed manpower. CNN has laid out the three key frontiers where fighting is now raging, tracking the marginal gains Russia has made along a frontline which had previously been frozen for months. In the north, Moscow\u2019s troops are aiming to bring its troops within tube artillery range of Kharkiv city. Along the southern front, the battle is on to recapture villages liberated during Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive last year and push further into Ukrainian territory. Ukraine, meanwhile, is racing to fix its current weak spots after finding itself on the back foot as it pledges to fight \u201chouse by house, street by street.\u201d The Kharkiv front The cross-border assault saw the Russians quickly take control of several villages. Since then, Russia has ramped up its attacks in the area as it tries to take control of the key settlements of Vovchansk and Lypsti. Lyptsi, which lies around 30 kilometers north of Kharkiv, is under heavy Russian bombardment. Capturing the large village would allow Russian troops to position artillery within range of Kharkiv city,\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s second largest, which is already vulnerable to missile attacks, as this weekend\u2019s strike on a hardware store showed. The attack also allows Russia to divert already thinly stretched Ukrainian resources away from other front lines, and to create a buffer zone from Ukrainian attacks on Russian border regions. The nearby Russian city of Belgorod, for instance, has increasingly come under Ukrainian attack in recent months. The east - Avdiivka and Bakhmut Before the Kharkiv offensive, Russia had been largely focusing its offensive capabilities in the east, where it had been inching forward since October 2023\u00a0as Ukraine\u2019s highly-anticipated counteroffensive floundered last summer. Capturing Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial heartland \u2013 known as the Donbas - remains a major Kremlin goal.  In February, Moscow\u2019s troops notched up a major success along this front when they took the town of Avdiivka. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that the decision to pull back was made to \u201csave our soldiers\u2019 lives\u201d and came in the face of constant, heavy Russian bombardment and a ten-to-one shell disadvantage. Since then, Russian troops have made steady progress westwards in the direction of Pokrovsk, which serves as a vital military hub in Ukraine\u2019s war effort. A few dozen kilometers to the north, eastern city of Bakhmut was recaptured by the Russians in spring last year following a grinding, nine-month battle. Now, Russia\u2019s forces are edging west towards Chasiv Yar. Getting control of high ground on which the town sits would put Putin\u2019s troops closer to the strategic city of Kramatorsk. The battle for Robotyne Further to the south, Ukrainian forces are coming under pressure southeast of Zaporizhzhia, one of the few areas where they achieved success, albeit modest in size, in last summer\u2019s counteroffensive. Both Russian military bloggers and Ukraine\u2019s DeepStateMap report small Russian advances into a pocket of recaptured Ukrainian territory. Robotyne, a tiny village that is now completely destroyed, has changed hands several times during the war. It was first captured by Russian forces in early March 2022\u00a0and Moscow again claimed control over it earlier this month, something denied by Ukraine.\u00a0 The battle for Robotyne highlights the fluidity of the battlefield and\u00a0is a stark illustration of the nature of the fighting, with the war being decided in brutal battles for often abandoned villages.\u00a0", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/ukraine-war-map-kharkiv-avdiivka-robotyne-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_us-weapons-ukraine-strike-russia-kharkiv-intl", "text": "The story of the past 27 months since Russia invaded Ukraine has been one of crumbling taboos. After repelling Russia\u2019s initial march on Kyiv, Ukraine has asked its Western allies for greater and greater support: first ammunition, then tanks, then cluster munitions, then fighter jets. Each time, the West has agonized over whether to grant Kyiv\u2019s latest request, fearing escalation and a potential Russian response. Each time, the taboo was broken \u2013 and nothing happened. What seemed beyond the pale one week had become banal the next. But the rhythm of deliberation and delay has been hard to shake. Despite securing more weapons from the United States last month, Ukraine has not been able to use them as it pleases. As Moscow this month launched its surprise assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region, Washington forbade Kyiv from using US weapons to strike targets inside Russia. This too crumbled. President Joe Biden this week gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes using US weapons in Russian territory around Kharkiv, after several European nations had removed restrictions on how the weapons they have given to Kyiv can be used. \u201cOver the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that were provided to defend against this aggression\u201d near Kharkiv city, \u201cincluding against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday on a visit to Prague, the Czech capital. He confirmed Biden had approved Ukraine\u2019s request. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the decision as a \u201cstep forward\u201d which will help his forces to defend the embattled Kharkiv region. While the decision may mark a new phase of the war, analysts have questioned whether the new freedoms will significantly bolster Ukraine\u2019s ability to repel Russia\u2019s invasion. Some are bullish. This month, the calls for the US to remove the restrictions became more desperate, as Russia continue to pummel Kharkiv city with missiles and make gains elsewhere in the region. In a CNN op-ed, Adam Kinzinger and Ben Hodges described the bizarre effect of the US taboo: \u201cWe have heard Ukrainian soldiers repeatedly tell stories of Russian columns attacking, being repelled, and retreating to safe Russian territory to regroup, have a hot meal, plan and attack again.\u201d \u201cUkraine cannot win if Russians can attack civilian targets with impunity and call \u2018time out\u2019 in their own territory,\u201d they wrote, urging Biden to call his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin\u2019s bluff. But military analysts have tempered expectations, partly because the US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles). Kateryna Stepanenko, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, told CNN the policy change will \u201cblunt\u201d Russia\u2019s offensive in Kharkiv, but still \u201cpreserves the majority of Russia\u2019s sanctuary space.\u201d \u201cThe policy still protects Russia\u2019s operational and deep rear sufficiently that this change near Kharkiv Oblast is insufficient to bring about a turning point in the war. Ukraine particularly needs the capacity to strike deep rear areas to defeat the Russian ground and air threats, as many Russian airfields that support strikes against Ukrainian cities are located outside of the allowed GMLRS range,\u201d she said. Franz-Stefan Gady, an associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN the GMLRS cross-border strikes will allow Ukraine \u201cto hit some Russian staging areas, command and control centers, as well as supply depots. It will not stop but complicate Russian military operations against Kharkhiv.\u201d \u201cWe need to be realistic about what can be expected from this policy change, since the Russian armed forces have already adapted to the introduction of ground-based precision fires,\u201d he said. Mathieu Boulegue, a researcher at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said the policy change would allow Ukraine to \u201cbe more efficient when it comes to repelling attacks and pushing back preemptively.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a game changer, per se. It\u2019s an add-on, a steroid, an extra booster for Ukraine to defend itself,\u201d he said. Red lines fade The US is joining the United Kingdom, France, Germany and several others in removing restrictions on how Ukraine uses the weapons it is given. Before Biden gave the green light, Putin had made veiled nuclear threats to countries considering allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with their weapons. He warned the move could lead to \u201cserious consequences,\u201d particularly for \u201csmall and densely populated countries.\u201d As well as making nuclear threats, Putin also signaled earlier this month that he was open to peace talks. \u201cAll of these false narratives deliberately aimed to discourage Western decisionmakers from allowing Ukraine to preempt Russia\u2019s attack on Kharkiv city,\u201d Stepanenko said. While the removal of this taboo appears to mark a new chapter in the war, Russia has previously experienced Ukrainian strikes with Western weapons on territory it considers its own. Ukraine has frequently targeted occupied Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, using \u201cStorm Shadow\u201d missiles provided by the UK. Ukraine also launched strikes on Kharkiv and Kherson in late 2022, as it sought to liberate the regions occupied by Russia in the early weeks of the full-scale invasion. In both cases, Russia had warned Ukraine and its Western allies not to cross its red line. In both cases, Ukraine and its Western allies ignored the warning. \u201cThe Kremlin already regards strikes against occupied Crimea and Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia oblasts as \u2018strikes against Russia,\u2019 but the reality is that there are few things that Russia can do to further escalate its war in Ukraine without incurring major risks,\u201d Stepanenko said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/us-weapons-ukraine-strike-russia-kharkiv-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/06/2024", "section": "world"}}
