Carlo Acutis \u2013 whose computing skill helped him spread the message of the Catholic Church and earned him the nickname \u201cGod\u2019s Influencer\u201d - died from leukemia in 2006 aged 15. A second miracle attributed to Acutis has been recognized by Pope Francis, paving the way for him to be made a saint. Candidates normally need to have two miracles attributed to them before they can be canonized. Speaking to CNN, his mother, Antonia Salzano, said that the news of the approval of the second miracle was a \u201cgreat joy\u201d, and that Carlo is a \u201csign of hope\u201d who shows that holiness is possible today. \u201cAs I did: you too can become holy\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cNevertheless, [with] all the media the technologies it seems sometimes that holiness is something that belongs to the past. Instead, holiness is also something nowadays in this modern time.\u201d She said her son was bought a PlayStation when he was eight, but limited himself to one hour a week of gaming as he was wary that it could become addictive and that he knew the \u201cdangers of the internet\u201d. Along with his computing and gaming, Carlo played the saxophone, enjoyed soccer, loved animals and would make short, humorous films of his dogs. Ms Salzano said her son used his computer skills \u201cnot to do things for earning money or to become famous but to spread the Gospel [the message of Jesus Christ], to help people,\u201d and was \u201cfull of joy.\u201d While he had similar interests to other kids, the soon-to-be-saint was unafraid to stand out from the crowd. His mother said that the age of nine the youngster spent time helping the homeless in Milan and giving his pocket money to those sleeping on the streets. She explained that he insisted on only having one pair of shoes, so he could save money to help the poor. He was also unafraid to stand up for the victims of bullying and resist peer pressure. According to Nicola Gori, author of\u00a0\u2018Carlo Acutis: The First Millennial Saint\u2019\u00a0and the postulator (guide) of his sainthood cause, Acutis once defended a girl from India who was targeted for wearing a sari, and he was known at school for his \u201ccheerfulness, energy, generosity.\u201d He was devoted to Saint Francis, the saint renowned for poverty, humility and care for creation, and the pope\u2019s namesake. Paolo Rodari, an Italian journalist who wrote a book about Acutis with Ms Salzano, told CNN that Acutis was a \u201cnormal guy\u201d who served others including the \u201cmany needy people who slept on the streets of Milan. To them he gave everything.\u201d Acutis became ill in early 2006 and was later diagnosed with Leukemia: he died on October 12. At his funeral two days later, a large crowd gathered with many of them immigrants to Italy and those belonging to a variety of religions. Devotion to Carlo quickly began to spread across the world, and his story was taken up by several Catholic youth groups. Ms Salzano hopes the canonization will either be later this year or next year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/europe/carlo-acutis-mother-sainthood-pope-francis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Macron was leaving Paris on Tuesday night and will \u201cset up a mission\u201d in the French territory, government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot told a press conference, without giving further details. He will be accompanied by Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin, Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, and Overseas Minister Marie Gu\u00e9venoux, Darmanin told the National Assembly. New Caledonia has been roiled by riots sparked by electoral changes from the national government. The unrest has killed at least six people, and has left a trail of burned cars and looted shops, with road barricades restricting access to medicine and food. The violence is the latest outburst of political tensions that have simmered for years and pitted the island\u2019s largely pro-independence indigenous Kanak communities \u2013\u00a0who have long chafed against rule by Paris \u2013 against French inhabitants opposed to breaking ties with their motherland. Macron\u2019s visit comes as Australia and New Zealand deploy government planes to evacuate their nationals from New Caledonia and as hundreds more French security personnel have been deployed to assist in the unrest. France\u2019s High Commission of New Caledonia said Tuesday the airport remains closed for commercial flights until May 25. Thevenot said Tuesday that 1,000 more members of French security forces have arrived in New Caledonia to support the 1,700 personnel already on the island. Darmanin also told the French legislature the number of police and gendarmes in New Caledonia would soon reach 3,000. Also speaking to France\u2019s National Assembly, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said Tuesday \u201cthe situation is starting to improve.\u201d Protests began May 13 involving mostly young people, in response to the tabling of a vote in the French parliament proposing changes to New Caledonia\u2019s constitution that would give greater voting rights to French residents living on the islands. On Tuesday, legislators voted overwhelmingly in favor of the change. The proposed changes to the constitution add thousands of extra voters to New Caledonia\u2019s electoral rolls, which have not been updated since the late 1990s. Pro-independence groups say the changes are an attempt by France to consolidate its rule over the archipelago. Supporters of the change say voter rolls will better reflect the current population. Lying in the South Pacific with Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu for neighbors, New Caledonia is a semiautonomous French territory \u2014 one of a dozen scattered throughout the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean. Colonial France took control of New Caledonia in 1853. White settlement followed and the indigenous Kanak people were longtime victims of harsh segregation policies. Many indigenous inhabitants continue to live with high rates of poverty and high unemployment to this day.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/europe/french-macron-new-caledonia-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Adam Armstrong scored the only goal of the game in the first half as Southampton defeated Leeds United 1-0 in the Championship play-off final at Wembley Stadium to book its return to the top-flight of English soccer. According to Deloitte\u2019s Sports Business Group, Southampton will receive at least \u00a3140 million ($177 million) across the next three seasons through \u201cprojected increases in matchday, broadcast and commercial revenue.\u201d That would increase to more than \u00a3305 million ($386 million) if the club avoids relegation in its first season. Southampton joins both Leicester City and Ipswich Town in securing promotion to the Premier League this season. After the game, Southampton\u2019s captain Jack Stephens struggled to control his emotions as he summed up his elation, calling it \u201cthe best feeling I\u2019ve ever had in football.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so proud to be captain of this club. I\u2019m so proud of the boys today, I think they\u2019ve been unbelievable,\u201d Stephens told Sky Sports. \u201cI think we probably didn\u2019t play our best game today but we showed a different side. A few people have doubted us over this season. Can we defend? Can we dig in? I think we really showed that today.\u201d A lot on the line With a place in the Premier League on the line \u2013 and the financial reward that comes with it \u2013 the Championship play-off final comes with high stakes and high pressure. And the pressure was particularly high ahead of this year\u2019s final, with both teams looking to bounce back to the top-flight of English soccer at the first time of asking having suffered relegation last season. Pouring rain before the game in northwest London only heightened to add to the dramatic nature of the day, before bright sunshine broke through as the game began. The game\u2019s opening exchanges were played with the magnitude of the occasion weighing on them, with chances few and far between. But the game sparked into life halfway through the first half when a neat through-ball from Southampton midfielder Will Smallbone sprung Armstrong running into the Leeds box before he blasted the ball past goalkeeper Illan Meslier to score his 24th league goal of the season. Despite Leeds opening up in the hopes of an equalizer, it was Southampton who came closest to doubling its lead, with only Meslier and key defensive interventions sparing Leeds from going into halftime with a two-goal deficit. Just minutes into the second half, Leeds almost drew level but Crysencio Summerville\u2019s curled effort flew just wide of the post. Leeds continued to pile on the pressure in search of that illusive equalizer and came inches away from doing so when Wales international Dan James hit a curling effort against the bar. But despite pushing and pushing, Leeds was unable to find a way through and Southampton secured its return to the Premier League at the first time of asking.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/sport/southampton-leeds-2024-championship-play-off-final-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_middleeast_israel-idf-hostage-video-hamas-intl", "text": "Families of seven female Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas during the October 7 attacks have released graphic footage of their abduction as they pile pressure on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure their release. The video shows the women \u2014 all Israel Defense Forces (IDF) personnel \u2014 lined up against a wall, their hands bound. The faces of some of the women are bruised and bloodied. The footage was previously released by Hamas, according to the Hostages Families Forum. The campaigning group obtained it from the IDF, which had previously edited the video to exclude the most disturbing scenes. \u201cEvery new testimony about what happened to the hostages echoes the same tragic truth \u2013 we must bring them all back home, now,\u201d the Hostage Families Forum said in a press release Wednesday. The\u00a0women were\u00a0kidnapped during a Hamas raid on Israel\u2019s Nahal Oz military base, near the northern Gaza Strip, as part of the militant group\u2019s attacks on Israel that left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 250 captured and taken hostage in the enclave. Following the attack,\u00a0Israel\u00a0launched a war in Gaza that has killed\u00a0more than 35,000 Palestinians\u00a0over the past seven months, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. The\u00a0kidnapped\u00a0women were working as IDF observers, a role that involves monitoring Israel\u2019s border security. Video of the ordeal has been made public as pressure mounts on Netanyahu to secure the release of the Israelis still held by Hamas,\u00a0which his government has made a key goal of the Gaza offensive. Numerous attempts to strike a hostage-for-ceasefire deal with Hamas have faltered in recent months, infuriating those in Israel campaigning for the return of the captives. \u201cThe State of Israel cannot accept a reality where its citizens constantly feel their lives are threatened and suffer from unrelenting fear and anxiety,\u201d the Hostages Families Forum\u00a0said\u00a0as it publicized the video on Wednesday. \u201cWith each passing day, it becomes more challenging to bring the hostages back home \u2013 the living for rehabilitation and the murdered for proper burial. The Israeli government must not waste another moment; it must return to the negotiating table today!\u201d Netanyahu\u00a0said Wednesday he is \u201chorrified by the video showing the abduction of our dear field observers.\u201d He said Israel will \u201ccontinue doing everything to bring them home\u201d and the \u201ccruelty of Hamas terrorists only enhances my determination to fight forcefully until the destruction of Hamas, to ensure that what we\u2019ve seen this evening will not happen ever again.\u201d War cabinet minister Benny Gantz said when he first watched the video it made his \u201cstomach turn.\u201d However, Gantz said, \u201cthe responsibility of leaders is not only to look reality in the eye \u2013 it is to create a different reality even when it comes to difficult decisions. And that is our responsibility.\u201d \u2018For the world to see\u2019 One of the women shown in the video, Ori Megidish, was\u00a0rescued by the IDF in a special operation\u00a023 days after being taken. Another, Noa Marciano, an IDF Corporal, was\u00a0killed while in Gaza\u00a0and her body was returned to Israel in November. But five of the seven \u2014 Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Daniela Gilboa, and Naama Levy \u2014 remain in captivity, more than seven months after being taken across the border. The mother of Naama Levy told CNN on Wednesday that bringing them home is not\u00a0a top priority of the Israeli government, saying some members of the government did not even watch the video. \u201cMinisters and\u00a0members of the government were asked to watch a version of this video in their meetings, and some of them refused and said we want to sleep OK at night,\u201d Ayelet Levy Shachar said, adding, \u201cSo if this is the reaction when it\u2019s their duty to watch these materials, this is their job, so they can make correct decisions, then we think that we should put it out there for our citizens, for the world to see.\u201d More than 100 hostages were freed during a release deal in November, but the IDF believes there are still around 130 people being held in Gaza. Efforts to reach a deal that would pause the war in Gaza and allow the release of hostages have repeatedly been dashed. Earlier this month, Hamas said Israel\u2019s rejection of a ceasefire plan submitted by mediators at negotiations in Cairo had sent hostage release talks back to \u201csquare one.\u201d The statement came a day after the latest round of Gaza truce and hostage deal talks ended in Cairo, without a deal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/middleeast/israel-idf-hostage-video-hamas-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_middleeast_palestinian-statehood-spain-norway-ireland-intl", "text": "Ireland, Spain and Norway have announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state next week, in a move that is likely to bolster the global Palestinian cause but further strain relations between Europe and Israel. The three European nations say their landmark decision is the best way to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, but it sparked swift condemnation from Israel, as its foreign minister ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors from those countries. Most of the world already recognizes Palestinian statehood. More than 140 out of 193 member states of the United Nations have made their recognition official. But only some nations in the 27-member European Union are among them. Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris told a Wednesday news conference in Dublin: \u201cToday, Ireland, Norway and Spain are announcing that we recognize the state of Palestine. Each of us will now undertake whatever national steps are necessary to give effect to that decision.\u201d \u201cThere is never a wrong time to do the right thing,\u201d Harris later said, speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiana Amanpour on Thursday. \u201cIt was my government\u2019s preferred position to recognize a two-state solution as part of a peace process to bring that about, but sadly, unfortunately, such a comprehensive peace settlement now seems, in many ways, further away than it has ever been,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe believe you can\u2019t say you\u2019re in favor of a two-state solution and not recognize the very existence of two states,\u201d he added. The recognition will come into force in all three countries on May 28, according to Irish Foreign Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. Norway\u2019s\u00a0Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said that a Palestinian state was \u201ca prerequisite for achieving peace in the Middle East.\u201d \u201cThere will be no peace in the Middle East without a two-state solution,\u201d St\u00f8re said in a statement. \u201cThere can be no two-state solution without a Palestinian state.\u201d Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez sought to characterize the decision as one that was not anti-Israel. \u201cThis recognition is not against the people of Israel and certainly not against the Jewish people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in favor of Hamas. It\u2019s in favor of co-existence.\u201d The announcement was welcomed by Palestinian officials. \u201cThis step reflects Spain\u2019s keenness to support the Palestinian people and their inalienable and legitimate rights to their land and homeland,\u201d the office of the president of the Palestinian Authority said in response to Madrid\u2019s decision, as reported by Palestinian news agency Wafa. Hamas, the militant group which governs Gaza, urged other countries to follow suit and \u201crecognize our legitimate national rights, support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence, and end the Zionist occupation of our land.\u201d But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said recognizing a Palestinian state would be a \u201creward for terror.\u201d \u201cThis will be a terror state, which will attempt to perpetrate the onslaught of October 7 time and again, and to that we shall not agree,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding, \u201cthis evil must not be given a state.\u201d As Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors to Spain, Norway and Ireland, he said, in a statement: \u201cI am sending a clear message today \u2014 Israel will not hold back against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security.\u201d \u201cAfter the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has seen, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state,\u201d Katz added. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza\u00a0on October 7\u00a0after militants led by Hamas killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israel has come under fierce criticism for its war. Earlier this month, a panel of independent UN experts condemned \u201cthe continued and systematic onslaught of violence committed against Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d The agency has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages taken by Hamas. Israeli attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza have since killed at least\u00a035,647\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a079,852\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures. Two-state solution All three European leaders stressed the importance of having Palestinian statehood in reaching a two-state solution in the Middle East, a decades-long goal that the international community has failed to achieve. Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister Martin said the decision came amid \u201cgrowing impatience\u201d with Israel\u2019s lack of political will for a two-state solution. \u201cThe integrity of that two-state solution has been undermined in recent years by the strategy of the Israeli government and, in particular, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has declared opposition to it,\u201d Martin told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest during a live interview. Meanwhile, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson that Israel was wrong to see recognizing Palestinian statehood as rewarding Hamas. \u201cWe are sending the opposite signal. We are supporting the Palestine authorities which spring out of the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] who renounce violence and who many decades ago promised to leave the violent struggle behind and work for peaceful settlement with Israel \u2014 a promise they have kept by the way,\u201d Eide said. Senior officials in the United States, a close ally of Israel, have insisted the only way to bring peace and stability to the region is through the creation of a Palestinian state with guarantees for Israel\u2019s security. Lawmakers in Israel have long rejected those calls. Reacting to the news on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesperson told CNN that US President Joe Biden \u201cis a strong supporter\u201d of a two-state solution. The spokesperson added, however: \u201cHe believes a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\u201d France, meanwhile, said that now is not the \u201cright time\u201d for it to join its European neighbors in recognizing a Palestinian state. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Stephane S\u00e9journe, added that such a decision is not merely a \u201csymbolic issue or a question of political positioning\u201d but rather a \u201cdiplomatic tool\u201d in the service of a two-state solution. Germany, another one of Israel\u2019s staunchest allies, also questioned the decision. Michael Roth, the chair of the parliament\u2019s\u00a0Foreign Affairs Committee, posted on X: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that the recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state is an appropriate measure after the horrific massacres (by) Hamas (on) October 7 last year.\u201d Qatar, a key mediator in stalled ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, said it hopes \u201cfor more countries to recognize the State of Palestine,\u201d according to a statement from the foreign ministry. The foreign ministry of Saudi Arabia, another regional actor, called on \u201cmore countries to swiftly take the same stance.\u201d Ireland has a long history of being openly supportive of the Palestinian cause, consistently criticizing Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank and Gaza before Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack in Israel. Since then, Israel\u2019s war in response has shredded huge parts of the Gaza Strip and drained critical supplies, exposing the entire population of more than 2.2 million people to the risk of famine. \u201cI can say this to the people of Israel: we recognize the state of Israel. We recognize the state of Israel\u2019s right to live in peace and security. That is their right. The people of Palestine also must have an equivalent right to peace and security,\u201d Harris told Amanpour on Thursday. \u201cAnd let me also say this to the people of Israel: the Irish people know what it\u2019s like to have their national identity hijacked by a terrorist organization. The IRA was never the people of Ireland and Hamas is not the people of Palestine.\u201d \u201cWe have been clear and unequivocal that we condemn Hamas, that we condemn the most horrific barbaric massacre that Israel experienced on the 7th\u00a0of October. We call for the unconditional and immediate release of all hostages. But it is entirely possible to say what I have just said and also say the next bit which sadly some refuse to say: that what is happening in Palestine, what is happening in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe, that children are being starved, are being deprived of food and that there are children who will go to sleep in Gaza tonight not sure if they will wake in the morning,\u201d he added. A source familiar with the matter told CNN the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently considering further diplomatic steps against the three countries. Steps under consideration include cancelling visits of officials from these countries to Israel and revoking visas from diplomats, which will limit their ability to visit areas in the West Bank under control of the Palestinian Authority, the source said. Another step under consideration by Israel is to reach out to the US to seek diplomatic support in providing clarification from Norway, Ireland and Spain on their intended decision, and to ask the US to try and convince other countries to not follow suit. Pressure on Israel The planned recognition adds pressure on Israel after seven months of fighting, according to H.A. Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies in London. \u201cFor individual Palestinians on the ground in the Occupied Territories, it\u2019s not going to mean anything at all in the short term, perhaps in the medium term,\u201d Hellyer told CNN. \u201cIt is obviously political recognition by states that don\u2019t have a presence on the ground.\u201d Hellyer added that Israel risks becoming an \u201cinternational pariah\u201d given that Western nations are now beginning to recognize a Palestinian state.  Israel captured Gaza from Egypt in the 1967 war, then withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005. The territory, home to some 2 million Palestinians, fell under Hamas\u2019 rule in 2007. After Hamas took control, Israel and Egypt imposed a strict siege on the territory, which is ongoing. Israel also maintains an air and naval blockade on Gaza. These severe restrictions have been fiercely criticized by international bodies, including Amnesty International,\u00a0who say\u00a0Israel has violated international law. The vast majority of the population in Gaza are descendants of 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were\u00a0forcibly expelled\u00a0from their homes during what Palestinians call\u00a0al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d of the 1948-49 war, in what is now Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/middleeast/palestinian-statehood-spain-norway-ireland-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_world_habitable-earth-sized-planet-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Two teams of scientists have discovered a theoretically habitable planet, smaller than Earth but bigger than Venus, orbiting a small star about 40 light-years away. The exoplanet, named Gliese 12b, orbits a cool red dwarf star situated in the constellation Pisces and is about 27% the size of our sun and 60% of its temperature, according to the two studies published on Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Since its star is so much smaller than the sun, Gliese 12b still falls within the habitable zone \u2014 the ideal distance away from a star where liquid water can exist \u2014 even though it completes its orbit every 12.8 days. Working on the assumption that the exoplanet doesn\u2019t have an atmosphere, scientists calculated its surface temperature to be around 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius). \u201cWe\u2019ve found the nearest, transiting, temperate, Earth-size world located to date,\u201d said Masayuki Kuzuhara, a project assistant professor at the Astrobiology Center in Tokyo and co-leader of one of the research teams with Akihiko Fukui, a project assistant professor at the University of Tokyo, in a statement. Once temperate Earth-size planets have been identified, scientists can then analyze them to determine which elements are contained in their atmospheres and, crucially, whether water is present to sustain life. \u201cThere\u2019s only a handful (of exoplanets) we\u2019ve found that are good candidates for that. And this is our nearest and so that\u2019s quite a major discovery,\u201d Larissa Palethorpe, a doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London who co-led the other study, told CNN on Friday. Understanding Gliese 12b To spot Gliese 12b, scientists used the publicly available data collected by NASA\u2019s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) \u2014 a telescope that stares at tens of thousands of stars every month, tracking their changes in brightness, which can be evidence of orbiting exoplanets. It is easier for astronomers to find exoplanets orbiting red dwarf stars since their relatively small size results in a greater dimming effect during each transit. At the moment, scientists are unsure exactly what constitutes this planet\u2019s atmosphere, whether it even has one and if water is present, though Palethorpe said they aren\u2019t expecting to find water there. \u201cThere could be no water, and then we know a runaway greenhouse effect has already happened on this planet and it\u2019s more like Venus,\u201d she said. \u201cThere could be water, in which case it\u2019s more like us\u2026 or there are signatures that can be detectable that would be able to show you that the runaway greenhouse effect is in progress so it could be losing water.\u201d For the next stage of analyzing the exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere, scientists are hoping to use the James Webb Space Telescope and conduct spectroscopy analysis. This method involves capturing starlight that shines through an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere and seeing which wavelengths are absorbed by certain molecules, revealing their presence in the atmosphere. As well as shedding light on the exoplanet itself, Palethorpe said scientists are hoping that this work can help us understand our own planet better. \u201cWhat this planet will teach us in particular is what happened for Earth to stay habitable but for Venus to not\u2026 It can tell us the habitability patheways that planets take as they develop,\u201d she said.

This initiative started on Thursday, comes as Djibouti, one of\u00a0Africa\u2019s smallest nations\u00a0with just over a million residents, grapples with a dramatic increase in malaria cases, skyrocketing\u00a0from just 27 in 2012 to\u00a0more than 70,000\u00a0in recent years, according to the WHO. The\u00a0health body attributes the spike\u00a0to the arrival of\u00a0Anopheles stephensi, an invasive Asian mosquito species that transmit the deadly disease. The\u00a0mosquito species has also been detected in Ethiopia and Somalia, Djibouti\u2019s neighbors in the Horn of Africa, posing a significant regional threat. Unlike most malaria-transmitting mosquitoes in Africa that breed in rural areas, Anopheles Stephensi thrives in urban environments, intensifying the public health challenge for predominantly urban Djibouti. \u201cThis mosquito poses a huge threat to our fight against malaria,\u201d said Grey Frandsen, CEO of US-owned biotechnology firm Oxitec, which developed the gene-modified mosquitoes released in Djibouti. \u201cAnopheles\u00a0stephensi\u00a0evade conventional tools, are resistant to insecticides and daytime-biters, reducing the efficacy of bed nets,\u201d he said. Djibouti health minister Ahmed Robleh Abdilleh told CNN that his nation was trying out the new technology developed by Oxitec and believes it could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d in reducing malaria spread. \u201cWe are in the pilot phase, but we believe in the technology. We are sure it will be the game changer,\u201d\u00a0Abdilleh\u00a0said. \u2018Using mosquitoes to fight mosquitoes\u2019 Dubbed a method that \u201cuses mosquitoes to fight mosquitoes\u201d, Oxitec\u2019s genetic technology targets female mosquitoes, which are predominantly responsible for malaria transmission. The technique involves releasing genetically engineered male mosquitoes into the wild, which then mate with females. The introduced gene prevents female offspring from surviving to adulthood, effectively reducing the population of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Male mosquitoes do not bite and therefore cannot transmit malaria. Frandsen said Oxitec\u2019s genetic technology, which is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has been effective in reducing other mosquito-borne viral diseases such as dengue fever in other parts of the world. \u201cOur technology is already proven to reduce populations of dengue-spreading Aedes aegypti\u00a0mosquitoes\u00a0by upwards of 95%\u00a0in urban communities in Brazil, and we are committed to delivering impact in urban communities in Djibouti and beyond,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe are still at the early stages of this program, but we\u2019re hopeful of the impact this can have in driving down malaria-spreading mosquitoes,\u201d he added. Although the rollout of genetically modified mosquitoes in Djibouti is only the second in Africa,\u00a0the idea is drawing more interest on the continent. In 2019, a team of scientists released Africa\u2019s pioneer batch of gene-modified mosquitoes to gather data on the potency of the technique in Burkina Faso where malaria is a leading cause of death. According to vector control research alliance, Target Malaria, the mosquitoes released in the west African country were\u00a0\u201cgenetically modified\u00a0to be sterile, so it can mate but cannot produce offspring.\u201d It added that an estimated 14,850 gene-modified male mosquitoes were released and 527 were recaptured. \u201cAfter recapturing them, the researchers found that the genetically modified mosquitoes were less mobile than their non-transgenic siblings and had lower survival rates,\u201d the alliance said of its findings, adding that a\u00a0second trial phase was being planned in the country. Uganda\u2019s President Yoweri Museveni announced in early January that his country is partnering with Oxitec to combat malaria. Africa bears the brunt of the global malaria burden, accounting for 96% of malaria deaths worldwide in 2021, according to the World Health Organization.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/africa/djibouti-releases-gene-modified-mosquitoes-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_weather_memorial-day-weekend-forecast", "text": "(CNN) \u2013 The National Weather Service has issued a tornado watch for parts of three states, labeling it a \u201cparticularly dangerous situation,\u201d a rare designation indicating the possibility of exceptionally strong storms. The tornado watch covers parts of northern Texas, much of central Oklahoma and south-central Kansas. It will expire at 11 p.m. CT. The watch calls for several tornadoes \u2013 a few intense ones likely \u2013 over an area that includes cities such as Wichita, Kansas, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, according to the Storm Prediction Center. This is a special kind of tornado watch issued only when there\u2019s unusually high confidence in the potential of multiple at least EF2-strength and long-lived tornadoes in the area, according to the National Weather Service. Another tornado watch was added to portions of Kansas until 1 a.m. CT, affecting half a million people, according to the Storm Prediction Center. More than 4.5 million Americans were under tornado watches Saturday evening. The supercell thunderstorms firing up in the watch area will also be capable of extremely large hail up to the size of grapefruits and damaging wind gusts to 80 mph. An EF4 tornado \u2013 the third such violent tornado this year \u2013 killed at least four people in Greenfield, Iowa, Tuesday and left parts of the city in ruin. More strong tornadoes \u2013 at least EF2-strength \u2013 are possible Saturday in parts of the Plains and Sunday in portions of the Midwest. Some tornadoes Saturday could be particularly violent and exceed EF4-strength, the Storm Prediction Center warned Friday. Supercell thunderstorms that began firing up Saturday could be capable of producing a couple tornadoes, scattered large hail up to the size of softballs and damaging wind gusts to 70 mph, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Dangerous storms are expected to rumble to life in the evening in parts of western Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. Storms will expand in both scope and strength in the evening and overnight and move east into the Mississippi Valley. A Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place Saturday for a large swath of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Wichita, and far western Missouri. \u201cViolent tornadoes, extreme hail and corridors of widespread wind damage\u201d are most likely within this area, according to the SPC, but could extend beyond it. Anywhere from Texas through Nebraska to the Mississippi Valley could encounter storms unloading strong wind gusts, hail and tornadoes. Robust thunderstorms will continue over parts of the Mississippi Valley through Sunday morning before gradually losing their strength. But a new round of damaging storms is expected to arrive quickly after. Thunderstorms will develop over portions of the Midwest by Sunday afternoon and develop farther south and east through the evening and overnight hours. Powerful storms could ultimately stretch from the Great Lakes to the South Sunday night. Damaging wind gusts and hail will be the main hazards with any severe thunderstorm Sunday, but some could produce tornadoes. At this time, the greatest tornado threat is in parts of the Midwest, especially during the afternoon and evening. The travel hubs of Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Nashville could have to contend with damaging storms, leading to delayed or cancelled flights. Thunderstorm activity will likely continue for Memorial Day Monday and could disrupt outdoor plans and travel for a large part of the East. Some of these thunderstorms could become severe, but it\u2019s not yet clear how widespread the threat will be. Even in the absence of damaging wind gusts, hail or tornadoes, lightning is a serious threat for any outdoor plans like picnics, pool parties or beach trips. Unofficial start of summer will officially feel like summer Meanwhile, dangerous storms and searing heat will\u00a0continue affecting vast portions of the United States this Memorial Day weekend and could disrupt outdoor plans and travel. A near-record number of people will travel this weekend in what could be the busiest period in nearly two decades, according to AAA. Travelers will have to contend with a hazardous and disruptive multi-day severe thunderstorm event with damaging winds, dangerous hail and strong tornadoes. It is expected to unfold this weekend in portions of the central, southern and eastern US. Severe weather has been unrelenting in May, but hit an even more\u00a0frenetic pace\u00a0this week. Nearly 850 wind damage reports and at least 80 tornado reports have occurred across the US since Sunday. While severe storms pound inland areas this weekend, some coastal areas will face a different threat. A heaping serving of summerlike heat is on the menu as many head to the beach to celebrate the unofficial start of summer. It\u2019s already been record hot in parts of the South this month, especially in South Texas and South Florida, the type of extreme heat made more likely by human-caused climate change. Record heat will expand over the weekend and jeopardize daily high temperature records in jeopardy from Texas through the Southeast as air temperatures soar well into the 90s. Houston, New Orleans, Miami, Mobile, Alabama, Tampa, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, are just a few cities along the Gulf and southeast Atlantic coasts where it\u2019ll feel more like July than late May through Memorial Day. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could approach triple-digits along the southern tier of the US, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. For those out in the heat, it\u2019s important to stay hydrated and be vigilant for signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Heat index values skyrocketed well into the 100s this week in southern Texas and could climb higher into seriously dangerous territory through Monday. The heat index is expected to max out between 110 and 120 degrees in southern Texas, including in Corpus Christi and Laredo, according to the National Weather Service.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/weather/memorial-day-weekend-forecast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 1989 \u201cStudy for Portrait of Jos\u00e9 Capelo\u201d is the fourth painting to be recovered of the group, which is estimated to be worth a combined \u20ac25 million. In February, police arrested two people accused of the receipt of stolen artworks in the Spanish capital, leading them to ultimately discover the painting at a property in Madrid. Since the investigation began, 16 people believed to have masterminded and carried out the robbery have been arrested, police said in a statement. Three of the paintings were\u00a0recovered in 2017. Police said they continue to investigate Spanish citizens with links to organized groups from Eastern Europe in the hope it will lead them to the fifth painting. According to local media, the paintings were stolen from the apartment of Jos\u00e9 Capelo, Bacon\u2019s friend and former lover, although police would not confirm or deny that information. Dublin-born Bacon, who died in Madrid in 1992, was one of the most acclaimed artists of the 20th century, known for his disturbing vision of the human body.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

In the videos, horse-mounted police and water cannons can be seen in Tel Aviv\u2019s Democracy Square attempting to disperse crowds refusing to leave, resulting in violent clashes. At a separate protest, police said they arrested two people \u201cfor disorderly conduct\u201d after they allegedly left the approved demonstration site at the Kaplan intersection, headed to the Azrieli intersection and \u201clit fires and began to break the order, not obeying the police\u2019s instructions.\u201d \u201cA police officer declared the demonstration illegal and warned that if they did not disperse the police would be forced to use measures,\u201d police added in a statement. The clashes followed anti-government protest marches that took place in several cities across Israel, calling for the release of hostages taken during Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on Israel on Oct 7, and for a general election. Around 250 people\u00a0were taken hostage during\u00a0Hamas\u2019 surprise October 7 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli officials. Since then, Israel\u2019s retaliatory war on Hamas in Gaza has killed\u00a0more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. Many of the protesters in the streets of Tel Aviv, Haifa, Rehovot and beyond on Saturday took aim at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing his government of corruption and criticizing his handling of the war against Hamas. Families of current and past hostages also held a rally calling for an immediate resumption of negotiations with Hamas to \u201cadvance a deal that will bring them all back.\u201d Israel\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) believes 125 hostages are still being held in Gaza, following the release deal in November that freed more than 100.

{"id": "2024_05_22_africa_south-africa-elections-explained-intl", "text": "South Africans go to the polls on May 29 for what will likely be the most pivotal general election since the end of apartheid. Polls show the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party could lose its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led the party to power in 1994. While polling can be challenging in South Africa, most analysts believe that the ANC faces its stiffest challenge yet with a population deeply frustrated by the country\u2019s direction. This is the seventh general election South Africa has held since the end of white minority rule 30 years ago. A record 27.79 million people are registered to vote \u2013 the highest number to date, according to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC.) The slide in popularity mirrors the challenges of liberation movements that have transitioned into governing parties across the continent. What could happen? If support for the ANC drops below 50% for the first time, the party will be forced to enter into a coalition government. A loss of a simple majority would put significant pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa within his party, as he promised a \u201cnew dawn\u201d when he took over leadership in 2018 from disgraced former president Jacob Zuma. Support for the ANC has been on a slow downward trend over the decades but at the last election in 2019 it dropped below 60% for the first time, with the party earning 57.50% of the vote. What\u2019s gone wrong for the ANC? South Africans have a lot to grumble about. Violent crime is on the rise. Murder is at a 20-year high; with someone killed in the country roughly every 20 minutes, according to the most recent quarterly police crime statistics. Many have lost faith in the police as part of a larger breakdown in trust in government. The Rainbow Nation has the highest sustained rate of unemployment in the world \u2013 and it\u2019s growing.Meanwhile, rolling electricity blackouts, water outages, a crisis in education, and a lack of service delivery all weigh on the population. But high on the list of issues are the allegations of corruption and mismanagement that continue to damage the ANC. When Ramaphosa \u2013 Mandela\u2019s favorite to succeed him as leader \u2013 replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma as president, he pledged \u201cto work very hard not to disappoint the people of South Africa.\u201d But in 2022, Ramaphosa was himself forced to deny stealing money. \u201cCorruption has wounded our democracy and shaken people\u2019s faith in our institutions,\u201d he admitted in a November speech. \u201cIf corruption is not arrested, the greatest damage will not be in the funds stolen, the jobs lost, or the services not delivered. The greatest damage will be to the belief in democracy itself,\u201d he added. This year South Africa received its lowest score on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index. The index scores countries from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). South Africa received 41 \u2013 worse than China and Cuba at 42. What are the other key parties? The country\u2019s main opposition party, the centrist Democratic Alliance (DA), is led by John Steenhuisen and is seen by many as a party for White South Africans. For this election, the DA has formed a coalition bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. If the polls are to be believed, the ANC may have to make the choice between forming a coalition with the Zuma-backed party \u2013 uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) \u2013 and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) or the DA. Steenhuisen, for his part, has not ruled out going into coalition with the ANC if it were to keep the EFF and MK out of government. The EFF is a populist far-left party led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema. It began as a splinter party of the ANC and espouses expropriation of land without compensation and sweeping state nationalism. The EFF has shown support for the MK party and Malema recently said that he intends to \u201cgive the EFF vote to the ANC\u201d if it doesn\u2019t get 50% \u2013 on the condition that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, becomes Minister of Finance. Steenhuisen has described an ANC-EFF-MK pact as a \u201cdoomsday coalition.\u201d Talking of Zuma\u2026 The former president continues to be a thorn in Ramaphosa\u2019s side. After a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court after failing to appear before a corruption inquiry, the 82-year-old is now the leader of the MK party \u2013 and was up until this week top of their parliamentary list. The country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled Monday he is not eligible to run for parliament\u00a0until five years have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. The unanimous ruling capped months-long speculation and legal wrangling on whether he could stand for the country\u2019s top legislative body. His party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Zuma had been campaigning against what he perceives as Ramaphosa\u2019s failures and disillusioned ANC voters were lapping it up, according to polls. An April poll by the Johannesburg-based Social Research Foundation poll found the ANC may get 37% of the vote, while MK may garner 13%. However, the most recent polling from the same foundation puts support for the MK party at 10.5% and\u00a0the ANC at 44.8% on Monday.\u00a0This suggests the ANC may be winning back support and may only need a small coalition partner.  When will we know the final result? The final election results will be announced on Sunday 2 June, the IEC said. However, projections should give a sense of the result a day or two after polls close and the final result could be announced sooner if vote counting is completed earlier.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/africa/south-africa-elections-explained-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_asia_wwii-submarine-wreck-uss-harder-found-philippines-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "The wreck of one of the most storied US Navy submarines of World War II has been found in the South China Sea eight decades after its last patrol, the Navy\u2019s History and Heritage Command said Thursday. The USS Harder lies under 3,000 feet (about 900 meters) of water off the northern Philippine island of Luzon, sitting upright and intact except for damage behind its conning tower from a Japanese depth charge, the NHHC said in a press release. Harder was lost in battle on August 24, 1944, along with its entire crew of 79 submariners, while on its sixth patrol of the war, as the US sought to retake the Philippines from occupying Japanese forces. \u201cHarder was lost in the course of victory. We must not forget that victory has a price, as does freedom,\u201d NHHC Director Samuel J. Cox, a retired US Navy admiral, said in the press release. According to a US Navy history, Harder sank two Japanese escort ships off the Bataan Peninsula on August 22, 1944, and then headed north along the Luzon coast with two other subs in search of more targets. In a battle with Japanese escort ship CD-22 on the morning of August 24, Harder fired three torpedoes that missed and was later sunk by the Japanese ship\u2019s fifth depth charge attack, according to Japanese records cited by NHHC. The NHHC said the wreck of the Harder was confirmed by data provided by the Lost 52 Project, an effort led by Tim Taylor, CEO of Tiburon Subsea, to find the 52 US subs lost in World War II. The group has previously located at least six WWII subs, the NHHC said. \u201cWe are grateful that Lost 52 has given us the opportunity to once again honor the valor of the crew of the \u2018Hit \u2018em Harder\u2019 submarine,\u201d the NHHC\u2019s Cox said, in reference to the vessel\u2019s motto. The NHHC said the wreck is \u201cthe final resting place of Sailors that gave their life in defense of the nation and should be respected by all parties as a war grave.\u201d The Philippines was a US territory attacked by Japan just after its strike on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. By the spring of 1942, US and Philippine forces on Luzon surrendered to Tokyo\u2019s forces and Japan used the captured archipelago to protect its supply lines from the East Indies and Southeast Asia. But by mid-1944, the US was rolling back Japanese gains across the Pacific, and was planning landings to do the same in the Philippines. Harder,  which had the motto of \u201cHit \u2018em Harder,\u201d was captained by Cmdr. Samuel Dealey, who would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, the US military\u2019s highest decoration, for his actions in Harder\u2019s fifth patrol, from March to July 1944. During that time Harder sank three Japanese destroyers with another two likely destroyed or heavily damaged over the course of just four days, according to the National Medal of Honor Museum. The museum\u2019s page on Dealey described one particularly harrowing encounter. Coming under attack from a Japanese destroyer, Dealey ordered a head-on torpedo shot at the bow of the charging enemy, known as a \u201cdown the throat\u201d shot, according to the museum account. \u201cAt 1,500 yards, Dealey fired three torpedoes and ordered the sub to dive.\u00a0\u00a0As the\u00a0Harder\u00a0passed 80 feet underneath the destroyer, two of the torpedoes struck the ship, sending shock waves through the submarine.\u201d On its first four patrols after commissioning on December 2, 1942, Harder sank 14 Japanese warships and merchant vessels, according to the Medal of Honor Museum.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/asia/wwii-submarine-wreck-uss-harder-found-philippines-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Mon\u00e9gasque driver led from start to finish, crossing the finish-line over seven seconds ahead of second-placed Oscar Piastri. Ferrari\u2019s Leclerc paid an emotional tribute to his late father after the race, telling broadcaster Sky Sports that he was thinking about him as he drove towards the finish. \u201cHe has given everything for me to be here and it was a dream of ours for me to race here and win here, so it\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d he said. Leclerc also had to survive a dramatic opening lap in which a fifth of the field crashed, causing the race to be red-flagged before a lengthy delay, during which marshals cleared debris off the track and rebuilt sections of the barriers. The chaos began when Ferrari\u2019s Carlos Sainz punctured just after the start following contact with Piastri and had to use a run-off. Then, in a separate incident, Kevin Magnussen clipped Sergio P\u00e9rez while trying to overtake him and the Red Bull driver bounced along the walls, his car crumbling and shedding debris all over the track, before coming to a stop in a crumpled heap with just one tire left.

{"id": "2024_05_23_asia_china-taiwan-drills-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Tensions are once again ratcheting up in the Taiwan Strait, with China launching two days of military drills encircling Taiwan just days after the democracy swore in a new leader long loathed by Beijing. The exercises began early Thursday, in what China described as \u201cpunishment\u201d for \u201cseparatist acts\u201d \u2013 alluding to the election and inauguration of the self-governing island\u2019s new President Lai Ching-te. China\u2019s military says the drills are designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power\u201d over Taiwan. Though relations between the two sides have been steadily worsening in recent years, this latest escalation marks a significant test for Taiwan\u2019s new leader, whose ruling party has championed democracy in the face of growing threats\u00a0from its authoritarian neighbor. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.\u00a0And it has become much more bellicose under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Here\u2019s what you need to know. What\u2019s happening with the drills? The Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) said it launched joint military drills involving the army, navy, air force and rocket force in areas around Taiwan early\u00a0Thursday morning. The drills are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 a narrow body of water separating the self-ruling island from mainland China \u2013 as well as north, south and east of Taiwan. They are also taking place in areas around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off China\u2019s southeastern coast, the command said in a statement. Naval Colonel Li Xi, spokesperson for the command, called the exercises \u201ca strong punishment for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces and a serious warning against interference and provocation by external forces.\u201d As part of the drills on Thursday, dozens of Chinese fighter jets carrying live ammunition conducted mock strikes against \u201chigh-value military targets\u201d of the \u201cenemy\u201d alongside destroyers, frigates and missile speedboats, according to China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV. On Friday, the Eastern Theater Command said it was continuing the drills on both sides of the Taiwan island chain to \u201ctest the ability to jointly seize power, launch joint attacks and occupy key areas.\u201d CCTV aired\u00a0footage that shows PLA soldiers moving mobile artillery and missile systems into position, though it did not show any live fire. China\u2019s military drills are often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally. Chinese state media heavily covered the drills while the military also posted footage on social media. The exercises subsequently went viral on China\u2019s heavily regulated internet. How has Taiwan reacted? Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had dispatched sea, air and ground forces to respond to China\u2019s drills. It expressed regret at \u201csuch irrational provocations and actions that undermine regional peace and stability.\u201d Taiwan has also been closely monitoring China\u2019s warplanes and naval ships that came close to the island. Between 6 a.m. Thursday and 6 a.m. Friday, the ministry detected 49 Chinese aircraft, 19 warships and seven coast guard vessels. The island\u2019s presidential office said in a statement that it was \u201cconfident and capable of defending national security,\u201d accusing China of \u201cusing unilateral military provocation to threaten Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom.\u201d But despite Beijing\u2019s large show of force, life continued as normal in Taiwan, whose 23 million people have become used to China\u2019s military threats, even as they become more regular and prominent in recent years. \u201cWe are not scared of the Chinese Communist Party, and we have confidence,\u201d\u00a0an 88-year-old retiree, who gave his surname Liu, told CNN. \u201cIf the Chinese Communist Party does attack Taiwan, it won\u2019t be easy for them to take Taiwan. Taiwanese people are not afraid of war.\u201d What triggered this? The most obvious answer is Lai\u2019s inauguration on Monday. Lai\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), now in power for a historic third term, views Taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation with a distinct Taiwanese identity. Ahead of Taiwan\u2019s elections back in January, Beijing had warned that a Lai victory could inflame tensions and spark conflict \u2013 repeatedly framing the vote as a choice between \u201cpeace and war.\u201d Taiwanese voters dismissed those warnings, returning the DPP to power \u2013 although two opposition parties that favor closer ties with China now have a majority in parliament. China\u2019s government and state media regularly rebuke Lai, calling him a dangerous separatist, \u201ctroublemaker\u201d and \u201cwar maker,\u201d while rejecting his repeated offers of talks. Their vehement dislike of Lai is rooted in his political past, as well as Beijing\u2019s refusal to deal directly with a huge swathe of Taiwan\u2019s leaders. The 64-year-old former doctor and political veteran was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence \u2013 a red line for Beijing. His views have tempered over the years, and he now says he favors the status quo, saying there is \u201cno plan or need\u201d to declare independence since the island is \u201calready an independent sovereign country.\u201d But Beijing has never forgiven him for those early comments \u2013 making its stance clear with the drills on Thursday. Lai, too, has set the tone for his new administration\u2019s approach to China \u2013 using his inaugural speech on Monday to declare that a \u201cglorious era of Taiwan\u2019s democracy has arrived,\u201d and reiterating a determination to defend its sovereignty. He also called on Beijing to cease its \u201cintimidation\u201d of Taiwan and respect that its people want to decide their own destiny. What\u2019s the relationship between China and Taiwan? The Chinese Civil War ended with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) taking power in the mainland, establishing the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in Beijing in 1949. The defeated Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan, moving the seat of their Republic of China (ROC) government from the mainland to Taipei. Both proclaimed themselves the sole rightful government of the entire Chinese territory. In recent years, Taiwan has downplayed its territorial claims over mainland China, and is today a vibrant democracy, with its own military, currency, constitution and elected government. But it is not recognized as an independent country by most governments in the world.\u00a0Over the decades it has become increasingly isolated, with a number of governments switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.\u00a0But unofficial diplomatic ties with many Western nations have in fact been bolstered in recent years, in part thanks to China\u2019s saber-rattling. Meanwhile, under Xi, China has become increasingly assertive in foreign policy and grown more authoritarian at home. China has cut official communication with Taiwan since the DPP took office in 2016, and has ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure on the island. At the same time, ties between Taipei and Washington have become more robust, with increased arms sales and high-level political engagement under Lai\u2019s popular predecessor Tsai Ing-wen. This has infuriated Beijing, spurring it to unleash more pressure on Taiwan and sending cross-strait relations on a downward spiral. Where does the US stand in this? The US formally switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 \u2013 but has long trod a delicate middle path. In what is known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, Washington recognizes the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China; it also acknowledges Beijing\u2019s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never accepted the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s claim of sovereignty over the island. The US maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan, which have been strengthened in recent years. It is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and supplies it with defensive weaponry. American lawmakers regularly visit Taiwan and have supported legislation to bolster US support for the island and its defensive capabilities. But it has historically remained deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in case of a Chinese invasion, a policy known as \u201cstrategic ambiguity.\u201d After the election in January, the US sent a bipartisan delegation to Taiwan, where they met with Lai and Tsai \u2013 and promised that American support for\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0will continue no matter who wins the upcoming US election. Beijing on Tuesday also announced sanctions against former US House Representative Mike Gallagher, who led that delegation, citing his \u201cremarks and actions\u201d that \u201cinterfere\u201d in China\u2019s internal affairs.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/asia/china-taiwan-drills-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Starliner\u2019s first flight carrying astronauts is now expected to lift off no earlier than June 1 at 12:25 p.m. ET, with several backup opportunities in the days following, according to a statement from NASA late Wednesday. \u201cMission managers from NASA, Boeing, and ULA (United Launch Alliance) continue to evaluate a path forward toward launching the agency\u2019s Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station,\u201d the space agency said in the statement. The update comes after several previous delays this month, and a week after Starliner mission teams\u00a0reported a small helium leak\u00a0in the service module of the spacecraft. They traced the leak to a part called a flange on a single reaction control system thruster, where helium is used to allow the thrusters to fire. Last week, NASA announced that teams were aiming to launch no earlier than May 25, saying the additional time before launch would give specialists more time to evaluate the issue. The agency said tests have found that the leak doesn\u2019t pose a threat to the mission. However, while studying the leak, mission teams also spotted a \u201cdesign vulnerability\u201d in the propulsion system \u2014 essentially identifying a remote scenario in which certain thrusters might fail as the vehicle was leaving Earth\u2019s orbit, without a backup method of getting home safely. NASA and Boeing have since worked with the vendor of the thruster to come up with a backup way to perform the deorbit burn, should that situation arise, said Steve Stich, manager of NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program, in a Friday news conference. \u201cWe have restored that redundancy for the backup capability in a very remote set of failures for the direct burn,\u201d Stich said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a (Delta-Agency\u00a0Flight\u00a0Test\u00a0Readiness Review) on May 29 to review both the leak and the changes to the way we would execute a deorbit burn in a remote set of failures.\u201d This mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing\u2019s spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. The historic crewed flight was about two hours from liftoff on May 6 when it was scrubbed due to\u00a0an issue with the a valve\u00a0on the second stage, or upper portion, of the Atlas V rocket that Starliner will ride to space. The NASA astronauts set to crew the mission for a weeklong stay at the International Space Station, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, returned to Houston on May 10 to spend time with their families, Boeing said last week. They remain in pre-flight quarantine and continue to practice in Starliner simulators, the space agency said.  Boeing\u2019s historic goals The Crew Flight Test is a decade in the making \u2014 the culmination of Boeing\u2019s efforts to develop a spacecraft worthy of ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station under NASA\u2019s commercial program. The launch would mark only the sixth maiden voyage of a crewed spacecraft in US history, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted in a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIt started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX\u2019s) Dragon \u2014 and now Starliner,\u201d he said. On board, Williams will also make history as the first woman to embark on such a mission. Boeing designed the Starliner to rival SpaceX\u2019s prolific Crew Dragon capsule and expand US options for ferrying astronauts to the space station. A rocky start Development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner\u2019s path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing\u2019s rival under NASA\u2019s commercial crew program \u2014 SpaceX \u2014 has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency\u2019s astronauts. Williams and Wilmore were already in their seats aboard the Starliner capsule May 6 when engineers found an issue and halted the launch. The United Launch Alliance team,\u00a0which builds the Atlas V rocket, identified a pressure regulation valve on a liquid oxygen tank that needed replacing.\u00a0The valve has since been replaced, but the latest issue with the helium leak on the Boeing spacecraft that sits atop the rocket caused\u00a0further delay. \u201cThere has been a great deal of exceptional analysis and testing over the last two weeks by the joint NASA, Boeing, and ULA teams to replace the Centaur Self Regulating Valve and troubleshoot the Starliner Service Module helium manifold leak,\u201d\u00a0Stich said. \u201cIt has been important that we take our time to understand all the complexities of each issue including the redundant capabilities of the Starliner propulsion system and any implications to our Interim Human Rating Certification,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will launch Butch and Suni on this test mission after the entire community has reviewed the teams progress and flight rationale at the upcoming Delta Agency Flight Test Readiness Review.\u201d If the spacecraft does launch next week as planned, it and the astronauts inside will break away from the Atlas V rocket after reaching orbit, as Starliner begins firing its own engines. The vehicle will likely spend more than 24 hours gradually making its way to the space station. Williams and Wilmore are set to spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board, while the Starliner remains docked outside. The history-making crew will then return home aboard the same Starliner capsule, which is expected to parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/world/boeing-starliner-crewed-launch-delayed-indefinitely-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

At the same time, Rivers State Governor Siminalayi Fubara has highlighted the state\u2019s efforts to create a more vibrant, investment-friendly environment, aiming to reassure investors of the requisite return on their investments. Located in the Niger Delta region, Rivers State is a key oil-producing area in Nigeria. It hosts several major oil companies and boasts several oil wells. Despite its vast oil wealth, the region has faced oil theft and sabotage over the years and suffers from a high unemployment rate. Building an investor\u2019s paradise However, Fubara emphasized that his administration is taking measures to re-industrialize the state and bring back numerous production factories that had shut down operations. During the two-day Rivers State Economic and Investment Summit (RSEIS), themed \u201cRivers Emerge: Advancing Pathways to Economic Growth and Sustainability,\u201d held at the Dr. Obi Wali International Conference Centre in Port Harcourt, Sanusi delivered a keynote address where he called for better management of the state\u2019s resources. \u201cWith rich abundant land, abundant resources, and natural resources, as well as the strategic location of the state, Rivers can be one of the best investors paradises, not just in Nigeria but in West Africa if the right things can be done,\u201d Sanusi said. The Emir of Kano stressed that a prosperous future relies on the capacity of state institutions and the quality and skills of its population. He drew comparisons with countries like Japan, Singapore, Germany, Australia, and Rwanda, which have thrived without significant natural resources, attributing their success to good governance, innovation, and education. Fubara highlighted the various measures taken to make Rivers State a destination for all categories of investors. \u201cWe have already implemented certain policy initiatives and reforms, including the prompt allocation and issuance of land titles and certificates of occupancy to prospective investors and a moratorium on State taxes and levies on new businesses. We are also working on the harmonization of state and local government taxes to eliminate double taxation and the imposition of multiple levies on investors,\u201d he said. Fubara also announced a N4 billion (over $2.7 million)\u00a0matching fund loan scheme with the Bank of Industry Limited for small, micro, and medium-scale businesses to drive financial inclusion and enhance the growth and development of these businesses. \u2018Oil is not a curse, the curse is the leaders\u2019 Sanusi pointed out that while countries like Russia, the UAE, and Norway have benefitted from their natural resources, their success also hinges on visionary governance and strong institutions. He argued that resources can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on leadership. \u201cOil is not a curse; the curse is the leaders we have had,\u201d he said. Fubara detailed further initiatives, including providing hundreds of hectares of land for projects like a multi-billion-naira aluminum rolling mill and collaborations with international firms to develop the state\u2019s agricultural potential. He emphasized the importance of reviving abandoned agricultural projects and infrastructure, saying he would set aside about $10 million for these efforts this fiscal year. Governor Fubara highlighted the investment opportunities across diverse sectors, including oil and gas, agriculture, manufacturing, hospitality, tourism, education, ICT, healthcare, infrastructure development, glass products, garments production, and power generation and transmission. With over 40% of fertile cultivable landmass, Rivers State has the potential to significantly contribute to national food security through commercial investments in mechanized agriculture and agro-processing industrial value chains, he said. In his keynote address, former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Moghalu, said that due to the prevalence of poor governance in Nigeria, the abundant human and natural resources in the country have not been sufficiently harnessed to achieve the desired prosperity. He particularly advocated for the implementation of well-meaning policies to dismantle barriers to doing business while promoting transparency and building investor confidence. Moghalu added that, alongside developing requisite skills among the people and building enduring critical infrastructure, the foundation for good and competent governance should be assured to make the foreign direct investment (FDI) sought truly beneficial to the country. Sanusi concluded by highlighting the importance of investing in human capital and creating an education system that meets contemporary labor market demands. He called for an end to corruption in the judiciary, sensible tax policies, and the development of a skilled workforce to reduce dependence on foreign expertise. He urged Rivers State to aspire beyond being a recipient of federal allocations to becoming a commercial and industrial hub where citizens enjoy a decent standard of living.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/africa/nigerias-rivers-state-investor-magnet-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads", "text": "The Federal Communications Commission is taking initial steps toward new rules that could require political ads on TV and radio to include disclaimers about the use of artificial intelligence. On Wednesday, FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel called on other agency commissioners to support such regulations amid growing fears that AI-generated deepfakes could disrupt elections. \u201cAs artificial intelligence tools become more accessible, the Commission wants to make sure consumers are fully informed when the technology is used,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a news release.\u00a0\u201cToday, I\u2019ve shared with my colleagues a proposal that makes clear consumers have a right to know when AI tools are being used in the political ads they see, and I hope they swiftly act on this issue.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s proposal aims to open a rulemaking process at the FCC that would likely take months to play out. The proposal calls for new rules governing broadcast TV and radio, as well as cable and satellite providers. Under the proposed rules, political advertisers on those mediums would have to make on-air disclosures if their ads contain AI-generated content. The FCC does not regulate internet-based media such as streaming video services or social media. As part of the proposed rule, political advertisers would also have to provide written disclosures in the files that broadcasters are\u00a0required to make available\u00a0to the public. The FCC move seeks to fill\u00a0a yawning gap\u00a0in the regulation of artificial intelligence in political advertising. Existing US election law prohibits campaigns from \u201cfraudulently misrepresenting other candidates or political parties,\u201d but whether this prohibition extends to AI-generated content is an open question. Last summer,\u00a0Republicans on the Federal Election Commission blocked\u00a0a move that could have made clear the law extended to AI-created depictions; the FEC has since agreed to revive the discussion, but it has not reached a decision on the matter. In the meantime, some US lawmakers have proposed legislation that could clamp down on AI in elections. In March, a bipartisan proposal by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski unveiled the\u00a0AI Transparency in Elections Act, which could require AI disclaimers on political ads. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, has stressed the urgent need for Congress to create guardrails for artificial intelligence, particularly for elections. Last week, he and a bipartisan group of senators\u00a0released a blueprint\u00a0for legislative action. But many\u00a0policy analysts doubt\u00a0that Congress can pass meaningful AI legislation during an election year. Online platforms such as Meta have taken their own steps to address AI in political ads,\u00a0requiring campaigns\u00a0to disclose the use of deepfakes and banning the use of its\u00a0in-house generative AI tools\u00a0for political advertising.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_middleeast_israel-isolation-deepens-icj-gaza-rafah-analysis-intl", "text": "It\u2019s been a tumultuous month for Israel. Never before has the Jewish state come under such intense and sustained international pressure from multiple fronts for its policies towards the Palestinians. This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined the ranks of world leaders branded as international pariahs when he became the target of the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against him and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant for suspicion of war crimes and crimes against humanity during Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The court has previously sought warrants against the likes of Sudan\u2019s Omar Al Bashir, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Libya\u2019s Moammar Gadhafi. And on Friday, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, saying the humanitarian situation there is \u201cdisastrous\u201d and expected to \u201cintensify further.\u201d Seven months after Hamas attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, Israel\u2019s retaliatory war has failed to achieve its goals. Top Hamas leaders remain at large and 125 hostages remain captive in the enclave. Gaza is now in ruins and more than 35,000 Palestinians have died during Israel\u2019s onslaught. Pressure on Israel to end the war is mounting from all sides: US college campuses, international courts, American celebrities, Israel\u2019s Western allies, and even the families of the Israeli hostages. But the most significant of those may be the legal and diplomatic action taken against Israel this month. Israeli officials are scrambling to contain the fallout. They have accused critics of antisemitism and vowed not to relent in the face of international pressure. \u201cEven if Israel is forced to stand alone, we will stand alone, and we will continue to strike our enemies powerfully until victory,\u201d Netanyahu declared in a fiery speech at the opening ceremony of Holocaust Remembrance Day this month. Palestinian statehood For years, Israeli officials have opposed unilateral recognitions of Palestinian statehood, fearing it would enable the Palestinians to bring Israel before international courts and weaken its position in future peace negotiations. The Palestinians have therefore failed to gain full membership at the United Nations due to objections from the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally and primary defender on the world stage. However, a non-binding vote at the UN General Assembly on May 10 showed overwhelming international support for an independent Palestinian state, leaving the US and a few of Israel\u2019s allies isolated. Israel and the US maintain that a Palestinian state should only be established through a negotiated settlement. But as Israel continues to reject the prospect of Palestinian independence, some states have chosen to act independently. This week, Ireland, Spain and Norway\u00a0announced\u00a0plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state, saying they hope the move would prod other European nations to follow suit. \u201cWe live in a time in world history where doing the bare minimum is both heroic and insufficient. That is why we cannot stop,\u201d Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda D\u00edaz said in a video posted on her X page. \u201cPalestine will be free from the river to the sea,\u201d she added, using a pro-Palestinian protest slogan that Israel says calls for its destruction, a charge rejected by those who use it. The move prompted swift condemnation from Israel, which recalled its ambassadors from all three countries. Aside from international efforts to end the war, Netanyahu is also under intense pressure domestically to strike a deal with Hamas to bring back the hostages. With hostage-ceasefire talks stalled, relatives of the captives are pressing the prime minister to return to negotiation. This week, the families of seven female Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas released graphic footage of their abduction to pile pressure on the government to secure their release. But there were signs that the talks may resume. On Thursday, the Israeli war cabinet directed the country\u2019s negotiating team to resume talks, without saying when they\u2019ll take place, and CIA Director Bill Burns has traveled to Europe to try to get the deal back on track, a US official told CNN, adding that the Israelis are \u201cvery engaged.\u201d Quandary for Israel\u2019s allies The cases brought before the ICJ and ICC have tested Western states\u2019 commitment to the rules-based international order as they struggle to navigate the increasing legal actions against their ally in these courts. This has created a rift between Israel\u2019s Western allies and a growing coalition of Global South countries spanning Asia, Africa, and South America that are increasingly vocal in their calls for Israel to be held accountable for its actions in Gaza. In a recent case at the ICJ, Germany was compelled to defend its arms sales to Israel against allegations of \u201cfacilitating genocide\u201d brought by Nicaragua. Despite the pressure, the court rejected the demand for an immediate halt to Germany\u2019s arms exports to Israel. Meanwhile, the ICC\u2019s decision to pursue arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant has divided Israel\u2019s Western allies. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Karim Khan, the ICC\u2019s prosecutor, recounted a conversation with a senior leader who remarked: \u201cThis court is built for Africa and for thugs like Putin,\u201d underscoring the complexities surrounding international legal proceedings. While the US and the United Kingdom have denounced the move, European nations such as France, Germany, and others have affirmed the independence of the court and have not ruled out the possibility of arresting Israeli officials if they enter their territory following the issuance of a warrant. The court is also\u00a0pursuing warrants against three top Hamas officials: Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Mohammed Deif. A panel of judges at the ICC is still deliberating on whether to issue these warrants. The response to the warrant request has been particularly fierce in the US Congress, where a bipartisan effort to penalize the ICC is underway, potentially including sanctions.\u00a0US Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to work with Congress on legislation to penalize the ICC. \u201cIf they do this to Israel, we\u2019re next,\u201d Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has led the efforts against the ICC in Congress, told a Senate hearing this week \u2013 a reminder that however much pressure Israel is under, it still has one very powerful friend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/middleeast/israel-isolation-deepens-icj-gaza-rafah-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Alejandra Rodriguez made headlines across the world in April when she was crowned Miss Buenos Aires, becoming the first sexagenarian to win a contest organized by the Miss Universe franchise.

Just under 109 million people across broad swaths of the US were under threat of large hail, damaging winds and a fierce twisters Sunday, mainly throughout the mid-Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee River valleys. As the storms move east, the Storm Prediction Center warned of \u201cviolent tornadoes, extreme hail and corridors of widespread wind damage.\u201d The 108th running of the Indianapolis 500 began on Sunday afternoon about four hours later than expected due to extreme weather delays that interrupted pre-race festivities. President Joe Biden has been briefed on the storms. Meanwhile, as severe weather continued to unfold across parts of the US, a heightened tornado watch designated as a rare \u201cparticularly dangerous situation\u201d calling for \u201cseveral tornadoes and few intense likely\u201d went into effect on Sunday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. The watch covers parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee \u2013 including in St. Louis and Jefferson City, Missouri; Paducah, Kentucky; and Carbondale, Illinois \u2013 and impacts 4.7 million people. This is a special kind of tornado watch issued only when there\u2019s unusually high confidence in the potential of multiple at least EF2-strength and long-lived tornadoes in the area, according to the National Weather Service. The supercell thunderstorms firing up in the watch area will also be capable of large hail bigger than the size of baseballs and damaging wind gusts to 75 mph. \u201cIntense supercell thunderstorms will continue to develop across the watch area through this evening. Several tornadoes are likely, some of which are expected to be intense. Very large hail is also likely, along with the risk for potentially significant damaging wind gusts,\u201d says the Storm Prediction Center. A tornado watch was issued Sunday evening for more than 3 million people living in parts of Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky until 1 a.m. CT. The Storm Prediction Center warned of several possible tornadoes with hail larger than baseballs and widespread wind gusts up to 85 mph likely.

Electrical substations were downed and the city of Claremore was left with no operating gas systems, Claremore City Manager John Feary said. Among the injured, 19 were transported to hospitals, three with potentially critical or life-threatening injuries, Feary said. Survey teams from the National Weather Service found severe damage Sunday in Claremore, giving the tornado a preliminary rating of EF3. EF3 tornadoes pack winds of 136 to 165 mph. The damage was found north of Highway 20, east of Claremore. Inside a Shell gas station in northeast Texas, 60 to 80 people were trapped until the storm blew over, Sappington said. Multiple injuries were reported at the station, but none were life-threatening, he added. Many vehicles were damaged and destroyed, leaving about 40 people stranded. They were transported by bus to another gas station in Gainesville, where they were picked up by family members. In north Denton County, a possible tornado injured an unknown number of people, damaged several homes, overturned 18-wheelers, downed trees and knocked out power lines on Saturday night, authorities said early Sunday. \u201cMultiple victims\u201d were reported in Ray Roberts after severe weather struck the area overnight, city of Denton fire officials\u00a0said. Damage to several homes was also reported in the neighboring city of Celina, where officials said the city was affected by \u201capparent\u00a0tornadic activity\u201d on Saturday. The National Weather Service office in Fort Worth issued several tornado warnings for multiple North Texas cities late Saturday night, telling residents to seek shelter immediately as a tornado was seen heading east between Valley View and Sanger around 10:40 p.m. Lake Ray Roberts Marina\u00a0in the city of Sanger in Denton County sustained damage to boats, boat houses and the fuel dock by the severe weather Saturday night. Despite reports of people rescued after being trapped in overturned RVs, there are no reports of serious injuries. \u201cThere is so much damage, we don\u2019t even know where to start,\u201d the marina said in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0Sunday morning. \u201cWe know the boat houses are heavily damaged, all have lost walkways, and most boats are damaged,\u201d the post said. \u201cWe lost our fuel dock and offices along with our dock cat, Ginger.\u201d A survey team with the National Weather Service in Dallas found that a tornado of at least a preliminary rating of EF2 strength struck Valley View in northern Texas with estimated maximum winds of 135 mph. The team also said damage found in south Montague County was consistent with an EF2 tornado and estimated maximum winds of 125 mph. This tornado was just south of Forestburg. Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday signed a disaster declaration for four additional counties \u2013 Denton, Collin, Cooke and Montague \u2013 bringing the total to 106 counties. \u201cI saw the harrowing video inside the Valley View gas station as the tornado passed through with the people stockpiled in their clinging to safety,\u201d Abbott said at a news conference, adding that it\u2019s a \u201cmiracle\u201d everyone made it out alive. At least 100 people have been injured in Texas, said Abbott, who referred to the deaths as a \u201cheart-wrenching loss of life.\u201d In Bentonville, Arkansas, were working to respond to power outages and emergency medical calls on Sunday, according to Mayor Stephanie Orman. \u201cWe have crews mobilized throughout the city. We have power lines, down \u2013 about 10,000 probably out with power. We\u2019ve got trees across roads, we\u2019re really encouraging individuals to stay off the roads as we tried to clean up those road systems. We also have signals down,\u201d Orman said. \u201cWe have had over 20 EMS calls and so those are currently being worked.\u201d Across state lines, damage was also reported throughout Rogers County, Oklahoma, after a possible tornado swept the area, downing power lines and trees and damaging homes. As damaged areas recover, storms move east More than 500,000 customers across nine states were without power by Sunday evening, including more than 170,000 outages in Kentucky alone, according to the tracking website\u00a0poweroutage.us. A new tornado watch impacting 1.5 million people was issued Sunday for parts of Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma until 9 p.m. CT that includes Springfield, Branson, and Joplin in Missouri, as well as Fayetteville, Arkansas. Supercell thunderstorms could produce a couple tornadoes, scattered large hail up to the size of tennis balls and damaging wind gusts to 70 mph, according to the Storm Prediction Center. There is a Level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys into Monday morning, and EF2 to EF5 tornadoes and wind gusts of 74 mph are possible, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Storms will move\u00a0toward the East Coast on Monday, bringing disruptive high winds and large hail from DC through the Southeast. The travel hubs of Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Nashville could have to contend with damaging storms, leading to delayed or canceled flights. The potential for heavy rain over parts of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, middle Mississippi Valley, and Central Appalachians prompted the slight risk, Level 2 of 4, of excessive rainfall in those regions through Monday morning. Louisville, Kentucky; Cincinnati; St. Louis; Nashville and Indianapolis are among the cities included in the Level 3 threat. Record-breaking heat possible for some The unofficial start of summer is also ushering in sweltering heat, reaching potentially record high temperatures for parts of the US on Monday. Houston; New Orleans; Miami; Mobile, Alabama, Tampa, Florida; and Charleston, South Carolina, are among locations where warm weather will feel more like July than late May through the holiday weekend. A subtropical upper-level high over Mexico will help spawn excessive heat warnings and heat advisories over southern Texas through Monday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cThe ridging will create a dangerous early-season heat wave over south Texas and southern Florida,\u201d according to the center. Daily high temperatures and heat index reading exceeding 115 are possible in some areas, the Storm Prediction Center noted. Those spending time outdoors or who are dealing with a loss of power should drink enough water, dress in lightweight clothing and locate cooling centers if necessary.

{"id": "2024_05_24_middleeast_israel-icj-gaza-rafah-south-africa-ruling-intl", "text": "The United Nations\u2019 top court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, further increasing international pressure on Israel over its war against Hamas. \u201cIsrael must immediately halt its military offensive and any other action in Rafah which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part,\u201d Judge Nawaf Salam, president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), said on Friday. The court considers the humanitarian situation in Rafah to be classified as \u201cdisastrous,\u201d he said, adding that UN officials have indicated that the situation was set to \u201cintensify even further\u201d if the Israeli operation in Rafah continues. Israel began a limited ground offensive in Rafah on May 7, defying calls from the international community, including the United States, not to proceed. More than a million Palestinians were taking shelter in Rafah before Israel started its operation, but the court noted that around 800,000 have since been displaced. Upon entering Rafah, the military\u00a0seized the city\u2019s border crossing\u00a0with Egypt, which has remained shut since. The crossing was a vital entry point for humanitarian aid. The court ordered Israel to open the Rafah crossing for humanitarian assistance and said it had found that the evacuation and living conditions provided by Israel are not \u201csufficient to alleviate the immense risk, which the Palestinian population is exposed\u201d to.  Rulings by the court are final and binding, but the ICJ doesn\u2019t have a mechanism to enforce them, and they have been ignored in the past. Israeli officials have condemned the ICJ\u2019s ruling. Yair Lapid, leader of Israel\u2019s opposition party Yesh Atid, said that \u201cthe fact that the ICJ did not even directly connect the end of the military operation in Rafah to the release of the hostages and to Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against terror is an abject moral failure.\u201d Naftali Bennett, who was the 13th\u00a0Prime Minister of Israel, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201cThe International Court of Justice just provided every terror organization on earth with THE PERFECT METHOD TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER.\u201d Hamas welcomed the order in a statement, but said it had expected it would be for the entire Gaza Strip, emphasizing that the situations in Jabalya and other cities are equally dire and warrant similar attention. South Africa filed an urgent request on May 10 for additional measures against Israel, accusing it of using forced\u00a0evacuation orders\u00a0in the southern Gaza city of Rafah to \u201cendanger rather than protect civilian life.\u201d The request was part of a larger case brought by Pretoria against Israel in which South Africa accuses Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians during the seven-month-long conflict. Israel\u2019s Deputy Attorney General for International Law Gilad Noam denied the allegations in his opening remarks at the ICJ last week and asked the court to \u201crespect the predicament\u201d Israel is in. Two interpretations Following the ruling, a joint statement by the Israel\u2019s National Security Council and Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that Israel \u201chas not carried out and will not carry out military activity in the Rafah area that creates living conditions that could lead to the destruction of the Palestinian civilian population.\u201d In response to other orders by the ICJ, including keeping the Rafah crossing open, the statement said that Israel will \u201ccontinue its efforts to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip\u201d and \u201creduce as much as possible the harm to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip.\u201d Eliav Lieblich, a professor of international law at Tel Aviv University, told CNN that the text of the ruling had some ambiguity. \u201cThe order can be understood in two ways: either that Israel has to halt the offensive in Rafah; or specifically components that may lead to conditions of life that could bring physical destruction,\u201d he said. What is clear, however, is that in the eyes of the court, \u201cthe operation cannot continue in the same way, because it found that as it is now the situation is a risk to the rights protected by the (genocide) Convention,\u201d Lieblich said, adding that it is hard to tell whether Israel will comply with the ruling. \u201cI\u00a0hope that it doesn\u2019t argue that the order means that nothing has to change, because that clearly isn\u2019t the case,\u201d he added. The development comes as Israel faces mounting international and domestic pressure to end the war in Gaza. This week, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), a separate court in The Hague, sought arrest warrants for Hamas leaders as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. Families of Israeli hostages held in the territory also stepped up pressure on Netanyahu to bring the captives home, releasing graphic footage of female members of the Israel Defense Forces before they were abducted. Unclear how US will respond It is unclear how the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally, will respond to the ICJ\u2019s order. The Biden administration has spoken out strongly against the genocide case against Israel, but it has repeatedly warned Israel that Washington will not support a major ground offensive in Rafah unless it sees a credible plan to ensure the safety of civilians. This month, the US halted arms shipments to Israel for the first time out of fear that they could be used in Rafah to harm civilians. In an interview with CNN, US President Joe Biden acknowledged that American bombs had been used to kill civilians in Gaza, in a stark recognition of the US\u2019 role in the war. The US is Israel\u2019s biggest weapons supplier. The move by the ICJ is likely to add to mounting pressure on Israel to scale down its war in Gaza, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that his country will defend itself even if \u201cforced to stand alone.\u201d Israel says that Rafah is the last bastion of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that led an attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. Israel\u2019s subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 people, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 pressure The international pressure facing Israel is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN. \u201cBecause this war is unprecedented, and the way Israel conducts the war is unprecedented.\u201d While there has always been criticism of some of Israel\u2019s actions, such as the expansion of settlements, \u201cthis is on a different scale, a different universe altogether,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current Israeli government does its best to make Israel a pariah state.\u201d The ruling could also undermine Israel\u2019s own judiciary, according to Neve Gordon, professor of human rights law at Queen Mary University of London. In response to the ICC\u2019s decision to seek arrest warrants against top Israeli officials, Israel\u2019s Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and State Attorney Amit Aisman were cited by the Times of Israel as backing the Israeli military and said the judicial system is capable of handling such cases. \u201c(The) ruling would serve yet another blow to Israel\u2019s judicial system, and particularly the attorney general and the Supreme Court, since the subtext would be that it is not doing its job in ensuring that Israel abide by international law,\u201d said Gordon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/middleeast/israel-icj-gaza-rafah-south-africa-ruling-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_style_and-just-like-that-carrie-bradshaw-fashion-lotw", "text": "Carrie Bradshaw, the lead character played by Sarah Jessica Parker in the 1998-2004 TV series \u201cSex and the City,\u201d has always been more of a fashion daredevil than a fashion darling. From the time she wore a floating belt fastened across her bare midriff (season 4 episode 15) to the cowboy hat, python-print bandeau and striped sarong (season 2, episode 17), Parker\u2019s on-screen persona has never shied away from making a bold style statement. Bradshaw\u2019s sartorial abandon has long been part of her quirky allure. The Instagram account, @everyoutfitonsatc, has provided a diligent digital archive of the character\u2019s best looks for its 746,000 followers. Many of the early SATC outfits documented are met with pure adoration by a throng of Carrie apologists ready to jump to her defense in the comments, even for the more visually challenging ensembles. \u201cThis is one of my favorite Carrie looks! Something only she could\u2019ve pulled off,\u201d wrote one fan under an image of Bradshaw in a clashing neon pink and green Betsy Johnson tulle dress \u2014 complete with abstract printed leggings. \u201cShe\u2019d look fabulous wearing anything.\u201d But since the launch of the series reboot \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026\u201d in 2021, Bradshaw\u2019s wacky wardrobe has drawn more criticism than kudos. (HBO and Max, which airs \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026,\u201d are also owned by CNN\u2019s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) As filming for the show\u2019s third season continues around New York City, Bradshaw has so far been spotted in ensembles including wearing a sheer, rose-stuffed frock from the Irish designer Simone Rocha (pictured above), as well as a vintage color-blocked Ossie Clark dress and an oversize floppy Maryam Keyhani gingham sun hat. These looks have seemingly fallen flat with some viewers of the show. \u201cDefinitely too much,\u201d read one critique under @everyoutfitonsatc\u2019s post of Jessica Parker in the latter look. \u201cThis was not Carrie\u2019s style\u2026 This is trash,\u201d read another. (Commentary surrounding the Simone Rocha-designed look was somewhat kinder, however, with dedicated followers of Bradshaw\u2019s fashions showing appreciation for the nod to the character\u2019s love of florals \u2014 and a visible bra. So was the response to the first new look Jessica Parker was spotted in while filming in recent weeks: A pair of prissy vintage pastel separates from YSL and Ralph Lauren respectively.) The departure of Patricia Field, longtime stylist on \u201cSex and the City,\u201d has given some sartorially-minded viewers of \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026\u201d a scapegoat for their grumblings. But Field plowed her own absurdist furrow when curating her characters\u2019 wardrobes (and beyond). \u201cFollowing fashion trends? It\u2019s a waste,\u201d she told The Guardian in February. \u201cTo me, fashion is a cousin of art. And like art, originality is what counts. When it starts to feel intimidating, it\u2019s time to change.\u201d It\u2019s an instinct that the show\u2019s current stylists, Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago, have honored with Bradshaw\u2019s melting pot of patterns and silhouettes \u2014 but one that has gone under appreciated. So has Bradshaw\u2019s style really changed, or have we? Are audiences less tolerant towards an off-beat dresser in her late 50s, when compared to one in her 30s? It seems like a ripe topic for the character\u2019s newspaper column, and one Jessica Parker has thoughts on too. \u201cThere\u2019s so much misogynist chatter in response to us that would never. Happen. About. A. Man,\u201d the actor told Vogue in 2021. \u201cEspecially on social media. Everyone has something to say.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/style/and-just-like-that-carrie-bradshaw-fashion-lotw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_middleeast_raisi-funeral-analysis-intl", "text": "From his days as a clerical student, to overseeing executions as part of the judiciary, Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s life has been intimately tied with Iran\u2019s tumultuous modern history. Yet after all that, his presidency was notably unremarkable. Unlike previous Iranian presidents, Raisi seemed content to serve as an empty vessel that carried out the reactionary policies of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,\u00a0the final arbiter on policymaking. He showed none of the subtle pushback of his predecessor, the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani. He also lacked the charisma of conservative former presidents who were happy to do Khamenei\u2019s bidding\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as the firebrand Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but who sought to carve out autonomy for the position of the presidency. So, when foreign dignitaries from a whopping 68 countries gathered for Raisi\u2019s funeral on Thursday, they may not have been preoccupied with thoughts of the late president. This was not a game-changing death like the 2020 assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, the military mastermind credited with creating a strategic stranglehold over much of the Middle East and helping to put the US on the backfoot. Raisi\u2019s absence, in contrast, is unlikely to be felt. Yet his untimely death could hardly have come at a more pivotal time for Iran. \u201cForeign dignitaries will be trying to get a read of the country,\u201d Washington-based Iran analyst and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute Trita Parsi told CNN. \u201cThis is also an opportunity for many of them to manifest how their relationship with Iran has changed.\u201d Iran is deeply enmeshed in the war in Gaza, with Tehran-back armed groups engaged in a low rumbling tit for tat with Israel and its allies across four different countries. In April, it launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel from its territory after an apparent Israeli airstrike on Tehran\u2019s consulate in Damascus. In this fraught moment for the region, leaders from Turkey to India and China \u2013 many of which declared days of national mourning for the late president \u2013 appear keen not to ruffle feathers. The deaths also come after years of diplomatic efforts to achieve a rapprochement with former regional nemeses, such as\u00a0Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,\u00a0both of which were represented at the funeral. Qatar\u2019s emir, as well the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait attended the funeral. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who the International Criminal Court is seeking an arrest warrant for alongside Israeli leaders, was also in attendance. Tens of thousands flocked to the streets to mark the funeral, throwing flowers at the coffins. It was a strong show of support for the regime, and a demonstration of its powerbase. Iran\u2019s populace is deeply polarized, but the regime showed that it could still mobilize a critical mass. Iran today seems not to be the pariah state that former US President Donald Trump almost turned it into in 2018 when he pulled out of a landmark Obama-era nuclear deal that exchanged sanctions relief for curbs to Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cThis (funeral) is a way for countries to show the progress they have made in repairing relations with Iran,\u201d said Parsi. \u201cWe have missed how Iran\u2019s relations in the region have gone through a significant transformation.\u201d Foreign dignitaries are likely engaged in sideline chats to try to get a read on Khamenei\u2019s opaque and sometimes unpredictable thinking on domestic policy\u00a0that could have repercussions for the region. Constitutionally, a presidential election must be held within 50 days of the demise of a sitting president. That is a relatively short time to prepare for a race charged with consequence for Iran\u2019s theocratic leadership. The election will have ramifications for the question of the succession plans of the ailing 85-year-old Khamenei, who is only the second Supreme Leader to rule the Islamic Republic. Moreover, the race can\u00a0either appease or, conversely, fuel the tensions brought on by\u00a0the\u00a0youth-led\u00a0nationwide uprising that rocked the country less than two years ago. Khamenei has ultimate sway over elections through the country\u2019s Guardian Council, which consists of jurists appointed by the Supreme Leader, and which is tasked with vetting election candidates. In the 2021 presidential election, the council disqualified most viable candidates besides Raisi, paving a clear path to his presidency. The race was widely seen as heavily engineered and produced a record low voter turnout. The leader may orchestrate a repeat of that race. He could also decide to change tack, opening it up so that Iran\u2019s next president enjoys broad popular support. \u201cThe election can be a watershed moment for Iran,\u201d Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran analyst and editor of\u00a0Amwaj.media,\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson. \u201c(Khamenei) has a golden opportunity to reverse course in a face-saving way, make a U-turn, open up the space and allow people to run.\u201d During his tenure, Raisi made only feeble attempts to dispel the notion of him as a fig leaf president. He was widely criticized for presiding over the hollowing out of what remains of Iran\u2019s institutions. Legislative elections this March had a record low turnout of 41%.\u00a0The 2022 nationwide uprising posed the biggest domestic threat to the regime in decades. Since the brutal crushing of those protests, the bridge between the regime and its young and largely disgruntled population has grown ever wider. \u201cKhamenei has put the Islamic Republic on a path in which it will only be able to remain in power by increasing repression,\u201d said Parsi. Choosing to open up the election may appease the country\u2019s frustrated young population buckling under continued economic and political strains. That may set Iran on a course to stabilize its restive domestic situation. It may also pave a path for a more Western-friendly administration like that of Rouhani, which presided over the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, albeit within the confines set by Khamenei. Yet analysts say this remains wishful thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see why Khamenei would change course at this point. It would necessitate that he recognizes that he is on a path that is not good for him, but that\u2019s not the conclusion the regime has come to,\u201d said Parsi. \u201cBecause of the succession (of the Supreme Leadership), the regime wants the status quo. They\u2019re going to choose a direction that keeps everything as-is.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/middleeast/raisi-funeral-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Young adults will be able to choose between spending one weekend a month volunteering over the course of a year, or take up one of 30,000 spaces to spend a year in the armed forces, Sunak said. The announcement followed Labour Party leader Keir Starmer\u2019s comments on Saturday that he was in favour of allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote. Sunak\u2019s Conservatives\u00a0lag Labour\u00a0by a wide margin in opinion polls, which have shown little change in fortunes for the prime minister since his surprise election call last Wednesday. \u201cBritain today faces a future that is more dangerous and more divided. There\u2019s no doubt that our democratic values are under threat. That is why we will introduce a bold new model of national service for 18-year-olds,\u201d Sunak said in a statement. The Conservative Party said the proposal would be funded by cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion, and by diverting money from the\u00a0UK\u00a0Shared Prosperity Fund, which existed to reduce regional economic inequality. Labour politicians derided the announcement. \u201cThe national service we need from our young people is to vote for change on July 4,\u201d said Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester. Interior minister James Cleverly told broadcasters there would be no criminal sanctions for skipping mandatory service but that people will be compelled to do it, without providing further details. Asked by the BBC if forcing adults to volunteer was at odds with the Conservative Party\u2019s liberal tradition, Cleverly said: \u201cWe force people to do things all the time.\u201d He cited compulsory education or training for teenagers until the age of 18 as an example.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/europe/national-service-britain-uk-sunak-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_uk_us-embassy-london-congestion-fees-scli-intl", "text": "The US embassy in London is refusing to pay more than $18.6 million in charges from unpaid congestion fees, according to Transport for London (TfL), which oversees the city\u2019s vast transport network. The congestion charge was introduced in 2003 in order to stem traffic and pollution in central London. Drivers within the congestion charge zone are required to pay a $19 daily charge between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays and 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. on weekends. TfL says it will pursue all unpaid fees and said in a statement it is even \u201cpushing for the matter to be taken up at the International Court of Justice.\u201d The US embassy has declined to pay up and is claiming diplomatic immunity from the fines. \u201cIn accordance with international law as reflected in the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, our position is that the Congestion Charge is a tax from which diplomatic missions are exempt,\u201d\u00a0a US embassy spokesperson said. \u201cOur long-standing position is shared by many other diplomatic missions in London,\u201d the spokesperson added. However, TfL is insisting that in agreement with the UK government, London\u2019s congestion charge constitutes a service and not tax. \u201cThis means that diplomats are not exempt from paying it.\u201d It has also politely declared there to be a \u201cstubborn minority\u201d of embassies that do not pay the charge, despite \u201crepresentations through diplomatic channels,\u201d and posted a lengthy list of offenders. As of December 31, 2023, a total of 161 embassies, high commissions and consulates owed more than $182 million combined in unpaid congestion charge fees, according to TfL data. According to TfL\u2019s figures, the Japanese embassy owes the second highest amount from unpaid congestion charge fees, at around $12.8 million.  This not the first time a dispute has emerged over whether the US embassy should pay the charge. In July 2005, the embassy issued a diplomatic note, claiming the charge \u201cis a tax that cannot be lawfully imposed on the U.S. Government, its diplomatic and consular personnel, or its military force.\u201d While the embassy initially paid the charge, it stopped doing so on July 12, 2005, declaring the charge to be \u201cin tension\u201d with \u201cduties owed to foreign missions and diplomats.\u201d In 2020, then UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said British officials held \u201cmeetings with a number of diplomatic missions and international organisations\u201d to press for \u201cpayment of outstanding fines and debt,\u201d including \u201cunpaid congestion charge\u201d fees. The Japanese embassy told CNN \u201cthe Government of Japan is of the view that the charge corresponds to neither \u2018dues and taxes\u2026 such as represent payment for specific services rendered\u2019 nor \u2018charges levied for specific services rendered\u2019, as stipulated in the relevant international conventions, and therefore the Embassy, its diplomatic agents and their family members should be exempt from the charge.\u201d The UK Foreign Office said that diplomats are expected to pay the charge, adding that they believe there are no legal grounds for diplomatic exemptions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/uk/us-embassy-london-congestion-fees-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_summer-2024-air-travel-hurdles", "text": "If you\u2019re expecting to take to the skies this summer, you should also expect lots and lots and lots of companionship. And a few hurdles, too. Memorial Day weekend, the traditional launching pad of the summer travel season, is shaping up to set a scorching pace. The Federal Aviation Administration has forecast the holiday to be its busiest in 14 years. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 18 million passengers and crew between Thursday and Wednesday \u2013 up more than 6% over last year.\u00a0TSA says it\u2019s prepared for its busiest summer ever. American Airlines and United Airlines are both expecting about 10% more passengers over the holiday weekend than last year. United is expecting the biggest Memorial Day and summer travel season in the airline\u2019s 98-year history, according to Andrew Nocella, United\u2019s executive vice president and chief commercial officer. When it comes to navigating the flocks of fellow flyers, don\u2019t look for much of an ease-up after Memorial Day weekend. US airlines are predicted to carry 271 million passengers around the world from June 1 to August 31, according to industry trade organization Airlines for America. That\u2019s a 6.3% increase from last summer, and a new record for US airlines. To meet the higher demand, Airlines for America said that US carriers will offer more than 26,000 scheduled flights a day \u2013 up nearly 1,400 a day from summer 2023. While US airlines have staffed up and the TSA says it\u2019s ready for the summer crush, an air traffic controller crunch, hot weather and crowded airports could bring flight disruptions and pain points. Air traffic controller shortage Despite a surge in hiring last year, air\u202ftraffic\u202fcontrol stations nationwide are still about 3,000 controllers short, according to new FAA numbers. The numbers show the challenge of filling the gap that led to flight delays and concerns that fatigue contributed to a series of near collisions on runways last year. The current understaffing means controllers at many facilities are regularly working overtime to cover gaps. The shortage is a concern of\u202fairlines, controllers and watchdogs alike. Scott Keyes, founder of travel site\u00a0Going,\u00a0said that because of the way air traffic control maps are divvied up, airports in New York City metro area and in Florida have a slightly higher chance of being affected by air traffic control issues. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t, you know, not take that trip to New York or to Miami because of air traffic control,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN Travel. People flying in and out of those markets should try to get early morning flights and nonstop flights to help minimize problems if they come up. \u201cI was flying to New York a couple days ago and my flight to New York got delayed by four hours,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cIt was a pain in the butt \u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong. But that just meant I arrived in New York four hours later. \u201cIf I had had a connection in Chicago and my flight was delayed by four hours, I would have missed that connection. And then it\u2019s a much more hairy situation.\u201d Hot weather and hurricanes Much of the United States is looking at varying probabilities of having higher temperatures than the average for summer \u2013 especially in the Northeast and desert Southwest. Extreme heat can do more than make you feel miserable. It also affects airlines\u2019 abilities to carry out normal schedules, according to a report from Embry\u2011Riddle Aeronautical University. \u201cHot air is thin air. While this reduces the lift on which planes rely for takeoff, the main impact is felt on engine thrust. Aircraft engines will produce less thrust during takeoff and ascent as a result,\u201d said Bob Thomas, assistant professor of aeronautical science.\u00a0\u201cThe only way to make a takeoff possible on shorter runways would be to lower the weight of the aircraft.\u201d He said airlines generally reduce weight by removing baggage or passengers, especially as temperatures reach the triple digits. Cancellations are even possible. The report suggested trying to book early morning and late evening flights when you expect to fly in hot weather zones. Experts also warn that as the effects of climate change increase, passengers can expect longer periods of turbulence during flights in coming years. Says one professor of atmospheric science: \u201cThe seat belt sign will be switched on a lot more.\u201d And if you haven\u2019t heard, meteorologists warn we\u2019re phasing out of an El Ni\u00f1o cycle in the equatorial Pacific (with warmer waters) and phasing into a La Ni\u00f1a period (with cooler waters). And La Ni\u00f1a can sometimes generate increased hurricane activity along the US Gulf and Atlantic coasts. In fact, forecasters predict a \u201chyperactive Atlantic hurricane season\u201d with eight to 13 hurricanes. They think four to seven of them could reach at least a strength of Category 3, which have sustained winds of 111 to 129 mph. (The hurricane scale goes up to Category 5, which has sustained winds of 157 mph or more.) Bottom line, especially as summer progresses into peak hurricane season: Keep your eye on the forecasts if you\u2019re scheduled to fly. Crowded airports Passengers will need to pay attention to their ground game this summer, said Keyes. \u201cHere\u2019s how I put it: Airports are going to be extremely full. Airplanes are only gonna be pretty full.\u201d Keyes said new plane deliveries and additional flights will ease the load factor. \u201cThere\u2019s about 10 to 15 percent more capacity this year than there was a year ago. And \u2026 more seats mean there\u2019s going to be more elbow room for folks this summer even during the busy travel season.\u201d That won\u2019t help in the crowded airports, though. He has a couple of tips to mitigate that. First, get TSA PreCheck and/or Fast Track so you can at least bypass possible security line bottlenecks. Secondly, Keyes says he likes to find a quieter, more restful pocket of the airport away from his gate in which to hang out before his flight. He downloads the airline\u2019s mobile app, which notifies him just before boarding is about to start. Silver lining for flyers For those flyers who must carefully consider every dollar they spend, they could find the summer of 2024 to be a less expensive one than last year. Travel site Kayak reports that summer fares should be lower. For US domestic flyers, fares should drop an average of 13% compared with 2023. Mexico is seeing an even bigger drop with fares averaging 16% less. And if Australia is a dream trip of yours, those fares are falling an average of 14% (though the average price is $1,509, Kayak says). For people scared off from Europe last summer by the crowds and high prices, Keyes had some good news. \u201cI think a lot of that pent-up demand [from the pandemic] has been exhausted. I think you\u2019re going to see higher supply, lower demand and cheaper fares to Europe this summer as a result.\u201d Kayak is showing a 7% dip in Europe fares compared with last summer. While hardly typical, Keyes said he\u2019s recently spotted some round-trip mega-bargains that were almost nonexistent last summer: Paris for $570, Iceland for $475 and Dublin for $457.

{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall", "text": "Microsoft\u2019s buzziest new AI feature is raising concerns that it could potentially be misused in the wrong hands. This week, the company showed off a new tool called Recall for Windows computers that acts as a personal \u201ctime machine,\u201d allowing users to quickly pull up anything that\u2019s ever been on screen, such as documents, images and websites. It\u2019s different from a keyword search; the tool regularly saves screenshots of the user\u2019s screen and stores them directly on the device. It then uses AI to process the data and make it searchable. For example, if someone previously searched for a green dress or the name of a local ice cream shop, they can ask the feature to \u201crecall\u201d anything in their history that was shown on screen. Although so-called semantic search is a big step forward for AI, it comes at a time when the industry is moving so quickly and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Jen Golbeck \u2013 a professor of AI at the University of Maryland who focuses on privacy\u00a0\u2013 said the recall feature could pose a potential \u201cnightmare\u201d if the device falls into the wrong hands. \u201cStuff may stay on your device, but that doesn\u2019t mean people can\u2019t get to it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou won\u2019t have an option to protect yourself even if you use incognito mode or clear your history because the tool has access to everything that\u2019s been on your screen.\u201d The UK\u2019s independent regulator for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), told CNN it is investigating the tool \u201cto understand the safeguards in place to protect user privacy.\u201d \u201cWe expect organisations to be transparent with users about how their data is being used and only process personal data to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a specific purpose,\u201d the ICO said in a statement. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CEO Satya Nadella told The Wall Street Journal in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s launch that web searches must only be done on Microsoft\u2019s Edge web browser and that the screenshots never leave the user\u2019s computer. \u201cYou have to put two things together: This is my computer and this is my Recall \u2013 and it\u2019s all being done locally,\u201d he said. Geoff Blaber, CEO of market research firm CCS Insight, said that makes the issue less concerning. \u201cThe backlash by some to this feature isn\u2019t surprising, but it\u2019s an overreaction given that the data stays exclusively on the device and the user has full control,\u201d Blaber said. Someone can decide whether to turn the feature on during the device setup process and can customize and blacklist which apps and websites Recall can access. \u201cThese controls suggest the feature has been built with security and privacy at its core,\u201d he said. \u201cRecall won\u2019t appeal to everyone but the utility provided is likely to be significant.\u201d Potential for malicious uses But Golbeck cited times when that protection might not be enough, such as a journalist in a hostile country, a person trying to get out of an abusive relationship, someone searching for sensitive medical information or an employee whose boss wants to track them. She believes issues around the tool will likely impact the workplace the most. \u201cWe know jobs monitor what we\u2019re doing on their devices, but a lot of people will do a personal thing on their work computer and all of that will be archived and visible to an IT department, even if it just stays on device,\u201d she added. Golbeck said technology, despite the benefits, is too often developed without the consideration of malicious uses. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the last 15 years is every single one of those potential malicious use cases comes to fruition in some way or another,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will want to use this cool feature without understanding the privacy risk \u2013 that there will be a permanent record of everything you do.\u201d Similar reactions to features such as biometric passwords, such as fingerprints, facial recognition and iris scans, have emerged in the past. Blaber said to overcome some of the initial concerns, Microsoft and its partners will need to prove the value, security and privacy of the product in the real world. Still, Michela Menting, a senior research director at ABI Research, believes the feature is a \u201cstep backwards\u201d for privacy. \u201cThe argument that hackers need physical access to even be able to manipulate Recall is short-sighted at best because there are plenty of highly ingenious ways threat actors could exploit such a valuable tool,\u201d she said. \u201cAll it takes is time and effort to find a way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_asia_china-military-drills-taiwan-second-day-intl-hnk", "text": "China\u2019s military drills around Taiwan are designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power\u201d over the island, the People\u2019s Liberation Army said Friday as its forces kicked off a second day of large-scale exercises encircling its democratic neighbor. The drills are the largest in more than a year and come just days after Taiwan swore in its new president, Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. Beijing has denounced Lai as a \u201cdangerous separatist\u201d and decried his inauguration speech on Monday, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan, which has grown much more pronounced under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The PLA, which dwarfs Taipei\u2019s outgunned military, kicked off the exercises on Thursday morning, sending warships and fighter jets around Taiwan and its outlying islands in\u00a0what it called \u201ca strong punishment for separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces.\u201d On Friday, the PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command said it was continuing the drills on both sides of the Taiwan island chain to \u201ctest the ability to jointly seize power, launch joint attacks and occupy key areas.\u201d China\u2019s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. The vast majority of Taiwanese have no desire to live under Chinese rule. But Xi, China\u2019s most authoritarian leader in a generation, has made clear the island\u2019s \u201cinevitable reunification\u201d with the mainland cannot be put off indefinitely. The two-day exercises, involving joint operations of China\u2019s army, navy, air force and rocket force,\u00a0are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 a narrow body of water separating the island from mainland China \u2013 as well as north, south and east of Taiwan, according to the PLA. For the first time, the PLA drills also involved China\u2019s Coast Guard, operating in areas around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off the southeastern coast of China. CCTV aired footage on Friday that shows PLA soldiers moving mobile artillery and missile systems into position, though it did not show any live fire. Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry has condemned China\u2019s military exercises as \u201cirrational provocations\u201d and dispatched its own sea, air and ground forces in response. Between 6 a.m. Thursday and 6 a.m. Friday, the ministry detected 49 Chinese aircraft, including 35 that crossed the Median Line, an informal demarcation point in the Taiwan Strait that Beijing does not recognize but until recent years had largely respected. A total of 19 Chinese warships and seven coast guard vessels were detected near the Taiwan Strait, according to the ministry. Taiwan\u2019s presidential office said Thursday it is \u201cregrettable to see China threatening Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom and regional peace and stability with unilateral military provocations,\u201d adding Taiwan has the \u201cconfidence and ability to protect national security.\u201d First week in office Lai has had a busy and politically turbulent start to his presidency after taking over from two-term leader Tsai Ing-wen, to kick off a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The PLA\u2019s drills pose the first real test for the veteran politician in managing tensions with Beijing, which has refused his offer to talk and to resume cross-strait tourism and student exchanges. On Friday, China\u2019s Defense Ministry accused Lai of pushing Taiwan into \u201ca dangerous situation of war\u201dand \u201cplaying with fire.\u201d \u201cThose who play with fire will burn themselves,\u201d ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters, using rhetoric China frequently deploys for Taiwan\u2019s government. \u201cWhenever \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 (forces) provoke us, we will push our countermeasures forward until the complete reunification of the motherland is achieved.\u201d Domestically, Lai is facing chaos in the legislature, where opposition parties who favor closer ties to China hold a majority, and have pushed to subject his administration to tighter scrutiny. Thousands of mostly young people have taken to the streets to protest the opposition\u2019s attempt to fast-track the proposed bills to grant the parliament more power. But despite Beijing\u2019s large show of force, life continued as normal in Taiwan, whose 23 million people have become used to China\u2019s military threats, even as they become more regular and prominent in recent years. \u201cWe are not scared of the Chinese Communist Party, and we have confidence,\u201d\u00a0an 88-year-old retiree, who gave his surname Liu, told CNN. \u201cIf the Chinese Communist Party does attack Taiwan, it won\u2019t be easy for them to take Taiwan. Taiwanese people are not afraid of war.\u201d A 42-year-old mother, who gave her surname Tsai, said she wasn\u2019t even aware the PLA drills were taking place. \u201cI believe leaders will prioritize people\u2019s happiness, so I\u2019m not worried. I think peace will be maintained,\u201d she said. \u2018Blockading Taiwan\u2019 China\u2019s military drills are often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally, and state media has ramped up coverage of the drills. Zhang Chi, a Chinese military expert, told China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV that the PLA\u2019s exercises focused on \u201cpracticing a new mode of blockading Taiwan.\u201d \u201cTaiwan is an isolated island, suspended in the sea with weak self-sufficiency. Taiwan\u2019s economy is export-oriented, and most of its energy consumption relies on imports. Once besieged and blockaded, it can easily lead to economic collapse, turning it into a dead island,\u201d he said. The exercises to the south of Taiwan are crucial for the blockade, targeting Kaohsiung port, Taiwan\u2019s largest port and an important base for the island\u2019s navy, Zhang said. Meanwhile, drills to the east of Taiwan are designed to practice cutting off the island\u2019s energy imports, the escape routes for \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d forces and the support line from the US and its allies, he added. The US maintains close but informal relations with Taiwan and is bound by law to supply the island with weapons to defend itself. Zhang also noted that the drills had achieved \u201ca new breakthrough\u201d by entering waters near Wuqiu\u00a0and Dongyin, which hold significant geographical importance. \u201cThe Taiwanese military views them as the front outposts for Taiwan Strait defense operations. This exercise further squeezed the activity space of the Taiwanese military,\u201d he said. Analysts said the China Coast Guard movement close to and around the outlying islands was an important new aspect of the current drills, which follow previous encirclement exercises in August 2022 and April 2023. \u201cThe pressing of Coast Guard and other forces into waters close to those offshore islands is provocative,\u201d said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center. He said he expected such Chinese activities to continue and that they \u201cwill become the norm,\u201d with Beijing at any point able to then turn an exercise into a real military operation. Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said China\u2019s pattern of exercises around Taiwan does not signal an imminent invasion threat. \u201cThese drills aid in blurring the lines between peace and war, so much so that future exercises could be used as a pretext for an actual invasion,\u201d Singleton said. But Singleton and others say the exercises are sending a bigger political message than a military one. \u201cJoint Sword - 2024A aims at reactivating the military pressure lever to assert a degree of influence on the new (Taiwan) administration and its narrative,\u201d said Lionel Fatton, assistant professor of international relations at Webster University in Geneva, using China\u2019s name for this week\u2019s drills. Beijing will use the pressure of the drills to try to increase divisions within Taiwan, which could \u201cweaken\u201d the island from the inside, he said. \u201cConstant and visible\u00a0military pressure on the island will also help polarize the political apparatus, if not the social fabric itself,\u201d Fatton said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/asia/china-military-drills-taiwan-second-day-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

The shoebox-size satellite lifted off Saturday at 7:42 p.m. local time (3:42 a.m. ET) aboard a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from Rocket Lab\u2019s launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand. The company confirmed the satellite\u2019s successful deployment at 8:35 p.m. local time (4:35 a.m. ET).

The data gathered will inform climate models and hopefully lead to better predictions of how the climate crisis will affect sea levels, weather, snow and ice cover, NASA said. Earth absorbs a lot of energy from the sun in the tropics regions. Weather and ocean currents move that heat energy toward the poles, where the heat radiates upward into space. Much of that heat is in far-infrared wavelengths and has never been systematically measured before, NASA added. PREFIRE is composed of two CubeSats fitted with specialized miniature heat sensors.

{"id": "2024_05_25_europe_kharkiv-russian-strike-hypermarket-ukraine-intl", "text": "At least 16 people have been killed and dozens injured after\u00a0a Russian strike hit a large hardware store in Kharkiv, Ukraine, on Saturday, according to officials. Among the dead is a 12-year-old girl, police said Sunday. The attack came as Russian forces continue to advance in northeastern Ukraine after crossing the border earlier this month and opening a new front in the two-year-old conflict.  Kharkiv has seen a spate of Russian attacks, as Russia seeks to tie up Ukrainian forces elsewhere and create a buffer zone.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the strike a \u201cbrutal attack\u201d in a post on X, later writing that \u201cRussia is run by men who want to make it a norm \u2013 burning lives, destroying cities and villages, dividing people, and erasing national borders through war.\u201d In his nightly address on Sunday, he said hundreds of personnel from State Emergency Services, police, and local authorities were involved in the response efforts. He also reiterated his calls for more air defense systems and stronger preventative measures against Russian forces. Officials have said there were nearly 200 people inside the building when the strike occurred. According to Chief of the Investigative Department of the Kharkiv Regional Police Serhii Bolvinov, investigators and forensic experts spent the night searching the ruins of the store for human remains. \u201cWe fear that they will have to sift through the ashes to find the remains and identify the victims,\u201d he continued. Ukraine\u2019s Interior Minister, Ihor\u00a0Klymenko, said Sunday that the hours following the strike were \u201chellish\u201d and thanked everyone who helped to put\u00a0out the flames that engulfed the hardware store after the attack. Oleh Syniehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, noted that there is \u201cnot a single military object nearby\u201d the site of the strike. He said the remains of 10 people who died in the strike had been identified and eight people were still missing. Meanwhile, further south in the Kherson region, authorities warned residents to avoid open spaces as there have been reports of explosions. \u201cThe enemy is attacking from the temporarily occupied left bank,\u201d Roman Mrochko, the head of the Kherson City Military Administration, said in a Telegram post Sunday. \u201cDo not stay in open areas. Take care of yourself and your loved ones,\u201d he wrote. Russian forces attacked Ukrainian frontline positions in Kharkiv 15 times over the weekend, General Serhii \u201cMarcel\u201d Melnyk, Commander of the Kharkiv city defense forces, said earlier on Sunday, adding that \u201csome of the attacks are still ongoing.\u201d Overnight Saturday into Sunday, Russian forces launched 14 missiles and over 30 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian military. Seven people were killed in Russian strikes on the city Thursday, after locations including a printing house were targeted. \u201cRussia continues its savage attacks on Kharkiv this week, striking a busy shopping center, a book publishing house and other civilian targets,\u201d US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said Saturday. \u201cWe condemn these attacks and commit to holding Russia accountable for its unprovoked war,\u201d she added. After Saturday\u2019s attack, Zelensky reiterated that \u201cif Ukraine had enough air defense systems and modern combat aircraft, such Russian strikes would have been impossible.\u201d \u201cThat is why we are appealing to all leaders, to all states: we need a significant strengthening of air defense,\u201d he said. Zelensky\u00a0has since appealed to US President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and Chinese leader\u00a0Xi Jinping\u00a0to attend a peace summit in Switzerland next month. \u201cPlease, show your leadership in advancing the peace\u00a0\u2013 the real peace and not just a pause between the strikes,\u201d Zelensky\u00a0said. \u201cThe efforts of the global majority are the best guarantee that all commitments will be fulfilled,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, at least two people were killed and at least 10 injured as a result of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian village in the Belgorod region, the region\u2019s governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said Saturday. Among the injured is an 8-year-old boy, he said, adding that \u201call victims had shrapnel wounds in various parts of the body.\u201d As a result of the strike, a private residential building caught fire, and about 20 other buildings and 23 cars sustained damage. \u201cAll operational services are working on site,\u201d Gladkov said.

A court in the city of Valpara\u00edso\u00a0ordered that they be put in pre-trial detention on Saturday, the office said. At least 137 people were killed in the fires that tore across large parts of central and northern Chile in February,\u00a0leaving 16,000 people displaced and damaging more than 9,800 buildings, according to government figures.

{"id": "2024_05_24_uk_prime-minister-rishi-sunak-election-intl", "text": "When British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced on Wednesday that the United Kingdom would hold a general election on July 4, many observers wondered: why now? More specifically, why has the PM called an election that is almost certain to lose? For months, polls have placed Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party way behind the opposition Labour Party and, as things stand, Labour leader Keir Starmer is set to not only win power but have a massive parliamentary majority. The answer to that question is simple: it\u2019s very unlikely there will be a better time. Almost everything Sunak tries seems to\u00a0backfire,\u00a0and it\u2019s not implausible that his favorability with the public will get even worse before the end of the year. The past couple of days have been relatively good for Sunak. The economy does seem to be recovering, with the\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0(IMF) updating the UK\u2019s growth forecast and inflation finally returning to something resembling a normal level. Nothing went catastrophically wrong in the last week or so ahead of calling the election. It\u2019s a low bar, but since his time in office, right now he probably has the most stable base to launch a campaign that he\u2019s ever had or ever will have. As one key\u00a0adviser\u00a0to Sunak told CNN: \u201cThe PM came into office facing a series a key challenges: inflation, no growth, migration. And he saw dealing with those as his primary mission. And he\u2019s made genuine and significant progress on that. On Tuesday, the IMF upgraded our growth forecasts, yesterday we saw inflation back to normal levels, today we see migration falling as a result of our reforms. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got a solid foundation to say that things are going in the right direction, and the view was that now was the best time to go to the country and say \u2018here\u2019s what we\u2019ve done, our plan is working, now who do you think has the plan and the capacity to take the bold action to move this country forwards towards a more secure future.\u2019\u201d Sunak had to call the election before the end of this year, constitutionally speaking. The fact he hadn\u2019t until this week allowed his opponents to paint him as a coward, terrified of facing the public. It didn\u2019t help that the country has felt in need of an election for quite a long time, nor that the Conservative Party has looked from the outside like a basket case for a number of years. Their time in office didn\u2019t begin formidably. In 2010, after 13 years of Labour rule, David Cameron won the general election but didn\u2019t win a majority in parliament. He was forced to make a coalition government with the centrist Liberal Democrats. Cameron, against the odds, kept the coalition together until the 2015 election, at which he won a surprise majority and secured the first fully Conservative government since 1997. The celebrations didn\u2019t last long. Holding the 2016 Brexit referendum split his party in two and made governing nearly impossible for his four (yes,\u00a0four) successors. First up was Theresa May. A botched snap election and the inability to pass her Brexit deal because her party hated\u00a0it ended May\u2019s tenure, and she\u00a0was replaced by Boris Johnson in 2019. Johnson blew his own majority when he became so weighed down by scandal \u2013 including the notorious illegal parties in Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 he had to resign in 2022. Liz Truss took over for 45 days, in which time she managed to cause sufficient economic havoc that the pound sank to its lowest ever level against the dollar, interest rates spiked and inflation ballooned. Eventually, the Conservative Party had enough of the chaos and put Sunak in charge as a safe pair of hands. Whether or not he has been that\u00a0is up for debate. Despite what Conservative sources might say about his record in office, his dire poll ratings cannot be denied. His flagship immigration policy, which would see illegal migrants sent to Rwanda to have their asylum claims processed, has already cost millions despite the fact only one person \u2013 voluntarily and given money to do so \u2013 has made the trip. His world-leading smoking ban, which caused Sunak major embarrassment when his own MPs didn\u2019t approve it, has been shelved due to the election. These are just two recent examples of how things seem to go wrong for Sunak. But the most damaging issue around him is the general sense that he is a bit of a loser and that his own party has so little faith in him. No amount of facts, figures or soundbites can change that he has an undeniable stench of failure around him. The sense that something is inevitable is powerful in politics, and for Sunak, defeat seems inevitable. Of course, it isn\u2019t. There is a chance that the polls are misleading us, and there is a chance that the Conservative campaign will work. They are making it personal: a clear choice between Labour leader Starmer and Sunak. Conservatives claim\u00a0Starmer cannot be trusted on national security, is a shameless opportunist with no principles and has no plan. Right now is probably the best time to hammer that message home. Labour will have to rush out its manifesto, which will inevitably be picked apart by commentators. The longer Sunak held off, the more time Labour had to get its house in order. Sunak inherited a mess, no one can deny that. It currently seems unlikely that he has cleaned up that mess enough to earn the Conservatives another term in office. But given the size of the task ahead of him, it makes sense that he seize on this rare period of good news and hope for the best.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/uk/prime-minister-rishi-sunak-election-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

More than 150 houses in Yambali village are buried in debris, Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the country\u00a0Serhan Aktoprak said on Sunday. The new estimate is a sharp increase from earlier in the week, when the UN initially said it believed more than 100 people had died. The population of the village was first reported to be about 4,000 people, but new estimates found the actual number of residents to be much higher, Aktoprak\u00a0added. More than 250 houses have been evacuated with an estimated 1,250 people displaced, and many locals have taken up temporary accommodation with relatives and friends nearby, according to the official. The area continues to pose an \u201cextreme risk\u201d as rocks continue to fall and the ground soil is exposed to a constant increased pressure, Aktoprak said. People are removing bodies buried under the soil with digging sticks, spades, and agricultural forks, he added.

{"id": "2024_05_22_europe_norway-ireland-spain-palestinian-state-analysis-intl", "text": "Europe has struggled over the Middle East for a very long time. The decision by Ireland, Spain and Norway to recognize\u00a0a\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0state\u00a0tells us more about the domestic politics of those countries than anything else. Obviously, the decision of three European nations to take this step is newsworthy and will have repercussions diplomatically, perhaps putting pressure on their allies to take a firmer stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict. However, it is also reasonable to say that thus far, no amount of pressure from even the US has had a major impact on the thinking of\u00a0Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu.\u00a0Israel responded by recalling the ambassadors of the three countries, accusing them of rewarding terror with the decision. Conversations about what recognition of statehood practically means and how helpful\u00a0it is\u00a0to the Palestinian cause in the long run are all entirely valid. But the reality is that the stakes are quite low for the majority of European countries when it comes\u00a0to\u00a0issues relating to Israel and\u00a0the\u00a0Palestinians. In Ireland, Spain and Norway, support for\u00a0a Palestinian state\u00a0chimes with the broader electorate and is unlikely to receive any political blowback. That isn\u2019t necessarily the case in other European countries. While supporting a peaceful two-state solution in the long-term, Germany has been consistent in its support for Israel, as have Hungary, Poland, the UK and others. The main consequence of this is military support, which inevitably raises questions about complicity in the war against Hamas \u2013 namely weapons being used to kill civilians.\u00a0The UK government is currently under pressure to publish legal advice on whether or not selling arms to Israel falls foul of international law. But these are largely domestic issues. For a long time, European governments have\u00a0mostly\u00a0considered the Middle East \u2013 especially Israel \u2013 to be something that the US deals with,\u00a0in part due to the US\u2019s military operations in the region. European countries simply do not have a huge amount of influence in this area. The Middle East was not something that dominated European thinking in a major way until the fallout from the Arab Spring led to an enormous influx of migrants into continental Europe. Aside from the practical implications of mass migration, it also presented a security risk, with terror groups hiding among refugees and carrying out atrocities across the continent. That isn\u2019t to say Europeans didn\u2019t care about the Middle East, specifically\u00a0the Palestinian cause.\u00a0Large sections of Ireland are supportive of Palestine due to its own history of occupation, while Norway mediated the famous Oslo accords. The European Union has historically sent huge amounts of humanitarian aid into Palestinian territories and supported a two-state solution. Indeed, the European Commission responded to Wednesday\u2019s news: \u201cThe European Union has a long-standing commitment to the vision of an independent and sovereign state of Palestine, living side by side with Israel in peace and security.\u201d Whether this pushes any kind of peace process along or not remains to be seen. This is not a coordinated European effort. Norway is not a member of the EU and the idea that 27 member states would all be willing to go as far as Ireland and Spain seems extremely unlikely. Yes, it might put pressure on bigger players to take a stand. But Europe doesn\u2019t speak with one voice and is unlikely to any time soon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/europe/norway-ireland-spain-palestinian-state-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in the Thai capital is treating 22 patients with spine and spinal cord issues, six with skull and brain injuries, and another 13 for bone, muscle or soft tissue complaints, its director Adinun Kittiratanapaibool told reporters on Thursday. The doctor added that 17 patients had undergone surgery, including procedures from stitches to spinal operations. One person died in the incident. Passengers who spoke to the media after the plane made an emergency landing in Bangkok described how some passengers and crew were thrown around the cabin, their heads smashing into the overhead baggage cabins, and seeing people in shock with bloody wounds on their faces. Josh Silverstone, one of the passengers on the Singapore Airlines flight, described feeling \u201chappy to be alive\u201d as he was leaving the hospital on Wednesday evening. Speaking with journalists on his way out, the 24-year-old British citizen said he had suffered a cut on his eye and a chipped tooth in the turbulence, but that several passengers were in a much worse physical state than he is. Silverstone described the aftermath of the emergency landing in Bangkok, saying he started vomiting,\u00a0which prompted him to look for medical care. Flight SQ321 from London to Singapore was cruising at 37,000 feet on Tuesday when the plane\u00a0dropped sharply before climbing\u00a0several hundred feet, according to flight tracking data. It then repeatedly dipped and ascended for about a minute. Many passengers were having breakfast at the time of the incident. Video and images from inside the aircraft after its emergency landing in Bangkok showed the extent of the damage, with overhead compartments smashed open and emergency oxygen air masks dangling above the seats. A photo of one galley showed a section of the ceiling open with parts of the plane\u2019s interior hanging down. Trays, containers, plastic bottles and hot beverage pots can be seen strewn across the floor. After the incident, the plane \u2013 which was carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew \u2013 was diverted to Bangkok, where ambulances and emergency response teams were waiting. Those injured on the flight included citizens from Australia, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Spain, the United States and Ireland, the hospital previously said. Of the total 104 passengers who were reported injured on the flight, 55 people remain in hospital. A 73-year-old British man with an existing heart condition died on board, though hospital officials haven\u2019t confirmed his cause of death. The man was later identified as Geoff Kitchen, who was described as \u201calways a gentleman with the utmost honesty and integrity\u201d by the Thornbury Musical Theatre Group, an establishment where he worked for more than 35 years.

{"id": "travel_world-best-tourism-countries-world-economic-forum-2024", "text": "The United States has just won a significant honor \u2013 being named the world\u2019s best country for travel and tourism in 2024 by the World Economic Forum. The rankings are determined by a broad range of criteria, including infrastructure, natural resources, sustainability, labor availability and \u2013 since this is the World Economic Fund we\u2019re talking about \u2013 competitive pricing. Another thing to keep in mind is that the WEF data focuses on tourism \u2013 the business of hotels, airports, attractions, airlines and the like \u2013 and not just what it\u2019s like to be a traveler on the ground. Europe in the lead Six of the top 10 countries on the list are in Europe, with Spain the highest overall. The report calls the continent \u201ca resilient destination with strong intraregional travel flows,\u201d and gives it high marks for train connectivity. There are also points for having strong economies, the good position of the Euro and pound, and the likelihood of Europeans to travel more \u2013 which, in turn, means spending money. It\u2019s no surprise that France scores highly, landing in fourth position overall. The country knows it has the world\u2019s eyes looking its way ahead of the Summer Olympics in Paris this year. Another factor taken into account is the power of many European passports. Every year, the Henley Index ranks the world\u2019s most powerful passports, and their data has been included in the WEF report. For 2024, six countries share the number one ranking \u2013 France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore and Spain. Five of those nations appear in the WEF\u2019s top 10, with Singapore a respectable 13th. The scene in Asia \u201cIn 2024, global tourism growth is expected to be reinforced by the continued satisfaction of pent-up demand and growth in major Asian markets after travel restrictions have been lifted following a delay compared to other regions,\u201d says the report. That certainly feels true in Japan, this year\u2019s third-place country, which has been experiencing a tourism boom since reopening post-pandemic. More than three million foreign tourists per month went to Japan in both March and April 2024, with more expected to visit during the coming summer holidays. Meanwhile, eighth-place China has in recent months made some moves to make it easier for tourists to visit. In March, it dropped visa requirements for residents of several European countries, including Ireland, Switzerland and the Netherlands. It\u2019s also easier than ever for Americans to visit China, as they no longer need to provide an itinerary or proof of hotel bookings to get a travel visa. American beauty While the US is the only North American country in the top 10, neighbor Canada lands just off the chart in 11th position. According to the WEF, the US is a \u201cmature\u201d tourism market, meaning it already has infrastructure in place to welcome visitors, such as air links connecting cities and on-the-ground support like tour guides, rental cars, hotel rooms and maps. The US\u2019 size and scope really help it stand out: from national parks to big cities to great beaches, there\u2019s a big variety of offerings for travelers. However, there\u2019s one potential caveat amid the praise. The report says there\u2019s a likelihood that the US will experience a tourism labor shortage. Like many places around the globe, the pandemic played a big role in people leaving the hospitality business to work elsewhere. Good for tourism versus overtourism It seems impossible to look at a list of the most popular countries for tourists without also acknowledging that in some places too much tourism is the problem. The United States (in first place) and China have the advantage of being large and having lots of room to work with, which helps spread the flow of visitors. Not every destination in the top 10 is so lucky, though. In runner-up Spain, Barcelona voted to keep cruise ships away from the city center, while citizens of the Canary Islands have taken to the streets \u2013 and even threatened a hunger strike \u2013 to protest overtourism. Italy, in ninth position, has also struggled to balance its thriving tourism market with the needs of local communities. Venice began charging a \u201ctourist tax\u201d entry fee last month, and the northern region of Bolzano - South Tyrol has capped its hotel capacity, allowing a new hotel to open only if another has closed.

{"id": "2024_05_24_world_thomas-midgley-jr-leaded-gas-freon-scn", "text": "Facing a crowd of journalists, inventor Thomas Midgley Jr. poured a lead additive over his hands and then proceeded to inhale its fumes for about a minute. Unfazed, he said, \u201cI could do this every day without getting any health problems whatsoever.\u201d Soon afterward, Midgley needed medical treatment. But the act would have dire consequences beyond his own well-being. The year was 1924, and Midgley, then a chemical engineer for General Motors, had pulled the stunt to support his most recent, lucrative finding: a lead compound called tetraethyl lead. Added to gasoline, it solved one of the biggest problems the automotive industry faced at the time \u2014 engine knocking, or tiny explosions in car engines due to the low quality of gasoline that resulted in an annoying sound and potential damage. Lead helped, but at great expense, because the substance is highly toxic to humans, especially children. Midgley would go on to leave his mark in history with another destructive invention, also a solution to a problem: the need to replace the noxious and flammable gases used in refrigeration and air conditioning. He found that CFCs, or chlorofluorocarbons, were an ideal substitute and harmless to humans. However, they turned out to be deadly to the ozone in the atmosphere, which blocks dangerous ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancers and other health problems, as well as harming plants and animals. One hundred years after that stunt before the press in 1924, the planet is still recovering from the ill effects of both of Midgley\u2019s inventions. The ozone layer will need another four decades to heal fully, and because leaded gasoline was still sold in parts of the world until 2021, many continue to live with the long-term effects of lead poisoning. Yet Midgley \u2014 whose story will be told in an upcoming movie developed by the writer of the 2013 film \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d \u2014 was hailed as a hero for decades. An inventor from his early days Born in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, in 1889, Midgley had a penchant for finding useful applications for known substances early on.\u00a0In high school, he used the chewed bark of the slippery elm trees to give baseballs a more curved trajectory, a practice professional players would later pick up. He was known to carry with him at all times a copy of the periodic table, his main tool in the search for the substance that would mark his breakthrough invention. The task of addressing the issue of engine knocking fell to Midgley while he was working at General Motors in 1916. \u201cIt was the dawn of the automobile era in the United States, and Ford had developed the Model T, which was not very powerful,\u201d said Gerald Markowitz, a history professor at the City University of New York. \u201cGM joined with Standard Oil and DuPont to try to develop more powerful engines, and in order to do that they needed to solve the problem of the engines knocking with the fuel that they had at the time.\u201d Under the direction of Charles Kettering, another influential American inventor and head of research at GM, Midgley worked his way through thousands of substances \u2014 including arsenic, sulfur and silicon \u2014 in a quest to find one that reduced knocking when added to gasoline. He eventually landed on tetraethyl lead, a lead derivative that was marketed simply as Ethyl. Leaded gasoline first went on sale in Dayton, Ohio, in 1923 and eventually spread throughout the world. Lead is highly poisonous, with no safe level of exposure, and can impair development in children, causing decreased intelligence and behavioral disorders, according to UNICEF. An estimated 1 million people a year still die from lead poisoning, according to the World Health Organization. The toxicity of lead was already well-known when Midgley added it to gas, but that didn\u2019t stop Ethyl from becoming a commercial success. \u201cThere were alarms that were raised, because lead was known as a toxin,\u201d Markowitz said. \u201cBut the position of the industry was that there was no proof that lead coming out of the tailpipes of cars was going to injure people. And it was that lack of proof that ultimately led the surgeon general not to take action after a public health conference in 1925.\u201d However, workers in Ethyl manufacturing quickly experienced ill effects. \u201cIt was really the fact that the people working in the labs producing tetraethyl lead were getting sick that created a crisis,\u201d Markowitz said. \u201cThey would literally go insane as a result of their exposure to lead.\u201d Midgley went as far as pouring Ethyl over his hands and inhaling it during that 1924 news conference in an attempt to quench fears. But in reality, he was also getting poisoned. \u201cHe definitely wrote in a letter in January of 1923 that he had a touch of lead poisoning, and he did have lead poisoning for the rest of his life,\u201d said Bill Kovarik, a professor of communication at Radford University in Virginia. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really go away when you get that much lead in your body. It is a serious, long-term disability.\u201d Punching a hole Just years after the invention of Ethyl, Midgley \u2014 again spurred by Kettering \u2014 turned his attention to developing a nontoxic, nonflammable alternative to refrigerant gases such as ammonia, which were used in appliances and air conditioners at the time, leading to a series of fatal accidents in the 1920s. He came up with Freon \u2014 a derivative of methane, composed of carbon, chlorine and fluorine atoms \u2014 the first CFC. In another public demonstration, in 1930, Midgley inhaled the gas and blew out a candle with it, a move designed to show its safety. Freon, as well as subsequent CFCs, became commercial successes, and made air conditioning adoption shoot up in the United States. After World War II, manufacturers started routinely using CFCs as propellants for all sorts of products, including insecticides and hair spray. It was the mid-1970s, three decades after Midgley\u2019s death, before the damage from his two inventions became publicly known. CFCs had punched a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica; if left unchecked, the hole would have expanded to the point of eventually threatening all life on Earth. As a result of continued industry pressure, leaded gasoline was not phased out in the United States until 1996 and slowly thereafter throughout the world. The last nation to get rid of it, Algeria, still sold it until 2021, and lead additives continue to be used in aviation fuel. A 2022 study estimated that half of the current US population had been exposed to dangerous levels of lead in early childhood, but the damage to the world\u2019s collective health is harder to quantify. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was signed to phase out CFCs from 1989 until 2010, after which they were banned. (CFC emissions have been rising again recently, a sign that they may still be produced illegally.) The hole in the ozone layer is on the mend and will likely heal in the next half\u2013century in a rare environmental win. \u201cThe very sad truth is that we don\u2019t know especially the number of children who have been adversely affected,\u201d Markowitz said. \u201cThere is no safe level of lead in a child\u2019s body. We\u2019re talking tens of millions of children, hundreds of millions of children over a half-century or more that have been affected adversely, their life chances diminished from lead dust as a result of the exhaust gases that got into the ground or into the streets.\u201d A tragic death Midgley\u2019s life ended under tragic circumstances. After contracting polio in 1940, he became severely disabled and devised yet another invention: a machine that would lift him out of bed and into a wheelchair autonomously, via strings and pulleys. But on November 2, 1944, he became entangled in the machine and died of strangulation. For a long time, it was believed to have been the ultimate irony \u2014 the inventor dying by his own invention. But the reality may be even darker, according to Kovarik. \u201cThe official cause of death was suicide,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had a tremendous sense of guilt. The industry told him he was brilliant. But he did stuff that in hindsight was pretty irresponsible. The lead poisoning could have contributed to his psychosis.\u201d Midgley received several awards and honors in the late stages of his life. The Society of Chemical Industry awarded him the Perkin Medal in 1937; the American Chemical Society gave him the Priestley Medal in 1941 and elected him as president in the year of his death. A biographical memoir from the National Academy of Sciences, written by his mentor Kettering in 1947, contains nothing but praise and ends by saying that Midgley left behind \u201ca great heritage to the world from a busy, a diversified, and a highly creative life.\u201d History has other examples of inventions that turned out to be unwittingly deadly, such as TNT, which was originally developed for use as a yellow dye and not used as an explosive until decades later. Midgley is unique in having developed two such inventions, but although it\u2019s tempting to see him as an environmental villain, experts say his role was more akin to a cog in the machine. \u201cHe was just an employee,\u201d Kovarik said. Markowitz agrees. \u201cThis was corporate-sponsored research,\u201d he said. \u201cHad it not been Midgley, I\u2019m sure it would have been somebody else who would have come up with these solutions.\u201d Striving for growth and innovation at all costs was reflective of the conception of progress in the first half of the 20th century, Markowitz added. \u201cOnly with the environmental movement that started in the 1960s and 1970s did we begin to consider what the consequences of technological progress could be,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has had a really sobering effect, but up through the 1950s there were very few voices questioning the idea that progress was our most important product.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/thomas-midgley-jr-leaded-gas-freon-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Born in London 1991, he later moved to Milan, Italy with his family. Although Acutis\u2019 parents were not religious, the young boy\u2019s faith was nurtured by his Polish nanny. After his death, his body was moved to the Italian town of Assisi, where it is now displayed in a shrine, alongside other relics linked to him. Prospective candidates for sainthood normally need to have two miracles attributed to them before they can be canonized. The latest miracle attributed to Acutis relates to the reported healing of a girl from Costa Rica who had suffered a head trauma after falling from her bicycle in Florence, Italy, where she was studying. Her mother said she prayed for her daughter\u2019s recovery at the tomb of Acutis in Assisi. Acutis was beatified and declared \u201cblessed\u201d after his first miracle in 2020, when he reportedly healed a Brazilian boy who had a birth defect in his pancreas that left him unable to eat food normally. Following the attribution of two miracles, the next step is for the Pope to convene a meeting of cardinals to agree on Acutis\u2019 sainthood and decide on a date for the canonization. His story is seen as helpful for the Catholic Church as it seeks to connect better with younger generations in a digital age. Acutis \u2013 considered a millennial as he was born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s \u2013 is remembered by friends and family as enjoying playing video games such as Halo, Super Mario and Pok\u00e9mon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/europe/carlo-acutis-first-catholic-millennial-saint-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_style_parties-monaco-grand-prix-f1", "text": "The Monaco Grand Prix gets underway this weekend in Monte Carlo with its heady combination of glamor and adrenaline, not only for the tens of thousands who descend on the pristine principality, but for the millions watching across the world. Even those who are typically indifferent to motorsports can find themselves enraptured, or at least intrigued, by the sheer spectacle of Formula One cars hurtling along the country\u2019s winding streets. It is also where you will find celebrities happily jostling their way through the crowds and cameras. \u201cIt is unlike anything I have ever been to, it is electric,\u201d exclaimed Spider-Man actor Tom Holland while walking last year\u2019s grid. And of course, there is plenty of wealth on display. Monaco is nicknamed \u201cthe billionaires\u2019 playground\u201d for good reason. Here, designer stores, supercars, multi-million-dollar yachts and astronomically priced restaurants are \u2018la norme\u2019, but during the three-day Grand Prix, the eye-watering ostentation increases three-fold. When demand is high and options are limited, it is all to play for among the world\u2019s wealthiest who are keen to revel in the race\u2019s iconic location and party \u2018til dawn. If they are not using their own superyacht as a base, they might book into a private villa on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur or check-in to Fairmont Hotel, H\u00f4tel Hermitage or H\u00f4tel de Paris in Monte Carlo itself. A pioneer of Grand Prix party culture Of course, it is not only about finding the finest suites to rest your head, but the premium spots for dining and clubbing, whether it is the top table at Cipriani, Sass Caf\u00e9 or Caf\u00e9 de Paris or the best booth at exclusive night spots such as Jimmy\u2019z or Amber Lounge. The latter has the distinction of being the go-to destination for the F1 fraternity, including Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, while previous guests have included Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Minogue and Prince Albert of Monaco. Established in 2003 by former racing driver Eddie Irvine\u2019s sister Sonia as a \u201cpost-race destination\u201d for drivers and VIP guests, Amber Lounge is regarded a pioneer of the Grand Prix party culture. Notably, it will be marking its 20-year milestone (there was a year off during Covid) as \u201cthe most exclusive party in the world\u201d with panache over the Monaco weekend with three nights of events costing just over \u20ac1.5m ($1.6m) to produce. There will be after parties at an Amber Lounge beach club on the terrace of Le Meridien Beach Plaza (the only hotel in Monte Carlo with its own private beach), as well as VIP viewing of the race from aboard a 108ft superyacht moored just feet from the circuit\u2019s famous Tabac corner. \u201cThe size of the yacht also means we are as close to the action as you can get, unlike the larger yachts that are pulled back (from the coast). It also feels more intimate and exclusive on board. We have a lot of repeat clients (typically from the US, UK and Middle East) who want to network and build relationships,\u201d said Lauren Green, Managing Director of Amber Lounge who oversees logistics of the three-day pop-up event in Monaco, as well as other F1 locations including Singapore, Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi. Unsurprisingly, a ticket to one of the most coveted trackside spots does not come cheap. A one-day VIP viewing package for the race itself on Sunday costs \u20ac3,500 ($3,800) per person \u2014 and the 65 available tickets sold out within two weeks of going on sale in May 2023. While the dress code is \u2018Riviera chic,\u2019 shoes, however expensive, must be discarded on embarking so as not to ruin the yacht\u2019s teak decking. Tickets include free-flowing beverages, including champagne, wine and signature cocktails, as well as food, a DJ and dancers before tenders return to shore at 6.30pm. \u2018The center of the universe for a weekend\u2019 At the club\u2019s after parties held over the race weekend, a small army of waiting staff serve ever-flowing drinks for a 1000 strong crowd on Saturday and Sunday nights. On arrival, guests ring a bell and a gloved hand appears through a flower wall proffering a glass of champagne. Attendees have paid anything from \u20ac600 ($650) for entry to the afterparty on Saturday (the F1 qualifying day) to \u20ac800 ($870) on the Sunday (race day) in the hope they can party alongside drivers, celebrities and guests of high net worth, away from the public gaze. For \u20ac40,000 ($43,400), partygoers can book what\u2019s known as a \u201cdiamond table package\u201d for 10 people \u2014 a prime table with unobstructed views of the stage and DJ booth (Fatman Scoop and Jax Jones are the acts for 2024), as well as cirqus-themed performances, and Methuselahs of champagne (6-liters) and premium vodka. Add an extra \u20ac10,000 ($10,800) on for a Salmanazar \u2014 a nine-liter bottle of champagne that requires a team of four to carry it to the table, or \u20ac20,000 ($21,600) for a 12-liter Balthazar-sized bottle. The top-tier tables also have their own \u201chosts,\u201d who act as a concierge; liaising with VIPs\u2019 assistants or drivers to ensure guests can be greeted and escorted along the black carpet without having to queue. Amber Lounge might be one of the most exclusive and expensive events taking place during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend, but Monte Carlo itself is a veritable party hub. It\u2019s common for champagne glasses and bottles to be cleared from the track from the previous night\u2019s revelry ahead of that day\u2019s qualifying or race sessions. \u201cThe C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur is one of the truly exceptional global destinations, and Monaco is at the heart of it. The scenery, the sophistication, and the opulence are unmatched,\u201d said Bruce Bundrant, Senior Vice President of Business Development for rEvolution, a global sports marketing agency who lived in Monaco for three years as Commercial Director for AS Monaco FC. \u201cAs a former resident, I can tell you there are two sides to the F1 Grand Prix arriving in Monaco. On one side, your town is now the center of the universe for a weekend where the top 1% of the 1% from all over the world arrive and engage in outrageous parties and events on yachts, at luxury hotels suites, and in hilltop mansions,\u201d Bundrant explained. \u201cOn the other, it\u2019s the hybrid of the arrival of a hurricane and New Year\u2019s Eve. A week out from the race, grocery store shelves are emptied as locals know it\u2019s impossible to move around the principality when the F1 circus is in town. During the Grand Prix, your quiet, regular neighborhood bar has a line around the corner, charges a $100 cover charge, and a drink that typically costs $20 will be $50. But it\u2019s a truly unforgettable weekend, with an unreplicable buzz and energy. Sure, it\u2019s expensive, but come the Monday, things are back to normal.\u201d As normal as it can ever be in a place as excessive as Monaco. As the jet set move onto their next port of call, and the racetrack is dismantled, so too is the Amber Lounge club as preparations continue for their next F1 event, which will be Singapore in September. \u201cThere is no rest at Amber Lounge,\u201d Green quipped. \u201cJust a lot of adrenaline. And a lot of coffee.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/style/parties-monaco-grand-prix-f1/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

The attempted coup, which targeted the residence of Congolese politician Vital Kamerhe and the country\u2019s presidential\u00a0palace,\u00a0was led\u00a0by opposition leader Christian Malanga, who was killed\u00a0in a gun battle between the armed putschists and the presidential guards, according to army spokesman General Sylvain Ekenge. Ekenge also claimed Malanga was a\u00a0US\u00a0citizen, though the State Department said later it had no records of him. \u201cI confirm the death of Christian Malanga neutralized during the exchange of fire at the Palais de la Nation (presidential palace),\u201d Ekenge told CNN, adding that Malanga\u2019s son Marcel, \u201cwas among those arrested.\u201d Ekenge named three other Americans, identified as Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, Patrick Ducey, and Taylor Thomson were involved in the foiled coup. \u201cPatrick Ducey and Taylor Thomson are the same person\u00a0who have\u00a0two different identities. We\u2019re going to check his passport,\u201d he added. US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US is aware of two other individuals \u201creported to be\u201d US citizens who are in custody after the failed coup attempt. Miller said privacy laws prevented him from confirming whether or not the US had reached out to the Congolese government to be granted consular access to the two individuals. Videos widely shared on social media, but not verified by CNN, showed a man with a bloody face\u00a0being surrounded\u00a0by Congolese military personnel. US\u00a0ambassador to the DRC, Lucy Tamlyn, said in a post on social media platform X, that she was \u201cshocked\u201d by reports of the attempted coup, adding that her country \u201cwill cooperate with the DRC authorities to the fullest extent as they investigate these criminal acts and hold accountable any\u00a0US\u00a0citizen involved in criminal acts.\u201d It is not immediately known whether President Felix Tshisekedi, who secured re-election for a second term after last December\u2019s disputed\u00a0vote\u00a0was at the presidential palace during the attack. Sunday\u2019s incident was the second coup attempt by the now deceased Malanga, a former Congolese military veteran, Ekenge told CNN. \u201cHe tried it without success in 2017,\u201d Ekenge said but did not provide further details. Malanga, 41,\u00a0who had\u00a0been\u00a0exiled\u00a0in the\u00a0US, headed the United Congolese Party\u00a0which\u00a0describes itself as an \u201copposition political party-in-exile.\u201d Flanked by his son and other armed men in military fatigue, Malanga\u00a0was seen\u00a0in a live-streamed video posted on his Facebook page railing against Tshisekedi\u2019s government and Kamerhe on the morning of the attack, accusing them of doing \u201cmany stupid things in this country,\u201d\u00a0according to Reuters. A DRC government statement commended the \u201cprompt reaction\u201d of the DRC\u2019s security forces in foiling the attack, stating that two police officers stationed\u00a0at politician Kamerhe\u2019s home \u201cwere killed on the spot.\u201d The DRC, Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest nation, is one of the five poorest countries in the world, according to the World Bank, despite its vast\u00a0mineral wealth.

{"id": "2024_05_25_world_solar-magnetic-field-science-newsletter-wt-scn", "text": "I was lucky enough to catch an awesome glimpse of the northern lights\u00a0from my own home this month when the biggest solar storm to reach Earth in two decades made auroras visible at latitudes much farther south\u00a0than usual. Despite living in the light-filled streets of central London, my smartphone camera picked up a green haze and a pulsing sheet of purple and pink light. Capturing the moment was an unforgettable experience and one that I had thought would involve expensive travel to the northernmost reaches of our planet. The storms that create spectacular auroras such as those I witnessed originate from the sun\u2019s dynamic magnetic field, an astrophysical enigma that scientists this week came closer to unraveling. Solar update Figuring out how the sun\u2019s magnetic field works will help scientists improve the forecasting of space weather, which dazzles night sky watchers but can disrupt GPS and communication satellites. The sun\u2019s looping magnetic field lines, which form a tangled web of structures more complex than those on Earth, are difficult to study directly. To grasp what\u2019s going on, scientists create mathematical models. A new model, which took more than a decade to develop and required a NASA supercomputer to conduct the detailed calculations, found that the sun\u2019s magnetic field is generated much closer to the surface than previously thought. The team believes its model is more accurate because it accounts for a unique solar feature. A long time ago A single gold earring found in the ruins of a 2,000-year-old building in the Pyrenees is a clue to how a devastating fire may have started. The inferno consumed the wooden structure, situated in an Iron Age settlement called Tossal de Baltarga, and killed six animals penned in a stable. Archaeologists believe the fire was deliberate. Had it been accidental, the building\u2019s owners likely would have released the livestock and returned after the fire died down to retrieve their hidden gold, which was concealed in a jar. The arsonists may have been an invading army under Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who led troops against the Roman Republic, according to the new study. The fates of the people who used the building are unknown, but the excavation uncovered telling details of the lives of an Iberian people called the Cerretani. Sky watch The builders of Stonehenge placed the huge stones that make up the prehistoric monument in line with sunrise and sunset on the longest and shortest days of the year, revealing an intimate understanding of the sun that\u2019s still palpable today. But does the 4,500-year-old site in southwest England \u2014 and potentially other megalithic monuments around the world \u2014 also align with the moon? The idea that Stonehenge has a lunar link first gained ground in the 1960s. However, the concept hadn\u2019t been systematically explored \u2014 until now. This summer, archaeologists are using the lunar standstill, a little-known phenomenon that happens every 18.6 years, to investigate. Across the universe Space scientists have observed the edge of a black hole \u2014 an area known as the \u201cplunging region\u201d \u2014 for the first time. Andrew Mummery, lead author of a new study on black holes and a research fellow at the University of Oxford, compared it to \u201cthe edge of a waterfall\u201d at the end of a river, where orbiting material from nearby stars plummets into the abyss. In the plunging region, matter can no longer stay in orbit and instead hurtles into the black hole. But unlike at the black hole\u2019s event horizon, or surface, light can still escape at this point. The study\u2019s findings, which Albert Einstein predicted, could help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of black holes.

Researchers working with Eurasian jays trained to find food hidden under cups said these birds may be capable of the feat of memory. In the experiment, which involved decorated cups, the jays were able to remember what a particular cup looked like, even after the cups were rearranged and a time delay.

The Al-Nazla school in Saftawy, on the outskirts of Jabaliya, was being used as a temporary shelter by people fleeing violence when the strike took place. An eyewitness, Saleh Al-Aswad from Jabaliya, told CNN that his son-in-law is being treated for injuries sustained during the attack. He added that a \u201cman making bread for his children, thinking this was a safe space\u201d was killed along with his daughter, Afnan, and his son, Mohamed.

CNN has reached out to the Israeli military but has not yet heard back. Healthcare system \u2018on its knees\u2019 News of the strike comes as the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. In a statement on X Saturday morning, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned that Gaza\u2019s healthcare system \u201cis on its knees\u201d as access to hospitals and facilities shrink further amid supply shortages and Israeli attacks. As of Friday, 15 out of 36 hospitals in Gaza were only partially functional, 21 hospitals were out of service, and there were six functional field hospitals, OCHA\u2019s report said, citing the WHO. Existing hospitals are operating at more than four times their bed capacity, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health, the agency said. \u201cShortages in fuel, medical supplies and equipment are threatening the ability of the remaining health facilities to operate,\u201d it added. So dire has the situation become that the director of the Kuwait hospital in Rafah posted a video plea on WhatsApp, to \u201csound the alarm to the WHO to keep this hospital operational and to guarantee it doesn\u2019t shut down by providing it with the necessary fuel.\u201d In his video appeal, Dr. Suhaib al-Homs says the Kuwait Hospital is now the only functioning hospital in central Rafah injured members of the public can reach \u201caround the clock,\u201d as the surrounding field hospitals are difficult to access without an ambulance. \u201cWe are warning of the mounting health crisis as hospitals are going out of service and the collapse of the health sector,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will keep on working and the medical teams will keep doing their job.

{"id": "2024_05_24_americas_haiti-gang-mss-kenya-explainer-intl", "text": "After months of planning and discussion, the deployment of an international force to violence-wracked Haiti has been delayed again, puncturing hopes that a vanguard of Kenyan police would arrive this week. High-profile meetings on Thursday hinted at once-high expectations. In the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, the country\u2019s governing Transitional Presidential Council posted photos of its meeting with a Kenyan delegation. In Washington, US President Joe Biden and Kenyan President William Ruto touted their nations\u2019 collaboration on the mission (largely equipped by the US) at a joint press conference. Peace and security in Haiti are the \u201ccollective responsibility of all nations,\u201d Ruto said, warning that Kenya will \u201ctake that responsibility along with the Haitian police\u201d and \u201cbreak the backs of gangs and criminals.\u201d But for now, armed groups continue to rampage in capital city Port-au-Prince, extorting residents and controlling the movement of vital fuel, food and medical supplies. On Thursday evening, a young US missionary couple were attacked by gangs at a church in the city and later killed, their family said. Who are Haiti\u2019s gangs? Originally created as enforcers for Haiti\u2019s political and business elite, Haiti\u2019s rival gangs have in recent months formed a broad coalition known as \u201cViv Ansamn,\u201d or \u201cLive together,\u201d and are now coordinating attacks on government institutions like police stations and prisons. Haiti\u2019s National Police have been battling the gangs block by block, but they are understaffed and under-equipped. Since the assassination of then-President Jovenel Moise in 2021, the gangs\u2019 grip has expanded from an estimated 50% of the city to 80% today. Law enforcement sources in Haiti now liken the urban battlefield to quicksand, telling CNN that they need reinforcements to hold and defend territory. Complicating the situation is a torrent of smuggled guns and ammunition arming Haiti\u2019s gangs, despite an arms embargo on the island. Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken defended US backing for the international mission, warning a Senate Foreign Relations hearing that without foreign support, Haiti is \u201con the precipice of becoming an all-out failed state.\u201d What is the Multinational Security Support mission? Haiti\u2019s government has been asking for international military assistance since 2022. In October last year, the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) was finally greenlit by the United Nations\u2019 powerful Security Council. Designed to coordinate closely with Haiti\u2019s National Police, the MSS is expected to focus on securing the city\u2019s airport, seaport and key roads, according to people with knowledge of the mission\u2019s planning. Kenya, which volunteered to lead the mission, has committed 1,000 police officers. Most of those are Kenyan border police, chosen for their experience in dealing with armed non-state actors such as Al Shabaab and in operating in foreign contexts such as Somalia, Sudan and Congo, according to Bill O\u2019Neill, the UN expert on human rights in Haiti. According to documents seen by CNN, the mission will be helmed by a Kenyan police commissioner and a Jamaican police lieutenant, with other top posts filled by Kenyan staff. The Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Chad, and Jamaica have also promised to contribute personnel to the mission. Although the MSS was approved more than seven months ago, it has been mired in complications, including court challenges in Kenya and political tumult in Haiti. In March, a surge of gang violence forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign shortly after inking a deal with Kenya for the mission; Ruto\u2019s administration has since found a new partner in Haiti\u2019s Transitional Presidential Council, established last month. During the Thursday press conference, journalist Ayub Abdikadir from Kenya\u2019s Citizen TV questioned Ruto on the strategy of sending forces to a crisis in the distant Caribbean while security problems endure in Kenya\u2019s North Rift region. \u201cWhy are you committing to Kenya when we have a problem back home?\u201d he asked. Kenya\u2019s responsibility is broader than its own borders, Ruto responded, underlining that troops and police had already been deployed to \u201csort out the banditry problem\u201d in the North Rift. A UN-managed trust fund for the mission currently contains $21 million, provided by Canada ($8.7 million), the United States ($6 million), France ($3.2 million) and Spain ($3 million), according to the UN. The US and Canada have also committed more, much of it expected to take the form of equipment and other resources. Why hasn\u2019t the MSS begun yet? (A shortage of medevac helicopters, in part) May 23 had been the working deadline for a first instalment of 200 Kenyan police officers to arrive, according to documents seen by CNN. Several dozen Jamaican officers were expected to arrive in Haiti by mid-June, with more trickling in through the summer. This week, a Kenyan team including several police commanders visited Port-au-Prince to assess whether facilities were ready to accommodate a deployment. A base for the MSS near Toussaint Louverture airport in Port-au-Prince is close to completion \u2013 boasting a medical facility and a trauma surgeon already on site \u2013 but the Kenyan delegation concluded that some equipment was insufficient. They were particularly concerned by a lack of helicopters for medical evacuations, multiple sources said, citing confusion over which nation would provide them. Kenyan authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Documents seen by CNN show that El Salvador had been floated as a potential provider of medevac helicopters, which Salvadoran Vice President Felix Ulloa played down as unlikely in comments to CNN. \u201cWe would like to be part of the solution, but we would need a mandate clearly from the United Nations and the acceptance of the host country,\u201d he said, adding that El Salvador could potentially offer its highly trained helicopter pilots and experts to oversee air operations for the MSS if called upon. More equipment, including armored vehicles and radios, is expected to arrive in Haiti for the MSS over the coming days and weeks. What now? Experts on the ground say the Haitian government also has more work to do to lay the groundwork for the mission, particularly in communicating with the public \u2013 and even the gangs \u2013 about how it will work. One source with experience in dealing with Haiti\u2019s gangs said the Transitional Presidential Council should be developing messaging to the gangs themselves about potential \u201coff-ramps\u201d from outright confrontation with the MSS, potentially by turning themselves in or otherwise seeking nonviolent resolution. Haitian police union SPNH17 meanwhile told CNN that plans for their collaboration with the international mission were too opaque and questioned why there wasn\u2019t more focus on providing material support to the local police. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the international community working with a few sectors with no clear plans on what they\u2019ll do and how. We don\u2019t even know how we will communicate with the Kenyan police officers who speaks English.

An adult ticket including an elevator ride to the summit of the Parisian landmark will cost \u20ac35.30 ($38.31) from June 17 onwards, rising from \u20ac29.40 ($31.91), BFMTV reported. The same ticket for children aged between 12 and 14 years old will cost \u20ac17.70 ($19.21) and the price for children between four and 11 years old to reach the tower\u2019s summit will be \u20ac8.90 ($9.66). The price increase has been brought about, BFMTV reported, in part because of a \u201csignificant loss of revenue\u201d caused by the \u201chealth crisis between 2020 and 2022.\u201d In 2020, less than 1.6 million people visited the Eiffel Tower, compared to nearly 6.2 million visitors the year before, the monument\u2019s operating company Soci\u00e9te d\u2019Exploitation de la tour Eiffel (SETE) reported. Less than 2.1 million people visited the following year. In both years, operating costs were around triple that of the the landmark\u2019s overall turnover, SETE said. Renovation work is also behind the cost increase, including \u201clead prevention measures\u201d related to the painting of the tower, BFMTV reported. The painting work is expected to last until 2027 while work is also planned on the elevators, which will lead to occasional closures.

The supermodel, whose father is Palestinian-American real-estate developer Mohamed Hadid, drew praise from some on social media after she was pictured walking on the promenade in a dress by design duo Michael and Hushi. \u201cOur Palestinian princess,\u201d\u00a0wrote one user on X.\u00a0\u201cLoving this homage to her Palestinian roots,\u201d praised a separate user on Instagram, while another comment read, \u201cThis is fashion with purpose.\u201d The supermodel later reposted a picture of the dress with the caption \u201cFree Palestine forever\u201d in her stories on Instagram, where she is frequently vocal about violence against Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza. In October last year, she wrote in a statement posted to Instagram: \u201cMy heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood,\u201d referencing those killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. And on May 15, Hadid marked Nakba Day (commemorating the time in 1948 when an estimated 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes)\u00a0with a post\u00a0sharing her family\u2019s history as Nakba survivors and pleading for an end to the war in Gaza. \u201cPlease look into the eyes of the Palestinians suffering,\u201d she wrote. The keffiyeh scarf, on which Hadid\u2019s dress is based, is worn across the Middle East. But in recent decades, it\u00a0has come to be identified as a symbol of Palestinian identity and resistance. Hadid\u2019s dress is from the archives of\u00a0Michael and Hushi, a New York-based brand founded by Michael Sears and Hushidar Mortezaie. The dress retailed for $900 in September 2001 and was featured in magazines including Women\u2019s Wear Daily and Wallpaper, according to an Instagram post by Mortezaie.  Some on social media were quick to point out that Hadid\u2019s dress was not technically a Palestinian\u00a0keffiyeh, with the colors more closely resembling those used in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Mortezaie, one of the original designers, explained the intentions behind the dress. \u201cThis dress was made 23 years ago and everyone from the region was grouped as one big Other. There was no Google. Only what could be put together with little resources. Hopefully we can all learn to stand in unity and love against genocide,\u201d\u00a0he wrote on Instagram.

{"id": "2024_05_24_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-american-sentencing", "text": "The first of several Americans recently charged with possession of ammunition in Turks and Caicos headed home Friday after getting a suspended 52-week sentence and a $6,700 fine, his representatives said. But four other Americans still await their fate. In recent months, all were arrested and accused of bringing in various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. In the Turks and Caicos, possession of firearms or ammunition carries a minimum 12-year sentence, though the law allows reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d the local governor said. Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania had pleaded guilty to the charge, the Turks and Caicos government said. On Friday, he got a 52-week sentence that was suspended for one year, meaning he would not face immediate incarceration, Hagerich\u2019s attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel, told CNN. Hagerich was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory and return to the United States once he paid the fine, Smith said. He would have to serve the full 12-month sentence if the fine was not paid. Hagerich flew back to the US Friday afternoon, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign. The organization helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. \u201cVery grateful to the Court for giving two very special kids their dad back. Even more grateful to the numerous (Turks and Caicos Islands) nationals who helped along the way,\u201d Franks posted to X along with a picture of Hagerich boarding a plane. After Hagerich arrived at Pittsburgh International Airport on Friday night, he told reporters he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d to have his two children jump into his arms, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WTAE. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Hagerich said. \u201cA lot of memories to make together. Just so elated to see them. They\u2019ve been so strong through all this.\u201d Smith said his client was \u201cpleased, he\u2019s relieved\u201d by the outcome. \u201cThe sentence, in all its circumstances, is reasonable and fair,\u201d Smith said. After Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said justice \u201chas been served as the law intended.\u201d \u201cAs we have said, The Firearms Act includes consideration for exceptional circumstances,\u201d Misick said, \u201cand today\u2019s decision reflects our commitment to judicial independence along with upholding the law. Residents and visitors can be confident that the Turks and Caicos Islands are dedicated to safety and compassion as we protect the safety and rights of all.\u201d The four other Americans charged have been released on bail while they await their court dates, Misick\u2019s office said in a statement. One was allowed to return to the US for medical reasons, and the rest are staying in Turks and Caicos. US lawmakers tried to get Americans freed A US congressional delegation traveled to the islands this week and asked for charges to be dropped for the five Americans whom they said \u201cinadvertently\u201d had ammunition in their luggage. Hagerich\u2019s sentencing came after the US officials expressed disappointment over their attempted intervention. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward,\u201d Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said in a statement this week. In addition to Hagerich, two other Americans \u2013 Michael Lee Evans and Tyler Wenrich \u2013 have pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the territory\u2019s government. Evans was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, Smith said. A fourth American, Ryan Tyler Watson, will have a hearing Tuesday to determine if he will enter a plea or go to trial, Smith said. A fifth American, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, director of communications in the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. Watson\u2019s wife, who will appear\u00a0in\u00a0Turks\u00a0and\u00a0Caicos\u00a0court\u00a0next\u00a0week\u00a0for her husband\u2019s ammunition offenses, told CNN her husband\u00a0plans\u00a0to\u00a0employ a similar legal strategy\u00a0as Hagerich. \u201cI think we\u2019re\u00a0planning\u00a0to\u00a0kind of follow the\u00a0same path\u00a0that Bryan did,\u201d Valerie Watson told CNN on Saturday. \u201cI think they\u2019ve got a plan that they\u2019ve already come up with.\u201d Hagerich and Watson share the same attorney, Valerie Watson said. \u201cI think he\u2019s ready\u00a0to\u00a0just go\u00a0in\u00a0(to\u00a0court) on Tuesday so they can get that going,\u201d she added. Turks and Caicos: No special treatment should be given to any group Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said the mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms or ammunition is in place to protect those on the islands, and judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said. \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly,\u201d Misick said. And US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick said Thursday. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date. Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Misick said. By contrast, the United States has more guns than people. Now, bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d While the US and Turks and Caicos collaborate in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d But at least one appointed member of the opposition, Alvin Garland, expressed concern about the American citizens\u2019 arrests. Garland said the islands\u2019 governor is correct in not interfering with the ongoing court cases in order to adhere to the government\u2019s separation of powers, but added he believes most, if not all, of the cases involving American tourists will fall into the \u201cexceptional circumstances category\u201d and sentences could be shorter than the mandatory 12-year minimum.

The body of 40-year-old Joshua Cheruiyot Kirui was found about 20 meters from the summit of the world\u2019s highest mountain, an official of Nepal\u2019s Department of Tourism told CNN. \u201cHis sherpa is still missing and the expedition agency is still searching for him,\u201d the official Khim Lal Gautam also told CNN by phone, was speaking from the foot of the mountain. Kirui, a banker based in Nairobi, and the 44-year-old guide Nawang Sherpa were reported missing early Wednesday after going out of radio contact. A rescue team then began searching for them in camps and trails along the expansive mountain, Gautam told CNN. Kirui\u2019s body was discovered on Wednesday night local time in Nepal, at about 28,970\u00a0feet (8,830 meters) above sea level. His employer KCB Bank called him \u201ca passionate athlete and mountaineer,\u201d saying he was \u201cthe second Kenyan to ever summit Mt Everest\u201d in an post on X. Kirui documented his brave attempt to climb to the peak of Everest without supplemental oxygen in his\u00a0last post on Instagram. \u201cA no-oxygen attempt comes with its special preparations and risks, physically my body is ready,\u201d he wrote, also laying out the precautions he was taking. He listed drugs he was bringing along for any potential illnesses or frostbite and said his guide would also carry an emergency bottle of oxygen. \u201cAnd so after heavy investment physically, mentally, timewise (this expedition is taking more than a month from a regular 8 to 5 banker), financially (the amount of zeros needed to make this happen means I declare bankruptcy immediately I land back in Kenya)\u2026 it\u2019s now the moment of truth,\u201d he wrote. Congratulatory comments and good luck wishes on the Instagram post were soon replaced by condolence messages as word spread that his body had been found. Kirui was a lover of the outdoors, who ran ultramarathons and climbed some of the world\u2019s most daunting mountains, according to colleagues. \u201cHis indomitable will and unwavering passion for mountaineering led him to conquer the world\u2019s most awe-inspiring landscapes,\u201d KCB Group CEO Paul Russo wrote of him. \u201cHis recent triumphs on Mt Manaslu and Mt Everest are a testament to his adventurous spirit and determination.\u201d Mount Everest, the highest peak in the Himalayan mountain range, is also the tallest mountain on Earth, rising 29,035 feet (8,850 meters) above sea level on the border between Nepal and Tibet \u2014 an autonomous region in China. More than 300 people are known to have\u00a0died on the mountain. Spring is the prime time to climb Everest, although some mountaineers might climb in the less favorable autumn season. Most climbers try to ascend the peak in May. There\u2019s a brief window of time \u2013 usually after mid-May \u2013 when temperatures are warmer, and the high-altitude winds known as the jet stream have moved away from the mountains.

{"id": "2024_05_24_world_papua-new-guinea-landslide-intl-hnk", "text": "More than 100 people are feared dead in a remote village in the Pacific nation of Papua New Guinea after a landslide flattened homes and buried people alive while they were sleeping, officials said Friday. The disaster hit the village of Kaokalam in Enga Province, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) northwest of the capital, Port Moresby, at about 3 a.m. local time (1 p.m. ET, Thursday). The remoteness of the affected village, home to nearly 4,000 people, is hindering rescue efforts, according to the Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the country. \u201cThe debris is as big as approximately three to four football fields, and is blocking the lifeline of the province\u2019s main highway, which is making the relief efforts all the more difficult,\u201d Serhan Aktoprak told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s already dark. It\u2019s already night time in Papua New Guinea. There\u2019s no power to continue the relief efforts. Only with sunrise will the [IOM] teams be returning,\u201d Aktoprak said. He added that three\u00a0bodies had so far been recovered, but the death toll is likely to increase because of the size of the landslide. The number of people killed or missing is \u201cvery fluid,\u201d but more than 100 are believed to be dead, Janet Philemon, Caretaker and National Treasurer of the Papua New Guinea Red Crescent Society (PNGRCS), told CNN. The local community has been scrambling to reach survivors \u201cwith whatever tools they have at their disposal,\u201d Philemon said. \u201cThe community themselves are responding, trying to bring out and uncover those that have been buried under the landslide,\u201d she added. She said that an earthquake had hit the area a few days prior, which she believed could have contributed to the cause of the landslide. Footage of the aftermath carried by AFP showed a wide scar of mud and rocks on a steep mountainside slope and locals clambering to look for survivors. Prime Minister James Marape said in an earlier statement, reported by the ABC and Reuters, that his government had sent officials from the country\u2019s disaster agency, defence force, and Department of Works and Highways to meet Enga\u2019s provincial and district authorities, and carry out the rescue and relief efforts, as well as the reconstruction of infrastructure. \u201cI extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the landslide disaster,\u201d he said, In comments reported by the ABC, officials said houses were flattened when the side of a nearby mountain gave way. CNN has reached out to local authorities, including Ipatas, as well as the national police and the country\u2019s disaster management agency. A Pacific nation home to around 10 million people, Papua New Guinea is rich in resources, but its economy has long trailed those of its neighbors, and it has one of the highest crime rates in the world. Violence remains widespread. Chaos erupted in the capital earlier this year after police walked off the job in protest over a drop in their pay, which government officials later blamed on a computer glitch in the payroll system. Shops were looted and buildings set on fire during the disturbance. Hundreds of tribes are spread across the country\u2019s remote and often inaccessible terrain. But its vast and diverse mountainous landscape, as well as a lack of roads, has made it difficult and costly to upgrade basic services like water, electricity and sanitation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/papua-new-guinea-landslide-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

But the country\u2019s black rhino population has more than doubled since 1989, and by December 2022 there were 1,900 black rhinos and white rhinos in total, according to Kenya Wildlife Services. Sera Conservancy has championed the country\u2019s community-led rhino conservation efforts. In 2015 it established East Africa\u2019s first community rhino sanctuary with the introduction of 10 critically endangered black rhinos. Today, that number has grown to 21 black rhinos which freely roam across 107 square kilometers (41 square miles) of designated sanctuary land, and in February 2024, they were joined by four white rhinos from the nearby Lewa Conservancy. As she searches on foot, Dr. Ruoro-Oundo spots two of the female white rhinos. One, called Sarah, looks heavily pregnant but as the vet creeps closer she notices something is very wrong. Mindful of not encroaching too long on the rhinos\u2019 territory and reluctant to intervene unnecessarily, she opts for a different approach; through a conservation technology tool called EarthRanger she can monitor Sarah\u2019s movements in real time from a distance.\u00a0 Prior to translocation, each of the four white rhinos was fitted with a GPS tag in its horns and ears, which sends a real-time location to remote devices like mobile phones, or to the conservancy\u2019s operations center, where Dr. Ruoro-Oundo is able to monitor Sarah\u2019s location and movements. As EarthRanger\u2019s co-founder Jake Wall tells CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s exactly like a \u2018Find my Friends\u2019 for rhino.\u201d Sparse internet connectivity means Dr. Ruoro-Oundo cannot get a clear signal from Sarah\u2019s transmitter but thankfully Sarah is not alone; a female rhino named Arot has never left her side and through Arot\u2019s transmitter Dr. Ruoro-Oundo can see that Sarah has barely moved in hours, suggesting her condition is deteriorating. By using a drone to take photos of her, the team is able to confirm that Sarah urgently needs help. \u201cWe noticed she has a fecal impaction, it was quite huge and had made the rectal and vulvar area swollen,\u201d says Dr. Ruoro-Oundo. \u201cShe\u2019s in a lot of pain because she could not put down her tail, and you could see she was a bit sluggish, she really wanted to spend her time lying down. So in such a case we really need to intervene for her comfort, to relieve her of the distress and the pain.\u201d An emergency intervention is immediately put into action, led by Kenya Wildlife Services and Sera Conservancy\u2019s management and rangers. Air, ground and additional veterinary support are mobilized within hours \u2014 potentially saving not only Sarah\u2019s life but that of her unborn calf too. For Dr. Ruoro-Oundo, the key to safeguarding Kenya\u2019s wildlife is a balance between community and technology. \u201cI think you cannot separate technology from conservation in the future,\u201d she says.\u201d The human element can never be removed, but technology will always come to assist where we cannot reach.\u201d A global effort Now used in 70 countries, EarthRanger\u2019s story started in Kenya when co-founder Wall was researching elephants there. \u201cIn about 2012, we had a real crisis with poaching in Kenya, so we wanted a way that we could pick up on elephants that were getting killed, and the sign for us was that the collar stopped moving for more than about five or six hours, which is the longest sort of period that an elephant rests for,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I wrote the algorithm that could work out whether an elephant had stopped moving or not, and then (the collar) would send an SMS if it had. So that was kind of the beginning.\u201d He adds that the system has evolved quite significantly since then, and Sarah is one of 9,000 animals \u2014 including elephants, lions, giraffe, tortoises, sea turtles and 1,200 rhinos \u2014 that EarthRanger is currently tracking in Kenya alone. Wall says the system can integrate data from more than 100 different devices \u2014 \u201canything from elephant trackers to ear tags for rhino, to collars for lions, tail tags (for giraffes), devices that glue onto the shell of a turtle.\u201d It can also receive information from sources such as vehicle trackers, satellites, and remote sensing alerts for things like deforestation and fire. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling it all into one platform, where it can be readily visualized, analyzed and then acted upon,\u201d Wall adds. \u201cAnd all of that\u2019s giving the operators and managers a bird\u2019s eye view of the situation as it\u2019s happening, with real-time tools.\u201d According to the EarthRanger, all of these devices are designed to be lightweight, durable and inconspicuous ensuring they don\u2019t impact on the animals\u2019 natural behavior or cause them discomfort. For rhinos, Dr. Ruoro-Oundo says that attaching a tracker is the equivalent sensation of a human getting their ears pierced. Samuel Lekimaroro, a wildlife protection manager for the Northern Rangelands Trust, which includes Sera Conservancy, uses this kind of data to live-track terrestrial and marine wildlife across 6.5 million hectares. For Lekimaroro it has become a powerful tool in translocating wildlife, data collection and security operations, including identifying hotspots for human-wildlife conflict. \u201cThanks to EarthRanger, trophy poaching has been on a steady decline for the last five years, from a high of 120 elephants poached in 2012, to zero in the last four years in (our) member conservancies,\u201d he says. Wall says its potential to securely collect and share data from different EarthRanger sites from across the world is revolutionary. \u201cIf organizations are doing, say, joint patrolling, or monitoring of a species, then they can also share that information,\u201d he says. \u201cBy storing information on EarthRanger we can pull that data from different sites and combine it in ways that was never possible before. So it\u2019s really enabling the analysis and the reporting in a way that just never existed before.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/earthranger-track-wildlife-kenya-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_25_europe_putin-peace-ukraine-russia-analysis-intl", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s\u00a0signaling this week that he is open to peace talks should be viewed with vast, overshadowing caveats, and the weight of Ukraine\u2019s - and the West\u2019s - past experience of Russian diplomacy. Friday saw a wealth of noise about negotiation, in\u00a0the same month\u00a0Moscow launched a third invasion of Ukraine from the north of Kharkiv. The\u00a0Reuters\u00a0news agency\u00a0cited four sources, in a report from two deeply experienced and connected Russia reporters, that Moscow was willing to consider peace talks which would freeze the current Russian occupation of about a fifth of Ukraine. Putin responded\u00a0to that report\u00a0by\u00a0suggesting Russia was willing to talk peace, based on earlier agreements. He hinted at an aborted deal in Istanbul, just after the war began, in 2022, which fell apart, mostly because Moscow\u2019s forces were still rampaging across Ukrainian territory, and massacres around Kyiv had come to light. The idea floated in the Reuters report would stop short of Moscow\u2019s stated goal of capturing all of eastern Donetsk, but also eradicate Kyiv\u2019s insistence it should not surrender any territory. The context of Putin\u2019s remarks was\u00a0key. They came during a visit to Belarus\u2019 President Alexander Lukashenko - something which in the past\u00a0occurred moments before the Kremlin\u00a0used\u00a0Belarusian territory for military moves into Ukraine,\u00a0while on\u00a0Friday\u00a0took place\u00a0during joint tactical nuclear weapons drills between the two countries.\u00a0Putin was talking peace with a backdrop that was anything but. Putin\u00a0questioned\u00a0the\u00a0legitimacy of Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky,\u00a0who\u00a0Moscow has repeatedly assailed, after Kyiv had to delay elections because of the very war Putin started.\u00a0At the same time, there were unconfirmed reports that the private jet of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich had landed in Belarus.\u00a0The\u00a0pro-Russian Yanukovich fled Ukraine in 2014 after forces loyal to him shot dead dozens of protestors in central Kyiv. The mere possibility of his presence while Putin and Lukashenko met led to speculation Moscow was again hoping to engineer the return of a proxy to power in Ukraine. The Kremlin\u2019s less brutal goal in Ukraine \u2013 short of full or partial occupation \u2013 has involved a president in Kyiv it considers loyal, who will stop the country\u2019s march towards the European Union and NATO. It was fanciful before the 2022 invasion, and came up during the aborted 2022 Istanbul talks. But now it would likely need an occupying Russian force to impose it on a population seething at the Kremlin\u2019s brutality. So why the talk of peace, particularly when Russia appears to be having its most successful moment on the frontlines in months, if not since the invasion? Diplomacy has always been a military tool for the Kremlin. It talked peace over Syria in 2015, as their jets\u00a0pounded\u00a0civilians in rebel-held areas. It talked peace in 2015 with Ukraine, while Russian troops and their proxies were in the throes of a full assault against the strategic Ukrainian town of Debaltseve. It is not cynical to distrust Russia\u2019s sincerity when it negotiates, but a practical necessity. Experience shows it considers talks worth pursuing in case they unexpectedly produce a useful outcome without violence, or give their opponent cause for pause in fighting to try and encourage a deal. Moscow may also be talking peace again now for two reasons. Firstly, Ukraine and its allies are convening a peace summit in Switzerland in June, where it will discuss, without Russia, what sort of deal it might accept. It is likely aimed at building momentum for an off-ramp the Kremlin can take when its forces are finally militarily exhausted or in a stalemate. Zelensky has said he hopes China - Russia\u2019s most potent ally but only partial supporter in the Ukraine war - will attend. Putin may be talking peace now to suggest to Beijing to not be involved in diplomacy about Russia without Russia present. There is little serious chance the Switzerland summit will end the war, but it might concretize minds in the West as to how serious a threat Moscow poses to an actual peace deal by laying out the bones of what damage Ukraine might have to absorb to its territorial integrity to stop the bloodshed. Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0Foreign\u00a0Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Friday\u00a0that\u00a0Putin\u2019s hints at peace talks were directly aimed at sabotaging the summit. \u201cPutin currently has no desire to end his aggression against Ukraine\u201d, he wrote on\u00a0X, adding \u201cthis is why he is so afraid of\u201d the Switzerland summit. Secondly, and most importantly, Putin is messaging governments in the West and the current American presidential campaign. He is trying to opaquely suggest \u2013 perhaps to populists in Europe, or MAGA Republicans in the United States \u2013 that a simple deal is in hand, one in which frontlines, on which Ukraine is currently losing with significant casualties, can suddenly freeze. Western support for the war is costly, and increasingly unpopular \u2013 although the recent $61 billion passed by Congress has perhaps given the issue a\u00a0reprieve\u00a0from being at the mercy of electoral opinion\u00a0for about a year. The Reuters report permits those in the West who want to see an end to the war to believe the Kremlin could stop the war, as it stands, immediately. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov made the report sound like it reflected Russia\u2019s permanent position. But ultimately it may sound new and interesting to key Western figures: Donald Trump - who has failed to explain how he would enact his claim he could stop the war in 24 hours \u2013 and other NATO members who are less bullish than France, the UK and the Baltic states, about the need to never trust Russia at the negotiating table. Putin is a pragmatist. He started the war thinking it would be easy. He continued it thinking his tolerance for pain, autocratic security, and patience for victory would triumph. He might be right, just now. He now sees a moment of electoral weakness in the US, and other European states, which he has met with a vague, opaque signal that there might be a time for diplomacy. It will likely gain some traction among those who desperately hope the war in Ukraine will just go away, and who are less mindful of the existential threat a victorious and hyper-militarized Moscow poses to NATO\u2019s eastern members. But it should be viewed through the lens of the deep cynicism of Moscow\u2019s earlier diplomacy in Syria and Ukraine: used as a time to ferociously pursue the same military objectives, but with the illusory backdrop that peace might be just around the corner.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/europe/putin-peace-ukraine-russia-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a speech celebrating US-Mexico cooperation on the case, US President Joe Biden on Saturday hailed the extradition of El Nini \u2013 also known as N\u00e9stor Isidro P\u00e9rez Salas \u2013 as \u201ca good day for justice.\u201d \u201cEl Nini played a prominent role in the notorious Sinaloa cartel, one of the deadliest drug trafficking enterprises in the world. The United States has charged him for his role in illicit fentanyl trafficking and for murdering, torturing, and kidnapping numerous rivals, witnesses, and others,\u201d Biden said, thanking Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. \u201cOur governments will continue to work together to attack the fentanyl and synthetic drug epidemic that is killing so many people in our homelands and globally, and to bring to justice the criminals and organizations producing, smuggling, and selling these lethal poisons in both of our countries,\u201d he added. According to the US Department of Justice, N\u00e9stor Isidro P\u00e9rez Salas \u201cwas one of the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s lead sicarios, or assassins\u201d and was involved in the \u201cproduction and sale of fentanyl\u201d in the United States. Biden has previously described El Nini as one of America\u2019s most-wanted criminals. P\u00e9rez Salas was charged in the US with cocaine and methamphetamine trafficking conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and witness retaliation\u00a0in February 2021. The\u00a0US State Department\u00a0offered a reward of up to $3 million for information leading to his arrest and he was detained in Mexico\u00a0in November of last year. According to the State Department,\u00a0P\u00e9rez Salas worked directly with Oscar No\u00e9 Medina Gonz\u00e1lez, a subordinate of Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar, one of the sons of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who was\u00a0sentenced to prison\u00a0in the US in 2019.

He is accused of being one of the commanders of the \u201cNinis\u201d cell, described as a \u201cparticularly violent\u201d group of security personnel for Los Chapitos. \u201cI am grateful to our Mexican government counterparts for their extraordinary efforts in apprehending and extraditing El Nini,\u201d US Attorney General Merrick Garland\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cThe Justice Department will continue to go after the cartels responsible for flooding our communities with fentanyl and other drugs.\u201d CNN\u2019s Evan Perez and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/americas/el-nini-mexican-cartel-extradited-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_europe_depardieu-paparazzi-harrys-bar-rome-intl-latam", "text": "In a scene reminiscent of La Dolce Vita era, French actor Gerard Depardieu has been accused of attacking celebrity photographer Rino Barillari outside Harry\u2019s Bar on the famed Via Veneto in Rome. Depardieu was dining at an outdoor table with a female companion and two other people around 2 p.m. local time on Tuesday when Barillari \u2013 known as \u201cthe king\u201d in Roman press circles \u2013 apparently snapped the diners, according to Italian media reports. Exactly what happened next is a matter of dispute, though both sides say they have filed police reports known locally as denouncements. Barillari, age 79, said Depardieu\u2019s partner Magda Vavrusova jumped up and started punching him before Depardieu joined the fight, according to Barillari\u2019s lawyer, as cited in several Italian media outlets including the Messaggero newspaper where Barillari works. Police confirmed to CNN that \u201ca local photographer\u201d had filed a complaint around an incident at Harry\u2019s Bar on Tuesday, but did not divulge the names of those involved. Piero Lepore, the owner of Harry\u2019s Bar in Rome, confirmed to CNN that the incident happened, but did not cast blame. Barillari often captures celebrities dining at the establishment, which is famous for appearing in the 1960 Federico Fellini film \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d \u2013 whose photographer character Paparazzo is reputed to have inspired the term \u201cpaparazzi.\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen fisticuffs here in two decades. This sort of thing never happens here,\u201d Lepore told CNN by telephone. \u201cWe are used to celebrities and we are used to paparazzi \u2013 they can\u2019t survive without each other. But we are no longer used to these fights.\u201d When asked for details, he said that because there was now a denouncement by Barillari, he could not comment. \u201cI gave my testimony to the police. I can\u2019t say any more.\u201d Barillari was taken to hospital by ambulance, according to Lepore. Magda Vavrusova\u2019s lawyer, Delphine Meillet,\u00a0said in a statement to CNN that it was Barillari who had pushed Vavrusova. Meillet told the Adnkronos news agency that Vavrusova filed a denouncement with Rome police stating: \u201cThe photographer pushed me, touching my torso and chest with his arm. At this moment in which I present the complaint I still feel pain, it was very violent.\u201d Meillet told the news agency that Vavrusova was also in the hospital, though calls to the University Policlinico Umberto did not confirm her as a patient. Meillet also told the news outlet that in fact Depardieu had run to intervene after the photographer attacked his companion and \u201cslipped and fell on him.\u201d CNN has also reached out to Depardieu\u2019s lawyer for comment. A spokesperson for Rome police said they are currently looking for surveillance footage from the area. Barillari got his start as a celebrity paparazzi when he was just 16 years old by delivering photos he had taken of celebrities at the Trevi Fountain to various news outlets, according to his biography. He has been to the emergency room 200 times after being attacked by his subjects, he said in a documentary to mark his 70th birthday nine years ago. He went on to become Rome\u2019s most infamous paparazzi, publishing several books of his images which have included popes, presidents and stars like Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Liz Taylor and Frank Sinatra, according to his bio. He has suffered 82 broken cameras, 11 broken ribs and a broken femur after photographing a local celebrity allegedly beating up his girlfriend in Piazza Navona, where he lives and keeps a photo studio. Depardieu\u2019s run-in with Barillari comes after the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office told CNN last month that the French actor \u2013 known for his roles in films like \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Man in the Iron Mask\u201d and \u201cLife of Pi\u201d \u2013 would face trial in October over allegations of sexual assault said to have taken place during the shooting of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d in 2021. The actor is also being formally investigated on suspicion of rape and sexual assault allegedly committed in August 2018 against actress Charlotte Arnould, the prosecutor\u2019s office said.

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Two residents, Dean Wiggins, 78,\u00a0and\u00a0Pamela Wiggins, 77, were killed\u00a0when their home was struck by a\u00a0tornado, according to the Adair and Guthrie County Emergency Management Agency. Another\u00a0man, Michael Jensen, 73, died at his residence. And William Williamson, 70, succumbed to his\u00a0injuries after being\u00a0transported from his home to a hospital.

The city\u2019s hospital sustained damage and some patients were moved to other facilities in surrounding areas. At least four medical airlift flights occurred. A \u201cmakeshift hospital\u201d was set up in the city\u2019s lumberyard Tuesday right after the tornado tracked out of the area, State Rep. Ray Sorensen said Wednesday. Sorensen lives in the area and assisted with recovery efforts in the immediate aftermath. \u201cWe pulled a guy from the rubble and put him on a little makeshift stretcher that we made for him on the back of a truck,\u201d Sorensen recalled. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows homes and other structures were obliterated and the community is blanketed with heaps of debris, tossed cars and uprooted trees. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific,\u201d Reynolds said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe until you can actually see the devastation.\u201d At least three tornadoes were reported in Iowa on Tuesday \u2013 part of a torrent of storms that left widespread power outages, structural damage and flooding across the US this week. Tornado reports have skyrocketed well-above average in recent weeks as the typically busiest period of severe weather season unfolds. The more than 800 tornadoes reported so far make 2024 one of the most active years for twisters on record. Greenfield, home to just over 2,100 residents, must now recover from the damage of the deadliest tornado in a year that\u2019s recorded fewer deaths from twisters than 2023. Despite the number of tornadoes this year, there had been 17 deaths from the beginning of 2024 until Tuesday, while 65 people died due to tornadoes during the same period last year. Nearly 15,000 homes and businesses were in the dark across Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. On Wednesday, a tornado hurtled through Temple, Texas \u2013 about 35 miles south of Waco \u2013 causing widespread power outages and making many roads dangerous or impassable. First responders were flooded with emergency requests and were prioritizing life-saving calls Wednesday night, the city said in a release announcing a disaster declaration. \u201cCurrently, no life-threatening injuries or fatalities have been reported,\u201d the release said. More than 125,000 homes and businesses in Texas were without power Thursday morning, including nearly 55,000 in Bell County, where Temple is located, according to PowerOutage.us. More than 200 homes destroyed in Iowa The governor expanded her disaster declaration from 15 counties to 32 on Thursday, and said state officials are working with the FEMA to get the federal declaration approved, citing \u201ca lot of destruction and damage across the state.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to process it as quickly as we can,\u201d said FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell. More than 200 homes were destroyed in Iowa, Reynolds said. Greenfield and other parts of western Iowa bore the brunt of the storms\u2019 catastrophic impacts: In Greenfield\u2019s county, Adair, 153 homes were either damaged or destroyed, according to Reynolds. A tornado also toppled a hulking wind turbine just south of Greenfield in Prescott, Iowa, and more than two dozen homes were damaged or destroyed in Montgomery County, including some \u201ccritical public facilities,\u201d emergency management officials said. No injuries have been reported but damage assessments are still ongoing. But Greenfield is the epicenter of Tuesday\u2019s event. \u201cThere is basically nothing left,\u201d Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday. Valerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, pleaded with God to protect her home and her family before she rode out the storm in her basement, she told KCCI. \u201cI was in the furnace room and then I heard (the storm) like a train,\u201d she said, describing insulation flying off of basement windows. \u201cI heard it, and I knew it was hitting.\u201d Warrior said the scale of damage is devastating to see, but she is confident residents will pull each other through the crisis. \u201cThey\u2019ll get through it. You already see people out helping each other, working together. And that\u2019s what they do, people come together when a tragedy happens. People come together to support and encourage each other.\u201d Fighting back tears, Warrior looked out the rubble strewn across her neighborhood and tried to crack a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jessica Jordan, Sara Smart, Amy Simonson, Andy Rose, Brad Parks and Raja Razek contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/weather/iowa-tornado-damage-storm-forecast-wednesday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_sport_indy-500-spt-intl", "text": "Josef Newgarden used a scintillating last-lap pass to win the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday for the second consecutive year in a race that started four hours late due to extreme weather. \u201cI\u2019m just so proud of the team. They crushed it. I mean, crushed it. \u2026 They came here with the fastest cars. We worked our tails off,\u201d Newgarden told race broadcaster NBC. The Indy 500, one of the most prestigious and highly-anticipated events of the motorsport calendar, began four hours late on Sunday afternoon after lightning and extreme weather caused organizers to pause pre-race festivities, evacuate fans from the grandstands and wait for rain to pass and the track to dry up. The race was initially scheduled to begin at 12:45 p.m. ET but was pushed back to 4:45 p.m. When it got underway, it was a fan\u2019s delight, with passes at the front of the field and in the pack. There were a race-record 16 different leaders and 87 lead changes. Newgarden and Pato O\u2019Ward battled for the win in the final laps, with Newgarden passing the Arrow McLaren driver on Turn 3 of the last trip around the 2.5-mile circuit to win the race by just 0.3417 of a second. Newgarden is the sixth driver to win back-to-back races in Indianapolis and the first since H\u00e9lio Castroneves in 2002. The win gave team owner Roger Penske 20 victories in \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\u201d Newgarden, a two-time IndyCar Series champion, and Team Penske were involved in a cheating scandal at the start of the season in March. Newgarden had his season opening victory in St. Petersburg, Florida, disqualified after IndyCar uncovered three Team Penske cars had illegal push-to-pass software on them. \u201cAbsolutely, they can say whatever they\u00a0want after this point, I don\u2019t care any more,\u201d Newgarden said after the Indy 500. O\u2019Ward was left near tears by his runner-up finish, a result that came two years after he similarly lost the lead of the Indy 500 on the last lap. \u201cJust so close again. So f\u2014\u2014 close,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just so painful when you put so much into it.\u201d He called Newgarden a great competitor. \u201cI knew it was going to be a fight until the end. Just two corners short,\u201d he said. \u201cI really thought that I did everything in my power to get it done.\u201d O\u2019Ward told reporters at a news conference that some of the other racers were driving like maniacs on restarts and he was driving defensively for 85% of the race. \u201cWe had so many near, near race-enders,\u201d he told NBC earlier. Third-place finisher Scott Dixon, who won the event in 2008, said the race was \u201cpretty full on.\u201d \u201cIt was pretty action-packed. At the end there when you\u2019re kind of capturing third, you hope that the first two are going to take each other out, but obviously that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. \u201cA little bit of drama, but I thought everybody raced pretty cleanly,\u201d Dixon added. The Indy 500 regularly shares a date with the famous Monaco Grand Prix, known as the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of the Formula One calendar. Earlier Sunday, hometown hero Charles Leclerc won the race around the streets of Monte Carlo for the first time. 500 miles, a flight, then more racing NASCAR Cup points leader Kyle Larson is attempting to drive the Indy 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day \u2013 a feat made more difficult due to the weather delay. Larson raced in Indy and led some laps but finished 18th as an Indianapolis 500 rookie. He had qualified an impressive fifth as a driver for Arrow McLaren. After driving in the Indy 500 and doing postrace media, Larson will head to the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina in an attempt to finish two major motorsport races in the same day, though he will have to take over from another driver who will take his place for the start of the 600. The green flag for the NASCAR race came at 6 p.m. ET. Larson, the 2021 NASCAR Cup Series champion, is attempting to become the fifth driver to start both races. John Andretti was the first to accomplish this in 1994, with Robby Gordon and Tony Stewart subsequently taking on the Double on five and two occasions respectively. It was most recently attempted by Kurt Busch in 2014. \u201cThe Double\u201d is regarded as one of the toughest challenges in motorsport due to the mental and physical toll of driving 1,100 miles in a single day, navigating the differences between open-wheel and stock cars and the exhausting travel schedule. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be just referenced as the greatest NASCAR driver of all time or the greatest sprint car driver of all time, I want to be known as somebody who could climb into all different types of cars and be great at what they do,\u201d Larson said in 2021, per NASCAR. Defying Father Time One of only four drivers to win the Indy 500 four times, Castroneves was seeking history on Sunday when he lined up at the Brickyard for the 24th time. A win on Sunday for the Brazilian would have seen him stand alone as the only person to win the race on five occasions. At 49 years old, Castroneves was aiming to become the oldest \u2018500 winner ever and does not plan to hit the brakes any time soon. Despite high hopes, he finished in 20th place Sunday. \u201c(Racing at 50) was always my goal, but I don\u2019t want to just \u2018do it\u2019,\u201d he told Indy Star. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re still very competitive, and not only just to win, but to make people go crazy here, and that\u2019s what I want to do. \u201cRight now, I want to keep it going, because that\u2019s what I know best. I\u2019m sure this will change, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be in the near future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/sport/indy-500-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Mackinlay, who is a member of parliament for the governing Conservative party, representing South Thanet in southeast England, fell ill on September 28, 2023. He told the BBC that he started to feel ill and turned \u201ca very strange blue\u201d within about 30 minutes. \u201cMy whole body, top to bottom, ears, everything, blue,\u201d he said in an interview released Wednesday, describing the symptoms of septic shock. Sepsis is the body\u2019s extreme response to an infection. It can be spurred by any type of infection, even a minor one, and occurs when germs enter a person\u2019s body and multiply, causing illness and organ and tissue damage. The life-threatening condition requires urgent medical care to prevent organ damage and death. In some cases, sepsis or the infections leading up to it are not properly identified because they can come with a wide range of symptoms such as confusion or disorientation, shortness of breath, high heart rate, fever, shivering or feeling very cold, extreme pain or discomfort, and clammy or sweaty skin, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mackinlay was put into an induced coma with multiple organ failures, and told UK media outlet GB News that there is a period of around three weeks where he can\u2019t remember what happened. When he woke up, he found that his hands and feet had turned black. \u201cI could see these things were probably lost,\u201d he said. On November 30, Mackinlay recorded a video from his hospital bed in which he showed the damage to his limbs. \u201cit\u2019s caused the complete death of my hands and also my feet,\u201d he said, describing them as \u201cgnarled, dry, dessicated\u201d and revealing that he was due to undergo a quadruple amputation the next day. \u201cThe reality is I probably shouldn\u2019t have survived this far,\u201d said Mackinlay. \u201cThe grim reaper let me survive, but he\u2019s taken his payment in four of my limbs,\u201d he adds. Mackinlay\u2019s wife, Kati Mackinlay, told GB News that doctors told her he had only a 5% chance of survival, but she remained hopeful. \u201cI never said goodbye, I never thought that\u2019s it for Craig,\u201d she said. \u201cI always knew that Craig would pull through and he did.\u201d The operation, in which his arms were amputated from the elbow and his legs from the knee, took around 4-5 hours, Mackinlay told GB News. He then went through a rehabilitation process to learn how to live with prosthetic arms and legs. He has also some scarring to his face and ears due to a lack of blood supply, he added. Nonetheless, Mackinlay is eager to get back to work. \u201cGet back into the saddle, get back into Parliament, get back doing the things I enjoy,\u201d he told GB News.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/uk/craig-mckinlay-sepsis-return-scli-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss, 72, is accused of leading the plot, which would have led to him becoming Germany\u2019s head of state. The prince appeared at a specially erected high-security courtroom in Frankfurt alongside eight other defendants, including former judge Birgit Malsack-Winkemann, who was allegedly ready to become minister of justice. In total, nine ringleaders accused of treason are believed to have planned the resurrection of the German Reich, or empire, through violence, by storming the Bundestag, the national parliament, and kidnapping President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Tuesday marks the opening of the second of the three trials across Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Munich, forming one of the biggest anti-terror cases in modern German history. With 27 defendants in total, the case was split into three trials for logistical reasons. In addition to the five judges, two others will be on standby for the Frankfurt trial in the event of a long-term absence. Around 260 witnesses will be summoned and up to 45 officers will ensure security on site. Malsack-Winkemann, an ex-lawmaker for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, allegedly led several co-defendants around the Reichstag building scouting the location. The defendants also include former army officers Maximilian Eder and Ruediger von Pescatore, who allegedly shared \u201ca deep aversion to German state institutions and to the democratic basic order,\u201d the Hesse higher regional court said in a statement. The plot by the terror organization to overthrow the German government and install martial law was uncovered in 2022. The group had planned to replace the government with a cabinet-like council and a military wing since August 2021, according to the charges. The plotters amassed almost $550,000 in funds and had access to a massive armory, according to the Public Prosecutor.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/europe/germany-far-right-plot-heinrich-xiii-prince-reuss-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

However, they\u2019re now at risk of being destroyed because of erosion from increasing storms and rainfall. The site is one of 22 new projects to be funded by the British Council\u2019s Cultural Protection Fund, which protects cultural heritage at risk from conflict and/or the climate crisis. In the skies, severe airplane turbulence is something we could be seeing more of in the years to come because of climate change, and the episodes might last longer, too. Here\u2019s why. One person was killed and 104 were injured on board a Singapore Airlines plane Tuesday after the aircraft rapidly plunged before ascending several hundred feet, then repeated the drop and climb.

{"id": "travel_hadrians-wall-women-history-vindolanda", "text": "A party invitation. A broken flipflop. A wig. Letters of complaint about road conditions, and an urgent request for more beer. It sounds like the aftermath of a successful spring break, but these items are nearly 2,000 years old. They\u2019re just some of the finds from Hadrian\u2019s Wall \u2013 the 73-mile stone wall built as the northwestern boundary of the Roman Empire, sealing off Britannia (modern-day England and Wales) from Caledonia (essentially today\u2019s Scotland). While most of us think of Pompeii and Herculaneum if we\u2019re thinking of everyday objects preserved from ancient Rome, this outpost in the wild north of the empire is home to some of the most extraordinary finds. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dramatic stamp on the countryside \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more redolent of saying you\u2019re entering the Roman empire than seeing that structure,\u201d says Richard Abdy, lead curator of the British Museum\u2019s current exhibition, Legion, which spotlights the everyday life of Roman soldiers, showcasing many finds from Hadrian\u2019s Wall in the process. A tenth of the Roman army was based in Britain, and that makes the wall a great source of military material, he says. But it\u2019s not all about the soldiers, as excavations are showing. A multicultural melting pot Hadrian, who ordered the wall to be built in 122CE after a visit to Britannia, had a different vision of empire than his predecessors, says Frances McIntosh, curator for English Heritage\u2019s 34 sites along Hadrian\u2019s Wall. \u201cAll the emperors before him were about expanding the empire, but Hadrian was known as the consolidator,\u201d she says. He relinquished some of the territory acquired by his predecessor Trajan, and \u201cdecided to set the borders\u201d \u2013 literally, in some cases, with wooden poles at sites in Germany, or with stone in Britannia. Where those poles rotted thousands of years ago, the wall is still standing: \u201cA great visual reminder\u201d of the Roman empire, says McIntosh. It\u2019s not just a wall. There\u2019s a castle every mile along, and turrets at every third-of-a-mile point, with ditches and banks both north and south. \u201cYou can imagine the kind of impact that would have had, not just on the landscape but on the people living in the area,\u201d says McIntosh. And thanks to the finds from the wall, we know a surprising amount about those people. Although historians have long thought of army outposts as remote, male-dominant places, the excavations along the wall show that\u2019s not the case. Not only were soldiers accompanied by their families, but civilians would settle around the settlements to do business. \u201c You can almost see Housesteads as a garrison town,\u201d says McIntosh. \u201cThere were places you could go for a drink and so on.\u201d The Roman rule of thumb was not to post soldiers in the place they came from, because of the risk of rebellion. That meant Hadrian\u2019s Wall was a cultural melting point, with cohorts from modern-day Netherlands, Spain, Romania, Algeria, Iraq, Syria \u2013 and more. \u201cIt was possibly more multicultural because it was a focus point,\u201d says McIntosh, who says that the surrounding community might have included traders from across the empire. Soldiers were split into two groups. Legionaries were Roman citizens from Italy, who had more rights than other soldiers and imported olive oil, wine and garum (a sauce made from decomposing fish). They worked alongside auxiliaries \u2013 soldiers from conquered provinces, who had fewer rights, but could usually acquire citizenship after 25 years of service. Soldiers carved their names and regiments on stones to show which part of the wall they built \u2013 around 50 of them are on display at Chesters fort. But the wall shows that women and children were equally present. McIntosh says that pottery brought to the camps \u2013 from the Low Countries and North Africa \u2013 shows that the soldiers \u201cbrought their families, who cooked in traditional style.\u201d Archaeologists have found what seems to be an ancient tagine for North African-style cooking. A tombstone from Arbeia fort for a woman named Regina shows she was a freed slave from southern Britain who was bought by \u2013 and married to \u2013 a Syrian soldier. Another woman buried at Birdoswald fort was laid to rest with chainmail that appears to be from modern-day Poland. \u201cPerhaps she married someone in the army,\u201d says McIntosh, who calls the wall a \u201cmelting pot of people from all over the world under the banner of the army.\u201d \u201cThey brought their own religions, as well as worshipping Roman gods and adopting local deities,\u201d she adds. At Carrawburgh, a temple to Mithras \u2013 an originally Persian deity \u2013 sat near a spring with a shrine to a local water spirit. \u2018Wretched little Brits\u2019 Some of the most extraordinary finds from the Roman empire are coming from one site on Hadrian\u2019s Wall: Vindolanda. Here, archaeologists have found a wealth of organic remains because of what curator Barbara Birley calls the \u201cunusual conditions onsite.\u201d At Vindolanda there are the remains of at least nine forts over 14 levels. \u201cWhen the Romans would leave, they would knock down timber forts, and cover the area with turf and clay, sealing the layers underneath,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it happened so many times, the bottom five or six layers are sealed in anaerobic conditions, so things don\u2019t decay. When we get down there, we get wooden objects, textiles, anything organic.\u201d Vindolanda has the largest collection of Roman textiles from a single site in western Europe, as well as the largest leather collection of any site in the Roman empire \u2013 including 5,000 shoes, and even a broken leather flip-flop. \u201cWe probably had a population of 3,000 to 6,000 depending on the period, so 5,000 is a lot,\u201d says Birley. For Abdy, the shoes evoke the conditions of the wet borderlands. \u201cWomen\u2019s and children\u2019s shoes are hobnailed \u2013 you needed it in the mucky frontier dirt tracks. They\u2019re very evocative.\u201d There\u2019s even a wig made from a local plant, hair moss, which is said to repel midges \u2013 the scourge of Scotland during the summer. A centurion\u2019s helmet is also crested with hairmoss \u2013 the ancient equivalent of spraying yourself with insect repellent. The first woman to write in Latin One of the most famous finds is the trove of wooden writing tablets \u2013 the largest found anywhere. \u201cThey give a snapshot of what life was actually like,\u201d says Birley. \u201cWe understand so much more from written correspondence than from \u2018stuff,\u2019 and, archaeologically, it\u2019s the stuff that usually survives \u2013 things like metals and ceramics. \u201cThese were written in ink, not on a wax stylus tablet, and we believe they were used for what we\u2019d put in emails: \u2018The roads are awful,\u2019 \u2018The soldiers need more beer.\u2019 Everyday business.\u201d The tablets \u2013 or \u201cpersonal letters\u201d as Birley describes them \u2013 were found on the site of a bonfire when the ninth cohort of Batavians (in the modern-day Netherlands) were told to move on. \u201cThey had a huge bonfire and lots of letters were chucked in the fire. Some have been singed \u2013 we think it may have rained,\u201d she says. One of them calls the locals \u201cBritunculi\u201d \u2013 \u201cwretched little Brits.\u201d Another talks about an outbreak of pinkeye. One claims that the roads are too bad to send wagons; another laments that the soldiers have run out of beer. Among the 1,700 letters are 20 that mention a woman called Sulpicia Lepidina. She was the wife of the commander of the garrison, and seems to have played a crucial role. There\u2019s a letter to her from another woman, Paterna, agreeing to send her two medicines, one a fever cure. Birley says it\u2019s similar to today. \u201cIf you\u2019re a group of moms, still today we say, \u2018Do you have the Calpol?\u2019 It\u2019s very human.\u201d For Abdy, it\u2019s a sign that women were traders. \u201cShe\u2019s clearly flogging her medicines,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really great stuff.\u201d Another tablet is an invite from Claudia Severa, the wife of another commander at a nearby camp. It\u2019s an invitation to a birthday party. Under the formal invitation, presumably written by a scribe, is a scrawl in another hand:\u00a0\u201cI shall expect you, sister. Farewell, sister, my dearest soul.\u201d Presumably written by Claudia herself, it is thought to be the earliest example of a woman\u2019s handwriting in Latin. Without the organic finds \u2013 the shoes and the letters that indisputably belonged to women, unlike jewellery or weaving equipment \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to prove conclusively that women lived in significant numbers. Vindolanda \u201cillustrate the missing gaps,\u201d says Abdy. For Birley, they prove that women were as crucial a part of army communities as men. \u201cBefore the Lepidina tablets were found we didn\u2019t really understand the interactions between the soldiers and their wives,\u201d she says. Another tablet is written by what is thought to be a Spanish standard-bearer\u2019s common-law wife, ordering military equipment for her partner. \u201cThe Vindolanda collection is showing that there weren\u2019t just camp followers and prostitutes; women were part of everyday life, and contributing to the military community in many ways,\u201d says Birley. Abdy says that Hadrian\u2019s Wall is interesting because the resident women span \u201call classes of society,\u201d from Regina \u2013 the dead freedwoman, who would have been \u201cbottom of the heap\u201d \u2013 to the trader Paterna and the noblewoman Lepidina. And of course, there\u2019s the wall itself. \u201cIn the Netherlands and Germany the finds are often stunning and better preserved \u2013 you go to museums and are bowled over. But in terms of structural remains, Hadrian\u2019s Wall must be among the best,\u201d says McIntosh, modestly, of her site. Abdy agrees: \u201cI can\u2019t think of many symbols so redolent of imperial will than that wall.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/hadrians-wall-women-history-vindolanda/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

The disaster hit the remote village of Kaokalam, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby, at approximately 3 a.m. local time on Friday, leaving a scar of debris that humanitarian workers say is\u00a0as big as four football pitches. Three bodies have so far been recovered, but \u201cwe are expecting the number to be significant,\u201d Sandis Tsaka,\u00a0provincial administrator of Enga province, told CNN. More than 100 are believed to be dead, Janet Philemon, caretaker and national treasurer of the Papua New Guinea Red Cross Society, previously told CNN. Tsaka said on Saturday that the landslides impacted about 3,900 people. Humanitarian group CARE Australia said, citing local authorities, that \u201cover 60 homes have been destroyed, and at present, all members of these households remain unaccounted for.\u201d Serhan Aktoprak, head of mission for the International Organization for Migration in the country, described the scale of the human catastrophe. \u201cChildren are separated from their mothers and fathers. Relatives are trying to find their missing ones. That\u2019s\u2026 not helping a lot because people are still in shock,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cEvery minute that passes is basically decreasing our hopes and increasing our frustrations.\u201d Emergency responders were deployed to the site, but rescue efforts have been hampered by damage to a main highway, which limited access to affected areas, according to Tsaka. \u201cThe impact area is huge, 150 meters of the road is gone and the landslide area is very active - moving debris and moving rocks - which is making it difficult for our first responders,\u201d he said, adding the debris is about 6 to 8 meters (around 20 to 26 feet) deep. CARE Australia said the obstruction \u201cwill likely take considerable time to clear.\u201d \u201cWhile the area is not densely populated, our concern is that the death toll could be disproportionately high,\u201d it said. A Pacific nation home to around 10 million people,\u00a0Papua New Guinea\u00a0is rich in resources. But its economy has long trailed those of its neighbors, and it has one of the highest crime rates in the world. Hundreds of tribes are spread across the country\u2019s remote and often inaccessible terrain. But its vast and diverse mountainous landscape, as well as a lack of roads, has made it difficult and costly to upgrade basic services like water, electricity and sanitation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/world/bodies-recovered-papua-new-guinea-landslide-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_world_qatar-airways-turbulence-dublin-injured-intl", "text": "Twelve people were injured after a Qatar Airways flight from Doha to Dublin was hit with turbulence on Sunday. The flight, which landed in Dublin shortly before 1pm local time, was met by emergency services, including airport police and the fire and rescue department. According to a statement from Dublin Airport, six passengers and six crew members were injured in the incident, eight of which were taken to hospital following assessment. The Qatar Airways flight QR017 experienced turbulence while flying over Turkey, the statement said. Dublin Airport said it was assisting passengers and staff and that operations were unaffected. The plane\u2019s return flight to Doha, flight QR018, is scheduled to go ahead as expected, though its departure will be delayed, the airport said. In a statement to CNN, Qatar Airways said that the flight landed safely in Dublin, but that \u201ca small number of passengers and crew sustained minor injuries in flight and are now receiving medical attention.\u201d \u201cThe matter is now subject to an internal investigation,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThe safety and security of our passengers and crew are our top priority.\u201d It comes days after 104 passengers were injured and a man with a heart condition was killed on a Singapore Airlines flight that was hit with severe turbulence. Flight SQ321 from London to Singapore was cruising at 37,000 feet on Tuesday\u00a0when the plane\u00a0dropped sharply before climbing\u00a0several hundred feet, according to flight tracking data. It then repeatedly dipped and ascended for about a minute. Is turbulence on the rise? About 65,000 aircraft suffer moderate turbulence every year in the US, and about 5,500 run into severe turbulence. These numbers, however, might be destined to grow. Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom, told CNN in 2022 that he believes climate change is modifying turbulence. \u201cWe ran some computer simulations and found that severe turbulence could double or triple in the coming decades,\u201d Williams said. The findings, which were later confirmed by observations, highlight a type of turbulence called \u201cclear air turbulence,\u201d which isn\u2019t connected to any visual clues such as storms or clouds. Unlike regular turbulence, it hits suddenly and is hard to avoid. Singapore Airlines\u00a0has previously\u00a0said its flight encountered sudden turbulence.\u00a0A spokesperson said Sunday that its investigations are ongoing. An\u00a0earlier\u00a0CNN analysis of satellite data found the flight entered an area where thunderstorms were developing, which can produce turbulence. It is not yet known what kind of turbulence the Qatar Airways plane experienced. CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect that the cause of the turbulence that hit the Singapore Airlines flight is yet to be determined and that investigations are ongoing. An earlier version also misstated the number of the Qatar Airways flight that experienced turbulence. It was flight QR017.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/world/qatar-airways-turbulence-dublin-injured-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
