{"id": "2024_06_30_world_nato-europe-biden-debate-performance-alarming-intl", "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s performance at the CNN\u00a0presidential debate against Donald Trump has raised\u00a0concerns with\u00a0US\u00a0allies - particularly within NATO and Europe. Those concerns, to be clear, are not about whether or not Biden is fit to make decisions. They are not worried that he will implement dangerous policies or take dramatic actions internationally \u2013 always a factor when talking about the person in charge of the world\u2019s most powerful armed forces, a nuclear arsenal and largest economy. The common view among US allies is that Biden is a sensible man who surrounds himself with sensible people and whatever happens, they will continue to make rational, reasonable decisions. Nor is the concern that Biden\u2019s stumbling, at times incomprehensible, performance has ensured a second Trump term. The prospect of a Trump return is a concern, but it has already been baked into allied thinking. Europe, in particular, has never really moved on from Trump 1.0 and has held the view since 2020: that if it could happen once, it could happen again. That has been at the heart of European strategic thinking since Trump took office in 2016 and has continued through Biden\u2019s presidency. The concerns that America\u2019s allies have are that the most powerful country on earth cannot provide the one thing they most want: stability. Removing a candidate this late in the electoral cycle, diplomats fear, could undermine the whole process. It could allow adversaries like China and Russia to lash out at the US democratic system, making it look weak in comparison to their autocracies where strongmen grip power tight. This may sound trivial, but diplomacy at this level is often seen in zero-sum terms: something bad or embarrassing for the West, particularly the mighty US, is good for its enemies. These small shows of supposed weakness create openings for adversaries to spread propaganda, sow divisions in the US and the West itself through disinformation. These risks would be bad enough in removing a candidate, but imagine if these conversations are taking place once Biden had secured a second term. Constant speculation about his ability to govern at home and abroad might be unfounded at a policy level, but it would doubtless create division, distrust and panic throughout his second term. What might that materially mean? Would Biden be able to push things like aid for Ukraine through the House? Would he have the political capital to take potentially unpopular action in the Middle East or Indo-Pacific if those regions further destabilise? And would a question mark over the White House\u2019s power embolden America\u2019s global adversaries in to act more aggressively in their own backyards? Meeting all of these challenges effectively requires stability. That brings us back to Thursday night. The world saw an old man struggling to speak eloquently or coherently. Whether you are a supporter or opponent, that performance\u00a0raises legitimate questions about whether or not he is simply too old for the job he wants to keep doing. Stability means more than political stability or consistency. If the noise and questions about Biden\u2019s ability to govern continue, allies fear that he will be unable \u2013 fairly or unfairly \u2013 to provide the stability the West desperately needs at an uncertain time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/world/nato-europe-biden-debate-performance-alarming-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_asia_arzo-afghan-girl-suicide-attempt-pakistan-taliban-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "Holding a mirror steady in one hand, Arzo carefully applies pencil to her brows as she gets ready for an English lesson a short walk from her home on the outskirts of\u202fPakistani megacity Karachi. Every step toward the classroom takes her closer to a future she no longer thought possible almost a year ago when she walked downstairs at her family\u2019s home in Afghanistan and tried to take her own life. \u201cOn that day, I felt like everything was over. I was overwhelmed by hopelessness, and that\u2019s why I drank acid, convinced it would end my life,\u201d said Arzo, whom CNN first met last November as she lay in bed, too weak to speak. At the time, she was 15 years old but weighed as much as a 4-year-old, her limbs painfully thin after months of starvation despite her siblings\u2019 best efforts to feed her through a tube inserted in her stomach. Now, after an extraordinary intervention, Arzo is making a remarkable recovery \u2013 but she faces a new threat that could force her family to return to Afghanistan, and a life under Taliban rule that has become so intolerable for women and girls that some would rather die. Pakistan, a place of refuge for millions of Afghans, is carrying out a mass deportation program that has already seen more than 600,000 people cross the border since September 15 \u2013 with the threat that more could follow in July, when another class of visas expires.  What awaits them is a system of gender apartheid \u2013 violations against women and girls so \u201csevere and extensive\u201d that a senior United Nations official says they may amount to crimes against humanity. It was what drove Arzo to try to take her own life. \u201cThe gravity and scale of the crimes cannot be overstated,\u201d Richard Bennett, the UN\u2019s Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, told a Human Rights Council meeting on June 18, as he presented his damning report on the Taliban\u2019s rule. \u201cWe have a collective responsibility to challenge and dismantle this appalling system and to hold those responsible to account,\u201d he said. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected the report as an attempt to \u201ctarnish perceptions\u201d of Afghanistan before a rare meeting this weekend between UN member states and Taliban officials in Doha, Qatar. Despite strong condemnation of the Taliban by most UN member states, the issue of women\u2019s rights will not be on the formal agenda. Instead, talks with Taliban officials will focus on counternarcotics and the private sector. Afghan women and other civil society members weren\u2019t invited to the meeting \u2013 they\u2019ll meet separately with member states, without the Taliban, the next day, according to a UN official. Rights groups are furious the Taliban meeting is going ahead without Afghan women, and say it legitimizes Afghanistan\u2019s leaders and fails to hold them to account for grave injustices. Smuggled across the border Arzo is not her real name. She and her older brother and sister, Ahamad and Mahsa, are using aliases to protect their family members in Afghanistan from reprisals from the Taliban, who have sought to silence critics of their repressive rule. They\u2019re also hiding from Pakistani authorities, who have threatened to arrest and deport undocumented foreigners, making every trip outside their rented room fraught with risk. After Arzo drank the acid in Afghanistan last July, a doctor told her family she\u2019d likely die if treated there, so they smuggled her across the border to Pakistan, where another doctor inserted a feeding tube into her stomach. For a year, the siblings have spent almost every hour inside a rented room in Karachi with three single beds, a ceiling fan and a carpet where they eat, study and read. For most of that time, Arzo has been confined to bed, unable to eat, after the acid created a stricture \u2013 or a blockage \u2013 in her esophagus. Every three hours, including through the night, Ahamad and Mahsa said they fed their little sister fluids \u2013 nutritional milk powder and juice \u2013 through the tube direct to her stomach. But it wasn\u2019t enough, and by November, Arzo weighed just 25 kilograms, or 55 pounds. By then, most of their money was gone, too, on rent and private medical bills. \u201cWe are financially broken here. Whatever we had, we spent it,\u201d Arzo\u2019s brother Ahamad, a 27-year-old journalist under threat from the Taliban due to his occupation, told CNN in November. \u201cI don\u2019t cry in front of her, but I kiss her and cry while she sleeps at night, for her future, for her treatment, so she can survive this sickness,\u201d he said. A lifesaving intervention Within hours of Arzo\u2019s story airing on CNN last December, an email arrived with the offer of help. A non-profit organization volunteered medical care on the condition that its name wouldn\u2019t be published due to potential repercussions in Pakistan for aiding an Afghan who is residing in the country illegally. \u201cShe was 20 to 22kg at the time that we saw her,\u201d said the doctor who treated Arzo, whom CNN has also agreed not to name. \u201cShe had come to us on a wheelchair and was bedridden at that point. She was essentially one influenza, or cold, or other kind of infection away from essentially dying,\u201d he said. Doctors told her siblings to increase her caloric intake threefold, so she\u2019d be strong enough for her first medical procedure \u2013 an endoscopic examination that revealed severe damage to her esophagus, so that it had almost closed, making it impossible to eat. Using X-ray guidance, the doctors passed a wire through a gap the size of a pinhole and inflated a tiny balloon to slowly widen the passage. \u201cOver the course of two months or so, with multiple staged procedures, we were able to open it up to the point where she was able to eat by mouth, which itself was a game changer,\u201d the doctor told CNN. Arzo\u2019s brother Ahamad sent CNN regular WhatsApp messages. \u2018These lives are not worth anything\u2019 During an interview this month, Arzo sat upright on the bed, straightened her head scarf and spoke for the first time about why she tried to take her own life. It was July 2023, and she was sitting on the second floor of her family\u2019s two-story home, in a remote Afghan province, eating what would be her last meal for months. \u201cAs I ate food at home, I glanced at pictures of my classmates and felt a deep sense of longing for them,\u201d she said. Arzo hadn\u2019t seen her classmates since the Taliban banned girls from secondary education after seizing power in August 2021, and rarely messaged them because the internet connection was cut to her family\u2019s village. So, in a moment of grief for the friends and the life that she loved, she walked downstairs to the battery her family used to power their home and drank its contents. Her sister Mahsa found her and forced her fingers down her throat to make her vomit. \u201cWhen I asked her why she had done such a thing, her response was heartbreaking,\u201d said Mahsa. Arzo had told her: \u201cThese lives are not worth anything,\u201d she said. At the time, Arzo was just 15. Mahsa also lost everything with the Taliban takeover. She was 22 and had graduated from high school before the Taliban banned girls from getting an education beyond elementary school. She held ambitions to become a dress designer or to work in a beauty salon, but those career paths were soon shut down. \u201cWhen I went to Kabul, I enrolled in a tailoring program. However, for three months, I lived in constant fear as the Taliban would visit our workshop daily and criticize us for not wearing the hijab. They eventually forced us to shut down the workshop,\u201d she said. The Taliban ordered beauty salons to close in July 2023. Instead of working, Mahsa found herself in Pakistan caring for Arzo, who was in constant pain with no medication to ease her suffering. \u201cWhen she was asleep, it provided a brief respite from the distress, but the moments when she was awake during our meals were particularly challenging for us to endure,\u201d Mahsa said. Arzo\u2019s treatment has allowed them both to think about their future, and for the first time in years, they\u2019ve glimpsed the possibility of a better life. \u201cWhen hope is lacking and life seems directionless, unexpected events can present themselves,\u201d Mahsa said. Arzo is determined to put the past behind her and has urged other girls in Afghanistan not to follow her lead. \u201cMy message to all girls in Afghanistan who can\u2019t continue their education or go to school is to stay strong and don\u2019t lose hope.\u201d No safe haven in Pakistan While the Taliban is in power, Arzo does not want to go back to Afghanistan, but she and her siblings are not wanted in Pakistan. Last October, Islamabad gave around 1 million undocumented Afghan migrants one month to leave the country or face arrest and deportation. More than 600,000 people fled \u2013 most voluntarily, though 89% said they did so for fear of arrest, according to UN data. Of the total, more than 30,000 people were arrested and deported. On the outskirts of Karachi, residents in one Afghan community thought they were safe from the deportation drive. Security officials came to their area late last year and painted red numbers on their homes to show how many people lived there and their visa status. \u201cAt the beginning, the local people were happy over the markings because \u2026 it would certify that only registered Afghan refugees were living in a specific premises,\u201d said lawyer Moniza Kakar, who showed CNN the markings. Some houses were marked with \u201cACC\u201d (Afghan Citizen Card), others with \u201cPOR\u201d (Proof of Registration) \u2013 both forms of identification issued to Afghans long before the Taliban\u2019s return. But then in April, the government added around 800,000 ACC holders to its removal list. And the expiry date for POR cards was set to June 30, putting another 1.35 million people at risk of deportation. Rain had already washed away some of the red paint, then residents tried to scrub it off to avoid encounters with police, said Kakar, managing partner at Abbas and Kakar Law Offices, who helps community members navigate Pakistan\u2019s immigration system. \u201cThey feel fear and uncertainty about what should happen to them,\u201d she said. Pakistan\u2019s policy on \u201cillegal foreigners\u201d is no different to that of other nations, Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mumtaz Zahra Baloch told CNN. \u201cIndividuals who are here illegally have to be dealt with according to Pakistani laws, and that includes fines, imprisonment and deportation,\u201d she said. Baloch told CNN on Friday that the government still hadn\u2019t decided whether to extend POR visas that were set to expire on Sunday, and had earlier said that Pakistan was considering the implications of \u201call the various options.\u201d Many of those at risk of deportation know little of Afghanistan. Amanullah was just a boy when his family sought refuge in Pakistan during the former Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s, an event that ultimately plunged the country into four decades of near constant conflict. Now he\u2019s firmly settled in the Afghan community in Karachi with seven children of his own, and two grandchildren. \u201cWe have nothing left in Afghanistan anymore,\u201d Amanullah told CNN. \u201cMy children have grown up here and know little about their homeland.\u201d A member of the Mughal tribe, Amanullah sells watermelon at a fruit stall, but he said some other residents had closed their businesses for fear of being deported with no notice. Pakistan has sheltered Afghan migrants for decades but now, amidst a surge in militant attacks on its territory, government officials say they present a security risk. The Taliban has denied any involvement, and relations between the two countries are worsening as they trade accusations \u2013 and in some cases retaliatory strikes. \u2018Our room is like a prison\u2019 In March, as Arzo began to regain strength, her brother Ahamad\u2019s messages turned to the threat of deportation and what that could mean for their family. There are ways out of Pakistan for people like Arzo, Ahamad and Mahsa, but they typically involve taking risky journeys across borders, or joining lengthy waiting lists to be relocated to a third country that agrees to receive them. Afghans without visas can\u2019t legally work in Pakistan, and many who fled Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover have already run out of money. Arzo and her siblings survive on handouts from a small number of supporters outside Pakistan, who are trying to raise enough money to sponsor them to move to Canada. But it\u2019s an expensive and time-consuming process, with no guarantee they won\u2019t be arrested and deported while they wait. Arzo realizes how lucky she is to be alive and says she\u2019s willing to go anywhere she can continue her education, to become a doctor like those who saved her life. \u201cI really thank all the doctors from the bottom my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cMy message to my friends is to be patient. One day, the Taliban will leave Afghanistan, and we will be able to pursue our goals.\u201d But until then, women and girls live in a suffocating silence, where the Taliban have issued at least 52 new edicts since last June, tightening their control over the female population, according to the UN report. \u201cIt should shock all of us that that there\u2019s a country on this planet that denies girls access to education beyond sixth grade, that denies women access to most paid employment,\u201d said Heather Barr, associate women\u2019s rights director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cWomen can\u2019t go to a park. They can\u2019t walk in the sunshine; they can\u2019t exercise; they can\u2019t play sport,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, all of these things that make you feel human.\u201d Barr is scathing of the UN process and says it\u2019s clear that engaging with the Taliban has not worked. \u201cDiplomatic engagement in terms of getting the Taliban to respect women\u2019s rights has been a 100% failure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s achieved nothing. And so, it\u2019s time now for us to be talking about other strategies.\u201d She said countries could bring a case against the Taliban in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), much like South Africa\u2019s allegations of genocide against Israel over its military actions in Gaza, or Taliban leaders could be charged with gender\u202fpersecution in the International Criminal Court (ICC). \u201cIt (also) means diplomats and countries listening to the Afghan women\u2019s rights defenders, who are calling for the crime of gender apartheid to be recognized under international law,\u201d Barr added. In his report, UN special rapporteur Bennett also backed calls for gender apartheid to be a punishable offense and predicted a dystopic future for women and girls should the world fail to act. \u201cLeft unchecked, the Taliban\u2019s institutionalized system of gender oppression will become more robust, as those resisting it suffer increasing violence, as memories of female role models and notions of female independence fade, and as new generations are raised and radicalized in a society unquestioning of its dehumanization and exploitation of women and girls,\u201d he wrote. Arzo doesn\u2019t want a life like that for herself, her sister, or the women and girls still in Afghanistan. She\u2019s learning English, hopeful that one day soon she\u2019ll be able to leave Pakistan for a safe country. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future holds, but as long as I am in Pakistan, I will continue my lessons,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m determined to achieve my goals \u2026 Now I am not scared of anything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/asia/arzo-afghan-girl-suicide-attempt-pakistan-taliban-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_middleeast_israel-west-bank-settlements-international-condemnation-intl", "text": "Israel has sparked condemnation after the finance minister announced plans to legally recognize five unauthorized Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. As CNN has reported, the Israeli government has been\u00a0looking to \u201cstrengthen\u201d Jewish settlements\u00a0in the occupied West Bank after several countries unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state. The spokesperson for Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, told CNN that the Israeli government had agreed in a late-night cabinet to\u00a0recognize five Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that were built illegally and that Smotrich will release tax funds to the Palestinian Authority that Israel collects on its behalf. In a statement to CNN on Sunday, Smotrich\u2019s office said the decision to release funds to the Palestinian Authority was \u201cimmediate\u201d and would cover the past three months. Funds have been frozen following the October 7 attacks. CNN reached out to the Prime Minister\u2019s office, which has not yet publicly commented on the reports. Once authorized, settlements become more like parts of Israel, with access to water, electricity and medical care. The Palestinian Authority, which administers some areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, told CNN on Sunday that it has not yet received the funds from Israel. \u201cSo far, no money or official messages from the Israeli side have been received,\u201d an official source in the Palestinian Authority\u00a0said. Smotrich is a leading far-right member of the Israeli cabinet and opposes the creation of an independent Palestinian state. He has long advocated for the building of settlements, pointing to them as a means of preventing the West Bank becoming part of such an independent state.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe goal is to change the DNA of the system for many, many years,\u201d he said,\u00a0according to leaked audio\u00a0from a speech he made earlier this month. The European Union as well as several Middle Eastern countries have denounced the plans. In a statement posted on X on Saturday, EU spokesperson Peter Stano said the organization \u201ccondemns in the strongest terms\u201d the announcement by Smotrich. \u201cThis is another deliberate attempt at undermining peace efforts,\u201d he added. Qatar called the decision \u201ca new chapter in the ongoing violations of international legitimacy resolutions,\u201d according to Qatar\u2019s official news agency. In separate statements, Egypt and Saudi Arabia also called it a violation of international law and Security Council resolutions. \u201cEgypt strongly denounced Israel\u2019s exploitation of the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip to push more illegal settlement expansion and attempts to change the legal situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem,\u201d the Egyptian government said. Saudi Arabia said the moves \u201cundermine the chances for peace, fuel conflicts, and impair regional and international security and stability,\u201d according to a foreign ministry statement. Israel has\u00a0expanded settlements\u00a0in the occupied West Bank over decades despite signing a series of peace agreements with the Palestinians in the 1990s, called the Oslo Accords, that envisaged the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza as part of a negotiated resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Such settlements\u00a0are considered illegal under international law and by much of the international community.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/middleeast/israel-west-bank-settlements-international-condemnation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_middleeast_ultra-orthodox-in-israel-defy-orders-to-serve-in-military-mime-intl", "text": "As thousands of men hurried towards the main square in Jerusalem\u2019s ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim on Sunday for a protest, they passed signs declaring \u201cwar\u201d on a contentious order from Israel\u2019s highest court. The Supreme Court ruling on June 25 said the Israeli government must enlist draft-age ultra-Orthodox (or Haredi) Jews into the military, reversing a de facto exemption in place since the country\u2019s founding 76 years ago. Sunday\u2019s rally in Shabbat Square, which drew thousands, was to demonstrate against the decision, which another poster said had \u201cthrust a sword\u201d through the \u201cbeit midrash,\u201d or Torah study hall. The protest highlighted the fault line in Israeli society between ultra-Orthodox Jews, who Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu relies on to maintain his government, and other Israelis, many of whom believe that all Jewish citizens should serve in the military, especially during wartime. Many Haredi men spend much of their early lives out of the workforce, instead studying at religious schools known as yeshivas that are partly funded through government subsidies. For many Haredis, the idea that they would be pulled from studying scripture and drafted into Israel\u2019s military is simply out of the question. An arrangement made during Israel\u2019s founding exempted several hundred Haredi men from conscription. However, the community has since grown exponentially, allowing tens of thousands of ultra-Orthodox men to now avoid the draft. \u201cWe will not enlist,\u201d said Yosef, 22, who traveled to the protest from his home in Beitar Illit, a large Haredi settlement in the occupied West Bank. \u201cSince the beginning of the state (of Israel), we have not enlisted\u2026 Now they want to make us (serve) by force. It will never work,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a democratic state there is not much they can do besides put us in prison. We are not afraid of prison. We laugh about prison\u2026 and the more people that go into prison, the more demonstrations there will be in the country.\u201d As Yosef spoke, he looked up at a group of boys climbing a ladder to a nearby lamppost to hang a sign that read: \u201cWe will not enlist in the army.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t watch as they tear the Torah to shreds,\u201d said another man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, due to the cultural norms of his community, some of whom are not open to speaking to the press. \u201cWe can\u2019t be quiet. The High Court, the government, all the Knesset (parliament)\u2026 they are looking for ways for compromise and to send Haredi boys to be destroyed. We will die rather than be enlisted.\u201d The clashes between some protesters and police following the gathering in Mea Shearim \u00a0underscored the depth of emotion in the ultra-Orthodox community, many of whom believe that serving in the military is incompatible with their way of life. Some ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods like Mea Shearim shun modern technology. A man at Sunday\u2019s protest held a placard stating: \u201cLife is happy only without internet and films.\u201d Five people were arrested in confrontations after some threw rocks, set trash cans on fire and attacked the car of Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf, himself a Haredi Jew. \u2018God is going to help them\u2019 But Haredi journalist Yanki Farber told CNN in a telephone interview ahead of the protest that although the protesters in Mea Shearim would be among the most \u201cextreme\u201d of Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox communities, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u2014 requiring the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to recruit all Israeli men equally \u2014 had left the wider community reeling. He said that for many Haredis, the court\u2019s decision won\u2019t change their stance, adding that many said they would \u201cneed to starve because they\u2019re not going to have money to buy food,\u201d referring to the court\u2019s edict that the government must withdraw funding from any yeshivas whose students do not comply with draft notices. \u201cThey still refuse to join the Israeli army. They (say they) are just not worried about it. And they trust in God, that God is going to help them,\u201d said Farber, who writes for the ultra-Orthodox Hadrei Haredim website. Given that most other Israeli Jews are required to serve in the military, the Haredi exemption, \u201cwhile relying on disproportionate government subsidies,\u201d has fostered significant resentment among non-Haredi Jews,\u00a0according to the Israel Policy Forum. The issue came to a head after Israel invaded Gaza following Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack, when the IDF initiated the largest mandatory military mobilization since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Some lawmakers in Netanyahu\u2019s own coalition have joined the opposition in pushing for the Haredi community to enlist. Despite the court ruling, the military is unlikely to immediately call-up all draft-age Haredi men. The Attorney General\u2019s office said the IDF \u201chad committed to recruiting 3,000 yeshiva students in the current recruitment year.\u201d Amichai Milici, a 45-year-old army veteran and father of seven who now studies full-time at a yeshiva, said the IDF isn\u2019t ready to absorb more ultra-Orthodox men yet. \u201cThey don\u2019t have synagogues (in the military), they don\u2019t have places to learn the Torah, there are girls all over the place,\u201d he told CNN, adding that some fear that enlisting would make the Haredis less religious. \u201cThe people are afraid\u2026 When they go to the army, who says they are going to be religious after that? After three years, he ain\u2019t going to be with kippah.\u201d He insists that any man who wants to study the Torah should remain exempt from military service, arguing that religious studies and the defense of Israel are intertwined and essential for the nation\u2019s well-being. \u201cThe study of the Torah is central to the existence of the Jewish people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Jewish need the army and need the Torah\u2026 The Torah is giving power to the soldiers, and the soldiers are giving power to the Torah.\u201d Rabbis losing influence Many fear that mass enlistment could change the way of life in their insular neighborhoods. Farber, the Haredi journalist who once served in the IDF, said ultra-Orthodox rabbis may be worried about losing their influence. \u201cThe Haredi leaders, spiritual leaders\u2026 are very, very afraid that they are going to see thousands of young Haredi boys in uniform in (ultra-) Orthodox neighborhoods,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are afraid that being a soldier in the Haredi community will become something normal. And if you go into the IDF, you (might) start getting different ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cYou start opening your head to other opinions\u2026 and nobody\u2019s going to listen to the rabbis anymore.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party said in response to the Supreme Court ruling that it hoped to pass a \u201chistoric conscription law\u201d which would \u201csignificantly increase the recruitment rates\u201d of ultra-Orthodox men but also \u201crecognize the importance of Torah study\u201d \u2014 raising the possibility of the exemption continuing for a smaller number of yeshiva students. But a source in the political opposition told CNN they did not believe any bill on the matter that could secure the necessary majority support in the Knesset would be acceptable to Netanyahu\u2019s ultra-Orthodox coalition partners, for whom this was the \u201cnumber one issue.\u201d \u201cIn terms of legislative process (we are) stuck,\u201d the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive political matters candidly, said. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if they (the Ministry of Defense) forcefully tried to recruit people against their will, even though it\u2019s the law. But it puts them in a very difficult spot now because the court ruling was so clear.\u201d The source said it was unclear what would happen to draft-dodgers. Prison is the final step in a process that starts with denying passport issuances and holding back benefits. \u201cSo it could be that we see that sort of process for a large number of ultra-Orthodox men. How much that impacts their lives, I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/middleeast/ultra-orthodox-in-israel-defy-orders-to-serve-in-military-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

Fresh protests dubbed \u201cOne Million People March\u201d began Thursday, with demonstrators calling for roads leading to the capital Nairobi to be blocked. Others threatened to occupy the State House, the president\u2019s office,\u00a0and the official residence. In a surprise move on Wednesday, Ruto said he would not sign the finance bill, saying he had been \u201clistening keenly\u201d to the Kenyan people. He had been facing escalating protests over the bill, with a civil society organization saying at least 23 people had died in clashes. But so far his move has failed to quell the demonstrations. Security forces have set up roadblocks around routes leading to the State House while other parts of the capital city have been fortified with heavy police presence. \u201cIt\u2019s more than about the finance bill now,\u201d Maria, a Kenyan protestor from Nairobi told CNN. \u201c(They\u2019re) killing us as young people for what? We come in peace,\u201d she added. Despite being billed as a \u2018million people march,\u2019 turnout was noticeably lower in Nairobi\u2019s central business district, a CNN team observed. The heavy security presence within the city deterred a crowd from forming with police shouting at protesters to \u201cgo home\u201d in Swahili. What the largely youthful protesters now want varies. Some have called on President Ruto to resign for failing to withdraw the unpopular bill much earlier to save the lives lost. Others are seeking justice for the deceased protesters and demanding the recall of lawmakers who voted in support of the finance bill. \u201cI want them to listen to me,\u201d another protester told CNN. Civic groups such as the Law Society of\u00a0Kenya\u00a0are calling for the removal of\u00a0Kenya\u2019s inspector general of police and Nairobi\u2019s regional police commander after officers were accused of reportedly shooting dead protesters. Kenya, East Africa\u2019s dominant economy, has grappled with escalating living costs that have spiked food prices and other commodities. The nation also owes billions of dollars in foreign and local debts, spending a sizeable chunk of its revenue repaying its creditors. \u201cI am not going to preside over a bankrupt country, I am not going to preside over a country that is in debt distress,\u201d President Ruto said last month while defending his plans. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern about a \u201csignificant shortfall\u201d in Kenya\u2019s \u201ctax revenue collection\u201d while urging its government to consider measures to shore up its earnings to reduce borrowing. The bill proposed levies on locally produced products, such as diapers and sanitary towels, including taxes on motor vehicles, and\u00a0mobile money transfer fees, among others. Last week, Ruto shelved some of those taxes, but Kenyans remain angry, and called for the bill to\u00a0be\u00a0scrapped completely. International financial ratings\u00a0agency\u00a0Moody\u2019s warned that scrapping the bill \u201cwill create a revenue shortfall\u201d in Kenya\u2019s budgeting. Ruto warned of spending cuts across government financing if the tax measures were withdrawn. Ruto\u2019s leadership is now being tested like never before. His ability to navigate this period of unrest will be critical not only for his political survival but also for the stability of\u00a0Kenya. The ongoing protests suggest that mere policy reversals may not be sufficient. Analyst Herman Manyora, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi,\u00a0told CNN the\u00a0president\u00a0may need to engage in more substantial reforms to restore faith in his administration. \u201cThe way forward is for the president to go a little more than he has done now in order to get the goodwill of the people,\u201d Manyora said. \u201cHe needs to reshuffle his cabinet and economic advisers which will send a signal that will create the goodwill required. At that point, a government-led conversation can take place.\u201d Ruto, whose rise to the presidency was largely propelled by youth voters said in his address retracting the finance bill that he hoped to engage with young people in the country to listen to their ideas and proposals on how to solve the nation\u2019s economic challenges. But that won\u2019t come easy, Manyora said. \u201cThey (young people) feel betrayed.

Michou\u2019s colorful drag performances made him a household name in France and he was known for habitually dressing in extravagant blue outfits.

{"id": "2024_06_30_asia_us-military-rebuilds-runway-peleliu-palau-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "A US Marine Corps aircraft has landed on a rebuilt runway on a World War II-era Japanese airfield on the Pacific island of Peleliu, site of one of the Marines\u2019 bloodiest battles of the war and now a possible US basing option in a strategy to counter China. The KC-130 Hercules transport aircraft touched down on the 6,000-foot runway on June 22 in what a Marine Corps press release called \u201ca significant and triumphant return to this iconic World War II site.\u201d Marine engineers had been working on rebuilding the runway for months, clearing brush, removing trees and ensuring no unexploded ordnance remained from the World War II battle on the island, which is part of the island country of Palau. More than 1,500 US troops and nearly 11,000 Japanese were killed on Peleliu between August and November of 1944, according to the US Naval History and Heritage Command, which noted that some Japanese troops hid in the island\u2019s jungle and weren\u2019t found until two years after World War II ended. One US unit, the 1st Marine Regiment, suffered 70% casualties in six days of fighting on the island. The Marines named the rebuilt landing strip the \u201cSledge\u201d runway in honor of a veteran of the Peleliu battle, Pfc. Eugene Sledge, a mortarman on the island who wrote about it in a memoir \u201cWith the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa,\u201d and whose memories were portrayed in the HBO miniseries \u201cThe Pacific.\u201d Sledge described Peleliu as \u201can alien, unearthly, surrealistic nightmare like the surface of another planet.\u201d Now the runway \u201cbridges the past and the future, honoring WWII sacrifices while enhancing regional security and cooperation,\u201d the Marine Corps release said. That regional security has been largely focused on China in recent years, which the Pentagon identifies as its \u201cpacing threat.\u201d Part of mitigating the threat has been building facilities where the US could disperse assets like aircraft in the event of hostilities, including in the so-called Second Island Chain, locations far enough away from the Chinese mainland that Beijing would have difficulty striking targets there. The First Island Chain, in such places as Okinawa in Japan, and US bases in the Philippines, \u201cis neither a survivable nor viable operating location due to Chinese military capabilities in long-range bombers, cruise missiles, and theater ballistic missiles,\u201d US Air Force Lt. Col. Grant Georgulis wrote in a 2022 commentary posted on the US Defense Department website. \u201cThus, the United States should prioritize Midway Island, the Marianas, Palau, and the Marshall Islands to complement an already fortified Guam,\u201d Georgulis wrote. China has been deeply critical of Washington\u2019s alliance-building efforts in the Pacific, viewing them as an attempt to halt Beijing\u2019s rise as a military and economic superpower. Beijing has long felt boxed in by the US presence in the First and Second Island Chains and under leader Xi Jinping has become much more assertive in regional waters and confrontational with neighbors such as Japan and the Philippines. It has also sought to boost its own diplomatic and security ties across the Pacific region. \u201cIn a bid to protect its hegemony, the United States is forming blocs globally to target specific countries, provoke confrontation and destabilize the world,\u201d China\u2019s state-run Xinhua news agency wrote in a recent editorial. \u201cIt claims to protect its allies under mutual defense treaties, but in reality, the treaties serve as a tool to subordinate them to the superpower and push them to the forefront of conflicts.\u201d Reviving airfield used by US atomic bombers Meanwhile, on Yap island in the Federated States of Micronesia, midway between Guam and Palau, the US Air Force in its 2025 budget requested $400 million to extend the runway at the island\u2019s international airport \u2013 also a former Japanese military airfield \u2013 so it can be used by US military aircraft. The US is already performing work on other locations in the Second Island Chain, including reviving North Field on Tinian island in the Northern Marianas, from where the US bombers that dropped the atomic bombs departed in August 1945. \u201cThe United States must focus like a laser on the need for air superiority in the Pacific region. The United States must recapitalize islands gained during World War II to form a Second Island Chain of strategic expeditionary points,\u201d Georgulis wrote. For Washington, establishing strong ties to Pacific island states is also seen as a way to keep China from gaining footholds in the region. The Biden administration has signed a bilateral defense agreement with Papua New Guinea and reopened an embassy in the Solomon Islands since the beginning of 2023. Palau is a remote archipelago of coral and volcanic islands in the western Pacific and home to about 20,000 people. Since 1994, Palau has been covered by a compact of free association with the United States, making Washington responsible for its defense needs and allowing Palauans to serve in the US military. Palau last year signed a bilateral law enforcement agreement with Washington that will let the US Coast Guard enforce its laws in its exclusive economic zone without a Palau officer present. US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro visited Palau\u2019s capital of Koror in March as part of a Pacific trip that included stops at two key US allies, Japan and South Korea, during which he said Washington\u2019s partnership with the island state \u201cdirectly supports a free and open Indo-Pacific.\u201d \u201cI can assure you that the United States remains committed to Palau\u2019s national security,\u201d Del Toro said during a trip that also included a visit to the Peleliu island runway work. Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr. has been critical of China\u2019s increasingly assertive moves in the region, including toward Taiwan. Palau is one of the few remaining countries to diplomatically\u00a0recognize Taiwan over Beijing. Along with the runway, US Marines are helping make improvements to the Peleliu Civic Center Museum, to house artifacts from the World War II battle. At an event last month marking the landing of the Marine aircraft on Peleliu, island Gov. Emais Roberts thanked the US Defense Department for its efforts there. \u201cOur small island community has benefitted immensely with the US Marine presence. We value the great partnership, and we feel safe and protected with the support of the greatest country in this world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/asia/us-military-rebuilds-runway-peleliu-palau-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Recording Industry Association of America \u2013 the trade group on behalf of labels including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Records \u2013 filed two copyright infringement cases against AI companies Suno and Uncharted Labs, the developer behind Udio, for training their AI models with the labels\u2019 unlicensed sound recordings. Udio is the company behind \u201cBBL Drizzy,\u201d the AI-generated song that went viral last month during the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat. Udio was founded last year by former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant,\u201d according to the company. In April, it raised $10 million in funding. Meanwhile, Suno raised $125 million in funding last month. The platform, which allows users to create songs with only a few prompts, relies on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for lyrics and title development. Udio and Suno did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement that the lawsuits are \u201cnecessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical, and lawful development of generative AI systems and to bring Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s blatant infringement to an end.\u201d He added that the music community is already partnering and collaborating with \u201cresponsible developers to build sustainable AI tools\u201d that put artists and songwriters in charge, but unlicensed services can exploit an artist\u2019s work \u201cwithout consent or pay set back \u2026 .\u201d In April, more than 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves, J Balvin, Ja Rule, Jon Bon Jovi, The Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Miranda Lambert and more, signed an open letter\u00a0organized by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d The lawsuit against Udio states \u201cif developed with the permission and participation of copyright owners, generative AI tools will be able to assist humans in creating and producing new and innovative music.\u201d It added: \u201cBut if developed irresponsibly, without regard for fundamental copyright protections, those same tools threaten enduring and irreparable harm to recording artists, record labels, and the music industry, inevitably reducing the quality of new music available to consumers and diminishing our shared culture.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Suno states the company has over 10,000,000 users generating music files using the platform, bringing in about 2,000,000 streams. \u201cThese digital music files have been released to the public\u2014some already finding their way onto the major streaming services\u2014and compete with the copyrighted sound recordings that enabled their creation; yet Suno sought no permission from and gives no credit or compensation to the human artists or other rightsholders whose works fueled their creation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

{"id": "2024_07_02_weather_july-fourth-forecast-extreme-heat-climate", "text": "Grills won\u2019t be the only thing sizzling this Fourth of July as uncomfortable, potentially dangerous heat sets in for millions in the US. This summer started off unusually hot and is largely expected to stay that way, as forecasts show only fleeting moments of respite in the weeks ahead. Summertime heat will be in place for much of the Lower 48 for Independence Day as the US enters its hottest time of the year. But temperatures for two large sections of the country are expected to far exceed those typical of early July. Heat will ramp up in parts of the West and southern US this week, culminating in temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal in California and Oregon on Thursday and 5 to 10 degrees above normal from Texas and Oklahoma to the Carolinas. High temperatures in the 100s and 110s will hit parts of California\u2019s Central Valley while desert areas in Southern California, Nevada and Arizona will approach 115 degrees. Sacramento \u2014 which just experienced its fourth-hottest June on record \u2014 could come close to its hottest Fourth of July with a high near 107 degrees Thursday. Las Vegas could come within a couple degrees of its hottest-ever Independence Day when the mercury tops out around 112. Heat has been relentless for the city \u2014 this June was also its hottest on record. While Thursday won\u2019t be record-hot for Phoenix, temperatures in the city are expected to climb around 7 degrees above its normal high of about 107. Thursday is also likely to be the third day in a row where temperatures exceed the 110 degree mark for the city \u2014 a streak that will continue into next week. Thursday will be very hot for parts of the West but even higher temperatures are expected to follow. Brutal heat will expand into much of the Pacific Northwest on Friday and keep temperatures sky-high across California and the desert Southwest. Portland, Oregon, will swelter as temperatures climb into the mid-90s Thursday and soar to near 100 degrees on Friday \u2014 about 25 degrees hotter than normal. The South will also bake Thursday, but it won\u2019t quite reach the extremes the West will endure. High temperatures in the 90s will be widespread in the Southern states, with parts of Texas and Oklahoma set to reach into the low 100s. Dallas will climb to around 101 degrees Thursday, likely marking the fourth day in a row of the thermometer hitting triple digits. Typically, the metro should have a high of around 94 for Independence Day. Farther east, Atlanta should normally top out at around 88 degrees on the Fourth of July, but the city is expected to reach 94 degrees this time around. The heat comes after the city recorded 11 days in a row of temperatures at or above 90 degrees to the end of June and recorded its first 100 degree reading in nearly five years. Humidity will make the heat feel even worse in the South, sending heat index values \u2014 how hot the air actually feels to the body \u2014 over 100 degrees for millions. Dangerous heat index values coupled with outdoor activity for the holiday could result in heat-related illnesses without the proper precautions. In addition to the heat, Mother Nature will also provide her own Fourth of July fireworks. Thunderstorms will rumble over portions of the Mississippi Valley and Midwest from the morning hours onward as a cold front digs southward across the regions. Thunderstorms are also possible from parts of the Ohio Valley to the Northeast. As the day progresses, some severe thunderstorms are possible, mainly in parts of Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas during the afternoon and evening. These storms could unload damaging wind gusts, hail, heavy rain and even a tornado or two. Any storms that linger into the evening hours could disrupt fireworks displays. Rain may prevent organizers from launching fireworks and any lightning strikes will make it dangerous for large crowds to be outdoors. Major fireworks shows in Washington, DC, Philadelphia and New York City may have to deal with storms Thursday evening.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/weather/july-fourth-forecast-extreme-heat-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_26_tech_uae-ai-minister-omar-al-olama-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "The world\u2019s first minister dedicated to developing artificial intelligence (AI) strategy is already becoming embroiled in a global power struggle for tech supremacy. In April, Microsoft (MSFT) announced a $1.5 billion investment in G42, an AI group based in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and chaired by an influential member of the ruling royal family. The deal, which analysts say was motivated by the Biden administration\u2019s desire to limit Beijing\u2019s influence in the region as the US battles to maintain its lead over China in the AI race, firmly pulled the firm into the orbit of the United States. \u201cI think the UAE and the US really see eye to eye with regards to how these technologies are pushed forward,\u201d UAE AI Minister Omar Al Olama, who was appointed in 2017, told CNN in a recent video interview. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see more alignment there.\u201d G42, a holding firm, is comprised of seven companies that work across data centers, energy, healthcare, surveillance and biotechnology. Its controlling shareholder is Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who also serves as the UAE national security adviser. The UAE is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of fossil fuels, and Abu Dhabi sees its AI push as crucial for diversifying away from oil. AI could contribute $96 billion to the UAE economy by 2030, equivalent to nearly 14% of its gross domestic product, according to a report by PwC Middle East. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are at the frontier of the technology, and that\u2019s why we work with partners around the frontier,\u201d said Olama, \u201cand play by the rules that are set by the market leaders.\u201d Olama, whose ministerial remit includes digital economy and remote work applications, wants to make the UAE a global leader in artificial intelligence by 2031. The UAE has laid out a national strategy to get there. Its objectives include deploying AI in priority sectors such as energy and logistics, developing an ecosystem and attracting talent. The country is putting public officials through AI training, and Dubai is aiming to teach a million citizens effective prompt engineering, instructing AI models to produce high-quality output. As of September, the Gulf country had 120,000 people working on AI or related industries, up from 30,000 two years earlier, Al Olama has said. Choosing sides Sometimes, the country has had to prioritize its relationship with the US over Washington\u2019s rivals. A US Congressional committee called on the Commerce Department in January to investigate G42\u2019s links to Chinese military companies and intelligence services (G42 denied any such connections), and the Microsoft investment required G42 to cut ties with Chinese hardware suppliers, reportedly including Huawei, in favor of US companies. \u201cThe US does not shy away from saying that \u2018on this technology specifically you need to choose sides,\u2019\u201d said Olama. The UAE has historically performed a balancing act with its foreign policy. It cooperates with the US on a range of issues, including defense, and in recent years the US has sold tens of billions of dollars of military equipment to the Gulf nation. The Biden administration, which sees maintaining a lead in AI as crucial for its future economic success and national security, has implemented a series of measures including export controls on AI and semiconductor technologies to slow China\u2019s advancement in the industry. Washington has also limited the sale of sophisticated US chips to ensure China doesn\u2019t use Middle Eastern nations as a back door to access the newest AI technology, according to Reuters. Nvidia, the world\u2019s third biggest company after Microsoft and Apple, said in an August 2023 regulatory filing that the US government had informed the chipmaker that some of its products would face additional licensing requirements for \u201ccertain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\u201d Some US politicians have raised concerns that they don\u2019t have enough details about the deal between G42 and Microsoft and that US technology might be vulnerable to Chinese espionage in the UAE. The country has ties to Beijing, too, and China is a key trade partner. Olama insists the UAE is a trustworthy partner. \u201cI really don\u2019t think that there is any risk, especially since there\u2019s a lot of cutting-edge American technology that is in the UAE,\u201d said Olama, adding that he was speaking in his personal capacity, not as a government official. \u2018A leading tech power\u2019 In late 2023, Abu Dhabi\u2019s government-backed Technology Innovation Institute unveiled a large language model (LLM), the technology behind generative AI chatbots, called Falcon10B. It outperformed offerings from Google and Meta by some metrics. \u201cThe UAE put a stake in the ground in the AI race with Falcon,\u201d James Lewis, who studies technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington DC-based think tank, told CNN. In October 2023, a collaboration between Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, Silicon Valley-based Cerebras Systems and Inception, a subsidiary of G42, produced Jais, a generative AI model trained on Arabic as well as English. Its creators said it could pave the way for LLMs in other languages that are \u201cunderrepresented in mainstream AI.\u201d Unlike ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, Falcon and Jais are open-source, which means their code is available for anyone to use or change. By opening up the technology, Abu Dhabi is positioning itself as an ally to developing nations that don\u2019t have the resources to build their own AI tools. \u201cWe know that not every country can develop these systems or these tools,\u201d said Olama. \u201cSo, we want to ensure that we\u2019re able to develop it for them.\u201d Some analysts say the UAE\u2019s vast oil wealth will be key in developing hugely expensive AI infrastructure. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a financial story,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cIt gives them an edge in terms of being one of the leading tech powers in the future.\u201d As fears grow about the potential risks of AI, Olama has called for a global coalition to regulate the development and use of the technology. The stakes are high. In March, a report commissioned by the US State Department warned that the most advanced AI systems could, in a worst-case scenario, \u201cpose an extinction-level threat to the human species.\u201d Olama has some specific concerns. He expects deepfakes will cause a \u201cfundamental truth crisis\u201d and could drive a \u201cpolitical crisis.\u201d He\u2019s also worried that AI could make it easier to create biotech weapons. \u201cI try not to be a fear mongerer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are very few guardrails in place to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/tech/uae-ai-minister-omar-al-olama-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_01_asia_north-korea-failed-missile-test-south-korea-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "A ballistic missile launched by North Korea on Monday might have had an \u201cabnormal\u201d flight trajectory and could have fallen inland, possibly near the capital of Pyongyang, the South Korean military said. North Korea launched two ballistic missiles on Monday morning, according to reports from the South Korean, American and Japanese governments. The missiles, launched at 5:05 a.m. and 5:15 a.m. local time, had two different flight distances, 600 kilometers (373 miles) for the first and 120 kilometers (75 miles) for the second, according to a statement from South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). When asked about the disparate distances, Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson for the JCS, in a briefing said, \u201cThere is the possibility that the second launched missile had an abnormal flight in the early stage.\u201d \u201cIf it had exploded during an abnormal flight, there is the possibility that debris fell inland,\u201d Lee said, clarifying that an \u201cexplosion\u201d is one of many possibilities. The military is \u201ccomprehensively analyzing\u201d various possibilities. He added that no damage has been confirmed so far. South Korea said the first missile, with the 600-kilometer (373-mile) flight distance, was a short-range ballistic missile, but Lee would only say the second was \u201ca ballistic missile,\u201d which leaves open the possibility of it being a new weapon. According to JCS, the two missiles were launched northeastward from the Changyon-gun area of South Hwanghae province, about 130 kilometers (81 miles) southwest of Pyongyang. If the missile exploded after flying 120 kilometers (75 miles) northeastward from Changyon-gun, the debris could have landed near Pyongyang, based on the distance traveled from the launch site. The JCS could not confirm whether there was an explosion near the capital, which is North Korea\u2019s largest city and home to more than 3 million people. Last week, North Korea said it successfully conducted a\u00a0test to deploy multiple warheads from a single-stage engine for a medium- to long-range ballistic missile, marking an important milestone in upgrading its missile technology. South Korea later said the North Korean claim was false. Lee, the JCS spokesperson, said that during a successful test, multiple warheads should separate from a missile during the descending stage of its flight, but North Korea\u2019s missile had exploded in the early stage during launch. North Korea did not make any statements after Monday morning\u2019s launches, but on Sunday put out a statement on the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) denouncing the recent US-South Korea-Japan military exercises named \u201cFreedom Edge,\u201d calling it another sign of the three partners \u201creckless and provocative military muscle-flexing.\u201d The statement said North Korea would \u201ccontinue to make important efforts to deter the acts of disturbing peace and stability\u201d on the Korean Peninsula. Technically the two Koreas\u00a0remain at war\u00a0\u2013 an armistice ended the Korean War that split the peninsula in 1953 but no formal peace treaty was ever signed. Relations between the two countries thawed somewhat in 2017 and 2018, but the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years as leader Kim ramped up weapons testing in defiance of United Nations sanctions and diplomatic talks fell apart. Meanwhile, both nations are drawing closer to their respective partners \u2013 with North Korea recently signing a defense agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0and South Korea stepping up cooperation with Japan and the United States. Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said Monday\u2019s missile tests, which occurred during ongoing meetings of the Central Committee of the ruling Worker\u2019s Party, likely served two purposes for the Kim regime. \u201cIn both North Korean politics and military policy, the best defense is often a good offense. These missile launches are likely the Kim regime\u2019s way of compensating for recent failed tests, aiming to impress a domestic audience during ruling party meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cPyongyang is also determined not to appear weak while South Korea conducts defense exercises with Japan and the United States.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/asia/north-korea-failed-missile-test-south-korea-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Austrian city has been crowned the most liveable city in the world yet again in the annual list from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), which was released today. The EIU, a sister organization to The Economist, ranked 173 cities across the globe on a number of significant factors, including health care, culture and environment, stability, infrastructure and education. Vienna topped the list for the third consecutive year, receiving \u201cperfect\u201d scores in four out of five of the categories \u2014 the city was marked lower for culture and environment due to an apparent lack of significant sporting events. Perfect scores Just behind the Austrian capital, Denmark\u2019s Copenhagen retained its second place position, while Switzerland\u2019s Zurich moved up from sixth place to third on the list. Australia\u2019s Melbourne fell from third to fourth place, while Canadian city Calgary tied for fifth place with Swiss city Geneva. Canada\u2019s Vancouver and Australia\u2019s Sydney were in joint seventh place, and Japan\u2019s Osaka and New Zealand\u2019s Auckland rounded out the top 10 in joint ninth place. While Western Europe performed well, with 30 cities scoring an average score of 92 out of 100, the region saw an overall decline in stability scores, which was attributed to \u201cincreasing instances of disruptive protests\u201d and crime. In 23rd place, Honolulu, Hawaii was the highest US city on the list, while Atlanta, Georgia moved up four places to number 29. Los Angeles was further down the list in 58th place, while New York came in at No. 70. \u2018Acute housing crisis\u2019 North America achieved the highest average score for education. However, marks for infrastructure were lower than the previous year in Canada due to \u201can acute housing crisis,\u201d which has affected several regions. \u201cThe situation is particularly worrying in Australia and Canada, where the availability of rental properties is at an all-time low and purchase prices have continued to rise despite interest-rate increases,\u201d reads the report. Vancouver fell backwards while remaining in the top 10, and Toronto (ninth on the list in 2023) dropped out of the top 10 to 12th place. UK capital London was ranked as the 45th most liveable city in the world. Over in Asia, Hong Kong saw the largest score improvement since last year, climbing from 61st place to 50th thanks to an improvement in its stability and health care scores. UAE cities saw some of the biggest score increases this year, with Abu Dhabi and Dubai climbing up the list, and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Riyadh, Jeddah and Al Khobar also making significant gains. Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s Tel Aviv experienced one of the biggest declines, dropping 20 places to 112th due to the Israel-Hamas war. Stability decline \u201cGlobal liveability has risen fractionally over the past year but risks to stability remain,\u201d\u00a0 said Barsali Bhattacharyya, deputy industry director at EIU. \u201cStill-high inflation accompanied by high interest rates and other economic headwinds led to another year of frequent protests across the world.\u201d There was little change at the bottom of the list, with Damascus, Syria still ranking as the least liveable in the world, with Libya\u2019s Tripoli, Algeria\u2019s Algiers and Nigeria\u2019s Lagos ranking just above. The study noted that none of the bottom four cities had seen any improvement in its overall score since 2023. \u201cSince we conducted our survey, there have been more instances of civil unrest and demonstrations around the world, such as the campus protests across the US, suggesting continuing stress on liveability that is unlikely to ease in the near future,\u201d said Bhattacharyya. 2024\u2019s Global Liveability Index: The top 10 1.

{"id": "2024_07_01_style_jesus-ai-artificial-intelligence-social-media-cec", "text": "AI images have become an unavoidable roadside attraction on Facebook and other social media, where dramatic and outlandish depictions of emotional scenes lure users into doling out likes, shares and \u201cAmens.\u201d Among the funhouse images of fake children crying in the street and police officers saving inexplicably huge Bibles from the rain, countless depictions of Jesus Christ seem to take up an outsized amount of AI real estate. It makes sense. The central figure of Christianity invokes potent reactions from billions of followers around the globe. For the last 2,000 years, faithful hands have labored to create likenesses of their professed savior, projecting onto him various theologies and mythologies combined with aesthetics of the time: Jesus suffering on the cross, Jesus as the Good Shepherd, Jesus the creator of miracles, Jesus the word made flesh, Jesus as cosmic judge. Now, in the age of AI, Jesus can assume an infinite variety of roles with just a few keystrokes. Jesus as a durian fruit, for instance. Or Jesus battling shirtless with Satan. Sometimes, Jesus is cuddling a person in need in a hospital bed, his chiseled features and strong hands providing divine comfort. None of these things are in the Bible, but they are alive in the minds of particularly imaginative Christians, or just those who want some easy engagement on Facebook. What\u2019s unsettling is how many AI-created images of Jesus are unnecessarily handsome and rugged, like one of those Instagram influencers who wears a lot of pendants and is always wandering barefoot through an island jungle. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, per se. The Bible doesn\u2019t get specific about Jesus\u2019 looks, and certainly artists over the millennia have taken creative license when it comes to his physique (and, to a different point, his skin tone). However, generative AI, like the kind that can create images from text prompts, doesn\u2019t work like an artist\u2019s brain. All of these handsome AI Jesus images are created from patterns a machine picks up from the information it is fed. What does that say about us, and how we view the figures most important to our cultural identities? The aesthetics of religious figures Since programs that generate AI art are trained on existing forms of art and imagery, the conundrum of handsome AI Jesus has two parts: How Jesus has been depicted in the images fed to such machines, and how the machines interpret the images they are given in order to spit out new ones. We\u2019ll start with the historical part first. \u201cDepicting religious figures in an idealized form far predates Christianity,\u201d says art historian and former classics professor Brenda Sanderson. \u201cGreeks and Romans portrayed their gods in a way that depicted strength and good health. While certain images of Jesus may not be intended to be sexual, they reflect a formal ideal that corresponds with the spiritual ideal.\u201d Sanderson also says some of these depictions merely reflect the sensibilities of the artist. The Sistine Chapel ceiling, painted by Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512, is considered one of the crowning achievements of sacred art. While its vibrant frescoes illustrate saints, prophets and characters of the Bible, it also includes a full-on depiction of God\u2019s bare behind. \u201cThings like that that some may consider sacreligious today weren\u2019t quite as scandalous at the time,\u201d she says. The question of whether a religious depiction is \u201ctoo sexy\u201d doesn\u2019t stop with Jesus. A very famous pair of sculptures created for St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium in the 1800s has become a beloved part of art history lore. The first, \u201cL\u2019ange du mal,\u201d was created by artist Joseph Geefs, but was removed from the church because church officials worried about its effect on female worshipers and reportedly said, \u201cthe devil is too sublime.\u201d It was replaced by a different sculpture by Geefs\u2019 brother, Guillaume. However, in a humorous twist, many art lovers consider \u201cLe g\u00e9nie du mal\u201d to be even more suggestive than the original. Even today, the question of sexualized religious images in art is alive and well. In early 2024, a \u201csexualized\u201d painting of Jesus by Spanish artist Salustiano Garc\u00eda Cruz was decried as \u201coffensive\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d by critics. \u201cBiblical figures and saints have often been made attractive or \u2018sexy\u2019 in art history, whether it\u2019s images of the scantily-clad young Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows, the naked body of Mary Magdalene covered only by her hair, or the muscular torso of Christ in works by Michelangelo and others,\u201d art historian Morgan Haigh told the BBC about Garc\u00eda\u2019s work. How AI interprets art Now that we know there is a long history of humans depicting their religious figures in, well, idealized form, the prevalence of handsome AI Jesus makes more sense. Christopher Framer, a generative AI certified programmer from Petaluma, California, explains that different AI models are trained on different pieces of art, and the outcome relies on a person\u2019s input as well. \u201cFrom a consumer view you can\u2019t usually tell what kind of images an AI model has been fed, but what is generated can vary on other specifications like image type \u2014 does the person specify they want a photorealistic image? You see a lot of those on Facebook.\u201d Framer says other inputs can greatly vary the images, like the addition of words like \u201cstrong,\u201d \u201cfighting,\u201d or \u201cpower.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you for sure, but when people are looking to create images that elicit a specific response, they just need to add a single word or describe a situation, and that can create a huge difference.\u201d That\u2019s one reason why some depictions of AI Jesus include curious details, like tattoos, bulging biceps, hairy chests or soulful dreamboat eyes. \u201cThese programs don\u2019t actually know who Jesus is, or what he means. They know, through what they\u2019ve been fed, that most images of Jesus may look a certain way. Adding more into a prompt introduces more information into the image that may be at odds with what people think a religious image should look like.\u201d AI-generated images are becoming somewhat of a problem on social media, where engaging with a religious picture may take half a second and doesn\u2019t necessitate a close look at the content. Many AI photos of Jesus online also include elements of patriotism or politics, which, through Framer\u2019s explanation, alter the nature of the depiction. There are other complications that lead to the persistence of handsome AI Jesus. Some AI art experts fear the more AI images that are created, the more the programs that run them will create a kind of \u201cfeedback loop,\u201d where the same type of images get generated over and over again. These images attract thousands of likes and comments as people scroll by them, despite, at times, being very obviously manipulated. Many pages offering this kind of content also contain links to questionable websites, spam-like hashtags or repeated variations of the same type of image. All in all, it\u2019s not a very human experience. It makes sense that their posted images of Jesus feel a little inhuman, too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/style/jesus-ai-artificial-intelligence-social-media-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_style_kinds-of-kindness-costumes", "text": "Yorgos Lanthimos \u2014 the movie director behind award season darlings \u201cThe Favourite\u201d and \u201cPoor Things\u201d \u2014 is hailed as a genius by fans of his often strange and unsettling oeuvre. He\u2019s made his name by courting the absurd and keeping audiences on their toes, embellishing his fables of love, power and free will with discordant musical motifs and disarming cuts to a wide lens. His latest project, \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d traces recognizable power dynamics \u2014 those with your boss, with your spouse or even with religious leaders \u2014 onto a surreal universe where they are intensified to their greatest (and often bloodiest) extremes. The film is told in three short stories. In the first, \u201cThe Death of R.M.F.,\u201d Jesse Plemons plays Robert, the hapless puppet of his boss Raymond (Willem Dafoe). In the second tale, \u201cR.M.F. is Flying,\u201d Plemons is a police officer whose wife (Emma Stone) has gone missing on a diving trip. When she returns, she seems fundamentally changed, prompting Plemons to test her love for him in progressively revolting ways. In the third instalment, \u201cR.M.F. Eats a Sandwich,\u201d Stone and a now-shaven headed Plemons are the disciples of a purity cult led by Dafoe, tasked with locating someone able to revive the dead. Although apparently detached from one another \u2014 bar the rotating cast and transient presence of the mysterious R.M.F. character (played by Yorgos Stefanakos) \u2014 each entry into the anthology repeats Lanthimos\u2019 career-spanning thesis: human agency is a myth, and people will commit unhinged acts to be accepted by the powerful. Happily, that dark existentialism didn\u2019t cloud the mood on set. \u201c(Lanthimos) puts together a group of really like-minded, lovely people that he feels will get along,\u201d Jennifer Johnson, the film\u2019s costume designer, told CNN via video call. \u201cWorking with Yorgos in general is a very satisfying, exhilarating and scary place, all at the same time. It\u2019s really fun!\u201d Power dressing \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is a film imbued with symbolism, and the costumes were critical in defining characters\u2019 relative status; in the first relationship we meet, Robert (Plemons) and Raymond (Dafoe) each wear their power quite literally on their sleeves. Raymond, dressed expensively in Italian suits, is \u201csomebody who has a lot of money, and exudes power and style but does it in his own way,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s this sense of confidence that was really important to telegraph very quickly, and this subtly eccentric way of dressing.\u201d His looks took inspiration from Gianni Agnelli, the head of Fiat between 1966 and 1996, who was a champion of Italy\u2019s nonchalantly chic \u201cSprezzatura\u201d style. \u201cHe would take hiking boots and wear them with a custom suit, with his watch worn on the outside of his shirt,\u201d Johnson recalled of Agnelli. \u201cIt\u2019s this mixing and matching that we take for granted now, but when (Agnelli) was dressing that was something that was very unusual.\u201d Per Raymond\u2019s written instructions \u2014 detailing not only how Robert should dress, but what he should read (always Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d); what he should eat, and when he should have sex with his wife \u2014 Plemons is also immaculately suited, if self-consciously so. \u201c(Raymond) gives him things that would make most men really uncomfortable,\u201d Johnson said, pointing to a pink Tom Ford turtleneck Robert\u2019s made to wear. \u201cIt\u2019s (one of) the little signifiers of eccentric power play.\u201d Three stories, three looks Having crafted a visual language to reflect one power dynamic, the film\u2019s structure meant the same also had to be done for the second and third chapters. \u201cEach story plays for about an hour, so there\u2019s definitely enough character development within each one that it is a full movie. That was very difficult in our short production time,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWillem is such a great example: you are a CEO, and then you\u2019re (Stone\u2019s) father, and now you\u2019re a leader of a sex cult. To traverse that territory and walk all those distances in one (costume) fitting was a challenge, for sure.\u201d Most of the cast shoulder three characters each but, in the final chapter, Margaret Qualley had the additional task of playing identical twins Rebecca and Ruth. For Johnson, this required carving out clear character traits. \u201cWhat was nice is that one twin was really wild and had a punk rock spirit; you can imagine she\u2019s into indie music and is not really walking to a mainstream beat, whereas her twin sister is a veterinarian who is kind of bookish,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was important (the veterinarian) wore comfort shoes, so they were her Dansko clogs, and that she would have a darned sock; something that feels homemade. She likes pretty things, but she\u2019s not interested in fashion. You make these rules for each person.\u201d Dressing for laughs Despite the film\u2019s grim subject matter, there are unexpectedly comedic moments \u2014 not so much to offer respite but, if anything, to add to the jarring effect. Several of them rely on costuming to provide the visual gag \u2014 with Dafoe leading the charge. As Raymond, he stands up from the sofa after lambasting Robert to reveal a pair of exposed knees to the camera; a switch in tone sharp enough to pull roars of laughter from the audience in the movie theater. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of men in the world who can wear a knee-high sock and a white pleated short and look really gorgeous at the same time!\u201d Johnson joked. In the third chapter Dafoe plays a cult leader, freed from Raymond\u2019s designer suits and instead sporting little else besides eyeliner and orange Speedos. \u201cWillem is just one of the most lovely, delightful and intelligent collaborators you could ever ask for,\u201d Johnson beamed. \u201cHis physicality is so beautiful and lends itself to wearing clothing so well, so he can really go for it and wear the most absurd thing \u2014 but it\u2019s not wearing him; he\u2019s wearing it.\u201d The brightly-colored swimwear \u2014 a reflection of the cult\u2019s affinity for water \u2014 was a surprise pick for Dafoe, who made a beeline for it in the fitting room. \u201cBecause the cult is very sexual, I thought it would be great if we could get him in the least amount of clothes possible,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt was the first thing that he saw and he said \u2018yup, I\u2019m putting that on!\u2019. It was a very fun moment because we didn\u2019t tell Yorgos about it. (Dafoe) walked out for the camera test in it, and it definitely got a laugh!\u201d On their hunt for the elusive \u201cwaker of the dead,\u201d Stone and Plemons\u2019 outfits \u2014 earth-tone, loosely-fitted suits paired with sandals \u2014 are also laughably conspicuous. Johnson drew reference to \u201cThe X Files,\u201d but Ken and Barbie trying to blend in on Venice Beach also springs to mind. \u201cThey\u2019re like detectives, and they\u2019re cult members but they have to pretend to be normal,\u201d Johnson explained. \u201cI think those characters thought \u2018oh, well a suit makes us look normal,\u2019 when in actuality they look really weird and more scary; they would have been better off in their cult wear, which was just outdoor gear.\u201d Plemons\u2019 suit was one of two found in a gargantuan thrift store \u2014 \u201clike a whole city unto itself\u201d \u2014 in New Orleans, where the film was shot. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun when you find that; you can just imagine the gentleman who donated it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt came in dark brown and tan, but the dark brown one never made it onto the camera.\u201d \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d is an oddly-dressed, oddly-paced detour from a traditional blockbuster, but it does make a compelling argument for the collective, visceral experience of cinema. Over the course of an almost three-hour screening, Lanthimos\u2019 efforts provoked audible gasps, averted eyes and strangled groans. There was laughter: full-bodied at times, faltering at others, as viewers grappled with whether they were being entertained or horrified in real time. People recoiled. One person cried. As the credits rolled, a stunned silence fell over the room. The atmosphere had taken on its own heightened reality; complementary to Lanthimos\u2019 style, difficult to stop thinking about on the way home.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/style/kinds-of-kindness-costumes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_style_marina-abramovic-glastonbury-crowd-silence", "text": "On Friday, Marina Abramovi\u0107 staged a collective seven minute silence at the UK\u2019s biggest music festival. In case her messaging was unclear, the Serbian artist wore a white sculptural column dress that, when her arms were outstretched, opened out into a peace sign. World-famous for her seemingly fearless approach to performance art, Abramovi\u0107 once invited members of the public to interact with her however they liked during a 6-hour sitting. The 1974 piece, titled \u201cRhythm 0,\u201d resulted in a loaded gun being held to her head. On the Glastonbury main stage Abramovi\u0107\u00a0asked the festival\u2019s 250,000 attendees to turn inward.\u00a0\u201cPeople come to have a good time. They\u2019re drinking, taking drugs, the weather is good,\u201d she told Vogue ahead of the event. \u201cBut I\u2019m asking them to be silent and to reflect on the state of this planet, which is really hell right now.\u201d If silencing a music festival the size of a small English town wasn\u2019t powerful enough, the artist\u00a0also chose an outfit to remember. Standing tall, her shoulders sloped to create the top of the peace sign \u2014 her hands lost in the round of the giant white sleeves. At hip level, more fabric jutted out to create the upside-down \u2018V\u2019 shape. The dress, designed by her friend and former Burberry creative director Riccardo Tisci, was inspired by the Japanese kimono. According to Abramovi\u0107, it will eventually be exhibited in a museum. While we\u2019re more familiar seeing peace signs printed on crop tops or canvas tote bags, Abramovi\u0107 and Tisci\u2019s IRL-rendering is closer to the symbol\u2019s creation story. Designed by British artist Gerald Holtom, the icon first debuted on a London peace march in 1958 and was later adopted by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). Holtom wrote that the idea for the sign came from his own human form. \u201cI drew myself: the representation of an individual in despair, with hands and palms outstretched, outwards and downwards in the manner of Goya\u2019s peasant before the firing squad. I formalized the drawing into a line and put a circle round it.\u201d More than six decades later, Holtom\u2019s peace sign has become one of the world\u2019s most recognized symbols \u2014 particularly on the runway. Throughout the years, it has adorned everything from Fendi Baguette bags to Dior knitwear. At Moschino in 2014, the design was fashioned into luxurious pendants on heavy, golden donkey rope chains; while the following year at Chanel, it appeared in Sharpie-style scrawl on distressed messenger bags \u2014 a punctuation mark to the revised phrase \u201cMake fashion, not war.\u201d Abramovi\u0107\u2019s outfit was very much in-keeping with Glastonbury\u2019s overarching theme for 2024: Peace. Holtom\u2019s sign was seen throughout the festival grounds, crowning the roof of the newly erected Peace Stage, and earlier in the week, appearing in the sky during the event\u2019s first ever drone display. As she faced the crowd, Abramovi\u0107 surrendered to the power of the symbol sewn into her dress. \u201cSee how we can feel positive energy in the entire universe,\u201d she told on-lookers. What originally began for Holtom as a mark of despair, suddenly became an open embrace.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/style/marina-abramovic-glastonbury-crowd-silence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz Ag Mohamed Ag Mahmoud, who was a senior member of the Islamic Police, was recruited by al Qaeda leaders, the\u00a0ICC said in a statement. The Islamic Police played a \u201cpivotal role\u201d in the system that al Qaeda, alongside Islamist group Ansar Dine, put in place to commit crimes against humanity and war crimes in Timbuktu between April 2012 and May 2013, the ICC said. Al Hassan was convicted by majority of directly committing, contributing to, or aiding and abetting crimes against humanity of torture and war crimes of torture and outrages upon personal dignity, the ICC confirmed. The court, in the Dutch city of The Hague, acquitted him of crimes related to rape, sexual slavery, forced marriage and attacking protected objects due to insufficient evidence that he was responsible, the statement said. The ICC said that 2,196 victims participated in the trial proceedings. Across 195 hearings, 7,896 documents were recorded and 13,275 items of evidence were submitted, the court said.

{"id": "2024_07_02_middleeast_netanyahu-rejects-hamas-ceasefire-hezbollah-war-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the idea of starting a ceasefire in Gaza while Hamas remains in power, after The New York Times published an\u00a0article\u00a0citing six current and former security officials who said a truce would give Israeli troops time to prepare for a potential land war with Hezbollah. The officials, most of whom spoke anonymously to \u201cdiscuss sensitive security matters,\u201d also said a truce would be the most effective way to secure the release of the Israeli hostages. Former Israeli National Security Advisor Eyal Hulata, who according to the Times maintains regular communication with \u201csenior miliary officials,\u201d spoke on the record, saying, \u201cThe military is in full support of a hostage deal and a ceasefire \u2026 They believe that they can always go back and engage Hamas militarily in the future.\u201d Faced with a \u201cforever war\u201d scenario, four of the officials interviewed by the Times agreed with Hulata that \u201ckeeping Hamas in power for now in exchange for getting the hostages back seems like the least worst option for Israel.\u201d But in a statement, Netanyahu said, \u201cI do not know who these anonymous sources are, but I am here to make it unequivocally clear: This will not happen. The war will end once Israel achieves all of its objectives, including the destruction of Hamas and the release of all of our hostages.\u201d \u201cThe government directed the IDF to achieve these war objectives and the IDF has all the means to achieve them. We will not capitulate to the winds of defeatism, neither in The New York Times nor anywhere else. We are inspired by the spirit of victory.\u201d The report was published as the situation in Israel\u2019s north remains extremely tense, with the Israeli military and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah ramping up cross-border attacks, which risk boiling\u00a0over into a full-scale war. \u201cThey (the IDF) understand that a pause in Gaza makes de-escalation more likely in Lebanon,\u201d Hulata told the Times. \u201cAnd they have less munitions, less spare parts, less energy than they did before \u2014 so they also think a pause in Gaza gives us more time to prepare in case a bigger war does break out with Hezbollah,\u201d he is quoted as saying. When asked by the Times if it supported a truce, the IDF released a statement that didn\u2019t answer the question directly. \u201cThe IDF is determined to continue fighting to achieve the goals of the war to destroy the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas, the return of the hostages and the safe return of the residents in the north and south to their homes.\u201d \u201cSo far, significant achievements have been made in fighting in Gaza, the IDF will continue to fight Hamas everywhere in the Gaza Strip, along with continuing to promote war readiness in the north and a defense effort at all borders,\u201d it added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/middleeast/netanyahu-rejects-hamas-ceasefire-hezbollah-war-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_style_queen-victoria-drawings-auction-sale-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "A set of 19th-century drawings by a teenage Queen Victoria will be put up for auction in London next week. Three of the sketches were made when the British queen, who reigned from 1837 until her death in 1901, was still a princess and only 14 years old.\u00a0Dated July 1833, they each depict a different figure on horseback \u2013\u00a0a knight, a woman, and a veiled woman. The fourth drawing is from 1838, one year after Victoria ascended the throne. It shows a seated woman with a crown and sash \u2013\u00a0not unlike her in appearance \u2013 and is inscribed \u201cby Her Majesty.\u201d \u201cThese slightly early drawings show that maybe she was still learning a lot, that she was still honing her craft,\u201d explained Charlotte Russell, Head of Sale for Old Master, British and European Pictures at Roseberys, the London-based auction house facilitating the sale on July 9. \u201cShe was very curious and keen as an artist,\u201d Russell told CNN. Roseberys has set an estimated sale price of \u00a31,500 to \u00a32,500 ($1,900 to $3,170) for the Victorian album that contains the four sketches, as well as works by other artists and items of royal ephemera. Russell says the album was probably assembled by Augusta Hayter, daughter-in-law of George Hayter, who painted the Queen\u2019s coronation portrait and was her court painter for many years. George Hayter also gave the Queen drawing lessons, and Russell believes these drawings show his influence \u201cquite closely\u201d. The album also features royal ephemera, including an invitation to the coronation of King George IV at Westminster Abbey in 1821. \u201cI\u2019m interested to see how it performs,\u201d said Russell. The auction house has previously sold other works by royal artists, including a painting by Queen Victoria\u2019s daughter, Princess Victoria, which fetched \u00a34,198 (around $5,320) last year. Art was one of Victoria\u2019s great loves \u2013\u00a0a passion she shared with her husband, Prince Albert. As newlyweds, the couple learned to etch together and would occasionally give their creations to family and friends. The Royal Collection Trust, which looks after the royal family\u2019s art collection, has more than 4,000 works by Queen Victoria, spanning 64 years of her life. The queen was a \u201ctalented\u201d and \u201cprolific\u201d artist, according to the trust. She received her first drawing lesson when she was eight years old and went on to be tutored by renowned artists like Edwin Landseer, William Leighton Leitch and Franz Xaver Winterhalter. She often drew from what she observed around her \u2013\u00a0nature, domestic life, people she encountered on her travels. \u201cShe is known to have experimented quite a lot with different subjects,\u201d said Russell, who added that Victoria would make \u201clittle sketches of costumes of people in the areas\u201d where she traveled. Last year, two paintings by the queen depicting vases of flowers were found in an English cottage and sold for \u00a319,500 (around $25,000).", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/style/queen-victoria-drawings-auction-sale-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_europe_deepfake-video-zelensky-wife-intl-latam", "text": "A deepfake video that wrongly suggested the wife of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky purchased a luxury car during the couple\u2019s visit to Paris last month is likely part of a Russian-linked disinformation network, according to CNN\u2019s analysis and disinformation experts. The AI-generated\u00a0video\u00a0features a non-existent employee of the Bugatti dealership in Paris claiming Olena Zelenska purchased its new model, the Bugatti Tourbillon, for 4.5 million euros (around $4.8 million) on June 7. The clip has several markings of a deep fake, from cuts in the video, to the strange accent and lip-and-mouth movements, according to Cl\u00e9ment Briens, a researcher at cybersecurity company Recorded Future. Yet, it gathered some 18 million views in 24 hours on X, where it was reposted by pro-Russian influencers. Bugatti said in a statement on Tuesday that its dealership in Paris, operated by Autofficina Parigi, a Car Lovers Group company, was victim of several criminal offenses and \u201cfirmly denounced this disinformation campaign.\u201d \u201cA supposed salesman claiming to belong to the Car Lovers Group and its sports label Schumacher Group, published a video on social networks in which he indicated that the Bugatti Paris dealership sold a vehicle to the Ukrainian presidential couple,\u201d it said, adding that the group \u201cstrongly denies both the existence of the transaction and, consequently, the existence of the invoice.\u201d \u201cThe mandatory legal details don\u2019t appear on the invoice, the price of the vehicle is also wrong, the price of the options and their descriptions are inaccurate and inconsistent, the graphics are outdated, and the Car Lovers Group would never have allowed such a document to be issued,\u201d the statement added. The group also said it has taken legal action \u201cby filing a criminal complaint for forgery, use of forgeries, usurpation of identity and defamation\u201d \u2013 but did not specify against whom the complaint was filed. Clarity, an AI cybersecurity startup that is fighting against deepfakes, told CNN that their review of the video indicated \u201ca high certainty for AI manipulations, mostly around the middle of the face area.\u201d The video originates from a French-language website, Verite Cachee France (sic), whose content appears to be AI-generated by scraping French media. A CNN analysis shows Verite Cachee was set up recently, on June 22, 2024, and some of its pages still have prompts with AI to create fake articles at the top of the piece. CNN is not able to find a contact for the website. The website\u2019s title also doesn\u2019t use accents \u2013 the proper spelling would be V\u00e9rit\u00e9 Cach\u00e9e \u2013 casting further doubts on its authenticity. Darren Linvill, a professor at Clemson University\u2019s Media Forensics Hub, told CNN the deep fake and Verite Cachee\u2019s websites bear the hallmarks of a Russian narrative laundering campaign that has been going on since last August, with the aim of undermining Ukraine. \u201cThey typically place some video with a story to tell on YouTube. They then tell that story by layering it on the fake news pages they\u2019ve created, and often also one or more allied web pages. They then integrate the story through social media, starting with real pro-Russian influencers who are part of their network,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cOnly minor change with this campaign is that the video doesn\u2019t seem to be on YouTube.\u201d In a\u00a0report\u00a0from last December, Linvill and Patrick Warren, also a professor at Clemson, showed how the disinformation campaign was led by DC Weekly, a website that published a series of AI-generated Russian propaganda and fake stories, such as the debunked claim that Olena Zelenska bought $1.1 million jewellery at Cartier in New York last September. A report by Recorded Future, a leading cybersecurity company, also identified Veritee Cachee as being part of the same disinformation network. Given the size and resources of the network, it is likely some Russian support or financing is happening, Cl\u00e9ment Briens, a senior threat intelligence analyst at the company, told CNN. \u201cThey scrape articles automatically from a number of sources, using LLMs to introduce specifically political bias to attack Zelensky, Biden and NATO. Then they upload the articles to launder a pro-Russian narrative,\u201d Briens said. The sheer volume of articles makes it harder to detect when deep fakes are introduced because when someone clicks on the website, they see a backlog of articles that usually pass the initial check, he said. \u201cThen after someone uploads the video from YouTube or directly into the site, the amplification system gets activated on social media.\u201d The target is political readers in Europe, with the purpose to erode domestic political support for Ukraine and undermine European leaders that support Ukraine, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, according to the analyst.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/europe/deepfake-video-zelensky-wife-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

I saw very considerable achievements in the fighting being carried in Rafah. We are advancing to the end of the stage of eliminating the Hamas terrorist army; we will continue striking its remnants,\u201d Netanyahu said, speaking to a group of mainly Israeli and international military officials studying at the National Security College. He again vowed that Israel would achieve its goals in its war against Hamas: returning hostages from Gaza, eliminating Hamas\u2019 military and governing capabilities, ensuring that Gaza will not constitute a threat against Israel and also returning displaced Israeli residents securely to their homes in both the south and the north. Before launching a military operation in Rafah in May, Israeli leaders had maintained that the southern Gaza city was the last stronghold of Hamas. Netanyahu said last month that the \u201cintense phase of the war with Hamas (in Gaza) is about to end,\u201d and that the military\u2019s focus could then shift to Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the war is going to end, but the war in its current stage is going to end in Rafah.

A\u00a0poster shared widely\u00a0on social media calls on all generations to return to the streets across the country on Thursday and block roads leading to the capital Nairobi. Some protesters have also called for people to occupy the State House in Nairobi. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken with Ruto since the clashes to urge restraint. According to a State Department readout of their call, Blinken \u201cunderscored the importance of security forces demonstrating restraint and refraining from violence and encouraged prompt investigations into allegations of human rights abuses.\u201d Kenya, a nation often praised for its stability, had seen escalating protests over the bill, which the government introduced to rein in public debt. Last week, the government\u00a0scrapped\u00a0some tax increases, including a proposed 16% value-added tax on bread along with taxes on motor vehicles, vegetable oil and mobile money transfers. But the concessions were not enough to quell protests amid the\u00a0rising cost of living. On Tuesday they turned deadly when security forces fired teargas and live ammunition at protesters. Dramatic scenes in the nation\u2019s capital Nairobi saw government buildings set on fire and a ceremonial mace stolen from the parliament in the melee. Kenyan lawmakers were evacuated from the parliament as police went up against protesters, CNN affiliate NTV Kenya reported. At least 23 people died in the violence, according to Kenya\u2019s Police Reforms Working Group, (PRWG) a civil society organization. The PRWG alleged in a statement published by Amnesty International Kenya that police targeted young, unarmed protesters outside the parliament, with the violence continuing into the night. They added that \u201creports show police shot several people in Githurai, Nairobi, one over 40 times \u2014 between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m., way after the protest ended.\u201d This was in contrast to details given by Ruto, who said in his speech that six people died. \u201cI send my condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones in this very unfortunate manner,\u201d Ruto added. \u201cThere is need for us as a nation to pick up from here and go into the future,\u201d Ruto said, adding that he would hold an engagement with the young people at the forefront of the protests to hear their ideas and proposals. The Law Society of Kenya is calling for the resignation of Kenya\u2019s inspector general of police and the Nairobi regional commander over officers allegedly shooting protesters. \u201cWe saw plainclothes policemen shooting protesters as early as 11 a.m. There was a clear directive to kill protesters,\u201d Law Society of Kenya president Faith Odhiambo alleged in an interview with CNN on Wednesday evening. \u201cThere was no intent to let the protesters move around.\u201d The Law Society also said the police \u201cabducted\u201d several prominent social media users connected to the protests, and six people remain missing. \u201cThe reports from those who have been freed is that they were taken blindfolded and handcuffed, and they didn\u2019t know where they were,\u201d she told CNN, after the society secured the release of six people. \u201cEven after they come out, most of them are quite shaken and afraid and want to go into hiding. Our message to the government is that if a country is built on fear, one day people will stop fearing. And that\u2019s what we saw on Tuesday.\u201d Ruto\u2019s change of heart came as a surprise to some who observed his hardline stance just a day earlier. During a nationwide address after the parliament was set alight, Ruto said the events on Tuesday were a grave threat to \u201cnational security\u201d and that the conversation around the bill had been \u201chijacked by dangerous people.\u201d Kenyan analyst Herman Manyora said withdrawing the bill much earlier could have saved the lives lost on Tuesday. \u201cHis announcement should have come earlier. He has done today what he should have done two days ago to avoid what we went through yesterday. It pains me that we had to wait \u2026 for us to do what we should have done on Monday \u2026 and that\u2019s a general feeling among people,\u201d Manyora told CNN.

The Turkish defender gave his side the perfect start after just 57 seconds, blasting home from close range following some pinball in the Austria box which almost resulted in an own goal. Demiral got his second of the game when the defender powered a header home shortly before the hour mark. Just when it seemed Turkey was on its way to the quarterfinals, Michael Gregoritsch halved the deficit to give Austria hope of rescuing the game. As the rain poured down in Leipzig, Austria had a golden chance to level the scores in added time, but Christoph Baumgartner\u2019s header was brilliantly pushed away to safety by goalkeeper Mert G\u00fcnok as Turkey held on for a famous victory. The game was played at a frenzied pace, with both teams known for their high-pressing football and both sets of fans bringing plenty of energy to the Leipzig Stadium. Turkey will play the Netherlands in the quarterfinal in Berlin on Saturday, July 6. Fast-paced action The atmosphere inside the Leipzig Stadium ahead of kickoff was electric \u2013 thanks to the Turkish diaspora in Germany and many Austrians making the short journey over the border \u2013 with the pace of the game matching the fervent noise inside the ground. Turkey was quick to capitalize on that fast start, forcing a corner in the opening minute. Austria struggled to deal with the set piece and although goalkeeper Patrick Pentz flicked the ball away, it was Demiral who pounced to smash his shot into the roof of the net. Austria looked set to level the scores when Baumgartner came rushing in at the near post with the goal gaping. Somehow Baumgartner was unable to make contact with the ball, instead clashing with the upright. The first half continued in a breakneck fashion, with 19-year-old Turkey forward Arda\u00a0G\u00fcler attempting an outrageous lob from the halfway line. Austria came out in the second half with a refreshed sense of purpose and had a golden opportunity to equalize when Marko Arnautovi\u0107 was slipped through on goal but his effort was denied by G\u00fcnok who spread himself to deny the Austrian captain. Stefan Posch was the next Austrian player to go close but the defender was unable to get a clean connection with the goal at his mercy. With Austria seemingly in the ascendancy, Turkey counterpunched to double its lead. Once again, it was 26-year-old Demiral who was the scorer, rising highest from G\u00fcler\u2019s corner to get his second of the game. The goal seemed to have given Turkey a safety net, but Austria halved the deficit seven minutes later, Gregoritsch finishing smartly from a corner to breath new life into the game. Austria kept pushing and when Baumgartner rose highest with seconds to spare, his header looked like it was heading for the net, but Turkey\u2019s goalkeeper G\u00fcnok flew to his right to push the ball away and seal Turkey\u2019s spot in the quarterfinals.

{"id": "2024_07_01_climate_india-delhi-floods-extreme-rain-intl-hnk", "text": "Deadly flash flooding due to sudden heavy rains has inundated India\u2019s capital, replacing one of the worst heat waves in Delhi\u2019s history that sent temperatures soaring well above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). An observatory in New Delhi on Friday reported 228.1 millimeters (nearly 9\u00a0inches) of rainfall in a 24-hour period, the most recorded in a single June day for 88 years and surpassing the city\u2019s average for the whole month, according to the Indian Meteorological Department. At least 11 people died from the rain and flooding last week, including four people  who drowned in submerged underpasses, Reuters reported citing local media. Heavy rains caused roads to flood, submerged cars and subways and cut power to some parts of the city. Video posted to social media showed waterlogged streets in Delhi as residents wade waist-deep through the floods. Delhi capital region \u201cis becoming home to extreme weather every season now,\u201d said independent weatherman Navdeep Dahiya on X. Heavy rain caused a section of roof at New Delhi\u2019s airport to collapse on Friday, crushing one man to death, and injuring eight others. Photos of the scene released by the fire service showed the large white canopy of the roof had plunged to the ground, crushing several cars. One person could be seen slumped under twisted metal in the driver\u2019s seat of one of the cars. The heavy rains have brought some respite from weeks of blistering heat, with one part of Delhi reaching 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in late May \u2014 the capital\u2019s highest temperature on record. This year\u2019s scorching heat wave persisted even after the blazing sun had set, with high nighttime temperatures providing little relief. The Indian Meteorological Department has issued a weather warning until July 4 as heavy rains\u00a0hit much of India\u2019s northeast, east and northwest coast. Red alerts, indicating the highest-level threat, were issued for parts of the northeast states of Assam, Meghalaya, West Bengal, Sikkim, Bihar, and Arunachal Pradesh on Sunday. \u201cHeavy to very heavy rainfall is very likely over northwest, east and northeast India over the next four to five days,\u201d Indian Meteorological Department said Sunday. In the state of Uttar Pradesh, which borders the Indian Capital Territory, two women reportedly died after a water tank collapsed in the heavy rain, according to ANI News. In Uttarakhand, video posted by ANI News shows vehicles swept away following heavy rain being hauled out of floodwaters. CNN cannot independently verify these reports. On Friday, five Indian army personnel died after their tank got stuck in flash floods while attempting to cross a river during training in India\u2019s northern Ladakh, the army said in a post on X. \u201cRescue teams rushed to the location, however, due to high current and water levels, the rescue mission didn\u2019t succeed and the tank crew lost their lives,\u201d the army said. Heavy monsoon rains have also caused damage in neighboring countries. In Nepal, at least nine people, including three children, were killed after rains triggered landslides in the country\u2019s west, Reuters reported, citing\u00a0an\u00a0official from the National Disaster Rescue and Reduction Management Authority. From no water to too much water India, the world\u2019s most populous nation, is one of the countries worst affected by the human-caused climate crisis, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u2013 potentially affecting 1.4 billion people nationwide. The climate crisis is making extreme weather events more frequent and severe, scientists say, and this can be seen play out in\u00a0climate-vulnerable India which is suffering from extremes of heat, rainfall and other disasters such as cyclones. While India often experiences heat waves during the summer months of May and June, in recent years, they have arrived earlier and become more prolonged, with scientists linking some of these longer and more intense heat waves to climate change. New Delhi topped a recent list of hottest capital cities, recording 4,222 days above 35 degrees Celsius in the past three decades \u2013 more than any other city analyzed. Between 2014 and 2023, just under half (44%) of days in the Indian capital met that threshold, compared to 35% from 1994 to 2003, and 37% from 2004 to 2013. Delhi, like many cities in India, is suffering from a water crisis, with acute water shortages and lack of groundwater supply leaving many people to rely on water tankers for their supply of fresh, clean water. \u201cWe get water only once a day, and it\u2019s scalding hot, unless you fill up a bucket and let it cool off all day before using it, you can\u2019t bathe in this water,\u201d 60-year-old Kalyani Saha, a resident of the Lajpat Nagar neighborhood of the capital city, recently told CNN. Meanwhile, seasonal monsoon rains usually start in June until September, bringing bands of heavy rains from the southwest that quench fields, nourish crops, and replenish reservoirs. But recent studies have shown India\u2019s monsoons have become more erratic in the past 10 years, due to the climate crisis, posing significant risks to critical sectors such as agriculture, water, and energy. Last June, nearly half a million people in northeast\u00a0India\u00a0were affected by severe flooding after heavy rains battered the region. \u201cBecause of climate change, you will get more extreme rain events, which means more rain in a fewer number of rainy days, rainy hours,\u201d Sunita Narain, director general of Indian research body Centre for Science and Environment, said in a video post on YouTube last week. \u201cIf you look at the data from across India, you will find that many weather stations are already reporting that they are breaking the record of 24-hour rainfall, which means that a city, a region, can get its annual rain, as much as a whole year\u2019s rain, in a matter of a few days or even one day.\u201d Going from water scarcity to floods is a \u201ccycle that we are beginning to see more and more,\u201d Narain said, adding that it was an opportunity \u201cto make a change.\u201d In a separate video post on the importance of rainwater harvesting, Narain said, \u201cThe only way we can manage floods is when we can build drainage so that our rivers are drained into channels, into ponds, so that excess rain can be held and it can recharge groundwater for the dry season that comes after.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/climate/india-delhi-floods-extreme-rain-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_europe_viktor-orban-visits-kyiv-intl", "text": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor\u00a0Orban has made his first visit to Kyiv since Russia\u2019s full-scale war began, and urged Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky to consider a \u201cceasefire\u201d in order to \u201cspeed up peace talks\u201d with Moscow. Standing alongside Zelensky on Tuesday, Orban, who is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and has criticized European support for Ukraine, said: \u201cI asked the president to think about whether we could reverse the order, and speed up peace talks, with making a ceasefire first.\u201d Orban continued: \u201cA ceasefire connected to a deadline would give a chance to speed up peace talks. I explored this possibility with the president and I am grateful for his honest answers and negotiation.\u201d The Hungarian leader has touted the idea of ending the war with\u00a0a ceasefire as opposed to military support for Ukraine numerous times since Russia\u2019s military flooded across the border in 2022. Zelensky dismissed the idea, according to his office. Speaking on national TV on Monday, Ihor Zhovkva, deputy head of Zelensky\u2019s office, said that even though Orban \u201cwas given the opportunity to express his thoughts\u201d during his visit to Kyiv, Zelensky\u2019s position on this issue \u201cis clear, understandable and known.\u201d Zelensky previously rejected French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Olympic ceasefire proposal citing its potential to inadvertently benefit Russians on the ground. According to Zhovkva, Kyiv\u2019s number one tool to end hostilities is through a second peace summit, which Ukraine is already preparing for. \u201cWe are saying that Ukraine will draft its peace plan, a roadmap for establishing peace in Ukraine. It will develop it with all the states that are ready. Hungary is also ready for this. And then, if the aggressor country is ready to listen to this plan, ready to talk about this plan, and not to speak the language of ultimatums, then yes, during the second summit, we can say that representatives of the Russian Federation may attend this summit in one way or another,\u201d he said. Orban also stated his desire to improve relations between Budapest and Kyiv, which have been strained by the Hungarian leader\u2019s close relationship with Putin. \u201cWe would like to make the relationship between the two countries better,\u201d Orban said. \u201cWe would like to make a broad bilateral agreement with Ukraine, similar to the ones we already made with our neighbors (in the past). We would be happy to take part in the modernization of Ukraine\u2019s economy, we would like an ordered framework for this.\u201d The authoritarian Hungarian leader has regularly attempted to block European Union initiatives offering further military and financial support to Kyiv during the conflict. The Hungarian prime minister\u2019s close relationship with Putin has frequently come under scrutiny. Their bond is underpinned by both economic cooperation and some shared values. Both leaders have also enacted anti-LGBTQ policies and clamped down on freedom of speech in their countries. Hungary has supported Russia at a United Nations level and rejected EU sanctions following Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine as early as 2014, after Russia illegally annexed Crimea. Tuesday\u2019s meeting comes as Orban and Hungary take control of the EU Council\u2019s rotating presidency, which changes every six months. During each six-month period, the country controlling the presidency does not take control of the EU\u2019s overall agenda, but does have a platform through which they can hammer home their own priorities. On the EU Council\u2019s website, it likens holding the presidency \u201cto someone hosting a dinner, making sure their guests all gather in harmony,\u201d adding that to \u201cguarantee effectiveness, the presidency acts as an \u2018honest broker,\u2019 rising above the holder\u2019s own national interest.\u201d Orban took control of the presidency on Monday with a call to \u201cMake Europe Great Again,\u201d a reference to Donald Trump\u2019s political slogan that will alarm many of his European counterparts who are braced for the former US president\u2019s potential return to the White House, concerned about what it will mean for the EU. Other key European diplomatic meetings are planned for July. NATO will celebrate 75 years of the alliance in Washington, DC between July 9 and 11. The agenda for that event is expected to be dominated by long-term plans to support Ukraine and conversations about its eventual accession to the alliance. The European Political Community (EPC), a forum for 47 European countries, inside and outside the EU, to discuss the continent\u2019s strategic challenges, will also meet on July 18 in the United Kingdom. Ukraine and Hungary are both members of the EPC. It is expected that Ukraine will dominate that agenda and Zelensky may attend the meeting in person. Orban may have had this in mind when timing this trip to Kyiv, ensuring that his first meeting with Ukraine\u2019s president since the start of the war was not in such a public and high-stakes diplomatic setting.

{"id": "2024_06_27_europe_france-parliament-election-explainer-intl-cmd", "text": "France\u2019s snap parliamentary election is one of the most momentous in decades, for both the country and the rest of Europe. Within two weeks, France could have a hard-left or hard-right government \u2013 or descend into political deadlock if no bloc wins a majority, leaving Paris hamstrung as problems mount at home and abroad. The election will take place over two rounds on June 30 and July 7. How will it work, who are the key players and what is at stake? How did we get here? Minutes after it was announced that his Renaissance party had been trounced in the European Parliament elections, President Emmanuel Macron called a snap national election \u2013 becoming the first president to do so since 1997. Renaissance had come a distant second, with less than half the votes won by the far-right National Rally (RN), the party of Marine Le Pen \u2013 and only marginally ahead of the left-wing coalition in third. Macron is not afraid of bold decisions. The first time he ran for elected office, under a party he had created only the year before, he became president. But even by his standards, this is a huge risk. \u201cIf his bet pays off, he\u2019ll go down as a brilliant strategist,\u201d Kevin Arceneaux, a political scientist at Sciences Po university in Paris, told CNN. \u201cIf not, I think he will go down in history as somebody who essentially exploded the traditional party system in France, and\u2026 took a grenade to the institutions of the Fifth Republic.\u201d Why did Macron call an election? Macron\u2019s decision took even his closest allies by surprise. France\u2019s next elections were not scheduled until 2027. Politicians rarely call an election when their party trails in the polls and there is no need to do so. Analysts have parsed his potential motives. Although Macron was elected to a second presidential term in 2022, his party failed to win an outright parliamentary majority. To pass controversial bills like his pension reform, Macron has increasingly had to bypass parliament and resort to presidential decree, to the outrage of opposition parties and much of the public. One theory about why Macron called an election now is that France might soon have been forced to the polls anyway. Every time Macron passes a law by presidential decree, under Article 49.3 of the French constitution, the parliament can hold a vote of confidence in his government. With more spending bills slated for later this year, Macron\u2019s government may not have survived another of these. Perhaps he judged it is better to jump than be pushed. Another theory is that Macron is gambling that he can defeat extremist parties by exposing them to government. With Le Pen seeming increasingly likely to succeed him as president in 2027 \u2013 when Macron will be unable to stand for a third term \u2013 this election may force her party to take up responsibility beforehand. Out of office, both the hard left and hard right have been able to rail against his policies and make outlandish promises of their own. Once in office, they will run into constraints and may find themselves unable to deliver on their promises \u2013 or simply risk being proved incompetent. Relinquishing some power now may give Macron\u2019s platform a better chance of retaining it in 2027. How does the election work? France\u2019s National Assembly has 577 seats, one for each of its electoral districts. For an absolute majority a party needs 289. In the outgoing government, Macron\u2019s alliance had only 250 seats, and so needed support from other parties to pass laws. If a candidate wins a majority of votes in the first ballot on a 25% turnout, they win the seat. But most elections go to a second round the following Sunday. Only those who won more than 12.5% of the votes of registered voters are allowed to stand in the second round, meaning it is often fought between two candidates, but sometimes three or four. At this stage, some candidates may drop out to give allies a better chance of victory. What are the roles of the parliament and president? The National Assembly is responsible for passing domestic laws \u2013 from pensions and taxation to immigration and education \u2013 while the president determines the country\u2019s foreign, Europe and defense policy. When the president and majority in parliament belong to the same party, things run well. When they don\u2019t, the government can grind to a halt. With Macron\u2019s party trailing in the polls and three years left on his presidential term, he may have to appoint a prime minister from an opposition party \u2013 in an arrangement known as \u201ccohabitation.\u201d Nonetheless, Macron has pledged to see out the remainder of his presidential term. Other government ministers are appointed by the president on the prime minister\u2019s advice. While Macron would in theory be free to nominate whomever he pleases, in practice he would be compelled to nominate ministers that reflect the will of the majority of the National Assembly. Who are the key players? In January, Gabriel Attal \u2013 Macron\u2019s protege \u2013 became the youngest prime minister in French history, at the age of 34. Just seven months later, his record could be broken by Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old leader of the RN. Bardella was handpicked by Le Pen to head the party in 2022, ending a 50-year-rule by the Le Pen family and continuing to detoxify the party from its antisemitic and jackbooted past. Bardella grew up as an only child in social housing in Seine-Saint-Denis, a working-class suburb in Paris. He joined the RN when he was 16 and briefly attended the prestigious Sorbonne university, before dropping out to climb the party ranks. If appointed, he will become Europe\u2019s youngest prime minister in more than two centuries. Bardella\u2019s campaign was bolstered after Eric Ciotti, leader of the mainstream conservative party, the Republicans, said they would enter coalition with the RN. His announcement drew fury from his blindsided party, which has attempted to oust him \u2013 so far unsuccessfully. Ciotti\u2019s endorsement may represent the death knell of France\u2019s \u201ccordon sanitaire\u201d \u2013 the principle by which mainstream parties refuse to cooperate with the radical extremes. On the left, four days after Macron called the election, a cluster of parties banded together to form the New Popular Front \u2013 a coalition meant to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked fascists from gaining power in 1936. The capacious \u2013 and potentially fractious \u2013 alliance comprises three-time presidential candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, leader of the France Unbowed party; the Socialists; the Communists; the Ecologists; and Place Publique, headed by the popular member of the European Parliament (MEP) Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann. It is not clear who the bloc would nominate as prime minister, nor how lasting the coalition might prove to be. But it could deliver a blow to Macron\u2019s Renaissance. Rather than several left-wing candidates appearing on the ballot, fragmenting the left-wing vote, there will now only be one in most constituencies, making it easier for the candidate to progress to the second round. What problems might an incoming government face? Since Macron called the election, the financial markets have taken fright \u2013 first at the prospect of an extremist government, then at the economic policies of the left and right. Earlier this month, the risk premium investors demand to hold French government debt reached its highest since 2022. France is running one of the highest deficits in the Eurozone and now risks falling foul of the European Commission\u2019s new fiscal rules, which had been suspended to help countries recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and energy crisis. French government spending could soon be brutally constrained by Brussels, despite the lavish promises of the RN and New Popular Front. \u201cThe debate on the left and the right is not about fiscal consolidation, it\u2019s about the degree of fiscal expansion they want to implement,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at political risk consultancy the Eurasia Group, told CNN. \u201cNo one is talking about austerity.\u201d Although Bardella has recently tempered some of the RN\u2019s spending plans, Rahman warned there could be a \u201cmajor confrontation\u201d between Brussels and an incoming French government. While these spending constraints might prevent an incoming far-right government from making good on its electoral promises, this may harm rather than help Macron. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that if there\u2019s chaos, it necessarily arrests the momentum of the far right. It may also hurt Macron. The electorate may conclude that ultimately the far right wasn\u2019t able to implement their program because Macron was a constraint \u2013 and that the way to get over the chaos is to ultimately give the far right a majority in 2027,\u201d said Rahman. \u201cI think everyone\u2019s going to end up with blood on their hands \u2013 not just the far right, but probably Macron as well.\u201d What might the outcome be? The two-round voting system makes predictions difficult. If the RN reaches the second round in lots of constituencies, people may vote tactically to keep the party out. But their lead in the polls suggests they are on track to improve significantly on the 88 seats they had in the outgoing parliament \u2013 even if they fall short of an absolute majority. The most likely scenario is a hung parliament, with a relative majority for the RN. But Bardella has said his party will only form a government if it wins an absolute majority. Macron might then have to search for a prime minister on the hard left, or somewhere else entirely. France might have to opt for a \u201ctechnocratic\u201d government \u2013 but these tend to fan the flames of populism rather than extinguish them. Whatever the composition of the next Assembly, France\u2019s next three years are likely to be marked by instability, as parties try to keep their hands clean ahead of the key presidential - and potentially parliamentary - elections in 2027. \u201cOne possibility is that in anticipation of those elections, all the parties in the parliament will see reasons to block each other,\u201d said Arceneaux. \u201cIf we arrive in that situation, we\u2019re just going to have a paralyzed government that\u2019s unable to do anything.\u201d This will likely raise constitutional questions, as domestic and foreign policy questions clash. Bardella has ruled out sending troops to Ukraine \u2013 an idea floated by Macron \u2013 and said he would not allow Kyiv to use French military equipment to strike targets inside Russia. In that situation, whose will would prevail \u2013 Bardella\u2019s or Macron\u2019s? \u201cThis is a perfect example of what we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Arceneaux. \u201cMacron could say, \u2018As President of France, foreign affairs are my responsibility\u2026 so I\u2019m not going to enforce that.\u2019 But then you have a problem, right? You have a constitutional crisis.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/europe/france-parliament-election-explainer-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_02_weather_hurricane-beryl-jamaica-caribbean-forecast", "text": "Hurricane Beryl, now a potentially catastrophic Category 5 storm, has set its sights on Jamaica after leaving at least one person dead and inflicting ruin across entire islands in the Caribbean on Monday. The storm is expected to bring life-threatening winds and storm surge to Jamaica on Wednesday and impact the Cayman Islands on Thursday, where a hurricane watch has been issued. The storm continues to smash records as it kicks off an exceptionally early hurricane season as the earliest Category 5 hurricane \u2013 and only the second Atlantic storm of such strength to be recorded in July. Beryl alarming strengthening has been fed by\u00a0abnormally warm ocean waters driven by planet-warming fossil fuel pollution. It took only\u00a0minutes for Beryl to tear through Grenada on Monday, blasting through buildings and knocking out power and phone service to almost all of the island\u2019s residents, the governor\u2019s office said. \u201cIn half an hour, Carriacou was flattened,\u201d Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said Monday. A path of \u201cimmense destruction, pain (and) suffering\u201d was torn through the neighboring nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where at least one person has been reported dead, said Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves. Parts of the islands, including hospitals, have no electricity and others are without water. About 90% of the homes on the nation\u2019s Union Island are damaged or destroyed, Gonsalves said. Hundreds more homes and several schools, churches and government buildings in St. Vincent also sustained severe damage. \u201cTomorrow we get up with our commitment and conviction to rebuild our lives and our families\u2019 lives,\u201d Gonsalves said Monday night. Though Beryl is likely to fluctuate in strength in the coming days, it is expected to remain an \u201cextremely dangerous major hurricane\u201d \u2013 Category 3 or stronger \u2013 through mid-week, the hurricane center said. The hurricane will continue packing strong winds, torrential rain and hazardous seas extending well beyond its center over much of the Caribbean. Even if Beryl doesn\u2019t make landfall in Jamaica, its outer bands will bring significant impacts. The latest on Beryl \u2022 Jamaica braces for severe impacts: A hurricane warning is in place for Jamaica, where hurricane conditions will impact the island on Wednesday. Tropical storm-force winds are expected earlier in the day on Wednesday. Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above normal tide levels and rainfall of 4 to 8 inches with isolated totals up to 12 inches is forecast. \u2022 Dominican Republic and Haiti under storm warnings: The southern coasts of Haiti and Dominican Republic remain under tropical storm warnings, with tropical storm conditions beginning Tuesday. Storm surge up to 3 feet is possible, and rainfall totals could reach 6 inches. \u2022 Extended state of emergency in Grenada: The order has been extended until July 7 due to the severe damage wrought by the storm, said Neila K. Ettienne, spokesperson for the prime minister\u2019s office. About 95% of the island of Grenada has lost power, she said. Telecommunications are also down and some individuals have lost internet service. \u2022 St. Vincent and Grenadines rush to restore power: Local authorities are \u201cworking feverishly, urgently and with great focus to get electricity in certain places tonight,\u201d Prime Minister Gonsalves said Monday. Many trees have collapsed on power lines. Even so, government buildings will reopen Tuesday and the prime minister urged business owners to open, if possible. \u2022 Huge blow to Barbados fishing industry: Though Barbados was spared from the brunt of the storm, large storm surge damaged numerous fishing vessels \u2013 a massive loss to the nation\u2019s fishing industry. At least 20 vessels have sunken, Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley said Monday. Some fishermen at the Bridgetown Fisheries Complex watched helplessly as violent waves slammed boats into each other or pulled them underwater, CNN affiliate CBC reports. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more we can do than stand and watch total destruction \u2013 our livelihood gone down the drain,\u201d one resident told CBC. \u2022 Cricket team and fans stranded: Some cricket fans who had traveled to Barbados for the T20 World Cup \u2013 and even the winning Indian team itself \u2013 have been unable to leave the island as Hurricane Beryl forced the Grantley Adams International Airport to suspend operations. But the Indian team is likely to make its way home Tuesday after the airport\u2019s planned reopening, Mottley said.  Kicking off a far from normal hurricane season Beryl has shattered numerous records and is a troubling indicator that this season will be far from normal in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. On Sunday it became the earliest\u00a0major hurricane \u2013 defined as one that is Category 3 or higher \u2013 in the Atlantic in 58 years and the only one to reach Category 4 status in the month of June. It is also the strongest known hurricane to pass through the southern Windward Islands, which lie at the eastern edge of the Caribbean Sea, according to data from NOAA that goes back to 1851. The hurricane was able to churn to life because the ocean is as warm now as it would normally be at the peak of hurricane season, said Jim Kossin, a hurricane expert and science advisor at nonprofit First Street Foundation. \u201cHurricanes don\u2019t know what month it is, they only know what their ambient environment is,\u201d Kossin told CNN. \u201cBeryl is breaking records for the month of June because Beryl thinks it\u2019s September.\u201d The ocean warm ocean temperatures fueling Beryl\u2019s unprecedented strengthening \u201ccertainly have a human fingerprint on them,\u201d Kossin said.

The two men and the entire crew of the yacht have denied any wrondoing. Eleven other crew members were freed on bail and with restrictions. Wildfires are common in the Mediterranean country but they have become more frequent and devastating due to hotter, drier and windier conditions, which scientists link to climate change. Greece has, in recent years, beefed up penalties for arson.

{"id": "2024_06_30_weather_hurricane-beryl-barbados-caribbean-sunday", "text": "Beryl, the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season, intensified to an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph Sunday, as it made its way toward the Windward Islands. Beryl is now the earliest Category 4 hurricane on record in the Atlantic Ocean and the only Category 4 storm ever recorded in the month of June. Tropical storm-force winds are expected to reach the Windward Islands late Sunday or early Monday. The early timing of the season\u2019s first hurricane is unusual, given the average date for the first hurricane is August 11. As of 8 p.m. ET, Beryl was about 200 miles southeast of Barbados, heading west. \u201cA life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels by as much as 6 to 9 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore flow near where the eye makes landfall in the hurricane warning area,\u201d the National Hurricane Center said, adding that the surge could bring large and destructive waves near the coast. The hurricane is strengthening quickly, increasing 55 mph in the 24 hours before Sunday morning. \u201cWe\u2019re forecasting rapid intensification and expecting\u00a0Beryl\u00a0to become a major hurricane before it reaches places like Barbados and the Windward islands and continue to be a powerful hurricane as it moves into the eastern and central Caribbean as we go into the early portions of next week,\u201d hurricane center Director Mike Brennan told CNN\u2019s\u00a0Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday. The hurricane center defines rapid intensification as an increase in maximum sustained wind speed of 35 mph or more in a 24-hour period. Residents in places with hurricane warnings should be prepared for major storm impacts, Brennan said. Beryl brings a risk of heavy rainfall, destructive hurricane-force winds and dangerous storm surge and waves. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches could bring localized flooding across the Windward Islands Sunday night and Monday, according to the center. Hurricane warnings are in effect for Barbados, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadine Islands, Grenada and Tobago. The hurricane is expected to produce 3 to 6 inches of rain across Barbados and the Windward Islands through Monday, the weather center said. Beryl\u2019s passage near the Windward Islands of Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as a powerful Category 4 hurricane would make it the strongest storm there since Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Tobago was placed under a red-level warning \u2013 the highest public alert issued by the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service \u2013 early Sunday evening, the agency said. The warning instructs the island\u2019s residents to take immediate action to protect their lives, livelihoods and property. \u201cShelter in place or evacuate to a safe location if your home is unsafe or vulnerable to flooding or wind damage,\u201d the agency said in a notice to the public. \u201cSecure food, water and medicine for at least 7 days in waterproof containers. Outdoor drains should be clear and loose objects secured by now. Sandbags should be near all entrances to your home.\u201d The Dominican Republic\u2019s government has issued a tropical storm watch from Punta Palenque westward to the border with Haiti ahead of Beryl, according to the hurricane center. A tropical storm watch has also been issued for Haiti\u2019s entire south coast, from the border of the Dominican Republic to Anse-d\u2019Hainault, the center\u2019s update stated. A tropical storm warning remains in effect for Martinique and a tropical storm watch for Dominica and Trinidad. Communities prepare for hurricane In Barbados, where the effects of Beryl are expected to be felt late Sunday, people across the island nation are making preparations. Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley urged all non-essential businesses on the island to close by 8:30 p.m. Sunday. The center of Beryl is expected to pass about 75 miles south of the island sometime early Monday morning, The Barbados Meteorological Services said Sunday. The storm could bring hurricane-force winds, heavy rainfall, flash flooding and some severe thunderstorm activity. \u201cThe reality is that we do not want to put anybody\u2019s life at risk in this country,\u201d Mottley said in a video message Saturday night. Barbados, Grenada and Saint Lucia will close some of their airports Sunday night as Beryl approaches. Grenada\u2019s Maurice Bishop International Airport will close at 6 p.m. and is tentatively set to reopen on Tuesday at 10 a.m., a spokesperson for the Grenada Airports Authority told CNN. He noted the hours could change depending on the situation and officials will provide updates on their social media account, Spice Weather 473. In Barbados, the Grantley Adams International Airport announced it will close from 7 p.m. until further notice. The Hewanorra International Airport and the George F. L. Charles Airport in Saint Lucia will also suspend operations, according to the tourism authority. Barbados is still hosting cricket fans from around the globe who traveled to the island for the T20 World Cup, Mottley noted. \u201cOur visitors are here with us,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of them are not due to leave until Monday and Tuesday, and some of them have never gone through a hurricane or a storm before.\u201d She urged residents to provide support for those who aren\u2019t able to leave on Sunday, and to continue making hurricane preparations for themselves. CNN affiliate CBC Barbados reported large crowds and long lines at a local grocery store just after 7 a.m. People were also seen filling up their gas tanks Saturday. Some people were still relaxing on the beach Sunday, CBC reported. In Saint Lucia, a national shutdown will be in effect from 8:30 p.m. Sunday, Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre announced in a statement. Businesses and schools will remain closed on Monday, the prime minister said, urging the public to stay indoors until the all-clear is given. \u201cI encourage everyone to secure their property, identify and check on the vulnerable in your community and ensure that you have the necessary essentials to weather the approaching system,\u201d Pierre said. First hurricane of the season unusually early Beryl is the earliest\u00a0major hurricane \u2013 defined as one that is Category 3 or higher \u2013 in the Atlantic in 58 years. The storm\u2019s rapid intensification is very unusual this early into hurricane season, according to Brennan. It\u2019s rare for tropical systems to form in the central Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles in June, particularly strong ones, with only a handful having done so, according to NOAA records. Beryl isn\u2019t just early for this hurricane season: It is now the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s third-earliest major hurricane. The earliest was Hurricane Alma on June 8, 1966, followed by Hurricane Audrey, which reached major hurricane status on June 27, 1957. The storm has already set the record for the easternmost hurricane to form in the Tropical Atlantic in June, beating a previous record set in 1933. The central and eastern Atlantic traditionally become more active in August, in part because ocean temperatures have had time to warm and fuel developing systems. This year, however, the Atlantic basin has seen above normal water temperatures and a lack of wind shear due to the transition from El Ni\u00f1o season to La Ni\u00f1a season, both of which are fuel for tropical development. \u201cBeryl\u00a0has found an environment with very warm ocean waters for this time of year,\u201d Brennan said. Warmer waters in the Atlantic Basin have given tropical storms and hurricanes the opportunity to develop at a more rapid pace in an more eastward position, according to Brennan, allowing storms to become more powerful and therefore more destructive earlier on in hurricane season, which runs from June 1 until November 30. \u201cThese are ocean water you\u2019d normally see like in August or September, but now we\u2019re seeing them in late June,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of opening up more of the deep tropical Atlantic for formation before we get to what would be the traditional peak of the hurricane season.\u201d Caribbean islands urge public to prepare ahead of hurricane Authorities are urging residents to take precautionary measures, with several Caribbean nations under hurricane watches and warnings while Hurricane\u00a0Beryl\u00a0approaches and gains strength. Officials in Barbados say the island is expected to feel the impact of the storm as early as late Sunday night. Its meteorological service is anticipating storm-force winds, 3 to 6 inches of rain, \u201chazardous\u201d marine conditions and severe thunderstorms that may interrupt power utilities. \u201cAll the regular preparations that we do for a hurricane is in full swing,\u201d Minister of Home Affairs and Information Wilfred Abrahams said in a statement. \u201cWe have less than 48 hours until we expect to see the effects of this system impacting Barbados. Please use the time very wisely.\u201d In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves warns that the storm could hit the islands by Monday morning as a Category 2 hurricane. The meteorological service forecasts sustained winds of 74 to 110 mph or greater and rainfall of 4 to 6 inches. \u201cKingstown is going to be flooded once this hurricane is on track,\u201d Gonsalves said of the capital city. \u201cNormally, two inches of rain \u2013 sustained rain \u2013 in a relatively short period of time will flood the city. Four inches will undoubtedly flood the city.\u201d In Saint Lucia, the government warns that the storm could bring \u201cmoderate to heavy showers, thunderstorms, and gusty winds\u201d to the region. Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre is advising residents to make necessary preparations and review their family emergency plans. In Grenada, the National Disaster Management Agency is also urging residents to prepare by having disaster supplies kits, trimming overhanging trees and branches, clearing drains and knowing where their emergency shelters are located. The island\u2019s officials declared a state of emergency Sunday evening ahead of the storm. Beryl is expected to impact the island early Monday, Grenada\u2019s Gov. General, Cecile La Grenade, said in a statement. All establishments will be closed except the police force, hospitals, prisons, waste disposal and ports. Tropical Depression Three forms in Gulf of Mexico As the trend of an active early Atlantic hurricane season continues, a new tropical depression has formed over the southern Gulf of Mexico in the Bay of Campeche. Tropical Depression Three is located about 185 miles east-southeast of Tuxpan, Mexico, and is moving west at 12 mph with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm before it moves onshore in eastern Mexico overnight on Sunday. \u201cThe official intensity forecast calls for the system to become a tropical storm before landfall,\u201d the hurricane center said. \u201cAfterward, the circulation is very likely to dissipate over the mountainous terrain of eastern Mexico by Monday night.\u201d The government of Mexico has issued a tropical storm warning from Cabo Rojo south to Puerto Veracruz. Heavy rainfall totaling 4 to 8 inches across portions of eastern Mexico could result in flooding, with mudslides possible in areas of higher terrain, the center noted. The next name on the list of Atlantic storm names is Chris. NOAA predicts above-normal hurricane season Systems forming this early in the summer in this part of the Atlantic\u00a0is a sign of the hyperactive hurricane season to come, according to\u00a0research from\u00a0Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University.\u00a0Normally, ocean temperatures aren\u2019t warm enough in June and July to help tropical systems thrive. National Weather Service forecasters\u00a0predict 17 to 25 named storms this season, with eight to 13 of those becoming hurricanes, including four to seven major hurricanes. \u201cThat\u2019s well above average,\u201d Brennan noted. The weather service says that\u2019s \u201cdue to a confluence of factors, including near-record warm ocean temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean, development of La Nina conditions in the Pacific, reduced Atlantic trade winds and less wind shear, all of which tend to favor tropical storm formation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/30/weather/hurricane-beryl-barbados-caribbean-sunday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

Rioters threw stones at police officers and the car of Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf as he returned to his house, according to an Israeli police spokesperson. Protesters also set trash cans and the road on fire, blocking the highway. Goldknopf\u2019s spokesperson confirmed to CNN that police evacuated him safely from the area a few minutes after the attack and he was not injured. Goldknopf is the minister of housing and construction and the head of the United Torah Judaism party. Social media videos showed protesters surrounding the minister\u2019s car with some banging on its windows. Other videos showed children and teen protesters walking near to dumpster fires. Ultra-Orthodox Jews have been protesting in the streets of Jerusalem since the Israeli Supreme Court\u00a0issued a ruling\u00a0Tuesday ordering the government to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military. Since Israel\u2019s founding, ultra-Orthodox Jews have been exempted from mandatory military service.

Police said they had to use force to disperse the protesters after orders for them to leave were ignored. Five people were arrested, two of them for attacking police officers, and three others for throwing stones or other objects, the police said in a statement. Some officers are remaining in the area to direct traffic and prevent further disturbances, the police said. \u201cThe police take seriously the attempts of those violent lawbreakers to hurt Israeli police officers with stones, sticks, eggs and other things. There is no connection between a lawful protest and criminal and violent conduct of this type \u2013 which may lead to injury to body and property,\u201d the police said in a statement. \u201cThe conduct of those who disturb the order and break the law in the area deserves every reproach.

{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_europe-election-youth-far-right-intl-cmd", "text": "Pollsters were surprised by the burst of populism in 2016, but many now think they shouldn\u2019t have been. In the United States and United Kingdom, swaths of voters in deprived regions \u2013 places \u201cleft behind\u201d by globalization \u2013 were given the chance to stick it to the system, and they took it. Why was anyone surprised? Pollsters have now been surprised by another trend. In this month\u2019s European Parliament elections, far-right parties performed predictably well \u2013 but especially, and unexpectedly, among young people. A few years ago, \u201cGeneration Climate\u201d \u2013 thought to be unquestionably liberal and progressive \u2013 were voting mostly green. But now, their vote has helped far-right parties capture one in four seats in Brussels. What happened? Perhaps the \u201cleft behind\u201d is not only a geographical phenomenon, but generational. Gen-Z - those born between 1995 and 2012 - has been baptized in crises: first the financial, then the eurozone, then of the pandemic and now of war in Europe. More and more young people believe they will have harder lives than their parents. Why should a left-behind generation be less vulnerable to the lure of populism than left-behind places? Roberto Foa, co-director of the Centre for the Future of Democracy at the University of Cambridge, a leading researcher of youth dissatisfaction with democracy, sees \u201ctwo big divides\u201d in Western societies: \u201cThe wealth divide between economically successful and left-behind regions, and the intergenerational divide in life opportunities.\u201d Political scientists may have overlooked both cohorts because they have long been disconnected. But now their apathy is turning into antipathy \u2013 a desire, once more, to stick it to the system. \u201cIf you are a political entrepreneur who is seeking to break the established party system, those are your options, in terms of mobilizing fresh support,\u201d Foa told CNN. The trend, he says, has been a long time coming: \u201cI\u2019m surprised that people are surprised.\u201d Youth support for far-right parties is being felt in several European countries. In Germany, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), won 16% of the under-25 vote in the EU elections \u2013 tripling its share in that demographic from the previous vote in 2019. Among French voters under 34, the National Rally (RN) was the most popular party, with 32% of the vote \u2013 a 10-point rise compared to 2019. In Poland, 30% of under-30 voters supported the far-right Confederation party, up from 18.5% in 2019. Far-right parties enjoyed a similar uptick in support in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Austria, and continued to do well in Italy. How alarmed \u2013 and surprised \u2013 should mainstream parties be? Generation, not geography Consider these policy proposals. Young people will pay no income tax. If they start a business, they will be exempt from corporation tax for five years. Students working part-time will have their wages topped up by the state, which will also build 100,000 units of student housing. They can also travel by train for free. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking this must be the platform of the far left. But no: This was RN doyenne Marine Le Pen\u2019s offer in the 2022 French presidential election, which she narrowly lost. Young people, unsurprisingly, loved it. Just under 50% of 25-to-34-year-olds who cast a vote opted for Le Pen, compared to just 41% of the general population and 29% of voters over 70. Whereas the \u201cgray vote\u201d took Donald Trump to the White House and Britain from the EU, it kept the French far right at bay. That may soon change. After his Renaissance party was trounced by the far-right in the EU elections, President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election, which could result in Jordan Bardella, the RN\u2019s 28-year-old leader, becoming France\u2019s prime minister next month. For Arthur Prevot, manager of the RN\u2019s youth wing in Paris, this is great news. Macron\u2019s presidency has failed to deliver for young people, he says. \u201cPurchasing power has decreased incredibly over the past seven years. Between the \u2018gilets jaunes\u2019 crisis, the rise in fuel prices, and all the different taxes that have been introduced \u2013 all of this impacts daily life, including mine,\u201d Prevot, 22, told CNN. His economic concerns prompted him to join the party which may soon govern France, although Macron will remain president. Jonathan Verbeken, a deputy RN candidate in Paris\u2019 15th district, said the main reason he joined the party was because, \u201cwe see people suffering daily, struggling to make ends meet. We see a deplorable situation in France, specifically with security and immigration. We want to react to that.\u201d To many older voters, the RN remains a terrifying prospect. Despite its years-long effort to \u201cnormalize,\u201d previous generations remember its antisemitic, neofascist origins. But young voters appear less concerned by these roots, says Simon Schnetzer, author of a recent survey of Germany\u2019s youth. \u201cYoung people are first-time voters. They are a blank sheet. What drives their decisions most is: Who can offer me something that best fits my needs?\u201d he told CNN. The lack of historical baggage, coupled with the strange death of center-left parties in many parts of Europe, has allowed the far right to appear respectable and armed with economic solutions to young people\u2019s problems. Sarah-Lee Heinrichs, a 23-year-old politician for the German Green Party, said economic concerns have become far more prevalent among young people since the last European Parliament elections in 2019, when the Greens became the second largest party in Germany for the first time. In the wake of the pandemic, the full-scale war in Ukraine and the return of soaring inflation, environmentalism is no longer young people\u2019s priority, she says. \u201cIf governments don\u2019t provide social security \u2013 good jobs and a place to live that doesn\u2019t cost more than 50% of your income every month \u2013 then the far-right will rise,\u201d Heinrichs told CNN. And with economic insecurity is coming fiercer opposition to immigration, nearly a decade after the continent \u2013 and especially Germany - welcomed a record number of refugees fleeing war in Syria. An alarming new trend began last month, after a short clip filmed on the German vacation island of Sylt was posted on X. In the video, well-dressed German youths belt out \u201cAusl\u00e4nder Raus!\u201d (\u201cforeigners out!\u201d) and \u201cDeutschland den Deutschen!\u201d (\u201cGermany for Germans!\u201d) over a 1999 Eurodance beat. The chant has since swirled across the country, currently hosting the European soccer championships. Its appeal is not confined to Germans. As Italy played Spain last week, fans in the stadium could be heard giving their own rendition. Swiping right If that\u2019s the \u201cdemand\u201d side, what about the supply? After her center-right bloc secured the most seats in the European Parliament, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen took to the stage in Brussels to give a victory speech. But her tone was more somber than victorious. She spoke of the importance of defending European values: integration, democracy and the rule of law. How do these abstract values sound to young voters? \u201cYoung people will double check, does that help me with any of my needs? Does it entertain me? Does it give me security? Is it fun? And if it\u2019s none of that, it\u2019s boring,\u201d said Schnetzer. \u201cIf you have this TikTok logic, you\u2019ll quickly swipe further.\u201d While Europe\u2019s mainstream gives grave speeches, the far right is developing vast followings on social media platform TikTok. The RN\u2019s clean-shaven Bardella posts videos of himself wine tasting and doing shots. Maximilian Krah, the AfD\u2019s lead candidate going into\u00a0the EU elections, offers his followers dating advice: \u201cDon\u2019t watch porn, don\u2019t vote for the Greens.\u201d In one TikTok, Nigel Farage \u2013 often described as the \u201carchitect\u201d of Brexit \u2013 approaches a fruit store, says \u201clovely melons,\u201d raises his eyebrows and walks off. The clip has been viewed 2.5 million times. Farage seems aware of this burgeoning market and keen to exploit it. In a recent interview, he praised misogynist online influencer Andrew Tate for being an \u201cimportant voice\u201d for \u201cemasculated\u201d young boys. Tate \u2013 who has racked up billions of views on TikTok \u2013 is facing charges in Romania of human trafficking and rape, which he denies. But those who have puzzled over Tate\u2019s appeal to young men should not be surprised that politicians making jokes about breasts enjoy similar success. The distinction between politicians and entertainment has long grown fuzzy \u2013 but for today\u2019s young, they no longer even exist in separate spaces. Just one swipe separates the voice of a figure like Tate and the voice of a politician. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised if here is where ideas are shaped. Thrill of the new It is not yet clear how deeply these far-right sympathies are held. In a trend especially pronounced among young people, voters are increasingly \u201cnot loyal to any particular party or platform,\u201d says Foa. \u201cThey\u2019re very volatile between one election and the next.\u201d Just as young voters campaigned vociferously for green parties in 2019, their allegiances could switch again. The appeal of the far right may also be dampened if its politicians begin to govern. Out of office, the far right is unable to break promises, while it can point endlessly to the mainstream\u2019s inability to deliver. Once in government, it will prove just as disappointing. That, at least, appears to be\u00a0Macron\u2019s theory. But the burst in support for far-right parties could spell a darker trend. In his studies of youth dissatisfaction with democracy, Foa noted a growing penchant for authoritarianism. Lacking a personal memory of life under authoritarian rule or the struggle to achieve democracy, young people are less enamored with the system than previous generations. This success of far-right parties should be a warning to Europe\u2019s mainstream. To Churchill\u2019s famous quote, \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others,\u201d we should not be surprised if young people ask in reply: \u201cReally?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/europe-election-youth-far-right-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

Cody Gakpo opened the scoring for the Netherlands in Munich with a powerful finish midway through the first half as he continued his impressive goalscoring form at the tournament. It was the Liverpool forward\u2019s third goal of Euro 2024. The Dutch had multiple opportunities to double its lead but were wasteful in front of goal until Gakpo produced a magical run to set up Donyell Malen for the Netherlands\u2019 second. It was Malen who scored the third Dutch goal in added time, running clear before finding the net with a low shot. The Netherlands will play Turkey in the quarterfinals after its 2-1 win over Austria in Leipzig later on Tuesday. A convincing performance Monday\u2019s game was played in Munich\u2019s Allianz Arena, a ground which is approximately six miles away from the city\u2019s former main stadium. The Olympic Stadium staged two of the most famous moments in Dutch football history \u2013 the Netherlands\u2019 loss to West Germany in the 1974 World Cup final and when it won the 1988 Euros. Having been beaten by Austria in its final group game in Berlin, the Netherlands were a different proposition in Munich on Tuesday, perhaps channeling some of that historical success in the Bavarian capital. Gakpo opening the scoring with a wonderful solo goal, picking the ball up wide on the left before driving into the Romania box and blasting past Florin Ni\u021b\u0103 at his near post. The goal makes him the joint-top goalscorer at the tournament alongside Georgia\u2019s Georges Mikautadze, Jamal Musiala of Germany and Slovakia\u2019s Ivan Schranz. Ronald Koeman\u2019s side came close to doubling its lead minutes later, but Stefan de Vrij\u2019s header from close range found the side-netting of the Romania goal. The Oranje was completely on top after Gakpo\u2019s goal, dominating possession and producing some confident passing play to torment the Romanian defense. Xavi Simons was the next to come close but his effort from a good position dribbled harmlessly wide. Although Romania \u2013 playing in the knockout stages of a European Championships for just the second time and first since 2000 \u2013 grew into the first half, Edward Iord\u0103nescu\u2019s side was unable to trouble Dutch goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen before the interval. The Dutch dominated the second half. Memphis Depay looked like he could just tap into the net from close range, only for Andrei Ra\u021biu to produce a brilliant defensive challenge. Minutes later, the Dutch captain, Virgil van Dijk, hit the post with a header from a corner. Gakpo continued to torment the Romanian defense, and he thought he had doubled the Netherlands\u2019 lead when he slammed home from close range only for the video assistant referee (VAR) to rule the goal out for offside. The Netherlands finally got that second goal in the 83rd minute when Gakpo managed to keep the ball in play on the byline. The 25-year-old then cleverly pulled the ball back for Malen, who slammed home for his first goal of the tournament. Things got even better for Malen in the final seconds of the game, as he got his second goal of the game by finishing off a swift counterattack.

{"id": "2024_06_25_tech_microsoft-teams-eu-antitrust", "text": "Microsoft has violated European Union antitrust laws by bundling Teams with its other popular applications for businesses, EU officials said Tuesday, marking the bloc\u2019s latest challenge to a US tech giant. If confirmed, the preliminary findings of an EU investigation could lead to a fine of up to 10% of Microsoft\u2019s global revenue, which totaled $211 billion in its latest financial year. The announcement comes a day after EU regulators accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act, a groundbreaking law that forced big changes on dominant tech platforms after it came into force in March. Apple, which has denied wrongdoing, also faces a huge fine if the charges are confirmed. The actions by the EU could result in changes to the way hundreds of millions of Europeans access services on some of the world\u2019s biggest digital platforms, reflecting a big push by European lawmakers to rein in the power of Big Tech. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, opened an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s software practices almost a year ago following a complaint in 2020 by the cloud-based internal messaging app Slack, which is now owned by Salesforce (CRM). Slack alleged that Microsoft (MSFT) had given Teams, which offers messaging, calling and video meetings, an unfair advantage by automatically including it with its Office software and thereby denying Slack an opportunity to compete on a level playing field. The European Commission shares Slack\u2019s worries. \u201cWe are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in statement. \u201cPreserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets. If confirmed, Microsoft\u2019s conduct would be illegal under our competition rules,\u201d she added. According to the Commission, Microsoft has been forcing customers to acquire Teams by automatically including the tool in its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites. The company\u2019s advantage over rivals \u201cmay have been further exacerbated by interoperability limitations between Teams\u2019 competitors and Microsoft\u2019s offerings. The conduct may have prevented Teams\u2019 rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers,\u201d the Commission said. Microsoft announced last year that it would stop the Teams bundling practice in Europe and extended the same commitment globally in April. But, while the Commission acknowledged that the company had started offering \u201csome suites without Teams,\u201d it said it believes \u201cmore changes to Microsoft\u2019s conduct are necessary to restore competition.\u201d In a statement, Microsoft President Brad Smith said: \u201cHaving unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission\u2019s remaining concerns.\u201d Salesforce, meanwhile, welcomed the Commission\u2019s findings, calling its actions \u201ca win for customer choice and an affirmation that Microsoft practices with Teams have harmed competition.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

The incident happened at a prayer meeting, known as a satsang, in the Mughal Garhi village in the Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh, officials said. The village in India\u2019s\u00a0most populous state is around 200 kilometers (124 miles) southeast of the capital, New Delhi. Among the 116 killed were 108 women and seven\u00a0children,\u00a0the state\u2019s Chief Secretary Manoj Kumar Singh told reporters. About 72 people have been identified so far, he added. At least 18 people were injured. Local officials have suggested that overcrowding was the cause of the crush, which saw people tumble into a sewer. Singh told reporters that the organizers of Tuesday\u2019s gathering had filed an application that said \u201can estimated 80,000 people\u201d were supposed to attend. However, \u201ca lot more people than expected\u201d showed up. The deadly scenes happened after the event had finished, when a large number of people went \u201cto touch the feet (of the religious figure) or to collect soil from the venue,\u201d as per local tradition. People then began to fall into an open sewer nearby. \u201cPeople started falling into the sewer and on top of each other,\u201d Singh said. He accused the organizers of failing to comply with a list of requirements given by the district. A high-level inquiry has been launched to investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident and a police report will be filed against the event organizers for allegedly exceeding permitted attendance levels, according to local officials. \u201cThere has been a major lapse on the part of the organizers. They will face a strict punishment,\u201d he said. Survivors spoke of the harrowing incident in its aftermath. \u201cPeople started falling one upon another, one upon another. Those who were crushed died. People there pulled them out,\u201d Shakuntala Devi told the Press Trust of India news agency, according to Associated Press. The bodies of at least 27 of the dead were taken to Etah district mortuary, according to Inspector General Shalabh Mathur, of the neighboring district Ambala Range, while the rest of the bodies are in Hathras, he said. Efforts are underway to provide the injured with medical care and arrangements are being made for post-mortem examinations at various locations, Inspector General Mathur added. A video distributed by Reuters showed crowds gathering outside a local hospital in Etah, where distraught families cried for the victims. Medical personnel could be seen carrying people on stretchers. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences in an address in the lower house of India\u2019s bicameral parliament known as the Lok Sabha. Modi said the government is engaged in \u201crelief and rescue work\u201d and is coordinating with the state government. \u201cThe victims will be helped in every way,\u201d he said. Speaking to reporters, Ashish Kumar,\u00a0the district magistrate of Hathras, said the crush happened as people were leaving the event, which was held to celebrate the Hindu deity Shiva. The district magistrate said police had given permission for the private event and officials were \u201cput on duty for maintenance of law and\u00a0order and security,\u201d but arrangements inside were handled by the organizers.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

The crash happened when the first stage of the Tianlong-3 rocket detached from its launch pad during a test, due to structural failure. It landed in a hilly area of the city of Gongyi in central China. \u201cDue to the structural failure of the connection between the rocket body and the test platform, the first-stage rocket was separated from the launch pad,\u201d Space Pioneer, also known as Beijing Tianbing Technology, said. \u201cAfter liftoff, the onboard computer was automatically shut down, and the rocket fell into the deep mountains 1.5 kilometers [0.9 miles] southwest of the test platform. The rocket body fell into the mountain and disintegrated.\u201d There were no injuries as a result of the crash, the company said, as people in the area were evacuated in advance of the rocket test. Space Pioneer, a leading company in the commercial rocket sphere, specializes in liquid-propellant rockets. In April 2023, it successfully launched its Tianlong-2 rocket, making the company China\u2019s first commercial launch operator to send a liquid carrier rocket into space and successfully enter orbit, according to state media. Tianlong-3, the rocket that crashed on Sunday, is a large liquid carrier rocket. It was made to help construct China\u2019s satellite internet network. The rocket\u2019s product performance is comparable to SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9, according to Space Pioneer, adding that it will be capable of launching the rocket over 30 times per year after the rocket\u2019s first successful flight.

{"id": "2024_06_29_europe_france-parliament-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "France has seen the highest turnout in decades as voting in the first round of snap parliamentary elections neared the end. The election could oust President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist alliance and leave him to see out the remaining three years of his term in an awkward partnership with the far right. Estimates published by Ipsos polling say the total voter turnout on Sunday is expected to be 65.5%, the highest France has seen in a first round of parliamentary elections since 1997. The estimates marks an 18 point increase compared to 2022. Voting began at 8 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), as France started the process of electing the 577 members of its National Assembly through locally fought contests across the country and in its overseas territories. The election is being held three years earlier than it needed to be, and three weeks after Macron\u2019s Renaissance party was trounced by the far-right National Rally (RN), the party of Marine Le Pen, in the European Parliament elections. Minutes after the humiliating defeat, in an apparent attempt to call voters\u2019 bluff, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent by voters and took the \u201cserious, heavy\u201d decision to call a snap election \u2013 France\u2019s first since 1997. Whatever the outcome, Macron has pledged to remain in post until France\u2019s next presidential election in 2027. The National Assembly is responsible for passing domestic laws \u2013 from pensions and taxation to immigration and education \u2013 while the president determines the country\u2019s foreign, Europe and defense policy. When the president and majority in parliament belong to the same party, things run well. When they don\u2019t, the government can grind to a halt \u2013 a prospect that could haunt Paris as it prepares to host the summer Olympics next month. France most recently had such a government \u2013 known as \u201ccohabitation\u201d - when right-wing President Jacques Chirac called snap polls and was forced to appoint a socialist, Lionel Jospin, as prime minister, who stayed in the post for five years. The first round of votes eliminates weaker candidates ahead of the second round next Sunday. If a candidate wins an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot on a 25% turnout, they win the seat. Typically, only a handful of deputies will be elected this way \u2013 but most will go to a second round. Only those who win more than 12.5% of ballots cast by registered voters are allowed to stand in the second round. Often this is fought between two candidates, but sometimes three or four. Some candidates choose to drop out at this stage to give their allies a better chance of victory. Most voters will choose one of three blocs: the RN-led far-right alliance; the New Popular Front (NFP), a recently formed left-wing coalition; and Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble. The RN bloc is headed by Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old party leader handpicked by Le Pen, who has striven to polish the image of a party historically ridden with racism and antisemitism that proliferated under the decades-long leadership of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. Until recently, the prospect of a far-right government was unthinkable. In the past, opposition parties have made marriages of convenience in an attempt to block the RN \u2013 under its previous name, the National Front \u2013 from entering government. Now, within a couple of weeks, Bardella could become France\u2019s prime minister \u2013 and Europe\u2019s youngest in more than two centuries. On the left, a previously fractious cluster of parties have recently banded together to form the New Popular Front \u2013 a coalition meant to resurrect the original Popular Front that prevented fascists from gaining power in 1936. The broad alliance comprises more radical figures like Jean-Luc Melenchon, three-time presidential candidate and leader of the France Unbowed party, as well as moderate leaders like Place Publique\u2019s Raphael Glucksmann. Meanwhile, outgoing French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal \u2013 who was only appointed to his post by Macron in January \u2013 is representing Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance. Attal was reportedly among the last of Macron\u2019s inner circle to learn that a snap election was imminent. Polls will close at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday, with the full results expected early Monday. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story miscalculated the time polls open in the election.

The attack damaged critical infrastructure, as well as a retail store and residential buildings, he said Saturday. Ukraine\u2019s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said trade pavilions, households and vehicles also caught fire as a result. Speaking to the National Police, one local resident who witnessed the strike said: \u201cIt was a weekend, everyone was having a rest \u2026 it wasn\u2019t even late, it wasn\u2019t dark, a missile hit.\u201d She continued: \u201cChildren died, children were injured. So did adults. For no reason. The children had a graduation party, they were graduating from school. They were planning their future.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered his condolences to those who lost loved ones in the attack and appealed for more long-range weapons, saying Ukraine needs \u201cto strike with real long-range capability and to increase the number of advanced air defense systems in Ukraine.\u201d \u201cI am grateful to all partners who are helping. And the decisions we need must be accelerated. Any delay in decisions in this war means losing human lives,\u201d he wrote on Telegram. Recent battlefield developments have seen Russia make slow but steady tactical gains along multiple fronts in Ukraine. Russia also launched a surprise cross-border assault in May. In the Donetsk region, Russia has made advances towards Chasiv Yar as it attempts to capture the strategic hilltop town. During its offensive Russia has been exploiting Ukraine\u2019s weak spots including thinly stretched manpower and delays in western supplies. As Zelensky repeats his appeals for more long-range weapons, these developments have again highlighted Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0reliance on ammunition and weapons\u00a0from the United States and other allies. Concerns have been raised over how long aid from the US will continue should former US President Donald Trump be reelected this November. Thursday\u2019s debate saw US President Joe Biden struggle, while Trump questioned continuing to fund\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia. A Ukrainian politician, Oleksiy Goncharenko, told CNN that Trump\u2019s comments on the war in Ukraine were \u201cworrying.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned because we, more or less, understand what it means for\u00a0Ukraine, [a] Biden presidency, and we really don\u2019t know what it means for\u00a0Ukraine, a Trump presidency. It can be very good, it can be very bad. We just don\u2019t know.

{"id": "2024_07_01_style_first-lady-jill-biden-vogue-cover-2024", "text": "First lady Dr. Jill Biden is Vogue\u2019s August cover star just as election season is kicking off in earnest in the United States \u2014 and only days after President Joe Biden\u2019s shaky first debate performance rattled the Democratic party. On the cover \u2014 her second for the fashion magazine \u2014 Dr. Biden appears in a cream-colored Ralph Lauren silk tuxedo dress, lensed by the veteran fashion photographer Norman Jean Roy. The accompanying profile, by Maya Singer, was written pre-debate, as the Vogue writer shadowed FLOTUS during two April campaign stops in Minnesota: one to speak to the coalition Women for Biden-Harris in Minneapolis, and another to speak to Educators for Biden-Harris. \u201cWe are the first generation in half a century to give our daughters a country with fewer rights than we had,\u201d she said in her speech at the first event, according to Vogue. \u201cBook bans. Voting laws gutted. Court decisions that strip away our most basic freedoms. But circumstance is not destiny. \u2026 When our bodies are on the line, when our daughters\u2019 futures are at stake, when our country and its freedom hang in the balance, we are immovable and unstoppable.\u201d Following the first presidential debate by President Biden and former President Trump, which was moderated by CNN on June 27, Biden advisers told CNN that his family continued their steadfast support in his bid for reelection. Vogue, too, reached out to the first lady following the debate amid calls for the president to step down as the Democratic nominee. She told the magazine that they \u201cwill not let those 90 minutes define the four years he\u2019s been president. We will continue to fight.\u201d Over those past four years, Biden has stepped into her role as FLOTUS with a hands-on approach. Earlier this year, the White House announced her new, critical initiative to fund research into a range of women\u2019s health issues that have been vastly understudied, from endometriosis to heart disease. As an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College, she\u2019s been an advocate for increased funding for in-school help for students particularly as the Covid-19 pandemic strained school systems and left gaps in education. And, as she told Vogue, she\u2019s seen the career-related frustrations of military spouses due to the often transient nature of their lives, so she has supported flexibility for remote work for some government jobs. \u201cReally, in so many different areas, I tell him what I\u2019m seeing, what I\u2019m hearing, and he gets it,\u201d she said of her husband. \u201cAnd this is where the magic happens.\u201d The first lady\u2019s sleeves-rolled-up approach is often reflected in her wardrobe. She favors a polished but practical style, from power suits and classic trenches to clothes with simple messaging (like her embellished \u201clove\u201d jacket at the G7 summit that\u00a0drew\u00a0contrasts to her predecessor\u2019s infamous \u201cI really don\u2019t care, do u?\u201d fashion statement). She places emphasis on American designers, often wearing pieces by Sergio Hudson, Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren. Following up on the periwinkle blue suit she wore at the presidential debate, she wore a black dress with white lettering by Christian Siriano at a North Carolina rally the next morning meant to re-energize voters. Her choice of garment conveyed her point loud and clear: \u201cVote,\u201d it repeated all over. However the political path forward unfolds, the first lady is sure to be key to the president\u2019s decisions. In Vogue\u2019s cover story, political journalist and author Katie Rogers noted that Dr. Biden is often not counted as one of the president\u2019s key advisers, but that she\u2019s \u201chis gut check and closest confidant.\u201d In the interview, the first lady struck a hopeful chord, but warned against the polarization that has split the country. \u201cWe don\u2019t need more chaos,\u201d she said. \u201cFundamentally, Americans care about each other. And this anger and animosity and divisiveness\u2026 it\u2019s not who we are.

{"id": "2024_07_01_china_china-defense-ministers-downfall-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "After months of intense speculation and official reticence, China has finally confirmed its two former defense ministers who vanished from public view last year had been under investigation for corruption. Their dramatic downfall has exposed deep-rooted alleged deceit in key sectors of Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s military modernization drive despite his decade-long war on graft, raising questions about the country\u2019s combat readiness at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. Li Shangfu, who was drastically ousted as defense minister in October after only seven months on the job, and Wei Fenghe, who served from 2018 to 2023, were expelled from the ruling Communist Party following the investigations, with both cases handed over to military prosecutors for charges, state media reported Thursday. The duo are the biggest heads to roll yet in a sweeping purge of China\u2019s defense establishment since last summer, which has felled more than a dozen senior generals and executives from the military-industrial complex. The turmoil in the upper ranks of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) comes as leader Xi Jinping is seeking to make China\u2019s armed forces stronger, more combat-ready and more aggressive in asserting its disputed territorial claims in the region. At the height of their careers, former defense ministers Li and Wei often struck a tough tone before the world\u2019s top military officials.\u00a0At successive regional security forums, the two generals warned the Chinese military would fight \u201cat all costs\u201d if anyone dares to \u201csplit\u201d self-governing Taiwan from China. They also fired thinly veiled shots at the United States, vowing to push back against \u201chegemony\u201d in the disputed South China Sea. Both promoted under Xi, their removals come despite the Chinese leader\u2019s more than decade long signature anti-graft campaign, underscoring the difficulties in preventing corruption at the highest levels of the military, according to analysts. While Xi\u2019s anti-corruption campaign has achieved some success, the lack of proper civilian oversight and an independent legal system means the PLA is reliant on its internal investigators for supervision, said James Char, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \u201cThat\u2019s difficult, so corruption will definitely continue,\u201d he said. Corruption in weapons procurement As part of Xi\u2019s ambition to transform the PLA into a \u201cworld class\u201d fighting force, China has poured billions of dollars into buying and upgrading equipment. Xi has also built up the Rocket Force, an elite branch overseeing the country\u2019s fast-expanding arsenal of nuclear and ballistic missiles. Most of the generals dismissed or disappeared without explanation last year were linked to the Rocket Force or military equipment, including Li and Wei. Before becoming Defense Minister, Li headed the PLA\u2019s Equipment Development Department for five years. An engineer by training, the 66-year-old spent decades launching rockets and satellites in southwest China before being promoted to the PLA headquarters to deal with military equipment procurement. Wei, 70, was the inaugural commander of the Rocket Force. In late 2015, it was elevated by Xi into a full service from the PLA\u2019s former missile arm, the Second Artillery Corps, where Wei had worked for decades. Wei\u2019s two successors at the Rocket Force have also been purged. The allegations against Li laid out in the announcement by the party\u2019s 24-member Politburo clearly point to corruption in the procurement of weapons. In addition to taking and giving bribes and abuse of power, Li was also accused of \u201cseverely polluting the political environment and industry practices of the military equipment sector,\u201d according to state broadcaster CCTV. Joel Wuthnow, a senior research fellow at the Pentagon-funded National Defense University, said the carefully worded phrase points to collusion between the state-owned enterprises that manufacture weapons and the PLA procurement system. \u201cWe know there is some collusion, but it\u2019s not clear \u2013 and the CCP would not admit it \u2013 that critical weapons actually are substandard or not reliable,\u201d Wuthnow said. \u201cIf proven, that would be even more serious for Xi since he would have doubts not only about ethics but also about actual military readiness.\u201d Char, the analyst, said problems in the PLA\u2019s procurement system have existed for many years. In 2018, a study penned by China\u2019s Naval University of Engineering, the Navy\u2019s equipment procurement center and the audit office of the Central Military Commission had already analyzed the bid rigging practices in the PLA\u2019s equipment procurement and called for improvement of the bidding system, Char noted. \u201cThese problems in procurement and acquisitions raised questions about the quality of the equipment that the PLA had purchased earlier. How well do they actually function on the field? I think that\u2019s quite debatable,\u201d he said. In a sign that China\u2019s top military leadership could be concerned about the quality of its equipment, Gen. He Weidong, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), which oversees the armed forces, vowed in March to crack down on \u201cfake combat capabilities\u201d within the military, Char noted. \u201cHis comment was quickly banned from public view afterwards. I think that says a lot about the actual combat capabilities of (the PLA),\u201d Char said. \u2018Lost confidence\u2019 Li and Wei are the most senior military figures to be felled in six years by Xi\u2019s relentless anti-corruption campaign. The Chinese leader has made rooting out graft and disloyalty a hallmark of his rule since coming to power in 2012, and he has brought down powerful generals previously deemed untouchable. Within the first few years of his first term, Xi claimed his two most senior scalps in the military, Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, two former vice-chairmen of the CMC. Xu later died of cancer and Guo was sentenced to life in prison for corruption. In some ways, Wuthnow said, the latest corruption scandal around the two former defense ministers is \u201ceven worse for Xi\u201d than the Xu and Guo cases a decade ago. \u201cBack then we could say Xi was cleaning house,\u201d he said, noting that Xu and Guo had been appointed to the CMC under former leader Jiang Zemin. But both Wei and Li were promoted under Xi. \u201cWei and Li\u2019s cases show that Xi\u2019s own vetting processes and vaunted anti-corruption campaign over the last decade haven\u2019t succeeded at preventing graft at the top of the system,\u201d Wuthnow said. \u201cI think this shows once more that Xi has lost confidence in his own appointees.\u201d Wei was promoted to the rank of general just over a week after Xi took the helm of the party. Li was promoted to lieutenant general and then again to general in just three years. The announcements by the Politburo said Li and Guo\u2019s actions \u201cbetrayed the trust and responsibility\u201d placed in them by the top leadership of the party and the military. Li \u201cbetrayed the party\u2019s founding aspirations and party principles,\u201d and Wei was accused of \u201ccollapse of faith and loss of loyalty,\u201d according to CCTV. \u201cXi must be feeling personally betrayed by this high-level corruption,\u201d wrote Bill Bishop, a China watcher and author of the Sinocism newsletter. But Xi remains determined to root out corruption and disloyalty. Last month, he convened the military top brass for a political-work conference in Yan\u2019an, a sacred site of Chinese Communist revolution in party history, calling for a deepening of political rectification in the PLA. \u201cThe gun barrel must always be held in the hands of those who are loyal and reliable to the party,\u201d Xi told the PLA elites. \u201cStrictness is clearly required to\u2026achieve combat effectiveness. There must be no place in the military for corrupt elements to hide.\u201d Char, the PLA watcher in Singapore, said in the long run, Xi\u2019s cleaning up of the military and its procurement system is a good sign for China\u2019s combat capabilities. \u201cThe problems are being rectified as and when, and there will always be an ongoing review as to how Xi Jinping can actually bring the PLA up to speed to have his dream of modernizing the PLA by 2035 realized.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/china/china-defense-ministers-downfall-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_sport_copa-america-photos-fans-cec", "text": "Their exuberant voices flooded New York\u2019s Times Square. Children sat on shoulders, hands raised; others jumped to the beat of their national songs. Their sky-blue-and-white striped jerseys cascaded through the streets, their matching flags waving overhead. Argentina, and beloved captain Lionel Messi, were playing later that day in New Jersey as part of Copa Am\u00e9rica, the soccer tournament featuring countries from North and South America. And everyone \u2014 Argentine or not, soccer fan or not \u2014 seemed to know about it. The US Men\u2019s National Team had a disappointing showing in the tournament, losing 1-0 Monday night to Uruguay and failing to advance to the knockout stage. But if Copa 2024 truly is a dress rehearsal for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which the US will co-host with Canada and Mexico, enthusiasm for this summer\u2019s event has shown the United States is more than ready. Fans have broken attendance records, both for matches involving the US Men\u2019s National Team and for other countries. In the crowds outside stadiums, in the jersey-clad bodies packed into bars, in the small talk around offices \u2014 the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica is smashed any ideas that US is not a soccer country. When the US first hosted Copa Am\u00e9rica, back in 2016, soccer still seemed like a new frontier in American sports. That tournament, fresh off the 2014 World Cup, was hailed as a success; the USMNT\u2019s group stage matches attracted an average of about 1.5 million viewers. The 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica has already rendered those records obsolete, doubling the viewership for US matches in some cases. This year\u2019s tournament, which ends July 14, isn\u2019t even halfway over, and the most exciting part \u2014 the knockout stage \u2014 has yet to begin. Still, Americans have been watching in record numbers. The USMNT\u2019s opening game against Bolivia drew 3.2 million viewers, according to Fox Sports, becoming the network\u2019s most watched non-World Cup soccer broadcast ever. In 2016, those numbers would have been mind-boggling. By some measures, the mammoth success of the US Women\u2019s National Team and the National Women\u2019s Soccer League, considered by some to be the best women\u2019s soccer league in the world, has created an environment for soccer to flourish in America. Women\u2019s soccer has long found talent, investment and fans stateside, while other countries have mainly played catch-up. And soccer has long been a popular sport among America\u2019s youth. \u201cThe rest of the world says America isn\u2019t interested in soccer. I\u2019m not so sure,\u201d David Beckham wrote in his 2004 autobiography \u201cBeckham: Both Feet on the Ground.\u201d \u201cEvery time I visit, I see kids playing in parks and on school and college campuses everywhere. \u2026 There\u2019s a buzz around soccer in the States that points toward a very exciting future.\u201d Twenty years later, this year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica success proves Beckham\u2019s words are ringing true. The hype extends past viewership and into attendance. In 2016, the US\u2019 game against Costa Rica in the group stage drew 39,642 people to Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field \u2014 leaving the stadium less than two-thirds full. Last week, 59,145 people packed Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta to watch the USMNT battle Panama, creating an environment so raucous that their explosion of cheers could be heard from outside the venue. Nathan Miller, a 28-year-old PhD candidate at Georgia Tech, attended that game against Panama. He\u2019s been a fan of the US team since 2010, he told CNN, but this was his first time seeing them play live. Miller grew up playing soccer \u2014 his whole family did \u2014 but until recently he didn\u2019t know many people who actually watched the sport. \u201cI think it\u2019s a ground-up thing, where if MLS continues to grow, which it has been, and pulling international stars like Lionel Messi, I think that\u2019s going to be something that drums up more American soccer fans in general,\u201d he said. Miller remembers those 2016 Copa America matches. At the time, he and a group of friends would go to a Buffalo Wild Wings to watch the US play \u2014 sometimes needing to ask the restaurant to put the matches on the TVs. Now, he said, a bar by his apartment complex has signs with the US Soccer logo on it. And the Mexican restaurant next door has been advertising drink deals during Copa matches. \u201cI think it\u2019d be harder now to find a place that wasn\u2019t showing the game, as compared to back then,\u201d he said. The growing diversity of the US population may be helping boost soccer in the country as more immigrants arrive with a deep passion for the sport, Miller said. Even so, smaller countries still have a harder time drawing crowds. When Ecuador faced Jamaica on June 26 in Las Vegas, Allegiant Stadium was less than half full. Just 15,000 fans came out to see Peru play Canada in Kansas City. By contrast, when powerhouse Argentina played rival Chile last week in New Jersey\u2019s MetLife Stadium, more than 80,000 fans came to watch. Many of them had been carousing in Times Square only hours earlier. Still, US fan interest is growing, and the 2024 Copa America may be another key step in its evolution. In two years World Cup matches will be played in 11 US cities, from Seattle to Miami \u2014 an event that will bring in thousands of fans from around the world and infuse the US with even more interest in the beautiful game. The 2026 World Cup final will be played at MetLife Stadium outside New York City. If defending champion Argentina reaches the title match, Times Square may once again become a roiling sea of blue and white.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/sport/copa-america-photos-fans-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

Three people were killed in a landslide in the Maggia Valley, Swiss public broadcaster SRF reported. Police in Switzerland\u2019s Valais canton said another man was found dead in a hotel in Saas-Grund, adding that initial findings suggest he could have been taken by surprise by the rapidly rising waters. A search is also underway for a 52-year-old man who has been missing in the village of Binn since Saturday evening, Valais Cantonal Police added in a press release Sunday. The public prosecutor\u2019s office has opened an investigation into the case of the missing man in Binn and the man found dead in Saas-Grund, police said. The floods are a result of a rapid increase in water levels of several rivers, including the Rh\u00f4ne, caused by storms and melting snow, police said in Sunday\u2019s press release. Police added the flooding has also caused debris flows and numerous road closures.

If successful, the lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in Washington, DC, on Monday by Jewish advocacy group the Anti-Defamation League and the Crowell & Moring law firm, could unlock federal funds designated for victims of state-sponsored terrorism if the plaintiffs can prove their case. \u201cThis landmark litigation\u2026 is really about holding accountable the Islamic Republic as well as Syria and North Korea for the role that they played in providing finances and training and, of course, munitions to Hamas, enabling the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust,\u201d Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO and National Director of the ADL, told CNN. The lawsuit lays out publicly available evidence of Iran, Syria and North Korea\u2019s alleged history of support for Hamas: training, weapons and financial support from Iran; training and financing from Syria; and weapons and tunnel-digging know-how from North Korea. The lawsuit alleges that Hamas could not have carried out the October 7 attacks, which killed more than 1,200 people and led to the abduction of more than 250 others, without the support of these countries. Iran has been a longtime ally of Hamas, providing financial and military support to the group. The month after the attacks, a document\u00a0recovered from a computer\u00a0found inside a Hamas pickup truck outside Gaza, obtained by CNN from Israeli officials, showed Iran was seeking to provide technical training that would help Hamas produce its own weaponry. The 2015 Justice for United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act established the US Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund, whose funds can be disbursed to victims and the families of deceased victims following the ruling of a US district court. Greenblatt acknowledged that it is unlikely that any of these three countries will respond to the allegations in federal court, but said he views the lawsuit as a critical step to not only seek accountability for their support for Hamas, but also to counter efforts by some anti-Israel activists to deny the horrific nature of the October 7 attack. The plaintiffs in the case are more than 100 US citizens and their families who were killed or wounded in the October 7 attacks at the Nova music festival and in several of the kibbutzes and towns near the Gaza Strip. One of the plaintiffs, Nahar Neta, is the son of California native Adrienne Neta, who was killed during Hamas\u2019 attack on Kibbutz Be\u2019eri. \u201cWhile nothing will ever undo the unbearable pain Hamas caused our family or the brutal losses we\u2019ve suffered, we hope this case will bring some sense of justice. It\u2019s important for us to be able to tell our stories so the world can hear how Hamas has terrorized Israel, the Jewish people, and many American citizens,\u201d Neta said in a statement issued through the ADL. \u201cMy mom devoted her life to caring for others regardless of race or religious beliefs.

{"id": "2024_07_01_europe_carlo-acutis-canonized-first-millennial-saint-intl", "text": "A video-gaming Italian teenager will become the Catholic Church\u2019s first millennial saint after his cause for canonization was approved by church authorities. Carlo Acutis, who died from leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15, was renowned for using his computing skills to spread awareness of the Catholic faith and earned the nickname \u201cGod\u2019s influencer.\u201d Being recognized as a saint in the Catholic Church can take decades, but the cause of Acutis has moved swiftly, with the teenager developing a\u00a0devoted following across the world. Often depicted wearing jeans and trainers,\u00a0his story is seen as helpful for the Catholic Church as it seeks to better connect with\u00a0the\u00a0younger generation in a digital age,\u00a0and he\u2019s become popular with Catholic youth groups. The church\u2019s sainthood process normally requires that candidates have two miracles attributed to them, with each alleged supernatural occurrence requiring in-depth examination. In May, a second miracle attributed to Acutis was\u00a0recognized by Pope Francis, a decision which paved the way for him to be declared a saint. That left one final step,\u00a0completed\u00a0Monday, when\u00a0the Vatican announced\u00a0the pope had decreed the\u00a0canonization would go ahead after cardinals convened by the pope\u00a0voted in favor of Acutis\u2019 sainthood,\u00a0along with 14 others. The date for his canonization\u00a0is yet to be set, however, although it is likely to occur at\u00a0some point during the Catholic Church\u2019s jubilee year celebrations in 2025. That canonization ceremony, expected to take place in St Peter\u2019s Square in Vatican City in front of tens of thousands and presided over by the pope, will be the moment where Acutis is formally declared a saint, meaning the Catholic Church across the world can name parishes and schools after the teenager and will remember him annually on a \u201cfeast day.\u201d Acutis, who was born in London, United Kingdom, in 1991\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u00a0putting\u00a0him\u00a0squarely\u00a0in the millennial generation cohort\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is remembered by friends and family as enjoying playing video games such as Halo, Super Mario and Pok\u00e9mon. During his short life, he also set up a website\u00a0documenting reports of miracles\u00a0taking place in different parts of the world. Along\u00a0with his computing and gaming, Acutis played the saxophone, enjoyed soccer, loved animals and would make short, humorous films of his dogs. His mother, Antonia Salzano,\u00a0described her son as a \u201csign of hope\u201d who shows that holiness is possible today. \u201cAs I did,\u00a0you too can become holy,\u201d\u00a0she told CNN\u00a0in May.\u00a0\u201cNevertheless, (with) all the media,\u00a0the technologies,\u00a0it seems sometimes that holiness is something that belongs to the past. Instead, holiness is also something nowadays in this modern time.\u201d She said that her son was bought a PlayStation when he was eight, but limited himself to one hour a week of gaming as he was wary that it could become addictive and\u00a0knew the \u201cdangers of the internet.\u201d Salzano added that from the age of nine, the youngster spent time helping the homeless in Milan and giving his pocket money to those sleeping on the streets. She explained that he insisted on only having one pair of shoes, so he could save money to help the poor. Acutis was beatified and declared \u201cblessed\u201d in 2020 after his first miracle, when he reportedly healed a Brazilian boy who had a birth defect in his pancreas that left him unable to eat food normally.\u00a0He was reportedly healed after his mother said she prayed to Acutis to intercede and help heal her son. The second miracle attributed to Acutis relates to the reported healing of a girl from Costa Rica who had suffered a head trauma after falling from her bicycle in Florence, Italy, where she was studying. Her mother said she prayed for her daughter\u2019s recovery at the tomb of Acutis in Assisi.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/europe/carlo-acutis-canonized-first-millennial-saint-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_30_europe_macron-france-election-first-round-intl", "text": "Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party led the first round of France\u2019s parliamentary elections on Sunday, taking it closer to the gates of power than ever before. After an unusually high turnout, the RN bloc clinched 33.15% of the vote, while the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition came second with 27.99% and President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance slumped to a dismal third with 20.76%, according to final results published by the Interior Ministry on Monday. While the RN appears on track to win the most seats in the National Assembly, it may fall short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, suggesting France may be heading for a hung parliament and more political uncertainty. Projections show that, after the second round of voting next Sunday, the RN would win between 230 and 280 seats in the 577-seat lower house \u2013 a staggering rise from its count of 88 in the outgoing parliament. The NFP was projected to secure between 125 and 165 seats, with Ensemble trailing with between 70 and 100 seats. A total\u00a0of\u00a076\u00a0candidates\u00a0were\u00a0elected\u00a0to France\u2019s parliament in the first round of the vote, of which 39 represented RN and its allies, 32 were from NFP, and just two from Macron\u2019s alliance, according to the results published on Monday. The election, which Macron called after his party was battered by the RN in European Parliament elections earlier this month, could leave him to see out the remaining three years of his presidential term in an awkward partnership with a prime minister from an opposition party. The RN election party in the northern town of Henin Beaumont erupted in celebration as the results were announced \u2013 but Marine Le Pen was quick to stress that next Sunday\u2019s vote will be key. \u201cDemocracy has spoken, and the French people have placed the National Rally and its allies in first place \u2013 and has practically erased the Macronist bloc,\u201d she told a jubilant crowd, adding: \u201cNothing has been won \u2013 and the second round will be decisive.\u201d In a speech at the RN\u2019s headquarters in Paris, Jordan Bardella, the party\u2019s 28-year-old leader, echoed Le Pen\u2019s message. \u201cThe vote taking place next Sunday is one of the most decisive in the entire history of the Fifth Republic,\u201d Bardella said. In bullish speeches before the first round, Bardella said he would refuse to govern a minority government, in which the RN would require the votes of allies to pass laws. If the RN falls short of an absolute majority and Bardella stays true to his word, Macron might then have to search for a prime minister on the hard left, or somewhere else entirely to form a technocratic government. Following news of the results Sunday night, anti-far right protests broke out in Paris and Lyon, with some 5,500 people gathering in the capital\u2019s Place de la Republique, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. Reuters later released a video of demonstrators setting off fireworks as they marched through Paris. While BFMTV reported 200 police were deployed in Lyon to deal with protests. Cordon sanitaire With an unprecedented number of seats going to a three-way run-off, a week of political bargaining will now ensue, as centrist and left-wing parties decide whether or not to stand down in individual seats to block the nationalist and anti-immigrant RN \u2013 long a pariah in French politics \u2013 from winning a majority. When the RN \u2013 under its previous name, the National Front \u2013 has performed strongly in the first round of votes in the past, left-wing and centrist parties have previously united to block them from taking office, under a principle known as the \u201ccordon sanitaire.\u201d After Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2013 the father of Marine and decades-long leader of the National Front \u2013 unexpectedly defeated the Socialist candidate Lionel Jospin in the 2002 presidential election, the Socialists swung their weight behind the center-right candidate Jacques Chirac, delivering him a landslide in the second-round runoff. In an attempt to deny the RN a majority, the NFP \u2013 a left-wing coalition that formed earlier this month \u2013 promised it will withdraw all of its candidates who came in third place in the first round. \u201cOur instruction is clear \u2013 not one more vote, not one more seat for the National Rally,\u201d Jean-Luc Melenchon, the leader of France Unbowed \u2013 the largest party in the NFP \u2013 told supporters Sunday. \u201cA long week awaits us ahead, everyone will take his or her decision with conscience, this decision will determine, in the long-term, the future of our country and each one of our destinies,\u201d Melenchon added. Marine Tondelier, leader of the Green Party \u2013 a more moderate part of the NFP \u2013 made a personal plea to Macron to stand down in certain seats to deny the RN a majority. \u201cWe\u2019re counting on you: withdraw if you come third in a three-way race, and if you don\u2019t qualify for the second round, call your supporters to vote for a candidate who supports republican values,\u201d she said. Macron\u2019s Ensemble allies have also called on their supporters to prevent the far right taking office, but have warned against lending their votes to the firebrand Melenchon. Gabriel Attal, Macron\u2019s protege and the outgoing prime minister, urged voters to prevent the RN from winning a majority, but said Melenchon\u2019s France Unbowed party \u201cis preventing a credible alternative\u201d to a far-right government. Former prime minister Eduoard Philippe, another Macron ally, said: \u201cNo votes should be cast for National Rally candidates, but also for France Unbowed candidates, with whom we differ on fundamental principles.\u201d Whether tactical voting can prevent the RN winning a majority is not clear. In Sunday\u2019s vote, the RN won support in places that would have been unthinkable until recently. In the Nord department\u2019s 20th constituency, an industrial heartland, the leader of the Communist Party, Fabien Roussel, was defeated in the first round by an RN candidate with no previous political experience. The seat had been held by the Communists since 1962. A huge gamble Macron\u2019s decision to call a snap election \u2013 France\u2019s first since 1997 \u2013 took the country and even his closest allies by surprise. Sunday\u2019s vote was held three years earlier than necessary and just three weeks after Macron\u2019s Renaissance party was trounced by the RN at the European Parliament elections. Macron has pledged to see out the remainder of his final presidential term, which runs until 2027, but he now faces the prospect of having to appoint a prime minister from an opposition party \u2013 in a rare arrangement known as \u201ccohabitation.\u201d The French government faces little trouble in passing laws when the president and majority in parliament belong to the same party. When they don\u2019t, things can grind to a halt. While the president determines the country\u2019s foreign, Europe and defense policy, the parliamentary majority is responsible for passing domestic laws, like pensions and taxation. But these remits could overlap, potentially sending France into a constitutional crisis. Bardella, for instance, has ruled out sending troops to help Ukraine resist Russia\u2019s invasion \u2013 an idea floated by Macron \u2013 and said he would not allow Kyiv to use French military equipment to strike targets inside Russia. It is unclear whose will would prevail in disputes like this, where the line between domestic and foreign policy is blurred. A far-right government could spell a financial as well as constitutional crisis. The RN has made lavish spending pledges \u2013 from rolling back Macron\u2019s pension reforms to cutting taxes on fuel, gas and electricity \u2013 at a time when France\u2019s budget might be brutally slashed by Brussels. With one of the highest deficits in the Eurozone, France may need to embark on a period of austerity to avoid falling foul of the European Commission\u2019s new fiscal rules. But, if implemented, the RN\u2019s spending plans would make France\u2019s deficit soar \u2013 a prospect that has alarmed the bond markets and led to warnings of a \u201cLiz Truss-style financial crisis,\u201d referring to the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. In a terse statement Sunday evening, Macron said the high turnout showed French voters\u2019 \u201cdesire to clarify the political situation\u201d and called for his supporters to rally in the second round. \u201cFaced with the National Rally, the time has come for a broad, clearly democratic and Republican rally for the second round,\u201d he said.

Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997. She was 36 years old. Harry went on to underline the importance of talking about emotions during the grieving process. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest thing, especially for kids, I think, which is, \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about it because it will make me sad, but once realizing that if I do talk about it, and I\u2019m celebrating their life, then actually, things become easier,\u2019\u201d he said. Harry is a global ambassador for Scotty\u2019s Little Soldiers, and sat down for a conversation with Scott ahead of Armed Forces Day on June 29. Scott told the duke about the moment she had to tell her son, Kai, that his father, Cpl. Lee Scott, had been killed while serving in Afghanistan. \u201cIt was the worst\u2026 How do you tell a 5-year-old this,\u201d she said, recalling the feeling that she had \u201cshattered his world\u201d on that day in July 2009. Scott went on to found the charity in 2010 to help other bereaved military children. Each year, 2,100 children lose a parent who served in the UK military, according to Scotty\u2019s Little Soldiers. The charity currently supports more than 680 members and aims to support more than 1,000 people each year by 2030.

The cause of the crash remains unclear and investigation is ongoing, according to the emergency services. Those who died are believed to have been on the bus. Slovak national railway company ZSSK said on a statement on Facebook that none of the more than 100 passengers on the EuroCity train died as it sent its condolences to \u201cthe families and loved ones of the bus passengers who were injured or lost in this accident.\u201d The emergency response continued into the night at the crash site in Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky, southern\u00a0Slovakia, the Slovak Emergency Medical Service said. Five ambulance vehicles and three ambulance helicopters are on the scene. Reuters footage from the scene showed smoke and fire billowing from a train carriage, with a person in the background heard saying: \u201cThere was just a big bang. Then the train stopped. We were able to get off, but the whole front part of the train was burning.\u201d The train was traveling from the Czech capital of Prague to the Hungarian capital of Budapest. More than 100 of its stranded passengers were transported by buses to the town of Sturovo on the Hungarian border. The locomotive and the driver of the train belonged to the Czech national railway company, while the carriages and the rest of the train staff were Slovak. The crash on Thursday was a second deadly collision involving an international train in the region in just three weeks. Four people were killed and more than 20 others injured on June 6 when a passenger\u00a0train\u00a0collided with a freight\u00a0train\u00a0in Pardubice in the\u00a0Czech\u00a0Republic. \u201cAll passengers were evacuated from the scene with the assistance of our staff. Our hearts and thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the bus passengers who suffered injuries or losses in this accident,\u201d ZSSK said in a statement shared with CNN. Slovak politicians expressed their shock about the incident. \u201cWith the deepest sadness, I received the information of a tragic accident that happened late afternoon in Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky,\u201d Slovak Health Minister Zuzana Dolinkov\u00e1 said in a\u00a0social media post. \u201cAll kinds of emergency services are on the scene and I send my deepest condolences to the families of the victims.\u201d Slovakia\u2019s President Peter Pellegrini, who was in Brussels attending a summit with European Union leaders, sent his condolences on social media. \u201cI am very sorry for all the victims and my condolences to their families. I wish the injured a speedy recovery and thank the doctors and rescue teams for their work done. I wish such catastrophes would avoid Slovakia in the future,\u201d he wrote.

Instead, he was fascinated with how sharks move through water using their multiple fins. It\u2019s no surprise he became a marine biologist. \u201cAs soon as I realized they were going through a conservation crisis, I wanted to help what I love the most,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. Sharks need him more than ever. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature reports 35% of all shark species are threatened with extinction. That number has grown nearly 50% in a decade\u2019s time. The primary reason is overfishing; shark meat and fins are highly sought. \u201cThey are being killed at a rate that cannot be sustained in the future,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. Scientists worry the sharks\u2019 dwindling numbers could bring ecological collapse as they play a number of key roles in the ocean. Unlike many fish, sharks take a long time to reproduce. Fisheries kill about 100 million sharks a year, according to the non-profit Save Our Seas. Many sharks end up as bycatch when long lines and gill nets unintentionally catch them. The largest demand that drives the international trade is shark fin soup.\u00a0\u201cShark finning is problematic because when you remove the fins from a shark and you put it back in the water, it\u2019s just like a rock or a log just falling to the bottom of the ocean,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. \u201cIf they cannot swim, they will suffocate to death.\u201d Hammerheads are one of the of the most critically endangered sharks- having lost 80% of their population in just the last three decades. \u201cTheir fins are big and really good quality,\u201d said the scientist. \u201cThat means they\u2019re thick and they have these cartilaginous filaments that are used in the shark fin soup.\u201d In recent years, demand has also risen for shark meat- a cheap protein consumed throughout Europe and South America. A small DNA tool makes a big difference Today Carde\u00f1osa is fighting the illegal trade of endangered sharks as a Distinguished Postdoctoral scholar at Florida International University in Miami. The marine biologist is using molecular and forensic tools to combat smuggling that stretches from Hong Kong to Latin America. One of the biggest challenges for law enforcement at ports around the world is determining whether shipments of shark fins and meat are violating CITES- The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. \u201cA lot of the fins look the same,\u201d explained Carde\u00f1osa. \u201cHow can you tell whether a shark fin that is coming into the country is legal or illegal, is from a species that is regulated or not regulated?\u201d Carde\u00f1osa, along with fellow FIU adjunct professor Demian Chapman, came up with a portable DNA kit that looks like a small red cube. It identifies species and country of origin of shark fins and meat coming into ports. \u201cWe take a little piece of this fin, we run it through a machine for two hours, and we\u2019re able to tell what species it is without sequencing very cheaply, very quickly.\u201d For years, port authorities were sending samples off-site to labs for testing that came back days if not a week later- slowing down the seizures. Their technology is now used in the shark trade\u2019s busiest ports: Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Spain, Belize, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. Carde\u00f1osa said it has helped Hong Kong authorities go from seizing an average of five tons of shark fins annually before 2018 to one hundred tons since they started using the tool. His DNA toolkits have also helped stop illegal shipments of European eels and South America\u2019s matamata turtles, earning the marine scientist Interpol\u2019s Directorate of Criminal Investigation and Interpol medal. A decade of pounding pavement leads to international shark protections Carde\u00f1osa and a team of Hong Kong scientists have surveyed fish markets for a decade to determine the source of their shark meat and fins. Using DNA, they\u2019ve tested more than 15,000 samples in Hong Kong and mainland China and discovered a whopping two-thirds of what\u2019s being sold in those markets are from threatened shark species. \u201cWe\u2019re removing and trading some of the ones that are the most critically endangered in the ocean,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. That research has helped expand the number of shark species now regulated by CITES. Governments that sign on to the agreement must require permits for every shipment of shark products that moves through their ports, ensuring the trade is legal, traceable and sustainable. Carde\u00f1osa said when he got started in the field, there were only five or six shark species regulated by the CITES agreement. Today there are more than 150 sharks and rays covered. Carde\u00f1osa also discovered through genetic tracing that 85% of the fins at those markets belong to sharks caught in the Eastern Pacific, which stretches from Baja, California south through Central and South America to Peru- including Carde\u00f1osa\u2019s home country, Colombia. \u201cThe vast majority of the markets and the fisheries for sharks around the world are unsustainable, unmanaged, unregulated and sometimes illegal,\u201d said Carde\u00f1osa. The scientist is working with fishermen in South America \u2013 some of whom rely on fishing all kinds of marine life for their livelihoods. He\u2019s teaching them ways to fish sustainably \u2013 without dangerous long lines and gillnets \u2013 and how to protect known endangered shark populations. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to identify areas where those hammerhead sharks spend the majority of the time and make agreements with them to not fish those locations.\u201d Carde\u00f1osa says good management of shark fisheries \u201cis a really hard task to do. Everybody is trying to find a way to do it.\u201d He also enlists those local fishermen to help him. \u201cWe teach them how to collect data and bring them in as part of our projects to help.\u201d The shark scientist is also trying to convince more countries to sign on to the CITES convention on sharks. How you can help sharks One of the easiest ways to help sharks and all marine life is to try to consume seafood from sustainable sources. There are a number of online resources and apps for that including the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch. Just 4% of global shark catches are sustainable \u2013 so it\u2019s generally not a good idea to consume sharks. Additionally, their dense meat often contains a lot of mercury. \u201cThat will go to our lab and our programs to fund these projects and really have an impact on a global scale.\u201d You can also donate to the research Carde\u00f1osa is conducting through the FIU Foundation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/world/a-third-of-sharks-are-threatened-with-extinction-heres-what-one-man-is-doing-to-help-iyw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_01_world_turkey-riots-social-media-intl-latam", "text": "Allegations of sexual abuse against a child by a Syrian man in Kayseri, Turkey, have sparked overnight riots that targeted Syrian businesses and cars in the city. According to Turkish state news agency Anadolu, a Syrian man was arrested on allegations that he sexually abused his seven-year-old female cousin, who is also Syrian, in a public bathroom at a market. Reports of the purported abuse quickly spread across social media, prompting outraged local residents to riot \u2014 setting fire to cars and Syrian-run businesses in the central Anatolian city. \u201cAn investigation was immediately launched on the issue. However, later our citizens gathered in this region, acted illegally in an attitude that does not suit our human values, and damaged houses, workplaces, and vehicles belonging to Syrian nationals,\u201d Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said. He said that dozens of people were detained, and the crowd was only dispersed in the early morning hours. The local governor of Kayseri called on people \u201cto act calmly, with moderation and common sense.\u201d Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed opposition parties, some of which have taken a hard line on removing the estimated 3.6 million Syrians from the country, for stoking \u201chatred politics.\u201d Erdogan himself has pledged to create the conditions for large numbers of Syrians to voluntarily return to Syria. \u201cXenophobia and hatred towards refugees in our country should not be ignited because this does not give any positive results,\u201d he said in a speech on Monday. The riots in Kayseri also sparked backlash inside Syria. Video from the town of Atareb, which is currently under the control of Turkish troops, showed people chanting against the Turkish army\u2019s presence and throwing things at an armored vehicle. Another video showed the chaotic situation that followed, with plumes of smoke and the sound of gunshots. A local resident told CNN troops had used a smoke grenade and fired shots into the air to disperse the crowd. CNN cannot independently verify the resident\u2019s account. In another town, Ghazawiah, also in northwest Syria, protesters were seen pulling the Turkish flag town from a military site. A local resident there confirmed to CNN that the incident took place. At the \u201cBab al-Salama\u201d border crossing with Turkey, the Turkish flag was removed, burned and replaced with a Free Syrian Army flag, according to a local resident and images circulating on social media. Several internet providers in northern Syria appeared to be disconnected late Monday. Only satellite internet was still working. The largest umbrella group representing the Syrian opposition, the \u201cNational Coalition for Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces\u201d released a statement urging Syrians on both sides of the border to \u201cexercise self-restraint.\u201d \u201cThe sole beneficiaries of this chaos, violations, and disorder are the regime and terrorist organizations,\u201d the statement read. Yerlikaya blamed bots and provocateurs for sowing discord on social media. He said that more than a third of accounts sharing content about the events in Kayseri on X were bots and that 10 accounts had been referred to prosecutors. \u201cWe will not tolerate those who threaten the peace and security of our country, make provocative posts, or engage in hate speech,\u201d he wrote on X. Turkey hosts more Syrian refugees than any other country, but Turkey has often struggled to integrate Syrian refugees fully into society. That, combined with a struggling economy, has turned Syrians into a political lightning rod in Turkey. Many Syrians accuse Turks of racist treatment. Countless Syrian children are not in schools because of a requirement that Syrians remain in the districts they were registered in originally \u2014 even after events such as last year\u2019s deadly earthquake in southern Turkey forced many of them to relocate. All of this comes just days after Erdogan said he was open to meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to restore ties between the two countries \u2014 though last year Assad made clear the meeting could not take place so long as Turkish troops remained in Syria. Assad and Erdogan were once close and even vacationed together, but Erdogan eventually backed the Free Syrian Army that sought to oust Assad from power in Syria\u2019s civil war.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/01/world/turkey-riots-social-media-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_middleeast_israeli-military-orders-evacuations-in-southern-gaza-intl", "text": "The Israeli military issued new evacuation orders on Monday for areas in southern Gaza, including eastern Khan Younis and Rafah. This forced residents, many already displaced, to find new shelter, due to the suggestion of the possibility of another ground operation. The Gaza European Hospital in Khan Younis, one of the territory\u2019s last standing hospitals, is within the evacuation zone. It has transferred patients, including those in intensive care and babies in incubators, and medical equipment to other facilities \u201cin fear of bloodshed,\u201d according to the hospital\u2019s deputy director and doctors. \u201cIt\u2019s a chaotic scene and very difficult and dire,\u201d Dr.\u00a0Saleh al Hams, deputy director of Gaza\u00a0European Hospital in Khan Younis, told CNN. This is his third evacuation, he said. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Tuesday that staff at the hospital have performed more than 3,000 surgeries, treated hundreds of burn cases and provided physical rehabilitation to wounded people. \u201cAn ICRC team stayed in the hospital overnight, however the hospital is now unable to continue functioning effectively because so many staff members have evacuated, including medical, nursing, administration and support staff.\u201d The ICRC said they would now move their team and patients to the Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah-Mawasi and, once conditions allow, staff will return to EGH and continue to work there. It said thousands of Palestinians have been displaced following the IDF evacuation orders, stressing there is \u201cno safe place\u201d in Gaza. Another ground operation in Khan Younis would underscore the difficulties faced by the Israeli military in trying to root out Palestinian militants from Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew its ground forces from\u00a0the city\u00a0in April after months of fierce fighting that left much of it in ruins. After more than eight months of war, militants continue to hold dozens of Israeli hostages and fire rockets at Israel. Still, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asserted on Monday that the country\u2019s military is advancing to the \u201cend of the stage of eliminating\u201d Hamas\u2019 army in Gaza and will \u201ccontinue striking its remnants.\u201d He vowed that Israel would achieve its goals in war: returning the hostages held in Gaza as well as eliminating Hamas\u2019 military and governing capabilities. On Tuesday, the IDF said that about 20 projectiles were launched from the Khan Younis area toward Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip on Monday, adding that it struck targets in the area from which the projectiles were fired. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad said on Monday that it fired \u201ctargeted rockets\u201d at five Israeli communities close to the Gaza border. On Monday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) reported that the emergency room at Al Amal Hospital in Khan Younis was overwhelmed with injuries after patients were transferred from the European Hospital following an Israeli military evacuation order for the Al Fukhari area. PRCS said the hospital also received patients from Nasser Hospital, which had similarly become overcrowded with patients from the European Hospital. In a separate statement, hours after the initial evacuation order, the IDF said the order \u201cdoes not apply to the patients in the European Hospital or the medical staff working there.\u201d \u201cThere is no intention to evacuate the European Hospital,\u201d the IDF statement added. Videos posted to social media showed hospital patients on stretchers being moved through nearby streets following the order. On Tuesday, Louise Wateridge, a spokesperson for the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, who is currently in Gaza, reported a \u201cmassive\u201d movement of people from the evacuation zones following the Israeli military\u2019s latest order. The agency anticipates that around 250,000 people will leave the evacuation zones after the latest order. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes and shelling on Khan Younis continued, with at least eight people killed and 32 injured overnight, according to Nasser hospital. Desalination plant Khan Younis is home to a UN-managed water desalination plant that supplies the city as well as Deir al-Balah and al-Mawasi, where scores of displaced Palestinians are residing. Gaza\u2019s clean water supply decreased significantly after desalination plants were forced to shut down following the siege imposed by the Israeli military in the wake of the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7. On Tuesday, COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for coordination with the Palestinian territories, and the IDF said in a joint statement that Israel would connect a new power line directly to the Khan Younis desalination plant to raise the production of drinking water to 20,000 cubic meters from 5,000. The UN estimated late last year that average water consumption in Gaza dropped to three liters per person per day. The World Health Organization recommends, in emergencies, a minimum of 7.5 liters to 15 liters of water per person per day for survival and hygiene.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/middleeast/israeli-military-orders-evacuations-in-southern-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}

The legislation, which came into effect Thursday, is part of a larger citizenship overhaul from Berlin as the government grapples with rising antisemitism, a surge in popularity for the far right, and fierce debate over its response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The country\u2019s naturalization exam will now include a number of new questions, according to a statement from the interior ministry. \u201cIn response to increasing antisemitism in Germany, the list of questions in the naturalization test has been expanded. New exam questions have been added on the topics of antisemitism, the right of the state of Israel to exist and Jewish life in Germany,\u201d it said. The war in Gaza, and Berlin\u2019s strong support for Israel, has fueled much discussion in Germany. In the aftermath of the October 7 attacks, German lawmakers, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, reiterated that Israel\u2019s security is Germany\u2019s \u201creason of state,\u201d or matter of national interest. But other voices in the country have accused authorities of going too far, infringing on the rights of pro-Palestinians to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. Adding to the complex picture, Germany has the largest Palestinian diaspora in Europe, which is estimated at 300,000. German Green lawmaker Lamya Kaddor previously told CNN that Muslim communities in Germany have felt ostracized in light of events in the Middle East. \u2018A crystal clear red line\u2019 The legislation is being introduced nationwide after the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt also required citizenship applicants to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist in December. The implementation of the law on a federal level was advocated by the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party last year. The idea was also well-received by other parties in the Bundestag. Under the changes, the process for obtaining citizenship has also been sped up. Those who work in Germany and are considered \u201cwell integrated\u201d can now obtain citizenship after just five years instead of eight. Applicants no longer need to give up the citizenship of their previous country \u2013 something that used to be a requirement in Germany for first-generation migrants. Germany\u2019s Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has welcomed Thursday\u2019s changes as a \u201ccommitment to a modern Germany.\u201d \u201cWhoever shares our values and makes an effort can now get a German passport more quickly and are not required to give up a part of their identity with the former citizenship,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe have also made it just as clear: Whoever doesn\u2019t share our values, will not be able to get a German passport. Here we have drawn a crystal clear red line and made the law much stronger than before. Anti-Semitism, racism and other forms of contempt for humanity rule out naturalization. There is no tolerance for that.\u201d The reform comes as a new report from RIAS, an organization monitoring antisemitism in Germany, found that antisemitic incidents in the country rose around 83% last year, significantly increasing after the attack on Israel on October 7 and Israel\u2019s eight-month military offensive in Gaza. These incidents include everything from antisemitic graffiti, to threats, to violent attacks.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/europe/german-citizens-israel-right-to-exist-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_06_26_europe_evan-gershkovich-trial-begin-russia-intl", "text": "Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, went on trial Wednesday, appearing in a Russian courtroom\u2019s glass cage with his head recently shaved. Later Wednesday, Gershkovich\u2019s family said the past 15 months had been \u201cextraordinarily painful.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re deeply disappointed that he will have to endure further attempts to discredit him and to paint a picture that is unrecognizable to anyone who knows him. Evan is a journalist, and journalism is not a crime,\u201d his family said in a statement. Gershkovich, 32, was arrested while reporting for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which he joined in January 2022, just weeks before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While many newsrooms subsequently pulled their reporters out of Russia, Gershkovich remained, covering the war and how it was changing life in the country. He was arrested while on a reporting trip in the city of Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and later accused of spying for the CIA. Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him. Within two weeks of his arrest in March 2023, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release. The press was briefly allowed into the courtroom 15 minutes before Wednesday\u2019s hearing began at 11 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET). During earlier appeals against his pre-trial detention, Gershkovich has made love-heart signs and given a thumbs-up to his friends, family and supporters. On Wednesday, Gershkovich stood cross-armed, seeming healthy and composed, occasionally smiling and waving to the crowd of reporters. No reporters will be allowed into the courtroom during the trial itself, which is expected to last months. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. After Wednesday\u2019s hearing wrapped early afternoon, court officials said the trial would resume on August 13, state news agency TASS reported. The trial of Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet-era emigres to the US, has highlighted the extent to which Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has harmed relations between Moscow and Washington. In their indictment, Russian prosecutors said that \u201cunder instructions from the CIA\u201d and \u201cusing painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d Gershkovich \u201cwas collecting secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory. Russian authorities have not publicly offered any evidence for their claims. WSJ Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker said it was \u201cjarring to see him in yet another courtroom for a sham trial held in secret and based on fabricated accusations.\u201d \u201cWhile we are told he\u2019s doing well given the circumstances, Evan\u2019s wrongful detention continues to be a devastating assault on his freedom and his work and an unfathomable attack on the free press. It\u2019s outrageous that he has already endured 455 days in prison when he never should\u2019ve been arrested,\u201d she said in a statement. Pjotr Sauer, Russian affairs reporter for Britain\u2019s The Guardian newspaper and friend of Gershkovich, told CNN, \u201cEvan is just an honest journalist,\u201d and emphasized that Russian authorities have not presented any evidence against him. \u201cWe\u2019re not holding our breath, it could take weeks or months. And we don\u2019t have much trust in the Russian justice system,\u201d said Sauer, who exchanged letters with Gershkovich before the American reporter was transferred to Yekaterinburg. \u201cRealistically, we believe that Russia will convict him because they\u00a0arrested him in the end because he\u2019s a bargaining chip for Moscow, for Putin to be exchanged.\u201d Ahead of the trial, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US \u201ccertainly\u201d does not expect Gershkovich to have \u201ca free and fair trial given that these are charges that never should have been brought in the first place.\u201d Miller said embassy personnel were traveling to Yekaterinburg, more than 800 miles from Moscow, and would attempt to attend the trial. Before being transferred to Yekaterinburg, Gershkovich was held in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo prison, spending almost every hour of the day in a small cell as his pre-trial detention period was extended several times. He has passed the time by writing letters to his friends and family, his parents, Ella Milman and Mikhail Gershkovich, said in a recent interview with the WSJ. \u201cHe\u2019s managing the best way he can, in a tiny space, one hour walking outside \u2013 six steps, six steps, six steps,\u201d Milman said, drawing a small courtyard with her finger. \u201cHe\u2019s been exercising, meditating, reading a lot, answering letters. His knowledge of the Russian language and the culture helped him adjust to the situation.\u201d Political \u2018pawns\u2019 In his State of the Union address in March \u2013 with Gershkovich\u2019s parents in the audience \u2013 US President Joe Biden said his administration was working \u201caround the clock to bring home Evan\u201d and other \u201cAmericans being unjustly detained all around the world.\u201d Shortly after the first day of Gershkovich\u2019s trial concluded, the US Embassy in Moscow demanded Russia stop using him and other detained Americans as \u201cbargaining chips.\u201d \u201cThis trial is not about the presentation of evidence, due process or the rule of law. We are talking about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political goals,\u201d the embassy said. The number of Americans being held in Russia has swelled in recent years. Paul Whelan, a former US Marine, was arrested in Moscow in December 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020 on espionage charges, which he has consistently and vehemently denied. The US State Department has also declared him wrongfully detained. After marking another grim milestone last week, surpassing 2,000 days in Russian custody, Whelan told CNN he has spent \u201can incredible amount of time\u201d in detention \u201cfor a crime that never occurred\u201d as he urged the Biden administration to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d to bring him and Gershkovich home. Brittney Griner \u2013 the basketball star who used to play in Russia during the WNBA offseason \u2013 was detained in Russia and sentenced to nine years in prison after authorities found cannabis oil in her luggage. After spending nearly 300 days behind bars, Griner was freed in a prisoner swap for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, nicknamed the \u201cMerchant of Death\u201d by his accusers. A former Soviet military officer, Bout was serving a 25-year sentence in the US on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles and provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2013 charges he and the Kremlin denied. The Kremlin has consistently said that any negotiations regarding a potential prisoner swap\u00a0should be conducted in complete confidentiality, without disclosing any details on the progress of these discussions. Western officials and analysts have accused Russia of using jailed Americans as political pawns. Discussing the case of Ksenia Karelina \u2013 a US-Russian dual citizen also on trial in Yekaterinburg after being accused of donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity \u2013 Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov told CNN that Russia aims \u201cto build up a bank of hostages with American passports,\u201d which Moscow can use \u201cas leverage\u201d in any negotiations with Washington. In an interview with American right-wing pundit Tucker Carlson, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested the Kremlin could be willing to free Gershkovich in exchange for Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from Russia\u2019s domestic spy organization who was convicted of assassinating a former Chechen fighter in broad daylight in Berlin in 2019. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll tell you: sitting in one country, a country that is an ally of the United States, is a man who, for patriotic reasons, eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals,\u201d Putin said.

The plane has the capacity to hold up to 339 passengers, according to Air Europa\u2019s website. One of the passengers, Evangelina Saravia, told the Uruguayan news outlet Teledoce that there had been about 20 minutes of mild turbulence before the plane suddenly dropped 400 meters at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour \u2013 catching some passengers, who had ignored the seatbelt warnings, off guard. \u201c(Before the drop) there were people walking, people without belts. There were children sleeping without belts,\u201d Saravia said. \u201cPeople were thrown from the seats and hit the ceiling, that\u2019s why the ceiling broke,\u201d she added. Another passenger, Daniel Monta\u00f1ez, told CNN he and his wife had been sleeping with their seat belts on when the turbulence hit and awoke to see some of their fellow passengers hitting the ceiling of the cabin and falling back down. \u201cPeople who did not have their seat belts unfortunately suffered consequences, injuries,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were people broken, people on the floor, people screaming, people who felt bad, people bleeding \u2026 A rather chaotic image. As you can imagine, the nerves at that point start to play after you come to your senses about what happened, because at that moment you don\u2019t really notice anything, only movements and madness.\u201d Another passenger, Stevan, told Reuters: \u201cThere are passengers with fractures and injuries to their arms, faces, and legs. There are about 30 people injured. It was a pretty horrible feeling; we thought we were going to die there, but thank God it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d The Spanish airline said that another plane was set to depart later on Monday from Madrid and pick up the passengers stranded in Brazil to continue their journey to Uruguay. Air Europa those passengers in need of healthcare were treated in Brazil\u2019s Natal International Airport. A second Air Europe flight picked up some of those diverted to Brazil and took them to Montevideo, Uruguay, their original destination, according to an Air Europa post on X. The passengers arrived in Montevideo on Tuesday morning at 07:20 a.m. local time, according to Air Europa. The airline added in a post on X that they \u201cregret what happened and the inconvenienced caused.\u201d Air Europa also said that some personnel have traveled to Natal to support the passengers that continue to receive medical assistance. The news comes as the latest development in a string of bad publicity for the airplane manufacturer Boeing. While there\u2019s no evidence so far that the injuries on the Air Europa flight had anything to do with a safety malfunction, Boeing has recently faced a series of whistleblowers alleging safety issues at the company. Just last week,\u00a0a whistleblower came forward alleging parts\u00a0of Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliner planes were built in an unsafe manner \u2013 potentially leading to \u201cdevastating consequences.\u201d A previous whistleblower, Sam Salehpour, a Boeing engineer, said he found and reported similar gaps in 787 and 777 aircraft. For nearly two years starting in 2021, the FAA and Boeing\u00a0halted deliveries of the new Dreamliners\u00a0while it looked into the gaps. Boeing said it made changes in its manufacturing process and deliveries ultimately resumed. More than a dozen whistleblowers have come forward against Boeing in recent years, and the number has grown substantially since a\u00a0door plug blew off a 737 Max plane\u00a0in January just after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in the side the plane. The FAA has opened multiple investigations into Boeing and the US Department of Justice said it\u00a0may file criminal charges\u00a0against the company because of its ongoing quality and safety failures.

Its intensity also\u00a0marks just the second time an Atlantic hurricane has reached Category 5\u00a0status\u00a0in July after Emily did so on\u00a0July 17, 2005, according to the National Hurricane Center. Beryl\u2019s maximum sustained winds have increased to near 160 mph, with higher gusts, the NHC said. \u201cFluctuations in strength are likely during the next day or so, but Beryl is expected to still be near major hurricane intensity as its moves into the central Caribbean and passes near Jamaica on Wednesday,\u201d the NHC said. Beryl made landfall shortly after 11:00 a.m. EDT on Grenada\u2019s Carriacou Island in the Caribbean Sea with max winds of 150 mph. It is the strongest\u00a0known hurricane to pass through the Grenadines, according to data from NOAA that goes back to 1851. There were \u201cwidespread reports of destruction and devastation in Carriacou and Petite Martinique,\u201d Grenada Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell said in a Monday news briefing. \u201cIn half an hour, Carriacou was flattened.\u201d Mitchell said there were no immediate reports of death or injury in Grenada but warned that could change. \u201cYou have to appreciate the ferocity and the strength of the\u00a0hurricane\u00a0and therefore we are not yet out of the woods,\u201d he said. At least one death was reported in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where hundreds of homes and buildings have been damaged, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves announced Monday evening, noting there may be more fatalities. Parts of St. Vincent\u00a0and the Grenadines were left with no water or electricity as of Monday night, Gonsalves said. Hurricane Beryl \u201cleft in its wake immense destruction, pain, suffering, across our nation at this hour,\u201d he said. Union Island, just north of Grenada, was devastated, with reports indicating 90% of the houses have been severely damaged or destroyed, Gonsalves said. In Grenada, about 95% of the island has lost power due to Hurricane\u00a0Beryl, Neila K. Ettienne, press secretary for the office of the prime minister, told CNN on Monday. Telecommunications across Grenada\u00a0are down, and some individuals have lost internet service, Ettienne explained. All schools and business are closed, including the airport, the secretary said, adding only hospitals and the national police force are currently operational. The airport reported a sustained wind speed of 92 mph and a gust of 121 mph Monday afternoon, according to the National Hurricane Center. Beryl\u2019s arrival\u00a0marks an exceptionally early start to the Atlantic hurricane season. On Sunday it became the earliest Category 4 on record in the Atlantic Ocean and the only Category 4 in the month of June. The abnormally warm ocean waters that facilitated Beryl\u2019s alarming strengthening are a clear indicator that this hurricane season will be far from normal in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Beryl is breaking records because the ocean is as warm now as it would normally be at the peak of hurricane season, said Jim Kossin, a hurricane expert and science advisor at nonprofit First Street Foundation. \u201cHurricanes don\u2019t know what month it is, they only know what their ambient environment is,\u201d Kossin told CNN. \u201cBeryl is breaking records for the month of June because Beryl thinks it\u2019s September.\u201d Kossin added the ocean heat fueling Beryl\u2019s unprecedented strengthening \u201ccertainly have a human fingerprint on them.\u201d The latest on Beryl: \u2022 Beryl is a dangerous hurricane:\u00a0The storm was located 510 miles east-southeast of Isla Beata in the Dominican Republic, had sustained winds of 160 mph and was moving to the west-northwest at 22 mph as of Monday evening. Beryl\u2019s hurricane-force winds extend 40 miles from center while tropical-storm-force winds extend about 125 miles. The storm\u2019s center is expected to move away from the southern Windward Islands Monday night and across the southeastern and central Caribbean Sea through Tuesday, and is forecast to pass near Jamaica on Wednesday. \u2022 Hurricane warning for Jamaica: Hurricane conditions are expected to reach the coast on Jamaica by Wednesday, according to the NHC. Tropical storm warnings are also in effect for the south coast of Dominican Republic from Punta Palenque westward to the border with Haiti, and the south coast of Haiti from the border with the Dominican Republic to Anse-d\u2019Hainault. \u2022 Hundreds evacuated: More than 400 people were being housed in hurricane shelters across Barbados on Sunday night, the nation\u2019s Chief Shelter Warden, Ramona Archer-Bradshaw, told CNN affiliate CBC News. \u2022 State of emergency in Grenada: A state of emergency declared Sunday night by Grenadian Gov. General C\u00e9cile La Grenade will remain in effect until Tuesday morning. All businesses have closed except the police force, hospitals, prisons, waste disposal and ports. \u2022 Airports remain closed: Airports in Barbados, Grenada and Saint Lucia were closed Sunday night as Beryl approached. Grenada\u2019s Maurice Bishop International Airport is expected to reopen Tuesday morning, a spokesperson said. The Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados and St. Lucia\u2019s Hewanorra International and George Charles airports have also halted operations. The Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados will resume operations Tuesday, a spokesperson said. \u2022 Cricket World Cup fans stuck:\u00a0Barbados is still hosting cricket fans from around the globe who traveled to the island for the T20 World Cup, some of whom are not scheduled to leave until Monday or Tuesday, said Barbados Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley. \u201cSome of them have never gone through a hurricane or a storm before,\u201d she added, imploring residents to provide support for visitors, if possible. Where Beryl is headed next Landfall is far from the end of Beryl\u2019s story, and its long-term path is still uncertain. The hurricane will track generally west or northwest over the Caribbean Sea through Thursday, and is expected to remain a major hurricane \u2013 Category 3 or stronger \u2013 into midweek before losing a bit of strength. Even so, the hurricane will remain formidable with strong winds, torrential rain and hazardous seas extending well beyond its center over much of the Caribbean. Beryl\u2019s center could pass just south of Jamaica on Wednesday and bring heavier impacts to the country even if it doesn\u2019t make landfall there. \u201cStorm surge could raise water levels by as much as 3 to 5 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds along the immediate coast of Jamaica,\u201d the hurricane center said. Several days are likely to elapse between Beryl\u2019s first landfall in the Windward Islands Monday and its next likely landfall on or around Mexico\u2019s Yucatan Peninsula around Friday morning. The hurricane center also noted large swells from the storm will continue in the Windward and southern Leeward Islands for the next couple of days. \u201cSwells are also expected to reach the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola late tonight into Tuesday. These swells are expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions,\u201d it said. What happens after Beryl\u2019s next landfall will also determine if the cyclone is able to reach the Gulf of Mexico over the weekend. If Beryl is able to survive its journey over land and reach the bathtub-warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, it could spell trouble for northeast Mexico or possibly the US Gulf Coast. An unprecedented start to hurricane season This season is already off to a busy start as a second storm \u2013 Tropical Storm Chris \u2013 made landfall near Tuxpan, Mexico, off the Gulf Coast early Monday. Beryl is ushering in a troubling start to a hurricane season that forecasters have warned will be hyperactive \u2013 and Beryl\u2019s record-shattering activity may be a sign of what\u2019s to come. Beryl is the earliest\u00a0major hurricane \u2013 defined as one that is Category 3 or higher \u2013 in the Atlantic in 58 years. The storm\u2019s rapid intensification is very atypical this early into hurricane season, according to National Hurricane Center Director Mike Brennan. It\u2019s rare for tropical systems to form in the central Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles in June, particularly strong ones, as only a handful of tropical systems have done so,\u00a0according to NOAA records. The storm isn\u2019t just early for this season. It is now the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s third-earliest major hurricane. The earliest was Hurricane Alma on June 8, 1966, followed by Hurricane Audrey, which reached major hurricane status on June 27, 1957. Beryl has also set the record for the easternmost hurricane to form in the Tropical Atlantic in June, beating a previous record set in 1933. The central and eastern Atlantic traditionally become more active in August, in part because ocean temperatures have had time to warm and fuel developing systems. This year, however, the Atlantic basin has seen above normal water temperatures and a lack of wind shear due to the transition from El Ni\u00f1o season to La Ni\u00f1a season, both of which are fuel for tropical development. \u201cBeryl\u00a0has found an environment with very warm ocean waters for this time of year,\u201d Brennan said. Systems forming this early in the summer in this part of the Atlantic\u00a0is a sign of the hyperactive hurricane season to come, according to\u00a0research from\u00a0Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University.\u00a0Normally, ocean temperatures aren\u2019t warm enough in June and July to help tropical systems thrive. National Weather Service\u00a0forecasters\u00a0predict\u00a017 to 25 named storms this season, with as many as 13 of those becoming hurricanes. \u201cThat\u2019s well above average,\u201d Brennan noted.

Despite undergoing surgery for a torn meniscus less than a month ago, the 37-year-old Djokovic is back at Wimbledon, winning his first-round match against Vit\u00a0Kop\u0159iva in straight sets \u2013\u00a06-1 6-2 6-2 \u2013 on Tuesday. On June 3, Djokovic battled to a five-set win in the fourth round of the French Open against Francisco Cerundolo, before withdrawing from Roland Garros the following day citing a medial meniscus tear in his right knee. On June 6, Djokovic posted on social media that \u201csurgery went well\u201d and that he\u2019d work to return to the court \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d \u201cEverything I could possibly do, I\u2019ve done along with my team in the last three and a half weeks in order to give myself a chance to be able to play in front of you here today,\u201d Djokovic said in his on-court interview. \u201cI think if it was for any other tournament, I probably wouldn\u2019t risk it, wouldn\u2019t rush it as much. I just love Wimbledon, love coming back here.\u201d There was little sign of the injury hampering Djokovic on Tuesday as he dominated Kop\u0159iva from the first point, dropping just five games and wrapping the match up in less than two hours on court. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how everything is going to unfold on the court,\u201d Djokovic added. \u201cYou know, practice sessions are quite different than official match play. I\u2019m just extremely glad that the way I felt today, the way I played.\u201d Djokovic is seeking his 25th grand slam singles title \u2013 the most across men\u2019s or women\u2019s tennis. He has seven Wimbledon titles, one behind Roger Federer for the most on the men\u2019s side \u2013 Martina Navratilova won the event nine times. Djokovic lost in the final last year to Carlos Alcaraz in a five-set epic. Olympic dreams Following Wimbledon, Djokovic will chase one of the only accolades to elude him: an Olympic gold medal. The 37-year-old will represent Serbia at the upcoming Paris Olympics, the country\u2019s Olympic Committee announced June 18. His best Olympic result is the bronze he won in 2008. \u201cBeing part of the Olympic Games, representing your country, is a huge privilege and honor,\u201d Djokovic, who carried the Serbian flag at the opening ceremony of London 2012, told the ITF in May. \u201c[It\u2019s so special to be] part of the oldest sports event in the history of sport. \u201cOf course, winning a gold medal or winning any medal for my country is a great wish and desire.

{"id": "2024_07_02_europe_french-election-drop-outs-intl-latam", "text": "As French citizens get set to vote in runoff parliamentary elections on Sunday hundreds of contenders have bowed out in an effort to block the far-right party from the gates of power. Over 200 candidates from President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist camp and the left-wing alliance have stepped down in a bid to avoid splitting the vote. They\u2019ve put aside their differences with one goal in mind: to keep the far right firmly away from the 289 seats required for an absolute majority currently within their reach. Last Sunday the French people placed the anti-immigration National Rally (RN) and its allies in first place while Macron\u2019s centrist camp came third, behind the left-wing bloc. After the first round in constituencies where no candidate won outright, an unprecedented number of seats \u2013 over 300 - went to a three-way run-off favoring the RN. By Tuesday, as the deadline to drop out closed, fewer than 100 remain, after centrist and left-wing candidates strategically dropped out in individual seats. This tactic could stop some RN candidates from winning, according to analyst Antoine Bristielle. \u201cThe main probability was an absolute majority for the National Rally, but now with all of the withdrawals, I think that\u2019s unlikely,\u201d Bristielle said. In an attempt to deny the RN a majority, the NFP \u2013 a left-wing coalition that wants to lower the retirement age and tax the rich \u2013 promised to withdraw all of its candidates who came in third place in the first round. Leslie Mortreux, an NFP qualifier and the only publicly out transgender runner, stepped aside to give right-wing Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin a better chance of defeating the RN rival in a constituency in the north. Macron\u2019s Ensemble allies also called on their supporters to prevent the far right taking office, but some warned against lending their votes to the hard-left France Unbowed, a party inside the NFP. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire drew the ire of the left on Tuesday when he said no vote should go to the far right but added that he personally would not vote for the far left either. In one constituency in the south, a government minister initially refused to help an NFP candidate, reasoning that she didn\u2019t want her voters to have to choose between two extremes. The following day she tweeted that she was bowing out following pressure from the president and prime minister. In over 80 three-way races, Macron\u2019s centrist candidates dropped out in favor of candidates from the left-wing NFP. But many stopped short of encouraging their supporters to vote for a left-wing opponent. \u201cI\u2019ve taken the difficult decision to withdraw \u2026 leaving it up to my voters to position themselves against the far right or far left,\u201d Samuel Deguara, a candidate from Macron\u2019s camp said after withdrawing. Meanwhile, far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen condemned the political bargaining. \u201cThe act of withdrawing and giving voting instructions shows the worst contempt for voters,\u201d Le Pen said Tuesday. Even before the candidate withdrawals, projections had suggested that after the second round of voting next Sunday, the RN was likely to fall short of an absolute majority and win between 230 and 280 seats in the 577-seat lower house. In speeches before the first round, National Rally leader Jordan Bardella said he would refuse to govern a minority government, in which the RN would require the votes of allies to pass laws. If the RN falls short of an absolute majority and Bardella stays true to his word, Macron might then have to search for a prime minister on the left, or somewhere else entirely. And if the unthinkable for Macron happens and the RN does get an absolute majority, then it will become the first far-right party to enter the French government since World War II.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/europe/french-election-drop-outs-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_02_middleeast_al-shifa-hospital-director-released-israel-detention-intl-hnk", "text": "The head of Gaza\u2019s largest hospital has claimed he was repeatedly tortured\u00a0during his seven months in Israeli detention, following his sudden release Monday, in a move that highlighted growing rifts in the Israeli establishment. Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of the Al-Shifa medical complex, who was arrested in late November during the first of two Israeli raids on the facility in Gaza City, was released along with 50 other Palestinian detainees. Their release has sparked outcry in Israel and was criticized across the political spectrum, as well as by families of the Israeli hostages kidnapped by Hamas during its deadly October 7 attack. At a news conference Monday, Abu Salmiya alleged Palestinian detainees suffered \u201csevere torture\u201d and had medical treatment denied. \u201cMy little finger was broken. I was repeatedly subjected to hitting on the head, causing bleeding multiple times. There was almost daily torture in the Israeli prisons,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe doctor there beats the detainees, and the nurse beats the detainees. This is in violation of all international laws.\u201d Abu Salmiya said fellow prisoners lost a significant\u00a0amount of weight and were \u201ccompletely denied treatment.\u201d \u201cThey amputated the feet of several prisoners, those who are suffering from diabetes symptoms due to the lack of medical treatment for them,\u201d he said. In response to allegations of abuse, the Israeli Prison Service told CNN Monday it was \u201cnot aware of the claims,\u201d that \u201call prisoners are detained according to the law\u201d and \u201call basic rights required are fully applied by professionally trained prison guards.\u201d A prison service spokesperson said, \u201cprisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined and addressed by official authorities.\u201d Abu Salmiya was reportedly detained while evacuating the hospital with a World Health Organization convoy. The Israeli military said at the time the director was \u201capprehended and transferred for \u2026 questioning following evidence showing that the Shifa Hospital, under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control center.\u201d Al-Shifa became a flashpoint in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza and now lies in ruins following a 14-day Israeli siege in March. Israel repeatedly claimed that a Hamas command center sat underneath the medical complex and that the militant group has used it\u00a0to hold hostages. Hamas has denied the claims, as have health officials working there. CNN cannot independently verify the accusations and Israel has not released definitive proof to back the claim. Other Palestinian detainees released on Monday described overcrowded detention centers where prisoners were abused, diseases were rife, and food was scarce. \u201cMorning and night we were being beaten, besides the solitary confinement and besides the diseases that spread between the prisoners,\u201d released detainee Faraj Attiyeh Al-Saman told CNN. \u201cThey would show us photos of our relatives\u2019 bodies, pictures of our families and children \u2026 and say: \u2018Look at your children, we killed them.\u2019 They would show us pictures of our wives, our sisters, and tell us that they had taken them and done this and that to them,\u201d Faraj said. It is unclear how the released detainees were arrested and under what premise. Those CNN spoke to were detained after being questioned at Gaza checkpoints. Israeli security officials have previously told CNN that they have been made aware of allegations of torture tactics being used against Palestinians within Israel\u2019s prison system and have said they are investigating. Israeli outcry The release has created tensions within Israel as its war with Hamas stretches into its ninth month, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordering an \u201cimmediate inquiry into the matter,\u201d according to his office. Netanyahu said the decision followed discussions at the High Court, and the identity of the released prisoners was determined independently by security officials \u201cbased on their professional considerations.\u201d Israel\u2019s domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet said in a statement that detainees who posed a \u201clesser danger\u201d were released to \u201cfree up places of confinement.\u201d Shin Bet said it had been warning for about a year of the need to increase the number of spaces in detention centers \u201cgiven the need to arrest terrorists\u201d in the West Bank and Gaza. \u201cWithout a choice, without an immediate solution to the prison shortage, arrests will continue to be canceled and detainees will continue to be released,\u201d the agency said. But far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir was among those outraged by the decision, calling the release of Abu Salmiya and other prisoners \u201csecurity negligence.\u201d Former defense minister Benny Gantz, who resigned from Israel\u2019s\u00a0War Cabinet last month, said \u201cwhoever made this decision lacked judgment and should be fired today.\u201d The decision to release the detainees comes as families of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas during the October 7 attacks continue to wait for news of their loved ones. As many as 120 hostages remain captive in Gaza. In a statement Monday, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum headquarters said it hoped the Israeli government would be \u201cdetermined to release our family members, with the same determination as it releases the director of Shifa Hospital.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/02/middleeast/al-shifa-hospital-director-released-israel-detention-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/03/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_youngest-duo-ride-around-the-world-by-motorbike", "text": "They first traveled long distance by motorcycle just a few years ago, but this couple now hold the title of youngest duo to circumnavigate the globe on a motorbike, two up. Lavi Scholl and Ollie Gamblin, now aged 32 and 34, visited 39 different countries, including Morocco, Argentina, and Mongolia, during their record setting 589-day motorbike trip and even found time to squeeze in a quick wedding. \u201cIt was quite an endeavor to set out and say, \u2018Right, we\u2019re going to do this,\u2019\u201d Gamblin, from the UK, tells CNN Travel. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really know how long it was going to take. We didn\u2019t know whether we\u2019d get to the end.\u201d Record-setting journey The couple, who tied the knot while riding through Las Vegas last year, first met while they were both working on a farm in Australia in 2017 and began traveling together soon after. \u201cI had a campervan at the time,\u201d adds Gamblin, explaining that Scholl had been camping in tents while traveling in her car. \u201cAnd Lavi thought it would be a good upgrade to join me in the camper van.\u201d After departing Australia, Scholl and Gamblin spent around five and a half months hiking around New Zealand. \u201cWe realized that we both have a passion for overland (travel),\u201d says Scholl, from Germany. Keen to take things further, the couple began planning a cycling trip around the world. However, after going on a short test run, they decided that it\u2019d be too \u201cexhausting\u201d and would \u201cprobably take years and years and years.\u201d \u201cSo we decided the best form of travel would be a motorcycle,\u201d says Gamblin, who has had a motorcycle license since he was 17. \u201cAnd that was the first time either of us have traveled overland or anything on a motorcycle.\u201d After a friend made an attempt to become the youngest male to circumnavigate the globe by motorcycle, the pair got in touch with Guinness World Records to see if they could set the record for the youngest pair to circumnavigate the globe by motorcycle (riding pillion). They had to meet certain requirements, which included beginning and starting their trip at the same location, traveling in one direction continuously and traveling through two antipodal points. The couple, known as \u201cLavi and Ollie\u201d were loaned a Suzuki V-Strom 1050XT by UK dealership Motorcycle World, and Gamblin says he fell over while riding out of the parking lot. Unsteady start \u201cI couldn\u2019t handle the weight of the bike on my leg with no gear and Lavi wasn\u2019t even on the bike,\u201d he says. After going on a test ride to the Peak District in central England, the couple marked out a route around the world on Google Maps and got together as much money as they could to fund the trip and purchase all the gear they\u2019d need on the road. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d explains Gamblin. \u201cSo we had to buy everything from scratch.\u201d Their trip was delayed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, but the pair were eventually able to set off in April 2022, starting from the Ace Cafe, a popular motorcyclist hangout in northwest London. \u201cNot all international borders were open at the time,\u201d says Gamblin. \u201cBut we figured that, as we were going along, it would sort of open up. And luckily it did.\u201d When planning their route, they looked into countries that did not require a Carnet De Passage, a passport for a car or motorbike, in order to save on costs. \u201cThe countries we chose didn\u2019t need a Carnet De Passage, and we\u2019d already researched all the visas to make sure that we could get those along the way,\u201d adds Gamblin. \u201cOr if we needed them in advance, we knew which ones to get.\u201d In order to keep costs down, they opted to wild camp as much as they could and avoid eating out. \u201cWe always cook our own food,\u201d says Scholl. \u201cThis was a really good way to save some money. And also, we didn\u2019t drink or party.\u201d While the couple had planned to travel eastwards, they were forced to rethink due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, instead heading south and west across France, Spain and then onto Morocco. \u201cIn the first few months we fell over many, many times on dirt roads, gravel,\u201d says Gamblin. \u201cAny difficult terrain, we just fell over.\u201d Scholl, who rode pillion for the duration of the trip, describes those initial months as a \u201csteep, steep learning curve.\u201d While they eventually got into a solid groove, the journey, which saw them travel nearly 47,000 miles (76,000 kilometers,) wasn\u2019t without its difficulties. Once they arrived in Senegal, Scholl and Gamblin shipped the bike, which they nicknamed \u201cBumblebee\u201d to Brazil. But the shipping container was temporarily \u201clost\u201d en route, which delayed them by around seven weeks and had them seriously questioning whether they\u2019d be able to complete the journey. \u201cThat was really, really challenging for me,\u201d Scholl says. \u201cWhen the bike made it to Brazil, (and) we could get it, it was the happiest day of my life, I think.\u201d Once they were reunited with Bumblebee, the pair were able to continue on through South America, traveling through Brazil, Bolivia and Peru. \u201cThe whole continent of South America really left some marks on me,\u201d says Scholl. \u201cEvery country is very unique.\u201d Ride of their lives The couple experienced some \u201cdifficult moments\u201d during this section of the trip, particularly while riding through the Andes Mountains. \u201cThat was quite tough for us, because of the altitude,\u201d says Gamblin, explaining that they both experienced altitude sickness. \u201cWe\u00a0 had to ride through snow storms and a lightning storm.. So we had some tough conditions\u2026 \u201cAnd we were at altitude for more than a month, I think. So there were some really physically tough days, and it took its toll on us.\u201d Scholl and Gamblin rode all the way down to Argentina, before heading back up to Chile, and riding through Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. From here, they flew their bike into Panama and entered North America, stopping off in Las Vegas for four days to get married \u201cby Elvis.\u201d \u201cWe had been engaged for six years and had always said that if we got to Las Vegas ever on our travels, we would get married there by Elvis,\u201d the couple told CNN via email. \u201cAnd on this trip that\u2019s exactly what we did. Quick four-day stop and then back on the road. Nothing like a honeymoon of riding thousands of miles.\u201d They then headed to Canada, before sending their bike to Seoul, South Korea via air freight. Once they\u2019d collected it, the newlyweds continued on, heading to Vladivostok, Russia by boat and then on to Mongolia. Gamblin found riding through Mongolia particularly challenging, explaining that he broke his rib after falling off the bike. \u201cAlthough it was probably the most difficult (place) to ride in, Mongolia was absolutely spectacular for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was like riding in a National Geographic documentary. \u201cThe roads are very challenging. We fell off loads of times\u2026 So it was challenging, but it was really rewarding.\u201d Despite this, the pair say that they very much enjoyed their time in the country, and loved wild camping there. \u201cThere was an amazing local culture with everybody living in gers (circular, domed tent-style dwellings) and herds of wild animals all over the place,\u201d adds Gamblin. \u201cSo it really felt exactly what I imagined Mongolia to be like in my head.\u201d Once they crossed over to Central Asia, the couple were able to re-energize in Kazakhstan and go on to finish the final leg of the trip, which saw them ride back towards Europe and on to the UK. Triumphant finish Gamblin and Scholl were joined by several other riders for the last section of the trip, from the southeastern UK port of Dover to London, including some of those who\u2019d been following their adventure via their YouTube and Instagram accounts. \u201cThere were lots and lots of riders that came,\u201d says Gamblin. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know any of them. But they all came to support us and we have this massive convoy heading from Dover to London.\u201d The group were greeted by a huge celebration when they arrived back in London on November 19 of last year. \u201cIt was very surreal,\u201d admits Gamblin. \u201cBecause we came back to the Ace Cafe, where we started, same place. \u201cAnd we sat at the same table that we started out at before we left on the trip\u2026 You have the same people that have been there at the beginning. So it\u2019s sort of like nothing actually happened.\u201d After submitting all of the proof required by Guinness World Records, the couple, who has since returned Bumblebee to the dealership, were informed that they\u2019d officially set the record for the youngest pair to circumnavigate the world on a motorcycle (riding pillion.) \u201cThey came back to us about two weeks ago, and approved the records,\u201d says Gamblin. \u201cSo it\u2019s official now.\u201d Currently based in the UK, Scholl and Gamblin say that they\u2019re still processing their incredible feat while trying to get used to being in one place at a time. \u201cThe funny thing is, we never had a flat (apartment), or a house or like this sort of situation together (before),\u201d says Scholl, who recently obtained her motorbike license. Both stress that they have no intention of settling down, and are already planning their next adventure. They plan to head off on a UK-based riding trip so that Scholl can improve her motorcycle skills. \u201cLater in the year, we want to go abroad and start a new trip, but on two separate bikes instead of one,\u201d adds Gamblin.
