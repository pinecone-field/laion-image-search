The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Straphangers at bus stops clutch steaming coffees and huddle for warmth. On the horizon, views of the Andes are as spectacular as ever, their snow-capped peaks gleaming extra bright after an early-season storm. Santiago is under a record freeze. After an eight-day \u201ccold wave\u201d pushed through the capital region this week, the average temperature for May dropped to 37 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) \u2013 the coldest since 1950, according to Ang\u00e9lica Guz\u00e1man, a meteorologist with the Chilean Meteorologic Directorate. Thursday marked the coldest day of the year so far, with one weather station notching a frosty 30 degrees. \u201cYou have to go out dressed in double layers,\u201d said Rosita Moya, a publicist who spoke with CNN on a frigid Friday morning, the fur-lined hood of her parka turned up. \u201cI had to go searching for my hat.\u201d Chileans are used to the cold, but not this early in the year. A typical May\u00a0in Santiago\u00a0reaches a balmy high of 64 degrees, dipping down to 43 degrees at night. The brunt of the winter arrives in July, when the average low is down to 37 degrees. A mass of cold air that will last through the weekend is behind the strange forecast, Guz\u00e1man said, with below-average temperatures expected to continue. Authorities have declared a \u201ccode blue\u201d throughout the country, opening additional shelters and services for homeless populations. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be prepared: warm clothes, closed shoes, protection for your hands. Watch the parts of your body that are more exposed, we need to cover them up,\u201d a radio announcer warned on a broadcast Thursday night. Zipped tight in a puffer by the central La Vega market, Diamira Salas sipped a warm quinoa drink spiced with brown sugar and pineapple that she\u2019d just bought from a street cart, the kind of goopy, stick-to-your-bones beverage perfect to beat back a morning chill. \u201cIt has natural protein and in this cold weather it gives you calories,\u201d Salas, a nurse, said.

{"id": "2024_05_19_sport_manchester-city-wins-premier-league-title-spt-intl", "text": "Seventy-nine seconds. That\u2019s how long Arsenal had hope for. In the end, the drama and tension of the final day of the Premier League season lasted little longer than a minute, as Phil Foden\u2019s stunning early strike set Manchester City on course for a comfortable 3-1 win over West Ham that ensured a historic fourth straight title for the club. Two points ahead going into the last day, City knew only a win would guarantee it retained the title ahead of Arsenal, while the Gunners needed to win and hope that Pep Guardiola\u2019s side either drew or lost. Foden\u2019s goal meant that what was happening 200 miles south in North London mattered little, though Arsenal took the fight to the bitter end with a 2-1 win at home to Everton to finish two agonizing points behind City. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ourselves in the history books, no team has ever done it,\u201d Foden, who was also recently crowned the Premier League Player of the Season, told Sky Sports. \u201cYou can see what it means to fans, to us. This Premier League title was a bit more [special] because no team had done it before, now we\u2019re the first team to have done it. I\u2019m lost for words. I\u2019m shattered. \u201cWe played this scenario a couple of times before and I think it helped with the nerves, I thought today we looked confident. We played our own football and it paid off.\u201d Still only 23 years old, Foden has now won a remarkable six Premier League titles. It\u2019s a feeling he certainly isn\u2019t taking for granted. \u201cI never get bored of it,\u201d he added. \u201cI want this feeling every time. When you win something there\u2019s no better feeling. I just want to keep winning as much as I can.\u201d City\u2019s stroll in the sun Foden\u2019s opening goal, a left-foot rocket into the top corner, settled any early nerves \u2013 if there were any at all - at a raucous Etihad Stadium. The remaining 88 minutes and 49 seconds were little more than an early trophy celebration as City\u2019s fans and players basked in the Manchester sun. The Englishman, a Manchester City boy born and bred, was living the dream, scoring the goal that clinched the league title for his hometown club \u2013 and it only got better from there. Just 15 minutes later, Jeremy Doku\u2019s pinpoint cross somehow made its way through three West Ham players and found Foden, who coolly side-footed the ball into the back of the net. West Ham midfielder Mohammed Kudus, who has enjoyed a superb first season in the Premier League, briefly made matters interesting after his outrageous bicycle kick halved City\u2019s lead just before half time. Back in north London, Everton took a shock lead five minutes before the interval but Arsenal hit back almost immediately to ensure the teams went into the break level. However, any concerns City had about West Ham spoiling the party were banished just over 10 minutes into the second half, as Rodri\u2019s low shot from the edge of the area squirmed under the hand of West Ham goalkeeper Alphonse Areola and into the net. Now there was no doubt. The Premier League trophy was staying in Manchester. The party had now well and truly started and City passed the ball around for the remainder of the match with a calmness and control that belied the enormity of the occasion, seeing out the final 35 minutes as though it was a training session. As the match entered its final stages, Manchester City fans began celebrating with \u201cthe Pozna\u0144,\u201d joining arms and jumping up and down with their backs to the pitch. Back down in London, Arsenal did eventually get a winner against Everton in the 89th minute thanks to Kai Havertz, but it was the most meager of consolations. Blue Moon, City\u2019s club anthem, echoed around the Etihad as the referee blew the full-time whistle to a deafening roar from the home fans. Hundreds of supporters ran onto the pitch to celebrate, filling the air with blue smoke set off from flares. Guardiola has built one of, if not the greatest team, in Premier League history. Manchester City has now gone where no team in English football has gone before \u2013 and it will likely take a monumental effort from Arsenal, or perhaps Liverpool post-Jurgen Klopp, to dethrone this juggernaut next season.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/sport/manchester-city-wins-premier-league-title-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_europe_vatican-guidance-supernatural-phenomena-scli-intl", "text": "The Vatican has tightened up its guidance on recognizing supernatural phenomena such as apparitions of the Virgin Mary and seemingly blood-soaked crucifixes. The new guidelines replace rules drawn up in 1978 and say that bishops should no longer act independently over such sightings but instead consult the Vatican. The changes made by the Vatican\u2019s doctrinal office (DDF) aim to to bring the church up to date in responding to the swift spread of claims of apparitions online. According to the document released by the Vatican Friday, the new procedure will allow for \u201cfaster decisions while respecting popular devotion\u201d when it comes to assessing claims of supernatural phenomena, which could include the appearance of stigmata and other purported miracles. Under the previous guidelines, a local bishop could rapidly declare a phenomenon\u2019s supernatural nature, the Vatican said, \u201conly for the Holy Office to express a different decision later.\u201d In other instances a bishop might decide whether or not an occurrence was supernatural only for his successor to conclude the opposite, the statement continued. The new Vatican guidelines say \u201cas a rule\u201d bishops and church officials will not declare whether alleged phenomena are supernatural or not, leaving this decision to the Pope. The head of the DDF, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fernandez, told reporters that often these events \u201chave led to a great richness of spiritual fruits, growth in faith, devotion, fraternity, and service. In some cases, they have given rise to shrines throughout the world that are at the heart of many people\u2019s popular piety today.\u201d Speaking at a Vatican press conference, the cardinal cited Lourdes, the Marian shrine in the southwest of France visited by those with physical and spiritual ailments, as a positive example. However, he went on to add that some alleged events which derive from the pursuit of \u201cprofit, power, fame, social recognition, or other personal interest\u201d may harm the faithful, potentially even to the extent of \u201cexerting control over people or carrying out abuses.\u201d Bishops will now generally be expected to issue a \u201cnihil obstat\u201d which will allow for worship but will leave open the issue of formal recognition of \u201csupernatural\u201d activity to the Vatican. However, Fernandez said that this recognition would be \u201cvery exceptional\u201d. Other options available to the bishops include the option to formally reject an experience as supernatural, as well as steps to ban or limit worship of phenomena regarded with suspicion. The guidelines state that those spreading false claims can face sanctions, including formal church penalties. Positive criteria that will be considered by the Church when making a conclusion include the credibility and reputation of those reporting the occurrence, while negative criteria include possible errors, overt pursuit of personal interest, and \u201cany psychosis (or) collective hysteria.\u201d One site of alleged Marian apparitions still under review by the Vatican is Medjugorje, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with Cardinal Fernandez telling reporters the claims would be studied according to the new norms.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/europe/vatican-guidance-supernatural-phenomena-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_middleeast_netanyahu-israel-political-tensions-intl", "text": "Divisions and disagreements within the Israeli cabinet on the conduct and priorities of the war against Hamas have simmered since the onset of the crisis. Now they\u2019ve boiled over, revealing a new level of public vitriol - as well as an ultimatum from one of three members of the war cabinet \u2013 as the seven-month long conflict potentially enters a new phase. On Saturday Benny Gantz, the leader of the National Unity Party, who joined the war cabinet after Hamas\u2019 attack in October, demanded by June 8 the adoption of a six-point plan. That plan would secure the return of Israeli hostages, the demobilization of Hamas and the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip. It would also lead to the creation of an alternative government for Gaza, \u201can American-European-Arab-Palestinian administration\u201d that would \u201clay the foundation for a future alternative that is not Hamas or [Mahmoud] Abbas,\u201d the President of the Palestinian Authority. The Gantz plan would also ensure the return of residents displaced by attacks from Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, and measures to ensure ultra-orthodox Jews can be drafted into the military just like any other citizen. That has been a red line for the religious right in the Israeli cabinet. In an unveiled swipe at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Gantz, who is widely seen to be a leading contender to be the next Israeli leader, added that \u201cpersonal and political considerations have begun to penetrate into the holy of holies of Israel\u2019s security.\u201d \u201cIf you choose to lead the nation into the abyss, we will withdraw from the government, turn to the people, and form a government that can bring about a real victory.\u201d \u201cUnity cannot be a fig leaf for stagnation in the management of the campaign,\u201d Gantz added. Within hours the accusations were flying, laying bare the fissures in Israeli politics and the personal animosities that pervade the government. The prime minister\u2019s office shot back. \u201cThe conditions set by Benny Gantz are washed-up words whose meaning is clear: the end of the war and a defeat for Israel, the abandonment of most of the hostages, leaving Hamas intact and the establishment of a Palestinian state,\u201d it said in a statement. One far-right member of the cabinet, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, said Gantz was \u201ca small leader and big trickster, who, from the first moment of joining the government has chiefly been trying to dismantle it.\u201d He added: \u201cWhoever offered the ultra-Orthodox agreements on a conscription law in exchange for the dissolution of the government and now chants slogans about responsibility, is a hypocrite and a liar.\u201d From a very different point of view, opposition leader Yair Lapid said Gantz should act now. \u201cEnough with the press conferences, enough with the empty ultimatums, get out! If you weren\u2019t sitting in the government, we would already be in the post Netanyahu and Ben Gvir era,\u201d he said. Gantz\u2019s broadside did not come in isolation. Last week, the third member of the war cabinet, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, spoke of decisions that he said should have been made at the start of the war. He also said: \u201cI will not agree to the establishment of Israeli military rule in Gaza. Israel must not establish civilian rule in Gaza.\u201d Illusion of unity shattered It\u2019s against this background of internecine warfare that Israeli troops continue to fight in Gaza, unsure of how their mission will end and of any plan for the day after the guns fall silent. Gantz himself made reference to this Saturday, saying that \u201cwhile the Israeli soldiers show supreme bravery on the front - some of the people who sent them into battle behave with cowardice and irresponsibility.\u201d Israeli commentators Sunday said the illusion of unity within the cabinet that had been fostered in the early phase of the conflict had been shattered. The Jerusalem Post reported Sunday that the comments were remarkable in that for the first time, \u201cGantz publicly accused the prime minister of prioritizing his political survival over the nation\u2019s interests. For the first time, he set a clear deadline for remaining in the government.\u201d Writing in Haaretz, Anshel Pfeffer said that whoever had written Gantz\u2019s speech \u201cdid nothing more than recycle the dozens of leaks on the divisions within the war cabinet over the past few months.\u201d Pfeffer, author of the unauthorized biography \u201cBibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu,\u201d says the bottom line, at the end of a week of political turmoil, is that \u201cof the three war cabinet members\u2026two have now publicly accused the third member, Netanyahu, of not having a strategy for a war that has been ongoing for seven and a half months.\u201d Despite all this, Pfeffer and other analysts contend that the status quo may persist, because for Netanyahu, the presence of Gantz and Gallant in the three-man war cabinet provides protection from right-wing members of the larger cabinet. Some of them want Israel to rebuild settlements in Gaza and a much more aggressive approach in the north. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who wants the Israeli military to take control of Gaza after Hamas is liquidated, on Sunday also called for Israeli forces to enter and establish a security zone in southern Lebanon should Hezbollah rocket attacks continue. On Saturday night, Gantz told Netanyahu: \u201cI look into your eyes tonight and I tell you - the choice is in your hands.\u201d He said the moment of truth had arrived. Has it? Over the next three weeks, compromise may yet keep the war cabinet intact. And Gantz is not part of the broader coalition government, which means his potential withdrawal from the war cabinet would not automatically trigger a collapse of Netanyahu\u2019s government. It would, however, leave the prime minister more exposed to the demands of far-right- members of his cabinet. All this comes at a time of daily protests in Israel, from those calling for immediate elections to those demanding that securing the hostages\u2019 release should be the absolute priority, and those wanting an end to further humanitarian aid being allowed into Gaza. And at a time when the Israeli military is fighting in north, central and southern Gaza, and preparing for what may be the toughest phase of the campaign to date.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/middleeast/netanyahu-israel-political-tensions-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_kazakhstan-destination-wedding-romance-chance-encounters", "text": "Ariff Hassan arrived at the wedding under strict instructions: \u201cStay away from the bridesmaid.\u201d It was August 2018. Ariff had traveled from his home in Singapore to Kazakhstan to attend the wedding of an old friend. This friend, like Ariff, had grown up in Malaysia. They\u2019d been close back in the day, but lost touch when Ariff moved to the UK in early adulthood. When Ariff relocated to Singapore, the two friends reconnected, and then the wedding invite followed. Ariff was touched and honored to make the guest list. Plus, his friend\u2019s soon-to-be wife was from Kazakhstan \u2013 the couple had met in Kuala Lumpur \u2013 and the celebrations were set to take place in Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city: Almaty. A keen traveler, Ariff never turned down the opportunity to explore somewhere new. Right away, he RSVPed \u201cyes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d been to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan before, and I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve not been to Kazakhstan. When else am I going to go?\u201d Ariff tells CNN Travel today. Ariff\u2019s friend was delighted that Ariff could make his celebrations. But before the big day, the friend took Ariff aside and gave him a firm warning. \u201cThe bridesmaid\u201d was his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s cousin. Ariff\u2019s friend wanted to avoid a potentially messy family situation, especially as he figured Ariff wasn\u2019t after anything serious. \u201cListen,\u201d said Ariff\u2019s friend. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to get married. And I don\u2019t want to have any problems later, with my extended family. So just give her a wide berth, OK?\u201d Ariff laughed, but he agreed. Anyway, he wasn\u2019t going to the wedding to meet women \u2013 he just wanted to cheer on his friend on his big day, and experience a new country and culture. In the week leading up to the wedding, the bride and groom planned daily activities for their wedding guests \u2013 many of whom, like Ariff, were in Kazakhstan for the first time. Ariff liked Almaty right away. He recalls thinking the city seemed like \u201ca great mix of old Soviet architecture and modern shiny buildings, quiet alleys and parks, and busy bars and restaurants.\u201d \u201cIt is surrounded by beautiful mountains,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe had the chance to stay in a chalet up there for a few days, where the views were absolutely breathtaking.\u201d Then, the night before the wedding, Ariff attended a dinner hosted by the bride\u2019s side of the family. And that\u2019s when he saw Liliya Dauletaliyeva for the first time. \u201cI remember Lili walked in,\u201d says Ariff. She stood out to him right away. \u201cShe was wearing a check shirt. All the other girls were wearing evening dresses.\u201d Over dinner, Liliya was friendly, chatty and at the center of most of the conversations. To Ariff, she projected self-confidence. \u201cShe was doing the translating, between Russian and English, for everybody\u2019s benefit,\u201d Ariff recalls. But when Liliya approached Ariff and tried to make conversation, Ariff made only noncommittal, vague and decidedly awkward responses. He really wanted to talk to Liliya, find out more about her. But Ariff\u2019s friend\u2019s warning was ringing round his head. Because Liliya was \u2013 of course, inevitably \u2013 the bridesmaid Ariff had been warned to stay away from. First impressions Back in 2018, Liliya Dauletaliyeva, born and raised in Almaty, was in her early 20s and living in the Kazakh capital of Astana. She\u2019d recently finished up her bachelor\u2019s degree and enrolled in a master\u2019s program. Liliya was firmly focused on her studies and \u201cnot planning to get married\u201d any time soon. When she wasn\u2019t working late in the library, Liliya was planning future travels. She loved exploring the world, and prioritized adventures whenever she could. She\u2019d just got back from a trip to Iceland, and was looking forward to her cousin\u2019s wedding partly because she\u2019d get to meet a bunch of people from across the world. At the pre-wedding dinner, Liliya noticed her cousin\u2019s fianc\u00e9 only had a couple of friends who\u2019d flown in for the celebrations. One of the guys seemed outgoing and talkative. The other \u2013 Ariff \u2013 seemed more reserved. Liliya wondered if he was shy, or perhaps nervous. \u201cI know a lot of people, their first impression of Kazakhstan, it might be a bit of a cultural shock,\u201d Liliya tells CNN Travel. \u201cSo I thought that he must be feeling a bit weird \u2013 or maybe even awkward because he just reconnected with his friend that he hadn\u2019t seen for ages.\u201d Liliya tried to talk to Ariff to make him feel \u201cmore comfortable.\u201d But she approached him, his eyes widened and he seemed even more awkward than before. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk back,\u201d says Ariff. \u201cI had instructions to follow.\u201d The wedding the next day was \u201can almost 12-hour affair,\u201d as Ariff recalls. \u201cA Kazah wedding is very different from a Southeast Asian wedding,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of drinks and a lot of dancing.\u201d It was a great day, and when the celebrations wrapped up at around 1 a.m., the party continued at a nearby hotel. \u201cThere was a huge karaoke venue at that hotel,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cAnd so all the young people \u2013 the bridesmaids and the friends and family, we all went there.\u201d That\u2019s how, in the early hours of the morning, Ariff and Liliya found themselves sitting side by side in the karaoke bar. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when we started talking, \u201c says Liliya. \u201cAfter all this singing and drinking and dancing. We just sat down and talked.\u201d After \u201ceight or nine hours of drinking\u201d Ariff was no longer preoccupied about his friend\u2019s warning. \u201cThe instructions went out the window,\u201d he says. Connecting at 1 a.m. At first, Liliya and Ariff talked about Kazakhstan. Liliya asked Ariff what he thought of her home country, commenting that Ariff seemed to be one of very few friends of the groom who\u2019d traveled for the wedding. \u201cWhy did you decide to come?\u201d she asked him. \u201cI know many people are like, \u2018Oh Kazakhstan, what is this place? Why would we go there?\u2019\u201d \u201cI like adventures,\u201d said Ariff. \u201cI love traveling and exploring new countries.\u201d Ariff mentioned the wedding invite had come through when he was planning a trip to Iceland. He\u2019d abandoned those plans, and prioritized Kazakhstan instead. \u201cI told him that I just came back from Iceland a couple of months before,\u201d recalls Liliya. \u201cWe realized that we both love traveling. And then just started talking about all these adventures and travel plans, where we want to go\u2026\u201d Liliya and Ariff spent the rest of the evening deep in conversation, but parted ways without exchanging contact details. Still, Ariff was hopeful they might see each other again \u2013 following the Kazak wedding, Ariff\u2019s friend and Liliya\u2019s cousin had a second wedding celebration planned in Malaysia in a few weeks time. Ariff figured Liliya, as a bridesmaid, would likely be there, although he didn\u2019t know for sure. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to figure out how to contact her without obviously asking my friend or his wife for help \u2013 because, you know, the instructions were to stay away from the cousin.\u201d In the end, Ariff tracked Liliya down on Facebook and dropped her a friend request and a message: \u201cHey, I hear you\u2019re coming to Malaysia this weekend for the second leg of the wedding,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to hang out or something, here\u2019s my number.\u201d \u201cAnd then we did hang out,\u201d says Ariff. It was a fun few days \u2013 Ariff showed Liliya his favorite places in Kuala Lumpur and recalls that they \u201cwere quite excited to see each other.\u201d Still, it wasn\u2019t obvious where their connection would go from there. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of long distance,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cI kept thinking, \u2018Maybe we can be friends.\u2019\u201d Taking a risk Before she left Malaysia, Liliya \u2013 on a whim \u2013 invited Ariff to come and visit Kazakhstan again, in a month\u2019s time, for her 24th birthday party. \u201cI obviously sat on the decision for about a week and a half, because I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve just been there,\u2019\u201d recalls Ariff. He remembers turning the idea over in his mind. Ariff really liked Liliya and wanted to see her again. But traveling across the world on a bit of a whim seemed \u201ccrazy.\u201d \u201cI was kind of hesitating to go, because I thought, \u2018This is insanity,\u2019\u201d says Ariff. Ariff mentioned the dilemma to an older family friend whose opinion he trusted. Ariff\u2019s confidant told him that, some 40 years ago he\u2019d \u201cmissed an opportunity with a girl\u201d and still regretted it to that day. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Don\u2019t be me. Go and live your life,\u2019\u201d Ariff recalls. So Ariff put aside his hesitations and embarked on the 19-hour journey to visit Liliya. \u201cI took three planes,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSingapore to Bangkok, Bangkok to Almaty, Almaty to Astana.\u201d \u201cI remember I went to pick him up from the airport,\u201d Liliya says. \u201cI was so nervous. I called my friends and I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. Why did I even agree to that? What did I sign up for? This guy, I only saw him for like, four or five days.\u2019\u201d Liliya wondered what she and Ariff were going to talk about, what were they going to do together, would it be awkward? But as soon as they were together again, Liliya and Ariff\u2019s respective worries melted away. \u201cWe literally spent every single day together. He stayed for 10 days. And every minute that I was not in school, we tried to spend together,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cIt was so much fun.\u201d Liliya also felt heartened that Ariff had followed through \u2013 she\u2019d invited him, he\u2019d said he\u2019d come, and then he did. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s the person that keeps his word, that you can rely on.\u2019 I started thinking, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t mind starting a relationship with a person like this.\u2019\u201d Deciding on the future By the end of the 10 days, both Liliya and Ariff were certain about their future. \u201cThat first trip, we decided we were going to get married,\u201d says Ariff. It wasn\u2019t really a formal conversation, says Liliya: \u201cWe were just having dinner and talking.\u201d Neither of them had been looking for love, let alone marriage. But after meeting each other, Ariff and Liliya were sure they wanted to be together, and to commit to a life side by side. They knew the whole thing was \u201cpretty nuts,\u201d as Ariff puts it today. But they were confident in their feelings and in each other. A month later, in October, Liliya went with Ariff to visit his parents in Malaysia. That Christmas, Ariff\u2019s mother invited Liliya on a family trip to the UK. Ariff\u2019s parents liked Liliya right away \u2013 and, certain marriage was on the cards, Ariff\u2019s mother suggested she and Liliya go shopping for wedding dresses while they were in London. Lilya and Ariff wanted to avoid extended periods of long distance, so around this time Liliya decided to quit her master\u2019s degree and move to Singapore to be with Ariff. \u201cObviously my family didn\u2019t approve,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cBut I thought, \u2018You know what, I can get my master\u2019s in Malaysia or Singapore, and that\u2019s probably an even better option. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u2019\u201d In general Liliya and Ariff\u2019s friends and loved ones were supportive, but a little concerned about the speed at which the romance was moving. \u201cIt was really fast,\u201d admits Liliya. \u201cSome of my friends, they\u2019re still shocked. They\u2019re like, \u2018He hadn\u2019t even proposed and his mom took you to pick a wedding dress.\u2019\u201d Liliya and Ariff shrugged off the concerns, and in December 2018, Liliya moved to Singapore. A couple of months later, Ariff formally proposed, on Valentine\u2019s Day 2019. The couple liked the idea of a \u201ca very small, intimate wedding,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cJust friends and family members, somewhere fun.\u201d \u201cMaybe somewhere in the Mediterranean, a bit of a party with friends,\u201d says Ariff. This dream wasn\u2019t to be. \u201cParents had different ideas,\u201d says Ariff, laughing. Ariff and Liliya ended up with several wedding celebrations \u2013 a small ceremony to sign the legal papers in April 2019, followed by a 300-person wedding in Malaysia in the summer \u201cwith a lot of food and alcohol\u201d and another big party in Kazakhstan. Amid all the planning \u2013 and parental negotiations \u2013 Ariff and Liliya took a break and went on a pre-wedding honeymoon. \u201cIt was great to go on a honeymoon before. We picked places where it was very hard to reach us,\u201d says Ariff. The couple returned from their vacation refreshed and ready to enjoy the August 2019 celebrations. Liliya and Ariff Kazakhstan wedding celebration incorporated a number of Kazakh traditions. \u201cWe had \u2018qyz uzatu,\u2019 a Kazakh traditional ceremony where the bride is sent off from her parental home to the groom\u2019s family, marked by a farewell party attended by close relatives and friends,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cThe event includes ceremonial rites, blessings from elders, presenting gifts to the groom\u2019s family, and the singing of traditional Kazakh songs. Parents give their blessings and advice to the bride.\u201d The Malaysian celebration also included \u201crecitations of prayers and blessings, a traditional meal, and an exchange of gifts,\u201d says Liliya. All of the celebrations were \u201ca blast,\u201d says Ariff. There was lots of laughter, and moving moments too. The family friend who encouraged Ariff to take a risk and visit Liliya was one of the witnesses when the couple signed the papers. Meanwhile, friends from across the world came to celebrate with the couple \u2013 including, of course, Ariff\u2019s childhood friend and Liliya\u2019s cousin, who\u2019d unwittingly kicked off Ariff and Liliya\u2019s love story the year before. \u201cI don\u2019t have any siblings, but I grew up with my cousin,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cWe are very close. So obviously she came to both our weddings, and we\u2019re still super close.\u201d Ariff\u2019s friend had forgiven him for breaking his promise to \u201cstay away from the bridesmaid.\u201d But he still worried, right up until the wedding, that it wouldn\u2019t work out. \u201cI think my friend was very stressed until we got married, until we legally signed the papers because he was like, \u2018Please don\u2019t mess it up,\u2019\u201d says Ariff. \u201cNow we\u2019re all part of one big family,\u201d says Liliya. Taking risks together Post-wedding, Liliya and Ariff settled into an easy rhythm in their relationship. The couple \u201cdon\u2019t have many cultural differences,\u201d says Liliya, even though they grew up in different countries. \u201cWe quickly learned that Kazakh and Malay cultures are very similar, both emphasizing the importance of family, traditions, and community,\u201d she says. Still, they like learning new things about each other\u2019s \u201chistory, people, food\u2026\u201d says Liliya. They enjoy sharing these learning moments with one another. After a few years in Singapore, in 2021 Liliya and Ariff moved to Malaysia. And another big shift occurred last year, when Liliya decided to recommence the master\u2019s course she quit back in 2018. \u201cEven after years of working, this idea of me leaving something incomplete kept bothering me, so I decided to apply again,\u201d she says. Liliya was excited to return to academia, but felt the associated upheaval would only be \u201cworth it\u201d if she was attending one of the best universities in the world. That\u2019s how she ended up accepting a place at the University of Oxford, in the UK. Liliya is loving the experience studying there. The only downside is she and Ariff are now contending with the long distance they actively avoided at the start of their relationship. That is slightly \u201cironic,\u201d admits Ariff. But he\u2019s really proud of Liliya and excited for her next career steps. He visits Oxford every month, and is able to work remotely from the UK for significant chunks of time. In between, the couple video chat regularly. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually much easier to have a long distance relationship when you\u2019ve already been in this relationship for quite some time,\u201d says Liliya. The fact Liliya and Ariff both love traveling also makes journeying back and forth a little easier. \u201cWe want to keep exploring the world and experience living in as many countries as possible,\u201d says Liliya, adding they \u201ccan\u2019t imagine their lives without the thrill of new adventures.\u201d \u201cWe like to take risks, both of us, daily,\u201d says Ariff, pointing out that mindset\u2019s woven into their love story. When they first met, they both jumped into the unknown, flying across the world to visit one another, and then deciding to be together, despite the obstacles. Today, Liliya and Ariff find it surreal to think Liliya barely knew Ariff when she moved across the world to be with him. After five years together, they\u2019re just as certain that they made the right choice. And while they know each other much better, they\u2019re still learning new things about each other. Liliya thinks that\u2019s a big part of what it means to be in love with someone. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great feeling when you feel like you just met this person, because you feel like you keep rediscovering, keep learning something new every day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt never gets boring.\u201d \u201cThinking about how all these puzzle pieces, how they all came together \u2013 I just started believing in destiny.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_middleeast_dubai-worlds-biggest-waste-to-energy-facility", "text": "It\u2019s difficult to imagine that an empty cereal box, a banana peel, or a deflated football could contribute to powering your home. Yet in Dubai, nearly half of all discarded waste plays a role in household energy. Much of it ends up at a plant operated by the Warsan Waste Management Company. \u201cAround 45% percent of Dubai\u2019s total waste comes to this facility,\u201d says Tim Clarke, the company\u2019s CEO. Operational since March of this year, the Warsan plant will use 2 million metric tons of trash annually to produce electricity, enough to power approximately 135,000 homes, according to the company. It\u2019s known as a waste-to-energy plant, and about 13% of all urban waste worldwide ends up in a facility of this kind, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. This method of processing trash is widely adopted across Europe and in nations such as Japan, China, and the US. Yet the plant in Dubai distinguishes itself through its scale. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest facility of its kind in the world,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cWe operate at around 34% efficiency of producing electricity, which is much higher than would normally be expected from an energy waste plant, and that\u2019s partly because with this size we can operate at higher temperatures and higher pressures.\u201d The power of waste The process of converting waste into energy involves three steps: burning trash, using the heat to create steam, and directing the steam to drive a turbine, which generates electricity. The process has been used for more than 100 years, but modern facilities have far more control over the pollutants released as waste is incinerated. Flue gas treatment allows the plant to filter toxic substances and stop them from going into the air. \u201cWe inject reagents into [a reactor] to strip out all the harmful elements such as heavy metals, sulfur components, and they trap particles which are then taken away for disposal,\u201d explains the CEO. Not all pollutants are filtered out. Climate-warming carbon dioxide, for example, is released into the air. However, since the plant produces power, replacing the burning of fossil fuels, Warsan Waste Management believes the overall result is positive. \u201cWe emit CO2, but also we generate 200 megawatts of electricity that\u2019s not having to be produced by a fossil fuel source, which is primarily gas in the UAE,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cSo [we\u2019re] saving around 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.\u201d Facilities such as the one in Dubai also implement a few extra steps to maximize resource extraction. Metals, for instance, are separated for recycling. The mountains of ash, resulting from burning the trash, are collected and repurposed in road construction. According to Clarke, out of the 5,500 tons of waste that the facility receives per day, only 200 tons of residue that can\u2019t be reused remain after processing. Need for recycling Waste-to-Energy plants serve as an alternative to landfills, which contribute to approximately 11% of global methane emissions. \u201cIf we\u2019re globally putting more waste into open dumps, we\u2019re creating methane that is unmanaged. That methane then is creating a significant emissions challenge,\u201d explains Bryan Staley, CEO of the US-based non-profit Environmental Research and Education Foundation. \u201cAs a solution, waste-to-energy can create less emissions compared to a landfill setting,\u201d he adds. But some environmental groups, such as Zero Waste Europe, argue that burning waste to generate electricity discourages efforts to cut waste and initiatives to increase recycling. According to a document released by the government last year, the UAE recycles 20% of its treated waste, but hopes to increase that to 90% by 2050. Staley reinforces the need for recycling, as the most energy-efficient and environmentally friendly solution for waste management. \u201cThere can be this perception of, well, I\u2019ll just throw it in the trash can and it\u2019ll be taken care of,\u201d says Staley. \u201cBut your paper, your plastics, have a much better endpoint if they\u2019re recycled and recovered rather than going to a waste energy facility because you can turn those materials into products.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/middleeast/dubai-worlds-biggest-waste-to-energy-facility/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_africa_tiwa-savage-water-and-garri-nigeria-spc", "text": "Despite her extraordinary success in Afrobeats music, Tiwa Savage has long harbored a secret aspiration: to pursue a career in acting. \u201cActing, I would say, was my first love before music,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Larry Madowo during a recent interview in Lagos. At 44, the multifaceted, award-winning Nigerian artist has transformed her dreams into reality. On May 10, her much-anticipated debut film, \u201cWater & Garri,\u201d hit Prime Video, marking her leap into acting. Executive produced by Savage and directed by her long-time music video director Meji Alabi, \u201cWater & Garri\u201d is a collaboration between Everything Savage, Unbound Studios, and JM Films. The concept was born from Savage\u2019s idea to create a visual album for her 2021 EP of the same name. Because of that, it \u201cinitially it was only supposed to be like a short film,\u201d Savage said, \u201cand then it grew on its own and took its own identity.\u201d Written by Comfort Emmanuel, the film is set in a fictional town on the Cape Coast of Ghana and follows a determined fashion designer named Aisha (Savage) who returns to her hometown due to a family tragedy after a decade in the US. However, upon her return home, she finds her once familiar surroundings altered by escalating violence and heightened tensions. As she reconnects with her family, old friends, and a former flame, Aisha must confront her past and face the guilt of what she left behind \u2013 an experience Savage says drew parallels to her own life. \u201cWe both felt like we had to go somewhere to chase our dreams,\u201d said Savage, who spent two weeks in intensive training in London to prepare for the role of Aisha. \u201cIt was just to break me out of my shell, to break me out of Tiwa Savage and just empty me out \u2013 and then just allow me to be or embody like a whole different character,\u201d she added. Experimenting with a new sound As the production of the film pressed forward, Savage didn\u2019t only shed her superstar persona, she moved on from the initial musical inspiration for the film, instead opting to create an original soundtrack for the movie. \u201cIt was supposed to include the first five songs on the EP; by the time we finished filming, it just took on a whole different identity, and we just created a whole new soundtrack,\u201d the singer explained. The album served as a platform for Savage to push her vocal boundaries and delve into new musical genres. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been boxed to a certain sound because I\u2019ve done it for over 10 years,\u201d Savage said. The 10-song soundtrack included collaborations with French Nigerian singer Asa on the folk song \u201cEmotions,\u201d\u00a0American gospel artist Zacardi Cortez on \u201cI Need You,\u201d and Richard Bona & The Cavemen on the jazz track \u201cWater & Garri.\u201d \u201cCreating the soundtrack allowed me to explore those different genres, and I think I didn\u2019t feel like I would have been able to do that as Tiwa Savage,\u201d she said. \u201c(So) I was able to explore those pockets of my talent.\u201d \u00a0 The singer admits she has always loved Jazz, R&B, and gospel music, but after acting in \u201cWater & Garri\u201d and performing the soundtrack, she says has discovered how much she has grown as an artist and feels encouraged to be limitless in her creativity. \u201cI\u2019m not limiting myself to the sound that people know me for; I\u2019ve definitely grown even in a performance \u2013 like I used to have a lot of dances and do routines,\u201d the singer-turned-actress explained. \u201cNow I think I\u2019m more about vocal delivery,\u201d she added. \u201cGoing forward from that \u2026 I feel like I can do anything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/africa/tiwa-savage-water-and-garri-nigeria-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Abinader\u2019s\u00a0government\u00a0has shown a commitment to addressing long-standing challenges\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0energy\u00a0sector.\u00a0But the World Bank says\u00a0the Dominican Republic\u00a0has more work to do\u00a0in\u00a0increasing transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the sector; continuing with the diversification of\u00a0the energy matrix among others. \u201cAbinader has a first rate and well-coordinated economic team,\u201d says economist and former\u00a0Dominican\u00a0ambassador to the US, Bernardo Vega.\u00a0But\u00a0Vega\u00a0notes that\u00a0increased\u00a0losses in the electric distribution system\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and\u00a0a resulting\u00a0increase in\u00a0external\u00a0debt\u00a0\u2013\u00a0have not\u00a0reflected well on his administration. Abinader\u2019s handling of\u00a0a spiraling\u00a0political and social crisis\u00a0in\u00a0neighboring Haiti\u00a0has also had mixed reviews.\u00a0For\u00a0voters living close to the border, the question of whether measures like deportations and closing the country\u2019s border to Haiti have been effective in insulating the Dominican Republic from shocks in Port-au-Prince will be top of mind, according to political analyst Rosario Espinal. During his\u00a02020\u00a0campaign run,\u00a0Abinader\u00a0promised to fight corruption, and later appointed what he described as\u00a0the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0\u201cfirst independent\u201d\u00a0\u00a0attorney\u00a0general. \u00a0Critics\u00a0argue that his administration\u2019s anti-corruption push\u00a0focused\u00a0disproportionately on members of the Dominican Liberation Party,\u00a0which held power for many years\u00a0before Abinader\u2019s election. Nevertheless, experts say the crackdown on corruption, along with his handling of the pandemic, are widely seen as achievements. Former President Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez seeks re-election \u2013 for the fourth time A familiar face to voters will be Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez, 70, who has already held the Dominican presidency three times: from 1996 to 2000, from 2004 to 2008 and from 2008 to 2012. Fernandez is most known\u00a0modernizing the Dominican Republic\u2019s\u00a0state institutions and justice system, including the constitutional reform that led to the 2010 Constitution, according to experts. One of his major contributions was during his first term when Fernandez privatized the energy distribution sector and\u00a0sold shares to private investors in the\u00a0electricity\u00a0companies that until then\u00a0had been\u00a0owned by the government,\u00a0according to\u00a0Vega. The ex-president is also recognized\u00a0in the Dominican Republic\u00a0for\u00a0advancing and building national\u00a0infrastructure,\u00a0such as\u00a0the subway system\u00a0that\u00a0transformed the capital city of Santo Domingo.\u00a0As a result,\u00a0Fernandez\u2019s presidencies\u00a0had\u00a0a\u00a0major impact on tourism in the eastern region, experts\u00a0say. But many voters will also likely remember that government corruption ran high during\u00a0his 12 years as head of state, Vega\u00a0says. Today,\u00a0Fernandez\u00a0heads the ticket of the\u00a0Force of the People\u00a0party, which he founded in November 2019 after losing the party primaries of his former party, the Dominican Liberation Party. Recently, Fernandez has promised to push forth public policies aimed at reducing poverty, the construction of decent homes, better education, comprehensive health, and citizen security, among others. His\u00a0platform has focused on inequality in the country, with \u201ccalls for wealth redistribution and social justice,\u201d according to Americas Quarterly. The five-time presidential candidate has also reportedly said he would back a new United Nations peacekeeping mission to Haiti. Abel Mart\u00ednez: From prosecutor, deputy, mayor to trying to win the presidency Abel Mart\u00ednez, 51, is a Dominican politician, educator and lawyer with a wide-spanning career in public service. Most recently the mayor of Santiago until last month, Martinez got his start as deputy prosecutor in capital city Santo Domingo, and then as a prosecutor in Santiago in the 1990s. He later became a deputy to the country\u2019s National Congress, serving three terms from 2002 to 2016 and presiding over the Chamber of Deputies for six years. Martinez is focused on heightening tech across multiple sectors, per Americas Quarterly,\u00a0as well as strengthening\u00a0the country\u2019s prison system and surveillance at the border with Haiti. Martinez is focused on ending hunger and poverty, better education for students and teachers, and fighting\u00a0crime and citizen safety. The youngest candidate running for president\u00a0also campaigns\u00a0against illegal immigration, especially of Haitians. Crime and safety and inflation on the ballot Crime and safety are among the biggest concerns of Dominicans\u00a0in this election, according to several surveys, although government data indicates that crime has decreased in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2023, with\u00a0the\u00a0homicide\u00a0rate falling by 30.2%. Since June 2023, the US State Department\u00a0has\u00a0maintained\u00a0a\u00a0Level 2 travel advisory for\u00a0the\u00a0Dominican Republic and recommends tourists exercise increased caution\u00a0due to crime. Pablo Flores resides in Santo Domingo and has his own business, a mini market. At one point, rampant crime forced him to temporarily shutter the business, he recalls. Today, for fear of being robbed, he has taken his own precautions; a fence protects the entire perimeter of his small business. \u201cIf I don\u2019t take care of myself, who is going to take care of me? Crime must go down because it\u2019s very high,\u201d says Flores. Hand-in-hand with street crime are the Dominican Republic\u2019s economic woes. According to\u00a0the World Bank, over the last two decades, the Dominican Republic has been one of the fastest-growing economies in Caribbean. Yet the drivers of this exceptional growth\u00a0appear to be\u00a0reaching their limit due to low productivity growth in recent years, insufficient human capital to meet the needs of the business sector, climate change-related disasters, and distortions in key markets, including the inefficient allocation of tax exemptions,\u00a0according to\u00a0the World Bank. And while the\u00a0Dominican economy grew by 4.9% last year,\u00a0high inflation rates in\u00a0both\u00a02022\u00a0(8.8%)\u00a0and 2023 (4.8%)\u00a0have taken a toll on the population\u2019s quality of life. Yoely Escarlante, a mechanic, says he is struggling to support his four children, and keeps his small workshop in Santo Domingo open rain or shine. There are days when he can earn up to $100 (between 5,000 and 6,000 Dominican pesos) in a day, according to his calculations. But some days, he doesn\u2019t earn a dime, he says. The economic situation is also of great concern for Ney Segura, a public transportation driver. \u201cThe money just doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0says. In his view, \u201cthe poor are poorer.\u201d More than 40% of Dominicans are economically vulnerable and are at risk of falling into poverty due to climate-related impacts and economic crises, according to the World Bank. Likewise, gender gaps in jobs and wages, shorter working lives, and higher unemployment and unpaid roles contribute to increased poverty among women in particular, it says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/americas/dominican-republic-election-explainer-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Lucero L\u00f3pez Maza, the mayoral candidate for the municipality of La Concordia, was killed in the attack, which, according to preliminary investigations, was a confrontation between armed civilians. Two other people were injured, the Attorney General\u2019s Office of Chiapas said. This comes as political violence has spiked across the country as Mexico heads toward its largest election in history on June 2. The Attorney General\u2019s Office said three of the victims, one of whom was a minor, were women, and three men. All died from gunshot wounds. The investigation is ongoing as police search for the identities and whereabouts of the perpetrators. IEPC condemned the attack, saying, \u201cthat events of this nature generate fear and uncertainty among citizens\u201d and risked discouraging people from participating in the upcoming election. Since the electoral process officially began in September 2023, an average of at least two people a day have suffered some type of political violence, according to private consulting firm Integralia. The official government figures are lower. Violence has been on the rise in the southern state, which borders Guatemala, as cartels fight for control of lucrative routes for migrant and drug smuggling routes. Earlier this week, eleven people were killed in mass shootings in the neighboring municipality of Chicomuselo, the state prosecutor said. The Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel have been engaged in a turf war in the area, with hundreds forced to flee their homes in January. Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador acknowledged that the region has been dealing with violent clashes recently, but claimed that the problem was being sensationalized. \u201cIt is very unfortunate but there is\u00a0a lot of profit made from murders and human pain.

{"id": "2024_05_17_europe_russia-ukrainian-captives-human-shields-intl-hnk", "text": "Russian forces have captured dozens of civilians in the border town of Vovchansk, a Ukrainian official has said, with a top regional police officer accusing them of using the captives as \u201chuman shields.\u201d Moscow has ramped up its offensive in northern Ukraine. Last week it\u00a0launched its most surprising operation in two years of war, crossing the northern border in renewed attempts to take Kharkiv, the country\u2019s second most populous city. Vovchansk, in the northern Kharkiv region, has faced an onslaught, with Russian forces claiming to control surrounding villages, forcing civilians to flee. The\u00a0cross-border attack came in a difficult month for Kyiv and marked another example of what\u2019s going wrong for the Ukrainians this year. Their forces are thinly stretched, with much less artillery than the Russians, grossly inadequate air defenses and above all a lack of soldiers. Their plight has been worsened by dry weather, allowing Russian mechanized units to move more easily. The deputy head of Ukrainian Defense Intelligence, Major-General Vadym Skibitsky, told the Economist last week: \u201cOur problem is very simple: we have no weapons. They always knew April and May would be a difficult time for us.\u201d Several analysts expect the Russians to broaden the border attacks westwards to Sumy region, which has seen months of raids by Russian special forces. In effect, the Russians have the manpower to stretch Ukrainian defenses through multiple points of attack hundreds of kilometers apart, forcing Kyiv to guess where\u00a0and when\u00a0an anticipated early-summer offensive will focus. Serhii Bolvinov, head of the investigative department of the Kharkiv regional police, told public broadcaster Suspilne News on Friday that Russian soldiers had kept about 40 civilians in a basement, near their \u201ccommand headquarters.\u201d The people are being interrogated, and \u201cthose conducting the interrogations call themselves FSB employees,\u201d Bolvinov said, referring to Russia\u2019s domestic security agency,\u00a0adding that the captives are being used as \u201chuman shields.\u201d He said the captives were mostly elderly people who \u201cdidn\u2019t want to evacuate until the very end\u201d and were captured when they finally decided to leave for Ukrainian-controlled territory. Bolvinov said an elderly Vovchansk resident was killed by Russian soldiers after refusing to obey their orders and trying to escape on foot. The details came a day after Ukraine\u2019s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko\u00a0said Russians are taking civilians captive in northern Vovchansk. \u201cWe know of the first cases of executions of civilians by the Russian military,\u201d Klymenko said on his Telegram channel, adding: \u201cIn particular, one of the residents of Vovchansk tried to escape on foot, refused to obey the commands of the invaders - the Russians killed him.\u201d Police investigators had opened a criminal case on the grounds of violations of rules of war, he said, adding that evacuations were underway in that area until Thursday. CNN is unable to independently verify\u00a0Bolvinov\u2019s claims and has contacted the Russian Defense Ministry for comment. Russia has not commented on its troops using civilians as human shields or targeting those trying to evacuate. Russian forces launched airstrikes on Kharkiv Friday, killing at least three people and injuring 28, mayor Ihor Terekhov said in a Telegram post. Oleh Syniehubov, head of Kharkiv regional military administration, said in a Telegram post on Friday that the district was hit twice by guided aerial bombs. Nearly 10,000 people have beeen evacuated in the Kharkiv region due to Russia\u2019s renewed offensive, the head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, Oleh Syniehubov, said in a Telegram update on Saturday morning. The evacuations took place over seven days following Russia\u2019s surprise cross-border offensive into northern Ukraine, which began on the morning of May 10. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky last week postponed all upcoming international visits as the country grapples with the new offensive. In an interview with news agency AFP aired on Friday, Zelensky\u00a0said the Russian offensive in Kharkiv region is \u201cnot stabilized, it is controlled.\u201d He said Ukrainian forces are controlling Russian troops\u2019 entry routes into the region but that the Russian operation continues. He also said there may be several waves of Russian attacks on the region, and emphasized the need for Patriot missile systems to push Russian troops out of Kharkiv.

{"id": "2024_05_19_style_isabella-gardner-heist-facts", "text": "Most art galleries and museums are famous for the art they contain. London\u2019s National Gallery has Van Gogh\u2019s \u201cSunflowers\u201d; \u201cThe Starry Night\u201d meanwhile, is held at The Museum of Modern Art in New York, in good company alongside Salvador Dal\u00ec\u2019s melting clocks, Andy Warhol\u2019s soup cans and Frida Kahlo\u2019s self-portrait. The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, however, is now more famous for the artwork that is not there, or at least, that is no longer there. On March 18 1990 the museum fell prey to history\u2019s biggest art heist. Thirteen works of art estimated to be worth over half a billion dollars \u2014 including three Rembrandts and a Vermeer \u2014 were stolen in the middle of the night, while the two security guards sat in the basement bound in duct tape. A new episode of CNN\u2019s \u201cHow It Really Happened\u201d airing Sunday 19 May at 9P ET/ PT features an interview with one of those guards: Rick Abath, who gave his only TV interview to CNN in 2013, and who died in February 2024 aged 57. The robbery is a treasure trove of surprising facts and unexpected plot twists. Here are five things that make the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and its famous theft, so interesting. The woman behind the building Isabella Stewart Gardner, the museum\u2019s founder and namesake, is a fascinating character. The daughter and eventual widow of two successful businessmen, Gardner was a philanthropist and art collector who built the museum to house her stash. \u201cWhen she opened the museum in 1903 she mandated that it be free of charge, to gain the appreciation and the attendance of all of Boston,\u201d Stephan Kurkjian, author of \u201cMaster Thieves: The Boston Gangsters Who Pulled Off the World\u2019s Greatest Art Heist\u201d, told CNN in the programme. \u201cHer museum, at that point in time, was the largest collection of art by a private individual in America.\u201d Gardner also had links to the fledgling campaign for women\u2019s political rights. The museum displays the photographs and letters of her friend Julia Ward Howe, an organizer of two US suffrage societies, and a print of Ethel Smyth, a composer and close friend of the English Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst. Gardner met Smyth through their mutual friend, the painter John Singer Sargent, whose portrait of Gardener raised eyebrows for the low-cut neckline he gave her. Gardner seemed to enjoy flirting with scandal and gossip: she once arrived at a Boston Symphony Orchestra performance in a hat band emblazoned with the name of her favorite baseball team, Red Sox, and an illustration in a January 1897 edition of the Boston Globe showed her apparently taking one of Boston Zoo\u2019s lions for a walk. Somewhat ironically, when the Mona Lisa was stolen in 1911, Gardner told her museum guards that, if they saw anyone trying to rob them, they should shoot to kill. The art not taken The thieves\u2019 loot is estimated to be worth over half a billion dollars. However, they left the building\u2019s most expensive artifact: \u201cThe Rape of Europa\u201d by Titian, which Gardner bought from a London art gallery in 1896, then a record price for an old master painting. Why commit history\u2019s greatest art heist and leave without the priciest piece in the museum? Well, size may have played a role. The largest artwork taken was Rembrandt\u2019s \u201cChrist in the Storm on the Sea of Galilee,\u201d famous for being Rembrandt\u2019s only seascape and measures roughly 5x4 feet. \u201cThe Rape of Europa,\u201d meanwhile, is larger, at nearly 6x7 feet. The Napoleon factor Around 2005, the investigation into the stolen artworks took a detour to the French island of Corsica in the Meditteranean Sea. Two Frenchmen with alleged ties to the Corsican mob were trying to sell two paintings: a Rembrandt and a Vermeer. Former FBI Special Agent Bob Wittman was involved in a sting to try and buy them \u2014 but the operation eventually fell apart when the men were arrested for selling art taken from the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Nice instead. Why would \u201cCorsican mobsters,\u201d as CNN correspondent Randi Kaye described them in the programme, be interested in robbing a Boston art museum? The answer could lie in the Bronze Eagle Finial, the 10-inch ornament stolen from the top of a Napoleonic flag during the heist. \u201cIt was sort of an odd choice for the thieves to take (the Finial),\u201d Kaye said, \u201cbut it turns out that Corsica is essentially the homeland of Napoleon.\u201d The French emperor was born on the island in 1769, and a national museum is now housed in his former family home. \u201cIt is a very compelling notion,\u201d Kelly Horan, Deputy Editor of the Boston Globe, said in the programme, \u201cthat a Corsican band of gangsters might have tried to steal back their flag and pull off the entire rest of the heist in the process.\u201d A rock\u2019n\u2019roll suspect March 18 1990 was not the first time a Rembrandt had been stolen from a Boston museum. In 1975, career criminal and art thief Myles Connor walked into Boston\u2019s Museum of Fine Arts, and walked out with a Rembrandt tucked into his oversized coat pocket. He was the FBI\u2019s first suspect in the Gardner case, however the walls of federal prison \u2014 where he was incarcerated on drugs charges \u2014 gave him a pretty solid alibi. When he wasn\u2019t lifting famous artworks from their displays, Connor was a musician. It was through gigging that he met Al Dotoli, who worked with stars including Frank Sinatra and Liza Minelli. In 1976 Connor was jailed for a separate art theft committed in Maine. Hoping to use his stolen Rembrandt to leverage a lesser sentence, he needed Dotoli \u2014 who was on tour with Dionne Warwick \u2014 to turn the painting in to the authorities on his behalf. An invisible thief? One of the stolen artworks, \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s \u201cChez Tortoni,\u201d was taken from the museum\u2019s Blue Room on the first floor. The painting stands out for two reasons, the first being its frame. The thieves left almost all of the frames behind, cutting some out of the front. \u201cTo even leave remnants of the painting(s) behind was savage,\u201d Horan said. \u201cIn my mind, it\u2019s sort of like slashing someone\u2019s throat.\u201d The \u201cChez Tortoni\u201d frame was unusual for where it was left, though: not in the room it was stolen from, but in the chair of the security office downstairs. Even more remarkable, not a single motion detector was set off in the Blue Room. Bar investigating the possibility of ghost robbers, investigators wondered if this pointed to the plot being an inside job. \u201cAt the FBI we found that about 89% of museum institutional heists are inside jobs,\u201d Wittman said. \u201cThat\u2019s how these things get stolen.\u201d How It Really Happened\u2019s \u201cGardner Art Heist: Stealing Beauty\u201d premieres on CNN Sunday 19 May, at 9pm ET/PT.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/style/isabella-gardner-heist-facts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_asia_new-caledonia-violence-france-vote-intl-hnk", "text": "The French government has declared a state of emergency in its South Pacific island territory of New Caledonia after deadly violence erupted for a third day Wednesday, with armed clashes between protesters, militias and police, and buildings and cars set on fire in the capital. At least four people have died in the unrest, which is considered the worst since the 1980s. In the capital Noumea, authorities have imposed a curfew and closed the main airport \u2014 usually a busy tourist hub \u2014 to commercial traffic. They have also banned public gatherings, carrying weapons and selling alcohol. The violence is the latest outburst of political tensions that have simmered for years and pitted the island\u2019s largely pro-independence indigenous Kanak communities \u2014 who have long chafed against rule by Paris \u2013 against French inhabitants opposed to breaking ties with their motherland. Protests began Monday involving mostly young people, in response to the tabling of a vote 10,000 miles (17,000 kilometers) away in the French parliament proposing changes to New Caledonia\u2019s constitution that would give greater voting rights to French residents living on the islands. On Tuesday, legislators voted\u00a0overwhelmingly\u00a0in favor of the change. \u201cThe last two days we\u2019ve seen violence of a scale we haven\u2019t seen for 30 years in New Caledonia,\u201d Denise Fisher, a former\u00a0Australian Consul-General in New Caledonia, told CNN. \u201cIt is kind of marking the end of 30 years of peace.\u201d \u201cThe Kanak people are objecting to [the vote in France] not just because it\u2019s been decided in Paris without them but also they feel that they want it to be part of a negotiation \u2026 which would include another self determination vote and a range of other things.\u201d The proposed changes to the constitution would add thousands of extra voters to New Caledonia\u2019s electoral rolls, which have not been updated since the late 1990s. Pro-independence groups say the changes are an attempt by France to consolidate its rule over the archipelago. France\u2019s interior ministry told CNN that 1,800 police officers and gendarmes are already present in New Caledonia and 500 additional police will arrive in the coming hours. The state of emergency will allow authorities to impose restrictions on movement and carry out house arrests and searches. A spokesperson for the French government said the measures were needed to \u201cdeal with the serious breaches of public order which are occurring.\u201d Lying in the South Pacific with Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu for neighbors, New Caledonia is a semiautonomous French territory \u2014 one of a dozen scattered throughout the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm, issuing a letter Wednesday to New Caledonian political leaders urging them to \u201cunambiguously condemn all this violence\u201d and inviting both pro- and anti-independence leaders to meet him \u201cface to face\u201d in Paris. Macron\u2019s administration has pushed for a pivot to the Indo-Pacific, stressing that France is a Pacific power, as China and the United States beef up their presence amid a battle for influence in the strategically important region. New Caledonia is at the center of that plan. \u201cThe stakes are high for France,\u201d Fisher added. \u201cFrance has identified an entire Indo-Pacific vision for itself.\u201d \u201cThe legitimacy of France\u2019s participation this way, having an influence in this way, is in question when you have scenes like this.\u201d The violence Three people - two men and a woman, all indigenous Kanaks - have been shot dead in the violent protests and looting, according to Charles Wea, spokesperson for\u00a0Louis Mapou, President of the Government of New Caledonia. A French police officer who was injured by gunfire in the riots also died, French interior minister\u00a0G\u00e9rald Darmanin said. Demonstrators have also set fire to buildings and cars in Noumea, defying a curfew that has been extended to Thursday. Thick plumes of black smoke covered the capital on Wednesday morning, social media video showed. Images showed burned-out cars, fires in the street, and shops vandalized and looted. \u201cSome are equipped with hunting rifles with buckshot as ammunition. Others were equipped with larger rifles, firing bullets,\u201d the French High commissioner to New Caledonia Louis Le Franc said. More than 140 people have been arrested, while at least 60 security personnel have been injured in the clashes between local nationalist groups and the French authorities, according to Le Franc. One Noumea resident told CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand of panic buying reminiscent of Covid-19. \u201cA lot of fire, violence\u2026but it\u2019s better I stay safe at home. There are a lot of police and army. I want the government to put the action for the peace,\u201d the person told RNZ, asking to remain anonymous. The vote Colonial France took control of New Caledonia in 1853. White settlement followed and the indigenous Kanak people were longtime victims of harsh segregation policies. Many indigenous inhabitants continue to live with high rates of poverty and high unemployment to this day. Deadly violence exploded in the 1980s eventually paving the way towards the Noumea Accord in 1998, a promise by France to give greater political autonomy to the Kanak community. Multiple referendums were held in recent years - in 2018, 2020 and 2021 - as part of the agreement offering voters in New Caledonia the option to secede from France. Each referendum was voted down, but the process was marred by boycotts from pro-independence groups and by Covid-19. Voter roles have been frozen since the Noumea Accord, the issue that France\u2019s parliament was seeking to address in the vote that sparked this week\u2019s violence. French lawmakers in Paris voted 351 \u2013 153 in favor of changing the constitution to \u201cunfreeze\u201d the territory\u2019s electoral rolls, enfranchising French residents who have been in New Caledonia for 10 years. The lists were frozen by the French government to appease pro-independence Kanak nationalists who believe new arrivals to the former colony, including from France, dilute popular support for independence. Both houses of France\u2019s parliament need to approve the constitutional change passed by the National Assembly. On Tuesday, French Prime Minister Gabriel\u00a0Attal said the government would not call a meeting of the parliament to vote on the motion before talks with Kanak leaders, including major independence alliance the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS). \u201cI invite New Caledonia\u2019s political leaders to seize this opportunity and come to Paris for talks in the coming weeks.

The US secretary of state made a surprise appearance on stage in a bar in Kyiv, as he appeared alongside Ukrainian band 19.99 in a rendition of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin\u2019 in the Free World.\u201d Blinken, who played guitar with the punk/jazz band and even joined in on vocals, arrived in the Ukrainian capital on Tuesday for a surprise trip, in which he met with President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss battlefield updates and the importance of newly arrived US aid. The visit is the first by a Biden administration official since the long-delayed passage of US supplemental funding to the war-torn country. Perhaps even more of a surprise, however, was his appearance at Barman Dictat on Tuesday evening, a popular underground cocktail bar and music venue just off Kyiv\u2019s main street, Khreshchatyk. The bar, which has heavy metal doors and metal reinforcements along the walls, is popular with war veterans and soldiers on leave. In a personal address from the stage, Blinken said: \u201cThe United States is with you, so much of the world is with you. And they\u2019re fighting, not just for Ukraine but for the free world \u2013 and the free world is with you too.\u201d The venue posted about the unusual performance on its Instagram page, captioning it: \u201cKeep on rocking on a free world! Thanks @secblinken.\u201d The song was released by Neil Young in 1989 \u2013 the year the Berlin Wall fell \u2013 on his album entitled \u201cFreedom.\u201d Although Blinken did not share the footage \u2013 or even reference the event \u2013 on his social media, his profile describes him as a \u201c(very) amateur guitarist.\u201d Blinken is not the first US politician to show off his musical talents in a European music venue. Former President Bill Clinton played saxophone at the Reduta Jazz Club in Prague in 1994, after the fall of the Iron Curtain \u2013 and returned there to play again earlier this year. In an interview with BBC Radio\u2019s\u00a0\u201dToday\u201d\u00a0show on Wednesday morning, Arsen Gorbach, the band\u2019s guitarist, said the choice of song had been made by Blinken. \u201cI think it\u2019s a special song for him,\u201d said Gorbach, who added that he had previously seen videos of the secretary of state playing the rock anthem online. He told the BBC that the band had earlier received a message that suggested they would be playing with Neil Young himself. Gorbach said the band had been \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the rock star did not show up, but he admitted that Blinken was \u201cvery good\u201d and that it felt like they had played together as a band for \u201cmany years.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/europe/blinken-rockin-free-world-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_18_world_britains-election-mudslinging-gbr-intl", "text": "When British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak addressed the nation on Monday, he seemed tetchy and tired. His speech, ostensibly about national security and the threats facing Britain, was a wide-ranging attack on his chief political opponent Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party. Sunak said that \u201cthe next few years will be some of the most dangerous yet most transformational our country has ever known,\u201d outlining the risks posed by foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and North Korea, and the rise of new technologies like artificial intelligence. The key point Sunak wanted to hammer home was that the UK was entering a perilous period and the Labour Party \u2013 including Starmer himself \u2013 cannot be trusted to keep the nation safe. His evidence ranged from commitments on defense spending to the views of the previous Labour leader. The PM\u00a0pointed out\u00a0that Starmer served in the shadow cabinet of\u00a0his\u00a0predecessor,\u00a0Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn historically had called for the scrapping of Britain\u2019s nuclear weapons and been a critic of NATO. He lost two general elections as Labour leader in campaigns that focused heavily on his views regarding national security. Starmer has since expelled Corbyn from the party over an antisemitism scandal. However, his association with the former leader is still damaging. Sunak has also talked at length about Starmer\u2019s previous life as a lawyer. Starmer, who was\u00a0director of\u00a0public\u00a0prosecutions\u00a0and a leading human rights lawyer, has defended terror suspects and worked to block the deportation of foreign criminals. It is worth noting that in some cases, lawyers do not get to choose who they represent. The context for Sunak\u2019s attack on Starmer is that the UK will vote in a general election at some point this year. Sunak has yet to announce exactly when that will happen, probably because as things stand he trails Starmer in the polls by double digits. Nothing Sunak does seems to shift\u00a0those numbers.\ufeff He recently suffered humbling losses at local elections and a high-profile defection of an MP to the Labour Party. Conservative sources say that no one believes Sunak can turn things around, but that attacks on Starmer over national security are the only thing that seems to resonate with voters. \u201cOf course Rishi doesn\u2019t believe that Starmer himself is a threat to national security,\u201d a senior Conservative told CNN. \u201cBut it is fair to point out that he supported Jeremy Corbyn, who many people do believe would have been dangerous in government. And those elements of the Labour Party do still exist, however ruthless Starmer has been in shutting them down.\u201d David Gauke, a former Conservative Cabinet Minister, says the challenge facing Sunak is that after 14 years in government, it is possible to blame the Conservative Party for everything that is wrong with the country. \u201cMaking the election a binary choice about security \u2013 who can you really trust to keep you safe \u2013 is much better for Sunak than a referendum on the past 14 years. The best way to do that is sustained attacks on Starmer\u2019s vulnerabilities,\u201d Gauke\u00a0said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have many vulnerabilities, but the Corbyn association is real and still resonates with voters somewhat. I suspect the attacks will get more personal the closer we get to the election.\u201d The other issue that does seem to cut through with voters is Starmer\u2019s legal work defending terrorists and terror suspects. The most high-profile example of this is when he gave legal advice to the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir in 2008 as they tried to overturn the German government\u2019s decision to ban their activities. The group was proscribed as a terrorist organization in the UK in January after members were seen chanting \u201cJihad\u201d at a pro-Gaza demonstration. Sunak took the opportunity to attack Starmer, saying at the time: \u201cI know that he does not like talking about them because they have been a client, but when I see a group chanting \u2018jihad\u2019 on our streets, I ban them; he invoices them.\u201d Starmer told a British newspaper in March:\u00a0\u201cIn the legal world, particularly if you\u2019re doing criminal law, you represent people you don\u2019t agree with. You know how it works in our legal system \u2013 it is very important that everybody is represented.\u201d He also said: \u201cI was chief prosecutor for five years. I prosecuted with my team nearly a million cases a year, including terrorists, murderers and drug dealers.\u201d However tame all this might sound written down, it is extraordinary that the\u00a0prime\u00a0minister is accusing the person most likely to succeed him of being a terrorist sympathizer who cannot be trusted with national security. It is remarkable that the legal career of Britain\u2019s former chief prosecutor \u2013 for which he received a Knighthood \u2013 is being used as evidence that he is soft on terrorists. However, politics, as the saying goes, is a contact sport. Conservative campaigners are quick to say that Starmer made a virtue of his legal career, so it\u2019s fair game. They say that he cynically stood by Corbyn, knowing exactly who Corbyn was and what he stood for. Labour are expecting worse to come but are thinking strategically about fighting fire with fire. \u201cWe know they cannot stand on their appalling record in government, so are going to say increasingly ridiculous things to cut through,\u201d an adviser to Starmer told CNN. \u201cWe will hit back at Sunak, but will have to be careful at how we do it. The public are sick of politics as a game we we will avoid being negative,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cYou might see more directly aimed at the PM, but it won\u2019t always have our paw prints on it.\u201d This is where Sunak\u2019s all-out attack strategy risks backfiring. People across the political spectrum have noticed he is looking increasingly tetchy when questioned in public. A supporter of Sunak said: \u201cHe is working very hard and everything is still going wrong. He is just not used to that.\u201d A Labour source said: \u201cHe cannot handle us making fun of him when he says ridiculous things. Like when he says he is the right man for new ideas and change, like he hasn\u2019t been a senior politician for years. It\u2019s just ridiculous and it clearly winds him up when we point it out.\u201d No one knows for sure when the election campaign proper will start. Until then, Britain is braced for months of mudslinging between Sunak and Starmer. It might all be moderately entertaining for people who like this sort of thing, but it\u2019s unclear how a bitter and nasty election campaign helps a country that has felt in limbo and horribly divided for the best part of three years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/world/britains-election-mudslinging-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_asia_lai-chingte-taiwan-president-inauguration-intl-hnk", "text": "Lai Ching-te was sworn in as Taiwan\u2019s president Monday, marking the start of a historic third consecutive term for the island\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has championed democracy in the face of years of growing threats\u00a0from authoritarian China. Lai, 64, a former doctor, was voted into office earlier this year alongside new Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, who recently served as Taiwan\u2019s top envoy to the United States. Both leaders and their party are openly loathed by Beijing for championing Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says the self-ruling democracy is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary. Lai takes up the mantle from DPP predecessor Tsai Ing-wen, who bolstered the island international standing and recognition during her eight years in office. In his inauguration speech later Monday, Lai is expected to emphasize that he will build on the foundations achieved by Tsai \u2013 the island\u2019s first female leader \u2013 according to a memo obtained by CNN. He is also expected to project goodwill to China with a message of pursuing peace and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait. Lai emerged victorious over rivals in the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party and the Taiwan People\u2019s Party in a January election, which was fought over a mixture of livelihood issues as well as the thorny question of how to deal with its giant one-party state neighbor, China, which under leader Xi Jinping has grown more powerful and bellicose. Voters shrugging off warnings from Beijing that the DPP\u2019s re-election would increase the risk of conflict. The DPP holds the view that Taiwan is a de facto sovereign nation that should bolster defenses against China\u2019s threats and deepen relations with fellow democratic countries, even if that means economic punishment or military intimidation by Beijing. Lai himself has championed this view \u2013 calling his win a \u201cvictory for the community of democracies\u201d after the election results were announced. A soft-spoken political veteran, Lai hails from a more radical wing of the DPP, and was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence \u2013 a red line for Beijing. Though his views have tempered since then, China never forgave him for his comments from six years ago, in which he described himself as a \u201cpractical worker for Taiwan independence.\u201d In the lead-up to the election, Chinese officials repeatedly framed the vote as a choice between \u201cpeace and war,\u201d while railing against Lai for inciting conflict. Lai now says he favors the current status quo, proclaiming that \u201cTaiwan is already an independent sovereign country\u201d so there is \u201cno plan or need\u201d to declare independence. That deliberately nuanced stance mimics his outgoing predecessor Tsai, Taiwan\u2019s first female president, who was unable to stand again because of term limits. Under Xi\u2019s strongarm tactics in the twelve years since he rose to power, Taiwan\u2019s public has shifted determinedly away from China. Less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification, and less than 3% identify primarily as Chinese. The majority of Taiwanese want to maintain the current status quo and show no desire to be ruled by Beijing. Meanwhile, Beijing has ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on Taiwan. Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have been at their highest since 1996, when China fired missiles into waters off Taiwan\u2019s coast to intimidate voters ahead of the island\u2019s first free presidential election \u2013 after the nascent democracy emerged from decades of its own authoritarian rule. As Lai formally takes office, official communication between Beijing and Taipei, cut since Tsai took office,\u00a0is unlikely to resume \u2013 with China repeatedly rebuking his offer for talks and denouncing him as a dangerous separatist.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/asia/lai-chingte-taiwan-president-inauguration-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end.

Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_17_middleeast_gaza-floating-pier-aid-trucks-intl-hnk", "text": "Trucks carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza have begun moving ashore after arriving through the floating pier built by the US military, according to the US Central Command (CENTCOM). The pier was anchored to a beach in Gaza on Thursday and will be used to funnel aid from various countries into the besieged strip, with most border crossings to the enclave closed and a catastrophic humanitarian disaster unfolding inside. No US troops went ashore in Gaza, according to CENTCOM. The goal is to get about 500 tons of humanitarian assistance into Gaza through the pier daily, according to Adm. Brad Cooper, the commander of CENTCOM. That means about 90 trucks worth of aid a day, and the goal is to build up to 150 trucks a day. Over 300 pallets of humanitarian aid were delivered to Gaza through a new floating pier installed by the US military, according to a statement from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Saturday. On Friday, the UN humanitarian agency, OCHA, said Gaza was facing a \u201cdire\u201d food situation with barely more than 300 aid trucks entering the strip since Israel began its offensive in Rafah. The maritime corridor is coming at a critical moment \u2013 with the Rafah border crossing to Gaza having been closed for more than a week, preventing aid from getting through. That crossing was the only one between Gaza and Egypt \u2013 with all other border points in the strip controlled by Israel. Here\u2019s what we know about the new aid route: How was the pier built and how will it work? The US began building the floating pier in late April at a cost of $320 million and with the help of some 1,000 US soldiers and sailors. The US said that it is only a temporary measure that is \u201centirely humanitarian in nature.\u201d Pieces for the pier were loaded aboard ships on the East Coast of the US and then \u201ctransported 6,000 miles across the ocean,\u201d according to CENTCOM\u2019s Cooper. The pieces were assembled off the coast of Gaza, with final assembly taking place in the Israeli port of Ashdod. The aid delivered via the pier will go through several steps before reaching Gaza. It will arrive in Cyprus by either air or sea where it will be screened by the US and Israel and palletized before being brought by ship to a floating platform near the Gaza coast. Then it is finally transported to the floating pier and loaded onto trucks to distribute on land. The US has said the pier is not meant to replace aid that enters through land crossings, which aid workers have said are the fastest and easiest way to get relief into the territory. \u201cThis maritime route is additive and is not meant to replace land routes into Gaza,\u201d Cooper said. The UN\u2019s World Food Programme will be responsible for receiving and distributing the aid in Gaza. Why is aid being shipped this way? Most land crossings into Gaza remain either shut or congested due to lengthy inspections by Israel. That has led the US and other countries to start air-dropping aid into Gaza, which human rights organizations have criticized as insufficient. The UN has warned of famine setting in in parts of Gaza, calling on Israel to open more land crossings for aid. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, the top US humanitarian official, has also assessed it is \u201ccredible\u201d that famine is already occurring in parts of Gaza. In March, the first batch of humanitarian aid by sea was delivered in an operation separate from the US pier project. Today, only the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing and the \u201cWestern Erez\u201d Crossing in northern Gaza are open, although the amount of aid trickling through them is nowhere close to what Gaza needs. The UN\u2019s World Food Programme however says that since May 6, when Israel launched its Rafah operation, the organization has been unable to access and receive aid from the Kerem Shalom crossing. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees\u00a0(UNRWA) said the crossing was closed between May 6-10. The Rafah crossing with Egypt, the entry point for nearly a quarter of all aid into Gaza, was also closed last week after Israel seized it as part of a ground offensive into the city, and is yet to reopen. How much aid is getting into Gaza now? The US State Department has said that \u201cnot nearly enough\u201d trucks are getting into Gaza. The UN estimates that 500 trucks are needed per day to alleviate the suffering of Gazans, but on May 11, UN figures showed that only six trucks entered. No data is available after that date. The UN agency stressed that more aid should be allowed to pass through checkpoints and enter Gaza by land. \u201cAny and all aid into Gaza is welcome by any route. However, getting aid to people in need, into and across Gaza, cannot and should not depend on a floating dock,\u201d OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke said Friday. Israel however said on Friday\u00a0that \u201caid is flowing into Gaza by land, sea, and air\u201d and through \u201cmultiple aid routes.\u201d The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli body that coordinates the flow of aid into the strip, said that 365 trucks \u201cwere transferred\u201d to Gaza Thursday. The UN\u2019s OCHA on Thursday said that crossings into Gaza have either been closed, are unsafe to access or not logistically viable. \u201cAid distribution is almost impossible with no regular fuel imports, unstable telecommunication and ongoing fighting,\u201d OCHA said on X. \u201cThe impact is devastating for over 2 million people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/middleeast/gaza-floating-pier-aid-trucks-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_middleeast_egypt-pyramids-nile-river-lost-ahramat-branch-scn", "text": "Egypt\u2019s Great Pyramid and other ancient monuments at Giza exist on an isolated strip of land at the edge of the Sahara Desert. The inhospitable location has long puzzled archaeologists, some of whom had found evidence that the Nile River once flowed near these pyramids in some capacity, facilitating the landmarks\u2019 construction starting 4,700 years ago. Using satellite imaging and analysis of cores of sediment, a new study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment has mapped a 64-kilometer (40-mile) long, dried-up, branch of the Nile, long buried beneath farmland and desert. \u201cEven though many efforts to reconstruct the early Nile waterways have been conducted, they have largely been confined to soil sample collections from small sites, which has led to the mapping of only fragmented sections of the ancient Nile channel systems,\u201d said lead study author Eman Ghoneim, a professor and director of the Space and Drone Remote Sensing Lab at the University of North Carolina Wilmington\u2019s department of Earth and ocean sciences. \u201cThis is the first study to provide the first map of the long-lost ancient branch of the Nile River.\u201d Ghoneim and her colleagues refer to this extinct branch of the Nile river as Ahramat, which is Arabic for pyramids. The ancient waterway would have been about 0.5 kilometers wide (about one-third of a mile) with a depth of at least 25 meters (82 feet) \u2014 similar to the contemporary Nile, Ghoneim said. \u201cThe large size and extended length of the Ahramat Branch and its proximity to the 31 pyramids in the study area strongly suggests a functional waterway of great importance,\u201d Ghoneim said. She said the river would have played a key role in ancient Egyptians\u2019 transportation of the enormous amount of building materials and laborers needed for the pyramids\u2019 construction. \u201cAlso, our research shows that many of the pyramids in the study area have (a) causeway, a ceremonial raised walkway, that runs perpendicular to the course of the Ahramat Branch and terminates directly on its riverbank.\u201d Hidden traces of a lost waterway Traces of the river aren\u2019t visible in aerial photos or in imagery from optical satellites, Ghoneim said. In fact, she only spotted something unexpected while studying radar satellite data of the wider area for ancient rivers and lakes that might reveal a new source of groundwater. \u201cI am a geomorphologist, a paleohydrologist\u00a0looking into landforms. I have this kind of trained eye,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile working with this data, I noticed this really obvious branch or a kind of riverbank, and it didn\u2019t make any sense because it is really far from the Nile,\u201d she added. Born and raised in Egypt, Ghoneim was familiar with the cluster of pyramids in this area and had always wondered why they were built there. She applied to the National Science Foundation to investigate further, and geophysical data taken at ground level with the use of ground-penetrating radar and electromagnetic tomography confirmed it was an ancient arm of the Nile. Two long cores of earth the team extracted using drilling equipment revealed sandy sediment consistent with a river channel at a depth of about 25 meters (82 feet). It\u2019s possible that \u201ccountless\u201d temples might still be buried beneath the agricultural fields and desert sands along the riverbank of the Ahramat Branch, according to the study. Why this branch of the river dried up or disappeared is still unclear. Most likely, a period of drought and desertification swept sand into the region, silting up the river, Ghoneim said. The study demonstrated that when the pyramids were built, the geography and riverscapes of the Nile differed significantly from those of today, said Nick Marriner, a geographer at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris. He was not involved in the study but has conducted research on the fluvial history of Giza. \u201cThe study completes an important part of the past landscape puzzle,\u201d Marriner said. \u201cBy putting together these pieces we can gain a clearer picture of what the Nile floodplain looked like at the time of the pyramid builders and how the ancient Egyptians harnessed their environments to transport building materials for their monumental construction endeavors.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/middleeast/egypt-pyramids-nile-river-lost-ahramat-branch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_russia-surging-on-frontlines-analysis-intl", "text": "The changing language used by the Ukrainian military in 72 hours of daily updates tells the story: \u201cOngoing defensive fighting.\u201d \u201cSignificantly worsened.\u201d Russian \u201ctactical success.\u201d You rarely ever hear Kyiv\u2019s top brass sounding downbeat, but their steep southerly trajectory reflects the grave place Ukraine finds itself in. Russia is not just advancing slowly in one place; it appears to be advancing in four,\u00a0across the frontline. Moscow knows it is on the clock: in about a month, the $61billion of US military aid will start to translate into Ukraine having the weapons it has been begging for. So,\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0seems to be throwing whatever he can at it, knowing the fight will likely\u00a0only\u00a0get tougher for his forces in the summer ahead. First, and most acutely troubling, is the northern border near Kharkiv,\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s second city. Russian forces have crossed the border in multiple locations and claim to have seized nine villages. Their move\u00a03 to 4.5 miles (5 to 7 kilometers)\u00a0into Ukraine, in the border area above Ukraine\u2019s second city of Kharkiv, is arguably their fastest advance since the first days of the war. Russia has thrown five battalions at the border town of Vovchansk, Ukrainian officials said, which has been hit hard by airstrikes over the weekend. The town of Lyptsi is at risk, say some military bloggers,\u00a0and\u00a0from\u00a0there\u00a0Russian forces could hit Kharkiv with artillery. This is a nightmare for Kyiv for two reasons: firstly, they liberated this land from Russian forces 18 months ago, yet failed, clearly, to fortify the area enough to prevent Moscow sweeping\u00a0back\u00a0with the ease\u00a0with which\u00a0they were swept out. And secondly, Russia can again tie up Ukraine\u2019s over-stretched army with constant and grinding pressure on Kharkiv, exacting a toll with crude shelling on a vast urban center. Then there is the rest of the front, where progress in Kharkiv region has been mirrored by old, exhausting fights suddenly seeing new Russian success. This should be the greatest cause for concern to Kyiv, as it suggests a coordinated bid to push in all directions and leave\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0President Volodymyr Zelensky with ugly choices about where to send limited resources, and where ultimately to sacrifice. Moving\u00a0slowly south from Kharkiv, closer to Bakhmut, the town of Chasiv Yar has been under intense pressure \u2013 a valuable height above two key Ukrainian military towns, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, which could prove an exhaustive pressure point over the summer on Kyiv\u2019s supply lines. Netailove and Krasnohorivka slightly\u00a0further\u00a0south show Russian forces making further gains to the west of Avdiivka, and threatening another key hub \u2013 Pokrovsk. If Ukraine begins to fall back further here, its grip on the remnants of Donetsk region could be at risk. And then overnight, Deep State Map, a Ukrainian military analysis group, said the southern village of Verbove was under greater threat \u2013 one of\u00a0the\u00a0minimal gains from Kyiv\u2019s stymied summer counteroffensive\u00a0last year. All across the board, the news is bad: it is a growing calamity. Ukraine\u2019s rhetorical response has been telling.\u00a0Its leaders\u00a0have, for once, openly said how bad it is. They appear to be shuffling commanders around \u2013 which is not something you do in the heat of battle without desperate reason. There is vocal criticism of the failure to prepare and fortify the northern border regions over the past year. Indeed, along much of the front line where there is not active fighting, and in the near-rear to active frontlines, fortifications seem wanting, if not entirely absent. It may be\u00a0that\u00a0Kyiv believed so much in its counteroffensive last summer, that\u00a0it failed to entertain the idea of bad news this summer. Kyiv\u2019s larger problem is global attention. Trenchant statements from European ministers, and even visits from senior Biden\u00a0administration\u00a0officials, cannot cut through the fatigue or the notion that helping Ukraine win is something governments see they strategically must do, rather than something their publics actively demand. It is becoming a war the world wishes would go away \u2013 side-lined by the horrors of the Middle East \u2013 exactly when its outcome is most perilous and vital for European security. Putin used the weekend to reshuffle some of his cabinet \u2013 moving Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to a more procedural role as National Security Council head, and perhaps further away from the wartime cookie jar. An accountant, Andrey Belousov, will take his place. But this is not necessarily a sign of retribution for failure, or a reset: the same old boys still get nice jobs. It smacks more of Moscow economizing, integrating the war more fully into the economy, and settling in for the longer haul. The opposite is happening in the West, where\u00a0the\u00a0congressional dysfunction pausing\u00a0that\u00a0paused\u00a0the US\u2019s $61 billion in aid has already wreaked havoc on Ukraine\u2019s military effort. Its forces\u00a0are losing\u00a0now because of that six-month delay in ammunition\u00a0reaching them. Europe talks big about making up the gap, but it cannot. And Washington DC will now be in a whirlwind of electioneering\u00a0ahead of the US elections in November\u00a0just when Kyiv needs\u00a0American\u00a0certainty most. The news is not just bad, it is worsening daily. The ground on the front lines is drying\u00a0out, bringing us into the season to attack. Russia has momentum unlike anything\u00a0seen\u00a0since March 2022. Ukraine is being forced to admit just how bad\u00a0the\u00a0situation\u00a0is. Much of the world may be tiring of this war, but Putin is not.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/europe/russia-surging-on-frontlines-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_asia_south-korea-space-out-competition-intl-hnk", "text": "More than 100 people gathered silently on yoga mats over the weekend to do absolutely nothing, in a Seoul event that is part physical challenge, part art piece, and part respite from South Korea\u2019s hyper-competitive society. The annual Space-out competition, held on Sunday, finds who\u2019s best at zoning out for 90 minutes without falling asleep, checking their phone or talking. Participants\u2019 heart rates are monitored, while onlookers vote for their 10 favorite contestants. Whoever has the most stable heart rate among the 10 takes home the trophy. Among those taking part was speed skater Kwak Yoon-gy, a double Olympic silver medalist. \u201cI tried out for the Olympics five times and have never taken a proper rest while training for 30 years,\u201d said the 34-year-old short-track specialist, who took third place. \u201cI heard this place is where I can clear my mind and rest at least during this time, so I came here thinking, \u2018Wow, this is what I needed so much.\u2019\u201d More than 4,000 people applied to participate in the competition, hosted by the city government. The 117 contestants selected ranged from a child in second grade to people in their 60s. For many participants, it was a way to recover from burnout and stress, often from their work, in a country with high academic stress and extreme pressure to succeed. \u201cI usually had a lot of worries and stress, so I applied [to participate] because I thought it would be nice to blow away such stress and worries by spacing out in the competition,\u201d said 26-year-old YouTuber Kim Seok-hwan. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the Space-out competition, founded by a visual artist, who goes by the pseudonym Woopsyang, after she suffered severe burnout.  \u201cI wondered why I was so anxious about doing nothing,\u201d she recalled, adding that that\u2019s when she realized her anxiety came from comparing herself to other people leading busy lives. \u201cIn fact, those people could also be wanting to space out and do nothing like me,\u201d Woopsyang said. \u201cSo, I created a competition thinking that it would be nice to pause all together at the same place at the same time.\u201d Competitive idling \u201coverturns the social convention that spacing out is a waste of time in today\u2019s busy society and turns it into a valuable activity,\u201d she said. \u201cThis contest tells you that spacing out is no longer a waste of time but a time that you really need.\u201d The competition is also performance art, she said. \u201cAlthough the contestants are staying still inside the competition venue, the audience is constantly moving around,\u201d Woopsyang said, adding her goal was to \u201ccreate a visual contrast between a group that does nothing and a group that is busy.\u201d Since the first Space-out competition was held in Seoul in 2014, it has expanded internationally, with contests taking place in various cities such as Beijing, Rotterdam, Taipei, Hong Kong and Tokyo. This year\u2019s competition in Seoul was won by freelance announcer Kwon So-a, who works multiple jobs, and took home a trophy shaped like the Auguste Rodin sculpture \u201cThe Thinker.\u201d \u201cEspecially here in Korea, it\u2019s such a competitive country, where people think that if they do nothing that they are a little behind,\u201d Kwon, 35, said. \u201cI think everyone has to have their own pace and sometimes just slow down.\u201d Doing nothing is \u201cgood for your mental health as well as your physical health because your body has to relax, but your body can only relax when your brain relaxes,\u201d she added. \u201cFor both of these reasons, people should space out.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/asia/south-korea-space-out-competition-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_europe_georgia-foreign-agents-bill-passed-intl", "text": "Georgia\u2019s parliament has passed a controversial \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill despite widespread domestic opposition and warnings from the European Union that its enactment would imperil the country\u2019s chances of joining the bloc. The new law will require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d or face crippling fines. Opponents say that the legislation was modeled after similar laws in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society. The law was approved on Tuesday by 84 lawmakers voting in favor to 30 against. After the vote, riot police moved on protesters in Tbilisi after some individuals smashed down the barriers and broke into the grounds of the parliament. Many Georgians fear their foreign agents bill will be used the same way in their country. Georgia\u2019s parliament now has 10 days to send the bill to President Salome Zourabichvili, who has already vowed to veto it. Zourabichvili has two weeks to do so, but parliament can override her objection with a simple majority. The bill has become a cultural flashpoint in a country which, like Ukraine, finds itself caught between Russia and Europe. Polls show that an estimated 80% of Georgians want to join the EU, but Moscow\u2019s geopolitical orbit has proven tough to exit. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Zourabichvili said the upcoming elections in October will give the population a chance to \u201creverse\u201d the bill. \u201cWe have to use this mobilization of the society and this consolidation of the political parties to go and win those elections because that\u2019s the European way,\u201d she said. Georgia applied for membership of the bloc in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, a move seen as an effort to reverse the former Soviet republic\u2019s drift toward Russia. However, EU leaders have made it clear that the foreign agents bill\u2019s passage would jeopardize Georgia\u2019s chances of accession. The United States also voiced concerns about the bill and \u201cdemocratic backsliding\u201d in the country, which is nestled in the Caucasus Mountains, bordered by Russia to the north and Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan to the south. Georgian Dream, the ruling party that pushed through the legislation, has hit back at criticism, saying the move will promote transparency and national sovereignty. But the party has long been suspected of harboring pro-Russian sympathies, especially given that its founder, the billionaire former Prime Minister Bidzina\u00a0Ivanishvili, made his fortune in the Soviet Union. President Zourabichvili called the legislation a \u201cRussian law,\u201d adding that Georgians are \u201cvery well aware of these old Russian Soviet propaganda tricks, so it doesn\u2019t work. They see what\u2019s happening and they\u2019re going to stop it from happening.\u201d The movement of the bill has ignited a feverish response, including in parliament, where scuffles and shouting matches broke out during the hours-long debate that preceded the law\u2019s passage on Tuesday. Masked officers engaged with the crowds shortly afterwards, as riot police appear to be preparing to disperse the protesters. Similar scenes played out last month when an opposition lawmaker punched a key Georgian Dream member in the face,\u00a0sparking a wider brawl. Many anti-Russian, pro-European Georgians remain angry over Russia\u2019s invasion in 2008 and the fact that the Kremlin still occupies about 20% of Georgia\u2019s internationally recognized territory \u2013 about the same proportion that Russia occupies in Ukraine. Nightly protests have been shutting down the capital, Tbilisi, for about a month. About 50,000 people\u00a0came out Sunday evening in the city of 1 million people to speak out against what they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cthe Russian law.\u201d \u201cIt is a Russian law. It is an exact duplicate of the Putin law that was adopted a few years ago and then complemented in order to crush civil society,\u201d Zourabichvili, the Georgian president and a longstanding opponent of Georgian Dream, told CNN in an interview. Zourabichvili told CNN she would veto the law, but the country\u2019s parliament can override that with a simple majority. Levan\u00a0Khabeishvili, a protester who was seriously hurt after being beaten by police, told CNN that the law is yet another example of Moscow trying to assert its authority in the region. CNN has reached out to authorities for more information on why police used excessive force against him. \u201cWe know that this law is dangerous for our future. It threatens our partnership with the West,\u201d Khabeishvili said. The Kremlin has claimed that the law was being used to \u201cprovoke anti-Russian sentiments.\u201d Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, said on Tuesday that criticism of the bill was tantamount to \u201cundisguised interference in Georgia\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d Current Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze\u2019s office declined an interview request from CNN.

{"id": "2024_05_17_americas_gary-allen-srery-alberta-canada-deaths", "text": "After 48 years of investigation, Alberta Royal Canadian Mounted Police linked the deaths of four young women killed in the Calgary area in the 1970s to one man \u2013 a serial sexual offender who they believe may have committed more violent crimes until his death. Police say Gary Allen Srery killed\u00a0junior high school friends Eva Dvorak and Patricia McQueen, both 14 years old, in 1976, before killing Melissa Rehorek, 20, and Barbara MacLean, 19, in the span of a year. \u201cSrery\u2019s criminality spanned decades, over multiple jurisdictions, under numerous aliases, and the Alberta RCMP believe there may be more victims,\u201d Alberta RCMP said in a news release Friday. Crime scene DNA was seized during the initial homicide investigations, but due to a lack of DNA technology at the time, police failed to link a suspect to the killings. About 30 years later, in 2003, police were able to confirm the same suspect was linked to Rehorek and MacLean\u2019s deaths through DNA evidence. And in 2021, resubmitted crime scene evidence from the Dvorak and McQueen investigations unearthed a link with those of Rehorek and MacLean, according to RCMP. \u201cThe same unknown male DNA profile was identified on both victims that matched the unknown male DNA profile from the Rehorek and MacLean murders,\u201d police said in a news release. \u201cIn light of this new information, the RCMP believed that the same male offender was responsible for the deaths of all four victims.\u201d Advancements in forensic science technology and the use of forensic investigative genetic genealogy, which combines DNA analysis with traditional genealogy research, have allowed more breakthroughs with DNA evidence collection. Police used genetic genealogy to identify, Srery, an American who died of natural causes in an Idaho state prison in 2011 while serving a sentence for rape. \u201cWith assistance from Interpol and Idaho State Police Forensic Services, Srery\u2019s DNA was confirmed as a match to the unknown male DNA profile present on all four Calgary victims,\u201d police said. At the time of the killings, Srery was living illegally in Canada, having fled the US in 1974 after posting bail for a rape charge in California, according to RCMP. Before coming to Calgary, Srery had an extensive criminal record in the US for sexual offenses, including forcible rape, kidnapping, burglary and sexual perversion. Srery lived in Alberta and British Columbia from the mid 1970s until he was deported in 2003, police say. He used several aliases, including Willy Blackman and Rex Long. \u201cFor over forty years, investigators did not give up in their pursuit to identify those responsible for these murders,\u201d said David Hall of the Alberta RCMP. \u201cIdentifying the perpetrator does not bring Eva, Patsy, Melissa or Barbara back. It is our hope however, that the families are finally able to have some answers as to what happened to their loved ones all of those years ago,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_19_world_blue-origin-rocket-ns-25-mission-scn", "text": "Blue Origin\u2019s tourism rocket has launched passengers to the edge of space for the first time in nearly two years, ending a hiatus prompted by a failed uncrewed test flight. The New Shepard rocket and capsule lifted off at 9:36 a.m. CT (10:36 a.m. ET) from Blue Origin\u2019s facilities on a private ranch in West Texas. NS-25, Blue Origin\u2019s seventh crewed flight to date, carried six customers aboard the capsule: venture capitalist Mason Angel; Sylvain Chiron, founder of the French craft brewery Brasserie Mont-Blanc; software engineer and entrepreneur Kenneth L. Hess; retired accountant Carol Schaller; aviator\u00a0Gopi Thotakura; and Ed Dwight, a retired US Air Force captain selected by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 to be the nation\u2019s first Black astronaut candidate. Despite completing training at the Aerospace Research Pilot School\u00a0and receiving an Air Force recommendation, Dwight ultimately didn\u2019t make the NASA Astronaut Corps. He went on to become an entrepreneur and a sculptor; a new National Geographic documentary on Black astronauts, \u201cThe Space Race,\u201d highlights Dwight\u2019s pioneering story. \u201cI had no intention of being an astronaut. That was the last thing on my bucket list,\u201d Dwight said in the documentary. \u201cBut once I was given the challenge, then everything changes.\u201d Dwight completed that challenge and reached the edge of space at the age of 90, making him the oldest person to venture to such heights, according to a spokesperson from Blue Origin. \u201cI thought I didn\u2019t need it in my life,\u201d Dwight said of the experience on Blue Origin\u2019s livestream after the capsule touched down at 9:46 a.m. CT (10:46 a.m. ET). \u201cBut I lied. I really, really did need it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a life-changing experience,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody needs to do this.\u201d The rocket booster landed safely a couple minutes prior to the capsule. During the mission, the crew soared to more than three times the speed of sound, or more than 2,000 miles per hour. The rocket vaulted the capsule past the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, an area 62 miles (100 kilometers) above Earth\u2019s surface that is\u00a0widely recognized as the altitude at which outer space begins \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot of\u00a0gray area. And at the peak of the flight, passengers experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and striking views of Earth through the cabin windows. The launch followed the success of an uncrewed science mission in December \u2014 the New Shepard program\u2019s first flight since the mishap more than a year earlier. New Shepard\u2019s 2022 failure A New Shepard rocket and spacecraft were set to launch a batch of science instruments on September 12, 2022. But one minute into flight, the rocket endured Max Q \u2014 an aerospace term that refers to a moment of maximum stress on a vehicle. It occurs when the rocket is at a relatively low altitude \u2014 where the atmosphere is still fairly thick \u2014 but the spacecraft is moving at high speeds, creating a moment of intense pressure on the vehicle. Around that time, the rocket appeared to emit a massive burst of flames. The New Shepard capsule, which rides atop the rocket, then initiated its launch abort system \u2014 firing up a small engine to blast itself safely away from the malfunctioning rocket. That system worked as intended, parachuting the capsule to a safe landing. Blue Origin later\u00a0revealed\u00a0that the cause of the failure was a problem with the engine nozzle, a large cone that directs the flaming exhaust at the rocket\u2019s bottom. Onboard computers accurately detected the failure and shut the engine down, according to the company. No injuries were reported on the ground, and Blue Origin said the science payloads and the capsule could be flown again. But the rocket, left without a functioning engine, smashed back into the ground\u00a0and was destroyed. Typically after New Shepard launches, the rocket booster guides itself back to a safe upright landing so it can be flown again. During a December interview with podcaster Lex Fridman, Bezos\u00a0said the escape system that jettisoned the capsule to safety is the most difficult piece of engineering in the entire rocket \u2014 but \u201cit is the reason that I am comfortable letting anyone go on New Shepard.\u201d \u201cThe (rocket) booster is as safe and reliable as we can make it,\u201d Bezos added. \u201cThe power density is so enormous that it is impossible to ever be sure that nothing will go wrong. \u2026 So the only way to improve safety is to have an escape system. \u201cA tourism vehicle has to be designed in my view \u2026 to be as safe as one can make it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it perfectly safe. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d Rocket fix and return to service The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial rocket launches and is charged with ensuring public safety, oversaw an investigation into the failure. The probe revealed that the engine nozzle failed because it experienced higher temperatures than what the company had anticipated. To fix the issue, Blue Origin said it implemented \u201cdesign changes to the combustion chamber\u201d \u2014 the area of the engine where fuel explosively mixes with oxidizer \u2014 and adjusted \u201coperating parameters,\u201d or the data that the company uses to model safe flights. \u201cAdditional design changes to the nozzle have improved structural performance under thermal and dynamic loads,\u201d the company said in a March 2023\u00a0statement. The FAA formally concluded the mishap investigation on September 27, 2023, outlining 21 \u201ccorrective actions\u201d Blue Origin needed to implement before returning to flight. The agency did not reveal details on what those actions were,\u00a0noting the report\u00a0\u201ccontains proprietary data and U.S \u00a0Export Control\u00a0information and is not available for public release.\u201d The changes and New Shephard\u2019s successful December flight teed up the company to restart its trips to space for thrill seekers. Before the September 2022 failure, New Shepard rockets had flown 22 consecutive successful missions \u2014 including six with passengers on board.\u00a0Bezos flew aboard the rocket\u00a0in 2021. Other notable space tourists previously carried by the vehicle include \u201cStar Trek\u201d actor William Shatner and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d host Michael Strahan.

Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

Instead, she\u2019s spending her days and nights at\u00a0Gaza\u2019s\u00a0European Hospital\u00a0on the outskirts of Rafah. Kattan, an anesthesiologist and specialist in critical care, is one of at least 22\u00a0American physicians trapped in Gaza after an Israeli military offensive in Rafah last week shuttered the city\u2019s critical border crossing to Egypt. Rafah had, until then,\u00a0served as the only entry and exit point for foreign aid workers into and out of Gaza. \u201cMy kids have already been texting me today saying, you said Tuesday that you were going to be home,\u201d\u00a0Kattan told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0WHO\u00a0(World Health Organization) is trying to negotiate a safe exit for us. And it\u2019s not happening.\u201d The crossing has been closed since the Israeli military seized it early last week. Israeli and Egyptian officials have so far failed to reach an agreement on reopening it, instead trading blame for its continued closure. Meanwhile, dozens of foreign doctors are stuck in Gaza, while others are unable to get in as humanitarian conditions worsen inside the besieged enclave. FAJR Scientific, the\u00a0United States-based\u00a0nonprofit organization that brought\u00a0Kattan and 16 other physicians to Gaza, is now calling on the US government to help coordinate the team\u2019s safe exit from Gaza.\u00a0They had been due to leave on Monday. \u201cI am asking the\u00a0US government to step in and coordinate with the WHO to protect US citizens trapped in a war zone and bring them home ASAP,\u201d said Mosab Nasser, the organization\u2019s\u00a0chief executive, who is also in Gaza. At least one member of the team requires evacuation on medical grounds, he added. The 17 medics include 12 American citizens, three UK citizens, one Omani and one Egyptian. Kattan and her husband, who is also an anesthesiologist, arrived in Gaza more than two weeks ago, driven by the helplessness they felt watching the suffering in Gaza on\u00a0television\u00a0and knowing they could help. \u201cWe knew that anesthesiologists were needed for the civilians here, the women and the children. And we knew we had something we could offer,\u201d\u00a0said Kattan. \u2018This is what clean looks like in Gaza\u2019 The FAJR Scientific team recorded video diaries of their experiences\u00a0and the conditions they face\u00a0inside the European Hospital exclusively for CNN. In one video, Laura Swoboda, a nurse practitioner and wound specialist from Wisconsin,\u00a0describes\u00a0the buzz of drones overhead. \u201cEven in moments where we feel safe, the war is going on, and there\u2019s the potential for violence to resume,\u201d\u00a0she says. The dangerous conditions aren\u2019t only\u00a0to be found\u00a0outside the hospital. \u201cWe were not aware of how dire the situation is here. There wasn\u2019t soap to wash our hands between infected wounds with maggots. There wasn\u2019t\u00a0sanitizer wipes to wipe down the tables after each patient,\u201d Swoboda told CNN\u00a0in a Zoom interview. \u201cPeople were just coming in, person after person after person. We\u2019re out of gauze to clean the wounds. We\u2019re out of advanced dressings, we went through all of our cleansers, we\u2019re using whatever we can get our hands on at this point.\u201d \u201cThis is what clean looks like in Gaza,\u201d says\u00a0Kattan in\u00a0a\u00a0clip showing the state of an operating room, with plastic overalls strewn atop the operating table. Ahead of an operation to revise the amputations of a quadruple-amputee,\u00a0Kattan details the lack of anesthetics. Picking up a single vial of Propofol,\u00a0she\u00a0describes\u00a0how the\u00a0medics\u00a0were able bring it in with them from the US. No way out FAJR\u00a0Scientific operates under the umbrella\u00a0of WHO which, according to\u00a0FAJR\u00a0Scientific, has been attempting to coordinate an evacuation. At least one other international medical mission is currently at the European\u00a0Hospital, organized by the Palestine American Medical Association. Of the 19 members on the PAMA medical team, 10 are US citizens. The volunteers on the\u00a0FAJR\u00a0Scientific\u00a0mission all knew the risks involved in traveling to a war zone,\u00a0said Kattan,\u00a0but getting stuck in Gaza was not a scenario they had contemplated. Now, she is torn between the desire to get back home to her\u00a0children\u00a0and the guilt she feels\u00a0for\u00a0trying to leave Gaza at a time when the Israeli military could widen its offensive and the need for medical personnel is\u00a0expected\u00a0to rise. \u201cIt\u2019s just missing my kids and waking up in the morning and realizing they\u2019re not next to me. But the harder part is knowing that I get to leave eventually. And I get to go home and be safe. And I know that my kids are safe,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve developed a lot of friends here who are the same age as me and have kids my age and they don\u2019t have those securities and those basic necessities.\u201d After\u00a0more than two weeks of\u00a0witnessing the enormous strain on one of\u00a0the last hospitals still in operation in southern Gaza,\u00a0Kattan\u00a0added that\u00a0she and her colleagues only want to leave Gaza\u00a0if they can be replaced by other physicians. \u201cWe are mothers and fathers who want to be home with their families, and sons and daughters, we are physicians here, and we have colleagues and we can\u2019t abandon them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/middleeast/american-medics-trapped-in-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

He was responding to a question from CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto about whether he holds the US responsible for the delay in aid which Russian forces have been able to take advantage of and advance further into Ukraine. Kuleba\u2019s comments come after Moscow has ramped up its offensive in northern Ukraine. Last week it\u00a0launched its most surprising operation\u00a0in two years of war, crossing the northern border in renewed attempts to take Kharkiv, the country\u2019s second most populous city. Vovchansk, in the northern Kharkiv region, has faced an onslaught, with Russian forces claiming to control surrounding villages, forcing civilians to flee. Analysts say Russia was prepared for the hiatus in Western military aid to Ukraine and has exploited it for its own gain. \u201cUkraine may need to make difficult decisions due to slowness of US action and the dilemma that is now causing,\u201d George Barros at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington previously told CNN. It comes as Kyiv\u2019s forces are thinly stretched, with much less artillery than the Russians, inadequate air defenses and a lack of soldiers. Kuleba described Ukraine\u2019s current position on the frontline as \u201ctough.\u201d \u201cRussia is strong, we are suffering from\u2026 insufficient supplies of military assistance which we are forced to compensate with heroism and sacrifice of our soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the main message remains the same: send us everything. Because we have proven over these two years that when our soldiers have everything they need, we succeed, and when we don\u2019t have everything that we need, we don\u2019t,\u201d he added. The foreign minister went on to say the situation on the battlefield would be different if countries did more to assist Ukraine, claiming that if every country were to follow Estonia\u2019s footsteps in allocating 1% of GDP to military aid for Ukraine they would be able to perform better on the battlefield. \u201cEstonia is a country that proves to the whole world that a small country with a big heart can make a big difference and it\u2019s a paradigm for everyone to follow,\u201d he said.

Years later, he says he heard his voice narrating a YouTube video and then on a podcast \u2014 even though he had never recorded either of them. Now, Lehrman, along with fellow voice actor Linnea Sage, is suing AI firm Lovo for allegedly commissioning them for voice projects under false pretenses in order to create and sell AI-generated versions of their voices. The Berkeley, California based tech company advertises AI-generated voice technology to be used in marketing, education and product demos. Lehrman and Sage are suing Lovo and seeking class action status to include other people \u201cwhose voices and/or identities were stolen and used,\u201d according to the complaint filed Thursday in the Southern District Court of New York. The complaint was first reported by the New York Times. The voice actors\u2019 lawsuit is just the latest in a recent string of legal actions brought against various tech companies by creatives, writers and artists who say their work was used without their permission to train AI systems that could ultimately compete with them. Such lawsuits have added to a growing wave of concerns over how the training of AI models, which requires huge swaths of data, could run afoul of copyright and intellectual property laws. \u201cImplicit in LOVO\u2019s offerings to its customers is that each voice-over actor has agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms and conditions for customers to be able to access that actor\u2019s voice,\u201d the complaint states. But for Lehrman and Sage and any others \u201cwho have not agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms, the continued unauthorized use of Plaintiffs\u2019 voices is theft of service and misappropriation.\u201d Lovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. In May 2020, Lehrman says he received a request for voice-over narrative services on the gig work website Fiverr from an account called \u201cUser25199087.\u201d When he asked what the voice sample was for, he was told it would be used \u201cfor academic research purposes only\u201d and that \u201cthe scripts would not be used for anything else,\u201d according to the complaint. He was paid $1,200 for the job, the complaint states. Two years later, Lehrman came across a YouTube video that sounded as if it had his voice narrating it, although he\u2019d never been involved in its creation, the complaint states. Then in June 2023, Lehrman claims he heard his voice being used on a podcast about the dangers of AI technologies. Similarly, Sage was offered a job on Fiverr in 2019 producing \u201ctest scripts for radio ads\u201d that she was told would \u201cnot be disclosed externally,\u201d according to the complaint. She was paid $400. Sage says she later also discovered her voice in a YouTube video: a recording of a Lovo investor presentation demonstrating its technology. Lehrman and Sage allege that the people who contacted them on Fiverr were Lovo employees who misrepresented what their voice samples would be used for and later sold or raised money on the back of the AI-version of their voices. \u201cTo be clear, the product that customers purchase from LOVO is stolen property. They are voices stolen by LOVO and marketed by LOVO under false pretenses,\u201d the complaint states. The actors are seeking more than $5 million in damages, as well as a court order blocking Lovo from continuing the alleged use of their voices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_world_ancient-arachnid-spiny-legs-intl-scli-scn", "text": "The idea of coming face to face with a spider-like creature unexpectedly is enough to fill any arachnophobe with horror, let alone encountering one with large, spiky legs. But that is exactly what roamed around what\u2019s currently northeast Illinois in the late Carboniferous Period about 300 million to 320 million years ago, according to a study published Friday in the Journal of Paleontology. The newly discovered long-extinct species is described as a \u201clarge spider-like arachnid\u201d with \u201cdistinctive large spines on the legs\u201d by the study\u2019s authors. They were unable to place the creature within any known arachnid order due to the specimen\u2019s lack of mouthparts, which scientists use to classify them.  \u201cYou see sort of spiny legs in some arachnids, but we\u2019ve never seen one that really has these big spines all the way along, at least the first parts of the legs. It\u2019s very, very striking,\u201d Dr. Jason Dunlop, a curator of arachnids and myriapods at Berlin\u2019s Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde and the study\u2019s coauthor, told CNN on Friday. \u201cWe looked at it twice and said, \u2018What are we looking at here?\u2019\u201d Expert fossil preparator Bob Masek first discovered the specimen in the 1980s in the fossil deposits preserved at Illinois\u2019 Mazon Creek Lagerst\u00e4tte. (The German word is a term paleontologists use to describe an exceptional site with many perfectly preserved fossils.) \ufeffHowever, it wasn\u2019t until 2023 that it became apparent the specimen was a newfound species and fossil collector David Douglass, who had acquired it from Masek, donated it for research. Researchers then examined and photographed the fossil using a camera attached to a microscope. They found that the creature was \u201cevidently something very different from any previously described arachnid,\u201d with spiny legs that resemble some modern harvestmen arachnids but with a different type of body. The creature likely used its spines for defensive purposes rather than to attack other animals, similar to a hedgehog\u2019s spines today, Dunlop said. \u201cIt means if something tries to bite it, it catches the spines in its mouth. \u2026 We talk about handling time, which means if you want to eat something spiny, it takes longer because you\u2019ve got to break the spines off or bite the bits that haven\u2019t got spines on it,\u201d he added. \u201cWe can guess there were scorpions and other spiders around,\u201d Dunlop said, as well as primitive lizardlike animals or large amphibians that would have hunted these arachnids, but it isn\u2019t possible to know for certain. Without the mouthparts, researchers cannot pinpoint its closest relative, but they hypothesize it could belong to a wider group including spiders, whip spiders and whip scorpions. Paleontologists have only found this particular species in North America so far, but it could \u201cturn up somewhere else\u201d in Northern Europe too, Dunlop said. \u201cA huge area across a lot of what\u2019s now Europe and North America was probably a kind of giant tropical rainforest and wherever coal is found today, you\u2019ve got a reasonable chance of finding these fossils (of arachnids, plants and insects),\u201d he added. Ultimately, researchers named the species Douglassarachne acanthopoda. The genus name honors the Douglass family, who donated the specimen to Chicago\u2019s Field Museum of Natural History, and the species name references the spines that make this arachnid so distinctive.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/world/ancient-arachnid-spiny-legs-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Yet almost two years after her death, new pictures of Britain\u2019s longest-reigning monarch have emerged for an exhibition opening at Buckingham Palace this week. Among the most striking is a touching image from 1964 of four royal mothers and their babies - including the Queen and her youngest son, Prince Edward. Alongside them are the Queen\u2019s sister, Princess Margaret, plus Princess Alexandra and the Duchess of Kent, all holding their newborn babies. The never-before-seen image was taken by Princess Margaret\u2019s then-husband, photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones - or Lord Snowdon as he was known as then - as a personal thanks for the royal obstetrician who delivered the four babies within two months of that year. Shown alongside it is a handwritten letter from Princess Margaret to her sister in which she asks \u201cDarling Lilibet\u201d to sign a print \u201cas a souvenir of an extraordinary two months of delivery.\u201d \u201cRoyal Portraits: A Century of Photography,\u201d which opened in The King\u2019s Gallery of the palace on Friday, has more than 150 items from the Royal Collection and Royal Archives, which chart the evolution of royal portrait photography since the 1920s. Also on show for the first time are several wartime images taken by Cecil Beaton, who captured the royal family on camera over six decades. Among them is one of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth inspecting bomb damage at the palace in 1940, while another shows them with their two daughters - Elizabeth and Margaret - around the King\u2019s desk at the Royal Lodge in Windsor. Beaton was the official photographer for Elizabeth\u2019s coronation in 1953. The exhibition features a contact sheet of proofs of the coronation sitting, alongside a note from Martin Charteris, the Queen\u2019s assistant private secretary, recommending to Prince Philip which images should be sent to the royal family and maids of honor. The picture that was subsequently chosen and sent to the Queen Mother can also be seen, signed by both the Queen, her husband and Beaton. In a week where many headlines were made about the new official painting of the King, the exhibition offers an altogether different view of Charles. It features a black and white shot of Charles, then a young prince, alongside his sister, Princess Anne, in 1956. There are numerous official photographs taken to mark royal birthdays, including a portrait by Beaton of Princess Margaret for her 25th birthday - together with her dog Pippin.  Separately, she and her sister, the Queen, can be seen laughing and talking in a contact sheet of images shot by Norman Parkinson on the occasion of their mother\u2019s 80th birthday. Another highlight is the earliest surviving color print of a member of the royal family. Taken in 1935 by pioneering female photographer Madame Yevonde, it shows Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester - sister-in-law to King George VI and Edward VIII - on her wedding day. The exhibition, which runs until October, charts the innovations in portraiture, featuring Andy Warhol\u2019s 1985 image of the Queen sprinkled with diamond dust and Rankin\u2019s 2001 photograph of the smiling monarch, superimposed against the union flag. Meanwhile, Paolo Roversi\u2019s memorable 40th birthday portrait of the Princess of Wales, shows Catherine bearing a striking resemblance to Alexandra, Princess of Wales, by Franz Xaver Winterhalter in 1864. Curator Alessandro Nasini said in a press release: \u201cThe Royal Collection holds some of the most enduring photographs ever taken of the Royal Family, captured by the most celebrated portrait photographers of the past hundred years \u2013 from Dorothy Wilding and Cecil Beaton to Annie Leibovitz, David Bailey, and Rankin. \u201cAlongside these beautiful vintage prints, which cannot be on permanent display for conservation reasons, we are excited to share archival correspondence and never-before-seen proofs that will give visitors a behind-the-scenes insight into the process of creating such unforgettable royal portraits.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/style/unseen-photos-royal-family-gbr-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_mallory-disappeared-everest-summit-mystery", "text": "It\u2019s one of climbing\u2019s greatest mysteries: was Everest really conquered for the first time in 1953, or did two mountaineers make it to the summit in 1924, before dying in mysterious circumstances? British climbers George Mallory and Andrew \u201cSandy\u201d Irvine were last seen on June 8, 1924, 800 feet below the peak, before disappearing into clouds. They never reemerged. When Mallory\u2019s body was found in 1999, hopes were high that it might give a clue as to whether the pair reached the summit. But, tantalizingly, the camera he had been carrying \u2013 with which he would have documented the highest point they had reached \u2013 was not on the body. Irvine\u2019s body has never been found. But now, as the 100th anniversary of the mens\u2019 disappearance approaches, one researcher believes that he has solved mountaineering\u2019s greatest mystery. By studying the expedition weather reports, author Graham Hoyland believes that he has worked out what happened to the pair \u2013 and whether they made it to the summit before they died. Hoyland \u2013 a distant relative of another member of the expedition group, who has visited on Everest nine times searching for the remains \u2013 believes that the key to the mystery is air pressure. His relative several times removed, Howard Somervell \u2013 another mountaineer, who had got within 1,000 feet of the summit on the same expedition before a lack of oxygen meant he had to retreat \u2013 was responsible for tracking the weather during the expedition. The smoking gun? His records \u2013 which he submitted after the official report on the 1924 expedition was made, having returned to his job as a surgeon in India \u2013 show that the barometric pressure dropped between the morning of June 8 and June 9 at base camp, where Somervell was taking the readings. Somervell recorded the pressure in inches of mercury, dropping from 16.25 to 15.98. Hoyland believes that these figures equate to a 10 millibar drop in pressure. Weather-related deaths on Everest are generally associated with a drop in barometric pressure at the summit. A decrease of just 4 millibars can trigger hypoxia; a 6 millibar drop was enough to cause the incident in 1996 in which 20 people were trapped on the mountain, eight of whom died. That story is recounted in writer Jon Krakauer\u2019s book \u201cInto Thin Air.\u201d The bad weather angle was also explored in a 2010 paper by experts from the University of Toronto, led by G.W. Kent Moore. \u201cThey were climbing into an absolute s***storm \u2013 not only a blizzard but a sort of snow bomb,\u201d Hoyland told CNN. Hoyland has experienced \u201csnow bombs\u201d himself on Everest. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying \u2013 the temperature drops hugely, you\u2019re gasping for breath. There are winds of 1,000 knots. One guy I know was blown off the mountain, and ended up further up the mountain,\u201d he said. Effectively, the drop in air pressure meant that the mountain suddenly became higher \u2013 around 650 feet higher, to be precise. Hoyland calls it \u201can invisible death trap.\u201d The pair \u2013 who were ascending along the northwest ridge \u2013 were already climbing against the odds. Mallory wrote in a letter to his wife that he put his chances of making the summit at 50 to one. Hoyland thinks it was more like 20 to one. But, he thinks, they would have had no idea what was about to hit them. \u201cMallory had seen Norton and Somervell get to to within 1000 feet of the top on 4 June using no oxygen equipment; it would have seemed reasonable to assume that it was possible to reach the summit with the apparatus,\u201d he writes in a forthcoming book. \u201cWhat he didn\u2019t know was that the rapidly falling air pressure was effectively making the mountain even higher. What\u2019s more, the storm and blizzard wouldn\u2019t just have made a drop in air pressure. The pair were wearing layers of silk, cotton and wool. Hoyland \u2013 who had a similar made-to-measure outfit on an Everest trip \u2013 says that the clothes are exceptionally comfortable but wouldn\u2019t have provided the warmth to survive a blizzard or an overnight. Previously, it has been speculated that the pair had reached the summit before dying on the way down, something that Hoyland calls \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d been trying to prove that Mallory had climbed Everest for years and years \u2013 I wanted to prove that I was the 16th Briton to climb it, not the 15th. But unfortunately when you read facts and they\u2019re different, you have to change your mind. You can\u2019t carry on being a wishful thinker,\u201d he says. Until Hoyland, nobody had closely studied at the weather reports, which were held at the Royal Geographical Society in London. The summit was eventually reached by Edmund Hillary, a New Zealand mountaineer, in 1953 \u2013 the first documented ascent of the peak. A century of speculation The mystery of Mallory and Irvine has intrigued adventurers for decades. In 1933, another mountaineer, Percy Wyn-Harris found an ax near the summit. It was assumed to have belonged to Irvine. In 1936, another mountaineer, Frank Smythe, believed he had seen two bodies in the distance. Using a telescope, he saw them at around 8,100 meters, or 26,575 feet. And Chinese mountaineer Wang Hongbao believed he saw a body during his 1975 ascent. Finally, an expedition in 1999, instigated by Hoyland, found Mallory\u2019s body at 26,700 feet \u20132,335 below the summit. Hoyland believes that the pair, tethered to each other, slipped while aborting the climb and returning to base camp. He thinks Mallory survived the initial fall, but took another, fatal plunge while staggering back to base camp. Irvine\u2019s body has never been found. Everest \u2018makes people mad\u2019 While some of Mallory\u2019s possessions were still to be found on his body, including a pair of goggles in his pocket \u2013 which suggests he was either in darkness or poor visibility \u2013 there was no sign of the photo of his wife which he had brought, planning to leave it on the summit. For decades, researchers have posited that, in lieu of more precise evidence, the lack of photo suggests the pair might have reached the summit and fallen while returning. However, having reviewed the new evidence, Hoyland believes this is not the case. Expedition reports noted a blizzard hitting the mountain at 2 p.m., he says \u2013 long before they could have reached the summit. The lack of photo, he thinks, means nothing. Mallory often forgot stuff, he notes. In his last letter to his wife \u2013 digitized to mark the centenary of his ascent \u2013 on May 27, Mallory wrote of \u201clooking out of a tent door onto a world of snow and vanishing hopes: and described it as \u201ca bad time altogether.\u201d Both he and Irvine were unwell, and he wrote that \u201cI\u2019m quite doubtful if I shall be fit enough.\u201d For Hoyland, who is taking part in an event at the Royal Geographical Society about the centenary, \u201cEverest makes people mad.\u201d \u201cMallory became obsessed with the desire to conquer Everest \u2013 it would have made him somebody,\u201d he said. Mallory was a teacher, but moved on the fringes of the Bloomsbury set, a group of British intellectuals, artists and thinkers centered on London in the early 20th century. \u201cEveryone he knew was a famous novelist or a Nobel prizewinner, and he got captivated by it [the idea of Everest],\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a dangerous thing called \u2018summit fever\u2019 \u2013 you see the summit, and you think, \u2018Right, it\u2019s death or glory.\u2019 You don\u2019t care if you die. \u201cI know that feeling. You get completely possessed by this mountain. Mallory was possessed by Everest and it killed him.\u201d Hoyland, who has since swapped mountaineering for extreme sailing, says that Everest has become \u201ca non-mountaineer\u2019s mountain.\u201d \u201cThere are rich men climbing it as a trophy. I wish it wasn\u2019t the highest,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite honestly I think the best thing to happen would be if the top 800 feet fell off.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/mallory-disappeared-everest-summit-mystery/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_weather_south-flooding-texas-louisiana-climate", "text": "At least four people are dead in Houston after hurricane-force winds and torrential rains tore a damaging path through the city Thursday \u2013 part of a lashing storm system that is bringing life-threatening flooding and power outages to parts of the South. Severe storms carved through parts of Texas Thursday before pushing into western Louisiana through Friday\u2019s early hours, prompting an overnight flash flood warning for New Orleans. As the sun rises Friday, several cities in the storm\u2019s path will begin to take stock of damage left in the storms\u2019 wake. One person was killed in Houston when a crane was toppled by strong winds and two other deaths were caused by fallen trees, according to Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a, citing preliminary information. Violent storms in Houston blew out skyscraper windows, partially collapsed a nightclub and ripped a strip of roofing off the downtown Hyatt Regency, showering the hotel lobby with rain and debris, according to witness video. All non-essential workers are urged to stay home tomorrow and city schools are closed as widespread power outages have darkened the city and disabled traffic lights, Mayor John Whitmire said. Streets are littered with debris, downed trees and power lines, and the downtown area is dusted with glass from broken windows, he added. Major flooding has prompted water rescues in at least one Texas city. As many as 20 drivers had to be helped from rising water in Bryan, about 100 miles northwest of Houston, police said. Power outages left more than 900,000 homes and businesses in the dark across Texas as of Thursday night. More than 200,000 are also without power in Louisiana as storms batter the state. Possible tornadoes posed a risk in Texas and Louisiana, and carried the threat of destructive winds and golf ball-sized hail. A reported tornado in Convent, Louisiana, downed trees and power poles late Thursday, the Storm Prediction Center said. Parts of Texas and western Louisiana are under a rare Level 4 of 4 high risk of excessive rainfall Thursday, the Weather Prediction Center said. More than 600,\ufeff000 people live in the high-risk zone. High risk days like this only happen on 4% of days each year, but account for more than 80% of all flood damage and more than a third of all flood deaths in the United States, according to the WPC. Just three other days have reached this concerning mark this year, including the most recent one nearly three weeks ago. It\u2019s a sign the atmosphere is primed to unload extreme amounts of rain, a phenomenon that is becoming more frequent in a warming world driven by human-caused climate change. Widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches are expected from Texas to Georgia through Saturday morning. A few spots caught under multiple torrential storms may pick up 8 inches or more of rain. It\u2019s not out of the question that one or two spots could record close to a foot of rain in about 48 hours. Texas and Louisiana have been in the bull\u2019s-eye of seemingly unrelenting rounds of torrential, flooding downpours since the start of April. Rainfall in the waterlogged area over the last two weeks is over 600% of what\u2019s typical, according to the WPC. Double-digit rainfall totals between 20 and 30 inches over the region in recent weeks have soaked the ground and left rivers swollen, priming the flood threat to extreme levels. Drenched soils are not expected to soak up any of Thursday\u2019s rainfall, the WPC warned Thursday morning. Widespread flash flooding could begin minutes after heavy rain starts to fall. Flooding ramps up Thursday and threat persists Friday Storms, some severe, rumbled to life Thursday afternoon in parts of Texas and prompted flash flood warnings for multiple cities, including Waco. Powerful, heavy storms will push south and east and reach Louisiana and Mississippi late in the day. More than 800,000 outages have been reported in Harris County, where Houston is located, according to PowerOutage.us. Harris County is the third-most populous in the United States. A tornado warning had been issued earlier Thursday evening in Harris County, including downtown Houston, according to the National Weather Service. The weather service also issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Houston with the highest-level \u201cdestructive\u201d tag. At around 6:30 p.m., the weather service in Houston noted a \u201cdestructive storm\u201d with wind gusts of up to 80 mph was over the metro area, and urged residents to take cover immediately in a post on X. Winds in the city were reported as high as 71 mph, according to the weather service.\u00a0On the east side of the city, there were reports of winds up to 78 mph \u2013 equivalent to the strength of a Category 1 hurricane. Multiple steel power transmission towers in Houston have been mangled by the storms, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. Along part of US Route 290, traffic was stopped as firefighters cleared downed lines draped over the roadway. Houston Mayor John Whitmire advised residents to stay off the roads. \u201cThe mayor and first responders are asking Houstonians to stay off the roads and avoid all unnecessary travel. Many roads are impassible due to downed power lines, debris, and fallen trees,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office said in a statement Thursday evening. \u201cThere are significant power outages and reports of damage across the city. We are working with Centerpoint, METRO and other regional partners to keep everyone safe.\u201d Rainfall rates up to 3 inches per hour are possible in the heaviest storms, which could lead to life-threatening flash flooding, according to the WPC. Damaging winds, hail and a couple of tornadoes are also possible. The greatest flooding danger will come as storms train later Thursday. Training storms track through and deluge the same areas over and over, like a train pulling its cars over the same stretch of track. Serious flash flooding is likely in any areas caught under multiple storms unloading 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour. Roadways may quickly become rivers and small streams could easily overflow their banks. More than 35 million people in the South are under a Level 2 of 4 or Level 3 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall Thursday. Many areas may only endure one torrential storm, but even brief downpours will be enough to cause flooding problems given how wet the South has been recently. Drenching storms from Thursday night will last into Friday for parts of the Gulf Coast. An initial round of flash flooding is likely in the first half of Friday before rain starts to taper off in the afternoon. Another bout of heavy rain will develop Friday night and continue into the earliest hours of Saturday morning, working over the same areas hit earlier in the day. These storms could produce rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour, and quickly restart or worsen any ongoing flooding. Extremely wet start to the year The rain will only add to already extreme rainfall totals in what\u2019s been one of the wettest years to date on record across the Gulf Coast. Some Southeast cities have recorded more than half a foot of rain above what\u2019s typical for the first several months of the year. Several dozen cities from Texas to western Georgia are pacing at a top 5 wettest year to date and at least two cities in eastern Texas are experiencing their wettest year, according to the\u00a0Southeast Regional Climate Center. Dallas is experiencing its third-wettest year to date while Shreveport, Louisiana, is amid its second wettest. Excessive rainfall has largely eliminated dryness and drought conditions along the Gulf Coast, but it hasn\u2019t come without a cost. Earlier this month, nearly 2 feet of rain fell in just five days and sent parts of eastern Texas underwater. Hundreds of people and animals were rescued from flooding as some area\u00a0rivers rose to levels\u00a0not reached since Hurricane Harvey in 2017.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/weather/south-flooding-texas-louisiana-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

The shooting occurred while the tourists were shopping at an open-air market in Bamyan, a Spanish diplomatic source said Saturday. \u201cThe information the Spanish government has received so far is that a group of six Spaniards were traveling in the region of Bamyan and they were attacked on Friday by at least one armed man who opened fire,\u201d the source said. Four foreign nationals and three Afghans were also injured in the attack when gunmen opened fire, Reuters reported, citing Qani, adding that four people have been arrested. A fourth Spanish citizen is among the wounded and has been transferred to a hospital in Kabul, where they are listed as being in serious condition following surgery.

{"id": "2024_05_14_europe_prison-ambush-france-intl", "text": "French authorities launched a manhunt on Tuesday after gunmen ambushed a prison convoy in Normandy to break out an inmate, killing two guards and wounding three others. The violent incident, extremely rare for that part of northern France, took place as the vehicle was transporting a prisoner from court to a nearby prison, French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said. Video from the scene showed a black SUV in flames that appeared to have crashed into a prison van near a motorway toll booth, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.\u00a0Two hooded individuals could be seen carrying what appeared to be long rifles. Dupond-Moretti told reporters that the incident was the first time a French prison employee had died while working since 1992. He added that one of the guards leaves behind a wife and two children, and the other a spouse who was five months\u2019 pregnant. Dupond-Moretti added that two of those hurt sustained life-threatening injuries. The gunmen are still at large, national police said on X. \u201cEverything, and I mean everything, will be done to find the perpetrators of this heinous crime. These are people for whom life means nothing. They will be arrested. They will be tried. And they will be punished for the crime they committed,\u201d Dupond-Moretti said. A manhunt is underway to find suspects who carried out the prison break and the inmate, a 30-year-old who had been convicted of burglary and is being investigated for a kidnapping related to death, according to the French national prosecutor in charge of organized crime, which has already opened an investigation into the incident. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on X he has mobilized the national gendarmerie and \u201cseveral hundred\u201d police officers for the manhunt.\u00a0Authorities on the scene are setting up roadblocks and establishing a perimeter, BFMTV reported. Vehicles found On Tuesday evening local time, French police said they had discovered two burnt out vehicles used by the attackers. Paris state prosecutor Laure Beccuau told a press conference that the two vehicles were found in Houtteville and in Gauville-le-Campagne, two towns in the d\u00e9partement of Eure where the attack took place near the Incarville tollbooth shortly before 11am local time (5aET). One of the vehicles, a Peugeot, had been used to ram the police van during the attack, Becuau said. The other vehicle, an Audi, had been following the van and carried the two gunmen. Forensic experts have been carrying out \u201cmeticulous tests\u201d at the scene of the crime, and police had been studying video of the attack filmed by eyewitnesses and posted on social media, Beccuau told the press conference. The prosecutor also revealed more details about the escaped inmate, identifying him as Mohamed Amra, and saying he is \u201cvery well known to the justice system,\u201d having sustained a total 13 convictions. Most of those convictions related to incidences of theft with aggravated offences, Beccuau said, adding that Amra had been incarcerated in various facilities since January 2022. A minimum of three police officers had been decided as the security level for the escort several weeks ago, Beccuau told journalists. In the end, five officers were involved in the escort. A 52-year-old officer and 34-year-old officer were both killed during the attack whilst their colleagues, a 48-year-old, a 52-year-old and a 55-year-old were all injured, she said. On May 10, Amra was found guilty on the charge of burglary by a court in \u00c9vreux and was also under investigation in Marseille for a kidnap which led to a death, Beccuau said. The prosecutor said the authorities\u2019 priority now is getting to the bottom of this \u201coutburst of violence.\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron said on X that \u201cevery effort is being made to find the perpetrators of this crime so that justice can be done in the name of the French people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/europe/prison-ambush-france-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_americas_new-york-city-chinese-migrants-flushing-intl-latam", "text": " A simple act of walking into a mosque with his wife and two children in New York City is what made the past six months of struggle worth it for Ye Chengxiang \u2013 even if not everyone is celebrating his arrival. \u201cIt\u2019s only been over two months here, but we can feel the spirit of freedom, inclusiveness, and equality,\u201d he said over a bowl of noodles. It was his only day off from working 12-hour shifts at a Chinese restaurant in New York City. The slim former restaurant owner left China last October. The ruling Communist Party\u2019s crackdown on his Hui Muslim ethnic group and growing restrictions on personal life gave his family no choice, he says. \u201cWhen I was in China, I had a pent-up feeling in my heart,\u201d he said of living as a Muslim in China, where his children were banned from entering a mosque. Ye and his wife drained $40,000 of their life savings and illegally crossed the United States\u2019 southern border in December after an exhausting weeks-long journey that saw the family take a hazardous boat journey from Colombia to the edge of the Darien Gap, a mountainous rainforest region that connects South and Central America. His anxieties melted away as Ye crossed into the US, which he described as entering a warm embrace. \u201cI felt like I was home, and that feeling was very real,\u201d he said. Their destination was New York City\u2019s Flushing neighborhood, home to a Chinese community going back generations. The city has integrated\u202fmillions\u202fof migrants over the decades, and it continues to inspire newcomers like Ye \u2013 even as the arrival of such migrants has turned into a flashpoint in US politics ahead of the November elections. After arriving in New York, Ye spent a week in a Manhattan shelter. Then, with the help of a group of other Chinese Muslim\u202fasylum\u202fseekers, he found a place to live and a job making noodles as his family proceeded through the religious\u202fasylum claim process.\u202f Their first court date is in October He is exhausted, barely having time to learn English or explore the new city. But he is happy. The first time that he walked to a mosque in Flushing with his wife and daughters, \u201cI immediately felt that rock, that lump in my heart, dissolve away,\u201d he told CNN. On downtown Flushing\u2019s Main Street, people hand out fliers offering help, for a fee, for the undocumented to secure drivers\u2019 licenses. Alongside the street vendors hawking vegetables, undocumented migrants walk into buildings with employment agencies offering restaurant and sales jobs. This is what draws Chinese migrants toward enclaves like Flushing and Sunset Park, where immigrant networks, legal service centers, job markets and nonprofits form a vital support system. For Chinese\u202fasylum\u202fseekers like Ye, there is a well-trodden route to residency in the US. Chinese nationals have the\u202fhighest\u202fnumber of asylum claims granted\u202f\u00a0in the US compared to other nationalities, because their \u201cpathway to claiming political\u202fasylum\u202f[for Chinese nationals] is more codified,\u201d said Amy Hsin, a sociology professor at Queens College in New York, who specializes in immigration and social inequality.\u00a0 The US expanded\u202fasylum\u202fpathways\u202ffor Chinese citizens in the past due to geopolitical events and policies, like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and the one-child policy, she explained. Recently, growing restrictions on freedoms in China and its stuttering economy have led to this new influx of disillusioned Chinese citizens. More than 37,000 Chinese citizens were picked up by law enforcement crossing illegally from Mexico in 2023, US government data shows. That\u2019s up from around 3,800 people the year before, and many of them were headed to New York City, according to experts. In a statement to CNN, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it is on \u201ca human rights development path suited to its national conditions,\u201d emphasizing the country\u2019s stunning economic transformation over the past few decades. \u201cAs a country under the rule of law, the Chinese government protects its people\u2019s freedom of speech and freedom of religious belief in accordance with the law,\u201d it also said. \u2018America is better\u2019 On the fourth floor of an old mall, migrant workers walk into a legal service center. They say they have lost their passports, or had them confiscated, in the melee of voluntarily turning themselves in for\u202fasylum\u202fwith the Customs and Border Protection. The office, which helps them in their\u202fasylum\u202fapplications, also connects them with the Chinese Embassy to apply for new travel documents. In the waiting room, migrants told CNN how videos on social media, providing detailed instructions on how to cross Central America to the US, inspired them to make the journey. They spoke of the socio-economic pressures back in China, made worse by pandemic restrictions and its lack of economic rebound, forcing them to leave the country. The center\u2019s owner, who declined to be named in this story because he does not have a license to practice law in the US, has helped more than 100 Chinese nationals since opening the office two years ago. The burden of proof for\u202fasylum\u202fclaims in the US is high and the owner said many of his clients have struggled to provide concrete evidence of political and religious repression they faced in China. Many go on to protest against the Chinese government once in the US, freed from Chinese authorities and its censors, he said. Dressed simply in jeans and a black jacket, Jiang Zhen said the\u202fsweeping crackdown\u202fon free speech, civil society and religion was suffocating him in China. He believes he was blacklisted for criticizing China\u2019s government on social media sites, his accounts banned or suspended. Poverty in rural China, like in his hometown in Hunan province, had become unbearable, with relatives and parents of friends \u201cdrinking pesticides, drowning themselves in rivers, or hanging themselves \u2026 especially when they are suffering from diseases like cancer and have no money for treatment,\u201d he said, adding that the Chinese government ignores \u201cthe living conditions of the lower classes.\u201d As he waits for his work permit, which can take up to 18 months to approve, the 33-year-old now works illegally cleaning dishes at a Cantonese restaurant in Queens. He earns $4,000 a month, slightly more than what he earned as a business owner in the coastal Chinese province of Guangdong. Next to him, a woman in a pearl-colored puffer jacket, who asked to remain anonymous because she works illegally in the country, said the US was not what she had imagined. She joked that China\u2019s infrastructure bests what she has seen in New York. \u201cFrom movies I watched when I was younger, I remembered Chinatowns being bustling and beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after coming here, I found that Chinatown is in a state of\u202f\u200b\u200bdisrepair. It\u2019s broken and dirty. I was so surprised,\u201d she said as the room burst out in laughter. When asked why she has chosen to remain in the US, she replied: \u201cBecause the US is actually more powerful, despite sometimes the broken appearance,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not starving in China, but everyone wants a better life. Obviously, America is better.\u201d Anti-China measures Both China and US authorities have been concerned with the uptick in migration to the southern border \u2013 but for entirely different reasons. A Chinese government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to comment publicly, told CNN that they believed some new Chinese migrants are participating in violent anti-China demonstrations in the US to help with their asylum cases.\u00a0The official pointed to clashes between anti-China protesters and pro-China supporters in San Francisco in November, when Chinese leader Xi Jinping was attending a forum in the city. In the US, a\u202frecord number\u202fof migrants at the southern border has been seized upon by Republicans who claim it as proof of the Biden administration\u2019s impotence, pushing immigration control to a top election issue. While most migrants at the southern border hail from Latin American countries, some politicians have focused on Chinese migration as a security concern; Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, claimed last May that some Chinese migrants at the border had military experience,\u202faccording to his blog, though he did not offer evidence. Wan Yanhai, a human rights activist based in New York, said the implication that the Chinese\u202fasylum\u202fseekers could be soldiers or spies was \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d There would be little reason for the Chinese government to embed spies among southern border arrivals, he pointed out, considering migrants are not the demographic that would gain access to state secrets in the US. \u201cThese migrants in the US are doing low-level jobs and don\u2019t speak the language, so they can\u2019t do this kind of work. \u2026 It\u2019s impossible for them to be spies.\u201d But the rhetoric around the rise of undocumented Chinese migrants highlights growing tensions between the US and Chinese governments. Geopolitical and security concerns\u202fhave led an increasingly hawkish Biden administration\u202fto unravel years of technological and economic integration with its chief rival in the Pacific. But Jiang, the\u202fasylum\u202fseeker who believes he was blacklisted by Beijing, is unfazed by the growing intergovernmental tensions. \u201cIt\u2019s not really anti-China, it\u2019s anti-Communist Party. I\u2019m also against the Communist Party, I don\u2019t have a good impression of them either, right?\u201d \u2018Deportation can\u2019t stop me from embracing freedom\u2019 Wan, a prominent former\u202fHIV activist in China, had to leave the country in 2010 due to harassment by Chinese authorities, he says. He received permanent US residence a year later and has gone on to help Chinese migrants in Flushing. Many of the new arrivals head to the enclave\u2019s unlicensed hostels, he said. He worries that rising hostel prices \u2013 upwards of $20 per night \u2013 could lead to a rise in homelessness, especially for the low-income elderly population in Flushing. Li Jiada lives in one of those hostels, sharing a cramped room with five other men, sparsely decorated except for a calendar hanging above his single bed. Life has not been easy for the 26-year-old, soft-spoken former fashion photographer since he arrived in the US on January 2023. He had spent three months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center after failing an initial screening for\u202fasylum\u202fwhen he crossed the southern border. He was released this year pending deportation proceedings expected within the next year. He initially struggled to find a job in New York. When he found one, he says, he was sexually harassed by a client and has since found a new role as a manicurist, earning $2,000 a month. His costs are higher than what he earns, but he says, \u201cThere\u2019s no regret because coming here has given me more options.\u201d He is desperate to stay in the US and thinks Christianity, which he discovered while in detention, will save him from deportation. The Communist Party\u202fsees any large\u202fgroup outside its dominion as a threat, has banned the online sale of Bibles, and has arrested Christians for \u201cinciting subversion of state power.\u201d \u201cMaybe my only way forward is through Jesus,\u201d he said. Li plans on filing a new\u202fasylum\u202fapplication based on his new-found religion. Sitting in a Baptist church in Flushing, Li spoke about the stress of the looming deportation and thinks back about the first thing he did when he arrived in New York: seeing the Statue of Liberty, a sculpture that has become a symbol of hope for millions of immigrants before him. \u201cAfter the treacherous journey to get here, I needed to see the embodiment of my beliefs: democracy, freedom, equality, and rule of law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US has yet to accept me, but deportation can\u2019t stop me from embracing freedom.\u201d The ethnic enclave has largely shielded the migrants CNN spoke to from a recent\u202frise\u202fin anti-Asian crimes in the city. Still, Li thinks he may have been targeted for being Chinese: Someone threw a full can of soda at him as he waited for a train back to Flushing from Manhattan, he said. And like a true New Yorker, he gave the assailant a piece of his mind. \u201cAt that moment, I felt like I could suddenly speak English fluently,\u201d he joked. \u201cMy talent was unleashed, and I said: \u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/americas/new-york-city-chinese-migrants-flushing-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_africa_meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam", "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on what was officially dubbed a 3-day private visit to Nigeria, yet it unfolded with all the grandeur and attention typically reserved for royal tours. Their first day saw them receive a red-carpet welcome complete with cultural dancers following their arrival in the Nigerian capital\u00a0of\u00a0Abuja, where they kicked off a multi-day mental health summit at Lightway Academy. There, they also unveiled a partnership between their Archewell Foundation and the\u00a0GEANCO Foundation to provide students with school supplies and menstrual products. The pair had been invited to the West African nation by the country\u2019s highest-ranking military official, Christopher Musa. After meeting him at the\u00a0Nigerian Defence Headquarters, Meghan signed a guest book thanking officials for \u201cwelcoming me home.\u201d Despite the private nature of their visit, the couple\u2019s itinerary resembled previous official tours they carried out before stepping back as senior working royals in 2020. They were warmly received everywhere they went, with Nigerians showcasing their famed hospitality. The couple were showered with gifts, including\u00a0a touching portrait of a young Harry with his mum. For both Nigeria and the Sussexes, this visit held significant weight. It was an opportunity for Nigeria to demonstrate its capability to host such high-profile guests and dispel any doubts raised by skeptics, especially considering the country\u2019s standing in the eyes of the UK\u2019s Foreign Office as one of the most dangerous countries to visit in the world. Nigeria has security issues with a terrorist insurgency in the northeast and northwest.\u00a0However, it is a huge country \u2014\u00a0 larger than the US state of Texas\u00a0 \u2014 and the other areas\u00a0visited by the royal couple over the past several days are relatively safe. Meanwhile, for Prince Harry and Meghan, this marked their first major trip to Africa since relinquishing\u00a0their official royal duties. It was a chance for them to engage in a hearts-and-minds charm offensive, which they executed with aplomb. Meghan, in particular, embraced exploring her Nigerian ancestry\u00a0after discovering several years ago\u00a0that she is 43% Nigerian\u00a0through a genealogy test. On Saturday, she co-hosted a women\u2019s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, for about 50 leading women from across Nigerian society and politics, business, media, and culture. During a panel discussion, moderated by Nigerian media mogul Mo Abudu, the duchess\u00a0spoke passionately about uncovering\u00a0her Nigerian roots and its significance to her own identity. She described Nigeria as \u201cmy country,\u201d adding\u00a0that \u201cbeing African American, part of it is not knowing so much about your lineage or background, where you come from specifically. And it was exciting \u2026 to discover more and understand what that really means.\u201d It was here that Meghan\u2019s natural ability to connect really shone through. She chatted\u00a0effortlessly with attendees, posed\u00a0for selfies and engaged\u00a0in heartfelt conversations. At another event on Sunday at the prestigious Delborough Hotel in Lagos\u00a0- where the great and good of Nigerian society had gathered to welcome the couple\u00a0-\u00a0she appeared visibly moved when three powerful traditional rulers honored her with royal titles. The Obi of Onitsha, His Majesty Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe christened Meghan \u201cAda Mazi,\u201d which means \u201cthe daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace.\u201d While, the Oluwo of Iwoland, southwest, Nigeria,\u00a0Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi christened her with the Yoruba name of \u201cAdetokunbo\u201d which means \u201croyalty from across the seas.\u201d Their engagements during the three-day visit were centered around their core passions:\u00a0sports rehabilitation,\u00a0mental health, and women\u2019s empowerment. For Harry\u2019s part, the duke\u00a0demonstrated his compassion and connection to his late mother, Princess Diana, as he visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kaduna, 150 miles from Abuja. His first stop was to drop in on the governor of Kaduna state, Senator Uba Sani, where he was again welcomed by a troupe of dancers and a red carpet.\u00a0Governor Sani sat opposite him and praised Harry as a \u201csymbol of courage,\u201d and \u201cpraised his service to his country.\u201d He added, \u201cPlease give our regards to the Duchess of Sussex, Princess Meghan.\u201d Harry toured about six wards at the Nigerian Army Reference\u00a0Hospital and met young men recuperating from their injuries. Many had been shot, ambushed by Boko Haram, or lost limbs due to blasts. One moment captured by photographer Misan Harriman, showing Harry holding a wounded soldier lying on the hospital bed resonated deeply and went viral on social media. Corporal Yusef, 23, who had been shot through the knee, spoke with the duke, who\u00a0asked him about his rehab. \u201cAre you going to try for the Invictus Games team? Are you preparing for that?\u2026 We will see you there,\u201d Harry said. Their visit also extended to cultural experiences, such as witnessing a vibrant dance performance and a polo match at the historic Lagos Polo Club. Polo holds special significance for Harry and the event provided a platform to showcase his longstanding commitment to the sport and its charitable endeavors. Amid the festivities, the couple expressed gratitude for Nigeria\u2019s warm reception.\u00a0As they bid farewell to Nigeria, Meghan declared: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to come back!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/africa/meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_world_dinosaurs-warm-blooded-science-newsletter-wt-scn", "text": "Dinosaur means \u201cterrible lizard.\u201d The idea that the prehistoric creatures were scaly, sluggish reptiles with sprawling postures that dragged their tails through tropical swamps is deeply imprinted in the collective imagination. However, science now has a more nuanced understanding of the diversity of dinosaur physiology. Many dinosaurs sported brightly colored feathers like birds. Dinos lived in many different ecosystems, including the Arctic, where they would have encountered snow (if not the ice caps of today) and winters devoid of light. New research this week is adding fresh detail to one of paleontology\u2019s biggest questions: Did dinosaur blood run hot or cold? Dino-mite It\u2019s hard to find evidence that unquestionably shows what dinosaur metabolisms were like. Clues from fossilized eggshells and bones have now suggested that some dinosaurs were warm-blooded and others were not. Gleaning the answer matters because it sheds light on dinosaur behavior. Warm-blooded animals, such as mammals and birds, are more active than their cold-blooded counterparts. A new study, based on fossils from 1,000 dinosaur species and paleoclimate information, found that the three main dinosaur groups adapted differently, with two of the groups evolving\u00a0the ability to regulate body temperature\u00a0in the early Jurassic Period about 180 million years ago. The research suggested that meat-eating theropods, which included T. rex, and plant-eating ornithischians, such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus, spread to live in colder climates during the early Jurassic Period, indicating that they may have evolved the ability to generate body heat internally. A long time ago Researchers have mapped a 40-mile-long extinct section of the Nile River through satellite radar imaging and analysis of sediment. Ancient Egyptians erected some 31 pyramids, including Giza\u2019s Great Pyramid, along the banks of the now-defunct arm of the river, which the builders likely used to transport stone and other construction materials. The discovery, buried deep beneath farmland and not visible in aerial photographs, may help archaeologists locate other Egyptian temples and monuments concealed by fields and desert sands that now cover the riverbed. Trailblazers In another feat of mapping, a 3D model of a cubic millimeter of brain tissue \u2014 smaller than a grain of rice \u2014 is now available in staggering detail and beauty, thanks to a collaboration between Harvard University and Google researchers. A team led by Dr. Jeff Lichtman, a professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard, cut the sample into thin sections one-thousandth the thickness of a human hair. Despite the fragment\u2019s tiny size, it contained 57,000 cells, 230 millimeters of blood vessels and 150 million synapses. The colorized images make the individual components more visible, but they are otherwise a truthful representation of the tissue. Eventually, the team hopes that observing the brain in this way could help scientists make sense of unresolved medical conditions such as autism. Climate changed The patterns of rings in tree trunks \u2014 affected by sunlight, rainfall and temperature \u2014 provide a climate history for each year of their lives, going back hundreds or even thousands of years. Tree-ring data from nine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America and Scandinavia, have allowed scientists to reconstruct annual temperatures for Northern Hemisphere summers between the years 1 and 1849 and compare them with last summer\u2019s temperatures. The summer of 2023 was warmer than any other summer during this 2,000-year period, according to the study. The temperature then was at least 0.5 degree Celsius (0.9 degree Fahrenheit) warmer than the warmest summer during the period studied, the year 246 \u2014 when the Roman Empire still ruled over Europe and the Maya civilization dominated Central America. Fantastic creatures Marine scientists have used artificial intelligence to decode previously unknown complexity in the calls of sperm whales. The whales produced a catalog of clicking sounds, which the researchers described as akin to a \u201cphonetic alphabet\u201d for sperm whales. Sperm whales produce clicks by forcing air through an organ in their heads called the spermaceti, and these sounds can be as loud as 230 decibels \u2014 louder than a rocket launch and capable of rupturing human eardrums. What sperm whales are saying with their clicks remains a mystery to human ears, but understanding the scope of their vocal exchanges is an important step toward linking their calls with specific behavior.

{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_blinken-kyiv-ukraine-us-support-intl-hnk", "text": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made a surprise trip to Kyiv on Tuesday, meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky as Russian forces make significant gains on the battlefield in Ukraine. Blinken\u2019s visit was the first by a Biden administration official since the long-delayed passage of US supplemental funding to the war-torn country. \u201cI have come to Ukraine with a message: You are not alone,\u201d he said during a speech at the Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. In their meeting Zelensky urged Blinken to provide more military support to the Ukrainian military, including additional air defense support. \u201cWe want to get it as soon as possible, and the second point is air defense, the biggest deficit for us. I think the biggest problem is that we really need today two patriots for the Kharkiv region, because there are people \u2013 they are under attack, civilians, warriors, everybody \u2013 they are under Russian missiles,\u201d he told reporters. Russia is pushing ahead with its\u00a0new advance\u00a0into northeastern Ukraine\u00a0after making\u00a0several major advances there over the past week \u2013 Moscow\u2019s most significant gains since Kyiv\u2019s forces recaptured Kharkiv in late summer 2022. Blinken and Zelensky \u201cdiscussed recent battlefield updates and the importance of newly-arrived U.S. security assistance to helping repel Russian attacks,\u201d US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a read-out following the meeting. In a Monday evening address, hours before he met Blinken, Zelensky said: \u201cWe understand how the enemy is acting and we see the plan to draw our forces back.\u201d US President Joe Biden\u00a0signed a\u00a0$95 billion foreign aid package\u00a0last month that includes\u00a0nearly $61 billion for Ukraine,\u00a0following a\u00a0successful six-month campaign by the White House\u00a0to build support\u00a0in a House GOP conference increasingly resistant to sending more money overseas. Blinken previously admitted that there was a \u201ccost\u201d to the delayed funding for Ukraine. But he focused his speech on what he said was support for Ukraine from\u00a0\u201ca significant majority of Americans.\u201d \u201cAfter the delay in approving the latest US assistance package to Ukraine, a delay that left you more vulnerable to Russia\u2019s attacks, some Ukrainians may be wondering whether you can count on America to sustain its commitment,\u201d Blinken said in his speech. \u201cThe $60 billion aid package that was approved by our Congress, with overwhelming support across both political parties in both houses of Congress, I think demonstrates that you can.\u201d Before he met Zelensky, Blinken said that US weapons\u00a0from that recent assistance package\u00a0had started arriving in Ukraine,\u00a0and more were on the way to help it succeed on the battlefield with Russia. \u201cWe know this is a challenging time,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cBut we also know that in the near term, the assistance is now on the way. Some of it already arrived, and more of it will be arriving, and that\u2019s going to make a real difference against the Russian aggression on the battlefield.\u201d He also praised the \u201cextraordinary courage of the Ukrainian people\u201d and said that \u201cwe are equally determined that Ukraine stands strongly on its own feet, militarily, economically, democratically, a strong, successful, thriving, free Ukraine is the best possible rebuke to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\u201d US will help build a \u2018force of the future\u2019 Amid Ukrainian\u00a0setbacks on the battlefield,\u00a0Blinken praised the country\u2019s resiliance. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing that Putin has always underestimated, but that Ukrainians understand to their core, and that\u2019s the fierceness with which free people will defend their right to shape their own destiny,\u201d Blinken said in his speech. Blinken committed to helping Ukraine build its \u201cforce of the future\u201d and\u00a0reiterated that\u00a0the US intends to\u00a0make use of seized\u00a0Russian assets to\u00a0provide funding to Ukraine for their reconstruction. \u201cOur Congress has given us the power to seize Russian assets in the United States. We intend to use it,\u201d said Blinken during the speech.\u00a0\u201cWhat Putin destroyed, Russia should and must pay to rebuild.\u201d Blinken said the US is working with other G7 countries to do the same with \u201cRussia\u2019s immobilized sovereign assets.\u201d \u201cThe G7 can unlock billions of dollars and send a powerful message to Putin that time is not on his side,\u201d said Blinken without giving a timeline for when these efforts might be realized. Western leaders have reacted with concern to Russia\u2019s new and unexpected assault in Kharkiv. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron acknowledged it was an \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d moment in the war, telling Sky News that Russia had effectively \u201cinvaded [Ukraine] again.\u201d During his fourth visit to Ukraine since the 2022 Russian invasion, Blinken also met Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba as well as with civil society and private sector partners. Blinken also used his visit to highlight the need for Ukraine to continue making democratic reforms to maintain its global coalition of support. \u201cWinning on the battlefield will prevent Ukraine from becoming part of Russia; winning the war against corruption will keep Ukraine from becoming like Russia,\u201d he said. It is \u201cimportant that Ukraine keeps taking the difficult steps to strengthen and consolidate your democracy. Because the choices that you make, the kind of democracy that you build, will determine the strength and the staying power of the coalition by Ukraine\u2019s side,\u201d Blinken said. He called on Ukraine to \u201croot out the scourge of corruption once and for all\u201d and said the US will continue supporting Kyiv\u2019s efforts. \u201cUkraine\u2019s security is eroded if the resources for its military are siphoned off by individuals looking to enrich themselves. Ukraine\u2019s economic potential is undercut if investors and innovators cannot count on a level playing field. Ukraine\u2019s democracy is weakened if citizens stop believing that they can hold their government accountable and fix the flaws in their system from within,\u201d Blinken said. \u2018Tough fight\u2019 Just days before Blinken\u2019s arrival, Ukraine\u2019s top general said the situation in the northeastern\u00a0Kharkiv region\u00a0has \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d after Russia claimed to have captured four more villages as it expanded its surprise cross-border offensive. US officials acknowledge that the slowdown in US support, due to congressional infighting, has exacerbated a challenging situation for Ukraine. \u201cThere is no doubt there has been a cost,\u201d Blinken said over the weekend on CBS. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to rush this assistance out there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a challenging moment.\u201d Some of the supplemental support is already on the front lines,\u00a0Blinken said.\u00a0Specifically the US has started to flow in\u00a0ATACMS missile systems \u201cparticularly with an eye towards Russia\u2019s activities right now in Kharkiv,\u201d\u00a0a senior US\u00a0official added. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough fight. There is no question. But we have a lot of confidence that the Ukrainians will increasingly be effective in pushing the Russians back as our assistance flows in both from the United States and other allies and partners,\u201d the official said. Russian forces have made advances south into Ukrainian villages in the Kharkiv region, after launching their surprise cross-border assault four days ago. One of the main Russian efforts appears targeted on Lyptsi, described by one Ukrainian military blogger as \u201ca very important village\u201d due to its position on\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s second defensive line. The intention behind Russia\u2019s new push, which began in the early hours of Friday morning, is unclear; it may be to create a buffer zone designed to reduce Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, or possibly even a renewed assault on the city of Kharkiv, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south. Equally, it could be an attempt to draw Ukrainian forces away from other key Russian objectives further south \u2013 a rationale Zelensky offered in a Sunday evening address. Officials have told CNN\u00a0there will be a lag time between the approval of the billions earmarked for Ukraine in the aid bill and\u00a0the\u00a0arrival\u00a0of the majority of the assistance that will make a significant difference on\u00a0the\u00a0front lines. Those officials said Western intelligence believes\u00a0Russia is seeking to exploit that gap in delivery time to further\u00a0step-up air and ground attacks on Ukraine in what it sees as a \u201cwindow of opportunity.\u201d State Department\u00a0deputy\u00a0spokesperson Vedant Patel told a news briefing Monday the US anticipates Russia will \u201cpress forward\u201d in Kharkiv, and that while Russia may \u201cmake further advances in the coming weeks,\u201d the US does not \u201canticipate any major breakthroughs.\u201d \u201cOver time, the additional influx of US assistance and continued support from partners will enable Ukraine to continue to withstand this kind of aggression,\u201d Patel said. US officials have looked to find ways to quickly provide vital military supplies to Ukraine from the\u00a0aid package,\u00a0utilizing the presidential drawdown authority (PDA), which pulls equipment from existing US stocks. Just moments after Biden signed the aid bill last month,\u00a0the US announced a $1 billion PDA package, with the president\u00a0saying at the time\u00a0that shipments of the equipment to Ukraine would begin \u201cin the next few hours.\u201d And on Friday, the US announced another\u00a0PDA package worth $400 million\u00a0and a\u00a0$30 million sale of HIMARS,\u00a0a rocket launcher that Kyiv\u2019s military has used to great effect against Russian forces. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Monday that the administration\u00a0would announce a third PDA package\u00a0in the coming days, \u201cto really accelerate the tempo of the deliveries.\u201d \u201cThe delay put Ukraine in a hole and we\u2019re trying to help them to get out of that hole as rapidly as possible,\u201d Sullivan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/europe/blinken-kyiv-ukraine-us-support-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Raisi\u2019s condition and that of Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who was also on board, remain unknown as overnight temperatures drop in the mountainous area. The aircraft came down in the early afternoon in Iran\u2019s East Azerbaijan province, sparking a massive search effort, including military drones and dozens of rescue teams, state media reported. Officials have said they were able to make contact with some of the passengers aboard the helicopter. But despite hours of searching, emergency crews have not been able to reach the crash site amid reported fog and extreme cold. A regional commander for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps announced late on Sunday night that they had detected the exact location of the crash after receiving a signal from the helicopter and the mobile phone of one of the crew, IRNA reported. \u201cMilitary forces are heading to the location and hope to have some good news,\u201d the commander reportedly said. Raisi\u2019s official Instagram account and state television have urged Iranians to pray for the president and his entourage. Iranian Supreme Leader\u00a0Ayatollah Khamenei echoed in the call in a video statement, saying, \u201cEveryone should pray for the health of this group of servants. \u2026 People of Iran, do not worry. There will be no disruption in the work of the country.\u201d Poor weather complicates search for helicopter The accident occurred as Raisi and Amir Abdollahian were returning from a ceremony for an opening of a dam on Iran\u2019s border with Azerbaijan, IRNA reported. Seven other people were also in the helicopter, according to the IRGC-run media outlet Sepah, including a local imam, the provincial governor, security staff and the helicopter\u2019s crew. Two other helicopters in the same convoy of dignitaries arrived at their destinations safely, officials said. Iranian authorities have identified a 2-kilometer radius for the crash site and believe the accident was \u201cnot severe\u201d after speaking with two people who were traveling on the downed helicopter, Iranian Vice President for Executive\u00a0Affairs\u00a0Mohsen Mansouri told Iranian semi-official FARS\u00a0news. \u201cThree helicopters were on this route, but the helicopter carrying the President lost contact with the other two. They began searching and established contact with one of the helicopter\u2019s occupants and the flight crew, indicating the incident was not severe. The Red Crescent, FRAJA, Army, and IRGC rescue teams have arrived and divided tasks,\u201d he said. The crash site is believed to be somewhere in the Dizmar Forest area between the villages of Ozi and Pir Davood, according to IRNA, which reported that residents in the northern Varzeqan region said they heard noises from the area. Poor weather and low visibility are complicating rescue efforts in the rural area. Iranian Minister of Health, Bahram Eynollahi, has warned that the crash site is very foggy, making it difficult for rescuers to search. \u201cWe have set up treatment facilities. We are now in the area and all rescue forces are busy searching,\u201d Eynollahi said on state TV Sunday. \u201cWe have deployed all medical facilities, including emergency medicine, surgery and ambulance.\u201d A deployment of helicopters in the area has already failed due to the weather, Iranian military officials said. \u201cThe helicopters of the 6th combat base of Tabriz Air Force arrived in the Varzeqan area according to the order to carry out relief operations,\u201d the\u00a0Commander of Iran\u2019s 6th Air Force Base said. \u201cThese helicopters, along with the rescue team, were sent to the helicopter accident area of the president\u2019s convoy from the early hours. Unfortunately, the operation failed due to unfavorable weather conditions.\u201d Iraq and Azerbaijan have offered assistance to Iran in the ongoing search operation. In response to requests from Iranian authorities, the European Union said it was activating its satellite mapping service, and Turkey said it would send a night-vision search and rescue helicopter, plus 32 mountaineer search and rescue personnel. Russia has also pledged to send two planes with 50 professional mountain rescuers to help reach the crash site on Monday, IRNA reported. US President Joe Biden has been briefed on the incident, according to the White House. Who is President Raisi? Raisi\u2019s powers as President are\u00a0dwarfed by those of\u00a0Supreme Leader\u00a0Ali Khamenei, who is the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic. But Raisi is widely seen as a figure in which the Iranian\u00a0clerical\u00a0establishment has heavily invested \u2013 and even as a potential successor to the 85-year-old Khamenei. Raisi\u2019s election\u00a0in 2021\u00a0was heavily engineered by the Islamic Republic\u2019s political elite so that he would run virtually uncontested. He seemed to be made in the image of the 1979 Islamic Revolution\u2019s ideals, a guarantor of its continuation even as many chafed under its ultraconservative rules. A year into his tenure, he brutally quashed a youth-led uprising over repressive laws, such as the compulsory hijab, and continued to stamp out dissent in its aftermath. Unlike his predecessor, the moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, there has been no daylight between Raisi and Khamenei.\u00a0This left\u00a0no doubt in many Iranians\u2019 minds that he has been groomed to be elevated to the Supreme Leadership. Any disruption to this vision of succession could sow further chaos in a country already buckling under significant economic and political strain.

{"id": "2024_05_19_sport_scottie-scheffler-valhalla-arrest", "text": "Top-ranked golfer Scottie Scheffler finished strong Sunday at the PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, days after being arrested as he drove to the tournament\u2019s second round. Scheffler shot a six-under par 66 to finish the tournament with a final score of 13-under \u2013 likely to fall well behind the winning pace, however. Speaking to reporters after his final round, Scheffler said he\u2019s not sure what the next steps of the legal process will be following his arrest on felony and other charges after reportedly trying to drive around the scene of a fatal crash Friday morning. \u201cI think it\u2019s all up in the air. I\u2019m not really sure what the next days have in store,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI think I\u2019m able to get home tonight, but we\u2019ll see when I leave here. I haven\u2019t really had much chance to assess the situation off the course.\u201d The 27-year-old golfer was attempting to drive to Valhalla Golf Club at about 6 a.m. Friday when he came to the scene of a fatal crash. He allegedly injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was then detained and arrested, according to police. Scheffler was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. He was released from jail and returned to the golf course for his tee time. Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steven Romines, told CNN in a statement Friday he plans to plead not guilty to the charges. According to a Louisville Metro Police report, Scheffler was trying to gain access to the golf course when he was stopped by an officer wearing a full police uniform and a yellow reflective rain jacket. The officer, identified as Det. Bryan Gillis, stopped Scheffler and attempted to give instructions. \u201cSubject refused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d the report states. Romines told CNN it had been a chaotic situation for his client. \u201cHe was proceeding as directed by another traffic officer and driving a marked player\u2019s vehicle with credentials visible,\u201d Romines said. \u201cIn the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer\u2019s traffic signals resulting in these charges.\u201d Romines said Scheffler had stopped immediately when directed and never assaulted an officer. In a statement, Scheffler said he had been proceeding as directed and \u201cthere was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do.\u201d The Jefferson County Attorney\u2019s Office said Sunday officials had \u201cmade no decisions\u201d in Scheffler\u2019s case. \u201cWe continue to gather information in the case and will review and proceed accordingly,\u201d the office said in a statement. Scheffler\u2019s arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday. His arrest represents a stark contrast from his clean image, David Dusek, senior writer at Golfweek said after the player\u2019s arrest Friday. \u201cScottie Scheffler is one of the most squeaky clean, upright, outstanding, well-respected players out here on the PGA Tour,\u201d Dusek said. \u201cHe is someone who is known for having a very calm, level head on the golf course and he keeps that when he\u2019s off the golf course as well.\u201d The World No. 1 said he\u2019s currently planning to play at next week\u2019s PGA Tour event, the Charles Schwab Challenge, in Fort Worth, Texas. Scheffler resides in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and he and his wife Meredith welcomed their first child this month.

{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_ai-high-school", "text": "At Princeton High School, students are trying to combat the rapid decline of indigenous languages with some unlikely help: a furry, wide-eyed stuffed animal named Che\u2019w. But Che\u2019w isn\u2019t a standard plush toy. He\u2019s a wildly intelligent generative AI robot that speaks Mam, a Mayan language spoken in the western highlands of Guatemala and Mexico and by a small population of the school\u2019s students.\u00a0The language is currently at risk of extinction, according to UNESCO; the students hope Che\u2019w can help change that. At a time when some high schools are restricting the use of AI in the classroom, others, like Princeton High School, are leaning into it. In the short 18 months since the launch of viral chatbot ChatGPT, generative AI has emerged as a revolutionary technology in the field of artificial intelligence. Its capabilities have impressed both users and experts with its ability to perform a range of tasks, from generating creative content, essays and games to conducting mathematical equations, summarizing complicated concepts and more. All that is already reshaping various parts of our lives, including education. But the technology has leaped ahead far faster, in many cases, than schools\u2019 understanding of how to use it. And with new products out this week from Google\u2019s XYZ initiative and OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o, many teachers and districts realize they cannot avoid the subject. Dr. Joy Barnes-Johnson, the science administrator for PHS, said the school is \u201ctrying to embrace AI\u201d as much as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a tool, just like a pencil is technology that helps communication.\u201d She said the school will host an AI summit this summer with its teachers and administrators to have a conversation about how generative AI should or shouldn\u2019t be used in the classroom. \u201cIn the beginning of the school year, we talked about how AI is the world we\u2019re in now and we have a responsibility to prepare kids for the world they will inherit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea is that it will help people connect and learn, so we [as teachers] have to not be afraid of it.\u201d Proceeding with caution When ChatGPT launched in November 2022, teachers worried that the tool, which can generate convincing responses and essays in response to user prompts, could make it easier for students to cheat on assignments. Some also worried ChatGPT and similar tools could be used to spread inaccurate information. Not long after its launch, New York City public schools became one of the first school districts to ban students and teachers from using ChatGPT on the district\u2019s networks and devices. Other schools reacted similarly in the weeks and months that followed, including the Los Angeles Unified School District and Seattle Public Schools, which blocked access to ChatGPT on their networks. Some of these districts have evolved their policies over time. The LAUSD, for example, has since launched a chatbot named \u201cEd\u201d to act as a student advisor, with the ability to inform parents about information ranging from children\u2019s test results to their school attendance. Many schools also continue to grapple with how to best approach the technology inside the classroom. \u201cThere is acceptance by educators, but we\u2019re still seeing a lot of caution,\u201d said Noel Candelaria, the secretary-treasurer of the National Education Association who is leading the charge around the union\u2019s AI policy. \u201cThe challenge is there isn\u2019t a lot of guidance on the district level, so the concern educators have is that it\u2019s being something done to them, instead of with them.\u201d He added: \u201cThere are also major concerns around data confidentiality and where data is being pulled from.\u201d Candelaria told CNN that educators feel strongly that they want their voice to influence how it can be applied to schools. The NEA is developing a task force with educators across the country to address many of these issues. Beyond generative AI Some high schools around the country are\u00a0trying to teach students how to use other forms of artificial intelligence for a greater good. At one prestigious public school in New York City, Stuyvesant High School, students created an app for the blind that uses artificial intelligence and tactile feedback to help people detect threats and navigate obstacles.  Similarly, at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Colorado, a team of students developed an AI-powered\u00a0wildlife detection system called Project Deer to help cut down on car crashes. Although researchers have tried to combat such accidents before, studies have shown wildlife don\u2019t consistently react to any one stimulus. So the students instead derived an AI-based predictive solution to alert the driver to an imminent threat on the road. Using four $5 infrared detection sensors placed on vehicles, the students developed a system for\u00a0AI to scan the surroundings and emit a high-pitched sound when an animal\u2019s body heat is detected, a signal that may help to scare the animal away. The school, which was the\u00a0Colorado State Winner in Samsung\u2019s annual Solve for Tomorrow competition, said it is partnering with the University of Colorado in Boulder this summer to help boost its success rate. The Solve for Tomorrow contest featured more than 1,000 schools submitting STEM-based solutions to real-world problems. Samsung told CNN there was a \u201cdefinite uptick in\u201d submitted AI-powered innovations this year compared to previous years. Computer science teacher Tylor Chacon told CNN the group\u2019s big vision is to one day have the technology regulated or adopted by the state for greater use. School administration has told teachers to help create rubrics or lesson plans, Chacon told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged to embrace it and look into ways we can use it to maximize our own job effectiveness and ease the burden on us,\u201d he said. It\u2019s an increasingly common trend among teachers to use AI tools to create assignments, quizzes, polls, videos and interactives for classroom use. Some are even turning to AI tools and platforms \u2014 such as ChatGPT, Writable, Grammarly and EssayGrader \u2014 to assist with grading papers or writing feedback, a practice that is also raising ethical considerations. Saving a language, learning the future Still, as schools continue to weigh the benefits or disadvantages to teaching and using artificial intelligence, some teachers and administrators feel strongly that it\u2019s the future. At Princeton High, a group of about 14 students met during school hours for months to build out Che\u2019w\u2019s conversational capabilities, drawn from artificial intelligence neural networks that are trained to recognize patterns, solve problems and understand words, sentences and phrases from spoken and written language. Che\u2019w, which translates to \u201cstar\u201d in Mam, was trained to understand the language by the students so it can serve as a personal tutor. The robot is also trained to speak Spanish and English. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t lose patience or get sick of talking to them,\u201d said Mark Eastburn, Princeton High School\u2019s science, research and engineering teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s taking [AI] off the screen and putting it onto a physical structure that looks like a friend that can help you do whatever you need to do.\u201d In April, the students were one of the top three National Winners at the Samsung Solve For Tomorrow\u2019s competition. AI is now a part of students\u2019 lives, Eastburn said. \u201cAnd it will be there when they\u2019re in college and also in their careers,\u201d he added, \u201cso they might as well learn and use it in appropriate ways in high school, if not even earlier.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/ai-high-school/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Animals in the news It\u2019s bad enough when travelers must deal with misbehaving crowds and unruly passengers. But at times, it seems like even the animal kingdom has it out for folks on the go. We\u2019ll start off in the ocean: Early this week, an unknown number of orcas sank a sailing yacht after ramming it in Moroccan waters in the Strait of Gibraltar. The vessel toyed with by the orcas was no tiny boat either \u2013 it measured 15 meters (49 feet) in length. And this isn\u2019t the first ramming incident in the area.

For instance, the tropical Atlantic getaway of Turks and Caicos strictly enforces its laws against bringing firearms and ammunition to the islands. Five US tourists have been arrested on ammo charges in recent months. If convicted, they could face years in jail abroad. It also pays to stay abreast of gun laws \u2013 and to check your carry-ons carefully \u2013 in the United States, too. \u00a0The Atlanta Police Department said this week it will arrest people caught with loaded guns in their bags at Hartsfield-Jackson International, the world\u2019s busiest airport, after years of letting many walk away without being arrested, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_georgia-foreign-agents-law-explained-intl", "text": "Georgia\u2019s parliament passed a highly controversial \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that has triggered widespread protests across the former Soviet republic nestled in the Caucasus Mountains. Tens of thousands of people in capital city Tbilisi have been protesting the legislation. Critics warn that it mirrors a foreign agents law already passed in Russia and could jeopardize Georgia\u2019s bid to join the European Union. But Prime Minister\u00a0Irakli Kobakhidze succeeded and got it through the parliament on Tuesday, with 84 lawmakers voting in favor of the law and 30 against it in the 150-seat legislature. President Salome Zourabichvili has vowed to veto the law, but the parliament can easily override her. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the law and the uproar it has caused. What\u2019s in the law? The law will require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d or face crippling fines. The legislation was drafted by the Georgian Dream party, which along with its allies controls parliament. Zourabichvili called the bill \u201can exact duplicate\u201d of its Russian counterpart in an interview with CNN. What happens next? Zourabichvili has vowed to veto the bill, but that won\u2019t mean much. She now has two weeks to do so. But the Georgian parliament can override her objection with a simple majority. Georgia\u2019s government is a parliamentary system, so Zourabichvili is effectively a figurehead. Real power lies with Kobakhidze, the PM. Georgian Dream\u2019s billionaire founder, former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, also wields significant political influence. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Zourabichvili said the upcoming elections in October will give the population a chance to \u201creverse\u201d the bill. \u201cWe have to use this mobilization of the society and this consolidation of the political parties to go and win those elections because that\u2019s the European way,\u201d she said. Why is it so controversial? A couple of reasons. The law is modeled after a similar one in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society. Many Georgians fear their foreign agents law will be used to the same way it has been in its northern neighbor: to quash dissent and free expression by going after nongovernmental organizations with financial ties overseas. The law has had a devastating impact on non-profits and human rights groups in Russia, forcing many to cease their activities. Georgian Dream contends the legislation will promote transparency and national sovereignty and has hit back at Western criticism over the proposal. But the law\u2019s possible passage has touched on a more existential question: whether Georgia\u2019s future lies with Europe or Russia. Georgia has, like Ukraine, been caught between the two geopolitical forces since achieving independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Many Georgians feel deep hostility toward the Kremlin, which invaded Georgia in 2008 and occupies about 20% of its internationally recognized territory \u2013 about the same proportion that Russia occupies in Ukraine. Georgian Dream has long been accused of harboring pro-Russian sympathies, especially given that Ivanishvili made his fortune in the Soviet Union. How do most Georgians feel about it? Passionately. So much so that lawmakers at one point came to blows over the bill. Polling shows that about 80% of Georgians support joining the European Union rather than drifting further into the Kremlin\u2019s orbit, and many of those in favor of deepening ties with the West have taken to the streets. Mass demonstrations against the bill in Tbilisi had been going on nightly for a month before its passing. About 50,000 people came out Sunday evening in the capital, which is home to about 1 million people, to speak out against what they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cthe Russian law.\u201d There have been counter-protests as well. One saw the usually reclusive Ivanishvili deliver a rare speech to a crowd of supporters bussed in to Tbilisi from Georgia\u2019s rural regions, where Georgian Dream enjoys more support. The address showed deep paranoia and an autocratic streak. Ivanishvili claimed that Georgia was being controlled by \u201ca pseudo-elite nurtured by a foreign country\u201d and pledged to go after his political opponents after October\u2019s elections. Didn\u2019t Georgia already go through this? Yes, just last year. Georgia\u2019s government tried to pass the same law but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after a week of intense\u00a0protests, which saw citizens waving EU flags buffeted back by water cannons. The bill was reintroduced in March, about a month after Kobakhidze became Prime Minister. This time, authorities seem determined to push the legislation through. What have other countries said? White House national security adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan wrote on X that Washington is \u201cdeeply alarmed about democratic backsliding in\u00a0Georgia.\u201d \u201cGeorgian parliamentarians face a critical choice \u2013 whether to support the\u00a0Georgian people\u2019s Euro-Atlantic aspirations or pass a Kremlin-style foreign agents\u2019 law that runs counter to democratic values,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stand with the\u00a0Georgian people.\u201d The Kremlin has claimed that the law was being used to \u201cprovoke anti-Russian sentiments,\u201d adding that protests against it were being stirred by \u201coutside\u201d influences. \u201cThis is now the normal practice of a huge number of states that are doing everything to protect themselves from outside influence, from foreign influence on domestic politics. And all countries are taking action in one form or another, but all these bills have the same goal,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in April. \u201cOnce again, there is no way to link this bill and the desire to secure Georgia\u2019s internal politics with some kind of Russian influence; this is not the case.\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement earlier this month that she was following the developments in George with \u201cgreat concern\u201d and reiterated Brussels\u2019 unease over the law. \u201cGeorgia is at a crossroads. It should stay the course on the road to Europe,\u201d she said. Could the law impact Georgia\u2019s ability to join the EU? Definitely. Georgia first applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, an important but still early step in the process of becoming a member of the bloc.

{"id": "2024_05_17_europe_ukraine-satellite-images-crimea-belbek-jets-destroyed-intl-hnk", "text": "Satellite images exclusively obtained by CNN show three destroyed Russian jets and damaged buildings at Belbek airbase in occupied port city of Sevastopol on Wednesday. The hardware losses come after two days of attacks by the Ukrainians\u00a0on Sevastopol in Crimea,\u00a0which was\u00a0illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. In images taken by US real-time space-based intelligence company\u00a0BlackSky and space technology firm Maxar, two jets can be seen burned out on the main flight line at Belbek, in addition to a third parked on a protective embankment. The satellite images also show a destroyed building nearby and another which has taken significant damage. Mikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-appointed governor of Sevastopol, said on Telegram Friday that the Russians \u201csuccessfully repelled a massive enemy attack on Sevastopol.\u201d Razvozhaev said \u201cdozens\u201d of unmanned aerial vehicles and \u201cmore than five sea drones were destroyed.\u201d\u00a0The city suffered a partial power outage due to drone debris falling on a power substation, he added. The attack is the second time Belbek was targeted by the Ukrainians in the last 48 hours. When questioned about a possible Ukrainian strike on Belbek, Dmytro Pletenchuk, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian army\u2019s South, said on Thursday, \u201cWe cannot announce any details at this time because there is no verified information at this time.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian military for an update. An insurgent Ukrainian group in Crimea, Atesh, claimed on Telegram after the second strike that an artillery warehouse at Belbek airfield was damaged. \u201cSignificant damage to the airfield infrastructure as a result of secondary detonation was also recorded,\u201d it said. But none of the satellite images seen by CNN showed any signs that a missile or artillery weapons warehouse was hit, or that secondary detonations occurred. While Moscow appears to have the upper hand in its ground campaign more recently, Kyiv\u2019s forces have enjoyed sustained successes targeting Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, in either missile strikes or sea drone attacks. In March, Ukraine says it hit two Russian naval vessels, along with a communications center and several other facilities belonging to the Black Sea Fleet, in a huge overnight attack. Ukraine\u00a0said the vessels hit were two amphibious landing ships, the Yamal and the Azov. More than 20 Russian naval vessels have now been disabled or destroyed, a third of the entire fleet. Though Ukraine has virtually no navy of its own,\u00a0technological innovation, audacity and Russian incompetence have given it the upper hand in much of the Black Sea. In October last year, satellite imagery indicated that\u00a0Russia\u00a0relocated some of its naval ships away from Sevastopol after a series of Ukrainian attacks. Russia advances in Ukraine The attack at Belbek comes as Russia makes advances in northeastern Ukraine,\u00a0prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0to\u00a0postpone his participation in all international events\u00a0in\u00a0the coming days as his troops defend against the surprise offensive\u00a0in the Kharkiv region. The offensive is the most serious\u00a0cross-border ground assault\u00a0since Ukraine recaptured the Kharkiv region in the late summer of 2022. It\u00a0comes as Ukrainians struggle with thinly stretched forces, artillery and inadequate air defenses as it awaits much-needed ammunition and weapons pledged as part of a long-delayed $2 billion US military financing package. Russian forces have taken control of more than nine villages close to the border since the start of Moscow\u2019s push. The town of Vovchansk, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv,\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, is the scene of some of the most intense battles. However, NATO believes Russian troops don\u2019t have the numbers necessary for a \u201cstrategic\u201d breakthrough in\u00a0Kharkiv, a senior commander of the military alliance said on Thursday. Gen. Christopher Cavoli, Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told a press conference in Brussels that while the Russians have the \u201cability to make local advances,\u201d they \u201cdon\u2019t have the skill and the capability to do it, to operate at the scale necessary to exploit any breakthrough to strategic advantage.\u201d Zelensky met with senior military officials in Kharkiv earlier on Thursday. He described an \u201cextremely difficult\u201d outlook for Kyiv\u2019s troops on the ground, where \u201cwe are strengthening our units.\u201d It comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing on Thursday and the two pledged to deepen their strategic partnership in a stark show of their\u00a0growing alignment. Russia\u2019s economy has become increasingly reliant\u00a0on China since Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and a sweeping joint\u00a0statement laid out their countries\u2019 alignment on a host of issues including energy, trade, security, and geopolitics with specific references to Ukraine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/europe/ukraine-satellite-images-crimea-belbek-jets-destroyed-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_middleeast_egypt-warns-israel-dire-repercussions-rafah-operation-mime-intl", "text": "Egypt could consider downgrading relations with Israel if it presses on with a military operation in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah on the Egyptian border, an Egyptian official told CNN. \u201cEverything is possible and is on the table, including the downgrade of the relations. But we are not there yet. We are talking to the Israelis, trying to explain and reach a consensus,\u201d the official said. The official said that coordination between the two countries on the Rafah operation, which Egypt has publicly opposed, \u201cdidn\u2019t go well. And that\u2019s why we warned Israel of dire repercussions.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Israeli foreign ministry for comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Egypt was considering downgrading ties with Israel. The two countries had been at loggerheads this week after Israel began a limited military operation in Rafah last week and seized the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt. Egypt subsequently refused to coordinate aid deliveries into Gaza with Israel. The official told CNN earlier that aid deliveries to Palestinians could be halted because Egypt can\u2019t guarantee the safety of its trucks, as they may come under attack by Palestinian militants targeting Israeli troops. The top diplomats in both countries traded blame over the closure of the Rafah crossing as aid deliveries through the key land crossing halted. Rafah had been the entry point for nearly a quarter of the relief entering the Gaza Strip before Israel\u2019s operation. On Tuesday, the US State Department warned that only 50 humanitarian aid trucks made it through to Gaza on Sunday, down from hundreds per day in previous weeks, adding that the number is \u201cnot nearly enough.\u201d Israel placed the blame for the crossing\u2019s closure on Egypt. In a statement on X, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday said he had spoken to UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock \u201cabout the need to persuade Egypt to reopen the Rafah crossing to allow the continued delivery of international humanitarian aid to Gaza.\u201d The Israeli minister\u2019s comments drew backlash from Egypt\u2019s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, who rejected Katz\u2019 statement, calling it a \u201cpolicy of distorting the facts.\u201d Shoukry stated Egypt\u2019s \u201ccategorical rejection of the policy of distorting the facts and disavowing responsibility followed by the Israeli side,\u201d adding that Katz\u2019s remarks are \u201cdesperate attempts by Israel to hold Egypt responsible for the unprecedented humanitarian crisis facing the Gaza Strip.\u201d The crisis, Shoukry said, \u201cis a direct result of indiscriminate Israeli attacks against the Palestinians for more than seven months.\u201d Israel has said that it will never let Hamas take control of the border crossing. The Egyptian official told CNN that Egypt didn\u2019t want Hamas to be in control either, but that Israeli control is also unacceptable. \u201cIt needs to be in the hands of the Palestinians,\u201d the official said, adding that the crossing could be placed under the control of the Palestinian civil defense. \u201cThese are neither Hamas nor Fatah (a rival party to Hamas).\u201d Israeli troops at the Egyptian border Adding to tensions are Israeli military movements that have seen the Jewish state\u2019s tanks and soldiers operating on Egypt\u2019s doorstep, causing outrage in Egyptian media for alleged violations of the 1979 peace treaty signed between the two countries. Israeli troops have crossed into an area that was demilitarized in that treaty four decades ago \u2013 including parts of a border zone known as the Philadelphi Corridor, where the Rafah crossing lies. Videos released by the Israeli military last week showed Israeli flags raised on the Palestinian side of the frontier. The Philadelphi Corridor is a 14-kilometer (about 8.7 mile) long and 100-meter-wide strip of land running along the border between Gaza and Egypt. The corridor is key to the 1979 treaty, a pact that saw Egypt and Israel end their enmity and which restricted the number of troops each side can place near the other\u2019s territory. Changes to the security presence in the area must be made with mutual agreement. Over the years, amendments to security agreements between Egypt and Israel have allowed Cairo to boost its security presence in the Sinai Peninsula, which borders Israel. Israel has not disclosed the scale of its military presence in Rafah. But according to the 1979 peace treaty, which was drawn up before Israel unilaterally withdrew troops from Gaza in 2005, Israel is allowed a limited force of four infantry battalions in Zone D \u2013 where the Philadelphi Corridor lies. These battalions may consist of up to 180 armored personnel vehicles and a total of four thousand personnel. The presence of tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft missiles, except individual surface-to-air missiles, isn\u2019t allowed, the treaty says. It is unclear how many troops Israel now has stationed across the border in Rafah. Asked by CNN about the scale of its military operation in the city, and whether it was coordinated with the Egyptians, the IDF declined to comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/middleeast/egypt-warns-israel-dire-repercussions-rafah-operation-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_asia_romulus-whitaker-snakeman-india-spc-c2e", "text": "Moving from America to India as a child in the 1950s would likely be a challenging experience for most, but for Romulus Whitaker it was a dream come true \u2014 he had arrived in \u201cthe land of cobras,\u201d he explained to CNN. Whitaker would go on to earn the nickname \u201cSnakeman of India,\u201d and spend more than six decades dedicated to reptile research and conservation. He\u2019s written several books on snakes, spearheaded a lifesaving anti-venom program, and launched wildlife research stations throughout the country. His field work with snakes and crocodiles ultimately led his conservation efforts to help save India\u2019s rainforests. Today, Whitaker\u2019s focus is on educating Indians on how to protect themselves from snakes \u2014 part of a national campaign to reduce the snakebite mortality rate. CNN spoke with Whitaker recently at his home in Mysore, southwestern India, around the release of the first volume of his memoir: \u201cSnakes, Drugs and Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll: My Early Years.\u201d The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: How did you first become interested in snakes? Whitaker: I started out as a very young lad in northern New York state, turning over rocks and finding bugs and stuff, until I found a snake, and it was love at first sight. It really started then. But I must blame or thank my mother for when I first brought a snake home. She said, \u2018wow, how beautiful.\u2019 And now, which mother would do that? Not very many. Then, when my mother married Rama Chattopadhyay and we moved to India, that was something that opened up the world to me. Can you imagine an eight-year-old arriving in Bombay and being able to go out into the jungles of India? These are dreams that I had when I was a little kid, which came alive. CNN: What does a herpetologist do and what was your journey to becoming one? Whitaker: A herpetologist is a strange person who studies reptiles. I\u2019ve concentrated most of my work on snakes and crocodiles, but I am very interested in all the others \u2026 the turtles, the lizards, and of course the amphibians, the frogs and toads. I\u2019ve been doing this forever, ever since I was four years old when I picked up my first snake. [In 1960] I was going to college in America, but I flunked out. Then I got a job at the Miami Serpentarium and worked for this gentleman [Bill Haast] who handled king cobras with the greatest of ease and extracted their venom. That was part of the love affair that I generated for king cobras. But I had always yearned to come back to India and get out to Western Ghats, where I knew king cobras still lived, and start studying them. In 1969, I set up India\u2019s first snake park, the Madras Snake Park. And we\u2019ve learned more about king cobra behavior and about their wonderful lifestyle than had ever been known by anybody before. CNN: Have you ever been scared of a snake? Whitaker: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been scared of a snake. I\u2019ve been scared of myself sometimes doing stupid things. I saw a black-tailed [snake] disappearing into the bushes, and I thought, \u2018ah, big rat snake.\u2019 And I dove on it, typical football tackle, grabbed it by the tail and suddenly this hooded snake rises up over me and I looked up and said, \u2018oh no, I think I\u2019ve caught the wrong tail.\u2019 And I let it go. It was a king cobra, the first one I had ever found. It was scary. Okay, I am scared sometimes. CNN: How did you first get involved with the indigenous Irula tribe to help create anti-venom to treat people bitten by snakes? Whitaker: The Irulas are an aboriginal tribe here in South India. Their expertise is finding and catching snakes and their specialty [was] catching snakes for their skins. But they had run out of a way to make a living because the snakeskin industry had been banned [in 1972]. So we hatched an idea together to set up a venom cooperative, the Irula Snake Catchers Cooperative, wherein they would catch snakes from the wild, extract the venom, and then release the snakes back to the wild. And the venom, it was used to make anti-venom to save millions of lives. CNN: Today a big focus of your work is preventing snakebites in the first place. Tell us more about that. Whitaker: Up until recently, we really didn\u2019t know how many people are getting killed and injured by snakes. The Centre for Global Health Research and the University of Toronto started doing this Million Deaths Study. And I\u2019m a coauthor of two of the major papers produced out of this study, and it turns out that close to 50,000 people are actually killed by snake bite every year in India. Now that we know the figure, we are working very hard right now on an educational program, which is nationwide, trying to teach people how to avoid snakes and avoid getting bitten. It\u2019s fairly simple: at night when you walk around, use a light. When you sleep, use a mosquito net. We tell people when they\u2019re working in the field, when they\u2019re doing agriculture, use a stick. Don\u2019t use your bare hand because a snake could be there. So it\u2019s just educating people. These are simple methods. CNN: At what point in your career did you get involved with conservation? Whitaker: My early, formative years were not very conservation-oriented. I was the kid with a gun, and I would go out there and instead of being a bird watcher, I was a bird shooter. The transition from being from a hunter to a conservationist happened [in the 1970s] when I realized that things were really out of hand here, and crocodiles were almost extinct by that time. And we really had to do something about it. I realized that unless I got into conservation, there\u2019s not going to be anything left. I set up field stations along with my colleagues and they are magnets for people who want to get into working with reptiles. And we\u2019ve had dozens and dozens of people who have now turned out to be some of the greatest conservationists in India we can call graduates of these stations. CNN: You\u2019re currently working on a three-part memoir. What would you like your legacy to be? Whitaker: People will remember me, like it or not, as a snake freak. But it\u2019s wonderful to think [of] the influence that I have had or that our organizations have had to engender this incredible deep interest in something which people sneered at or ran away from all their lives, but now suddenly, hey, they\u2019re interesting, they\u2019re hip, they\u2019re in. Snakes rule! And it\u2019s wonderful to realize that dozens, if not hundreds, of young people have continued to do wonderful work with reptiles. It\u2019s just wonderful.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/asia/romulus-whitaker-snakeman-india-spc-c2e/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

These are just three of the models who have graced the cover of Sports Illustrated\u2019s famous \u2014 and at times controversial \u2014 \u201cSwimsuit Edition.\u201d Now, to celebrate the special issue\u2019s 60th year in print, the magazine has unveiled seven new covers featuring 27 women and reuniting past cover models for a \u201cLegends\u201d photo shoot. Kate Upton, Chrissy Teigen, plus-size model Hunter McGrady, and CBS News host Gayle King all posed for their own solo covers. (This marks the fourth time Upton has appeared on the magazine\u2019s cover, and the second time for Teigen.) The remaining three \u201cLegends\u201d covers feature alumni including Chanel Iman, Maye Musk, Megan Rapinoe and Winnie Harlow, among others, as well as snowboarder (and gold medal-winning Paralympian) Brenna Huckaby, the first amputee model to appear in the \u201cSwimsuit Edition\u201d and Halima Aden, the first hijabi model. In a news release, Sports Illustrated editor-in-chief MJ Day said that the \u201cSwimsuit Edition\u201d has \u201ctranscended its origins.\u201d What \u201cbegan as a mere diversion in the winter months when the sports calendar was relatively empty\u201d is now \u201ca global symbol of empowerment, diversity and positivity.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve done our best to honor women of all shapes, sizes, ages and backgrounds,\u201d said Day. \u201cWe\u2019ve strived to reshape societal norms and redefine the standards of beauty.

Since then, the yearly special issue has become a mainstay. It has at times attracted criticism because of its focus on women\u2019s bodies. Over the past few years, the magazine has included a more diverse range of fashion models in its pages, including trans models Leyna Bloom and Valentina Sampaio (as well as the trans singer Kim Petras), older models like Musk, and plus-size models like Ashley Graham and McGrady. The magazine has also expanded its portfolio of cover stars to feature musicians, athletes and celebrities like Beyonc\u00e9, Kim Kardashian, Naomi Osaka and Megan Thee Stallion. \u201cWith each passing year, we have challenged ourselves to push boundaries and redefine what it means to be Sports Illustrated Swimsuit,\u201d said Day in the news release. \u201cWhile this year\u2019s issue is a tribute to the recent past, it\u2019s also a reminder of the work we must continue to do.

{"id": "2024_05_18_asia_tsai-taiwan-map-china-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "Tsai Ing-wen never set out to be a leader. Growing up shy, she aspired to become an archeologist, because \u201cpeople that are dead already wouldn\u2019t jump up and argue with you.\u201d But instead of picking over the remains of history, the self-described introvert ended up charting a new course for Taiwan in some of the world\u2019s choppiest geopolitical waters. \u201cAt this very moment, Taiwan faces a difficult situation,\u201d Tsai said in her inauguration speech when she became the island\u2019s first female president in 2016.\u00a0She was handed a flatlining economy, a lagging military and a groundswell of discontent over her predecessor\u2019s push to forge closer ties with neighboring China, an authoritarian giant that has vowed to one day absorb the self-ruled democracy. Eight years on, as the 67-year-old prepares to step down after two terms in office, she leaves the island of 23 million people with an elevated international profile, a firmer partnership with the United States, ongoing defense reforms and a consolidated sense of its distinct Taiwanese identity. It is also left with the looming threat of invasion by China, which has grown more assertive and belligerent under strongman leader Xi Jinping. Xi has ramped up pressure on Taiwan and vowed to never renounce the use of force to bring it under control. While supporters applaud Tsai for standing up to China, defending Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty, freedom and democracy, critics blame her for straining ties with Beijing, stoking cross-strait tensions. Under Tsai, Taiwan, which has its own past of brutal authoritarian rule and repression of minorities, has championed LGBTQ rights and become a bastion of democracy and liberal values in Asia, offering a stark contrast to Xi\u2019s authoritarian, socially conservative and patriarchal vision for China. Domestically, there have been mounting public grievances over livelihood issues, especially Taiwan\u2019s stubbornly low wages and unaffordable housing. But according to multiple polls, Tsai is leaving office with a net-positive approval rating \u2013 unprecedented among Taiwan\u2019s outgoing leaders in the democratic era. On Monday, Tsai will hand the baton to her former premier and vice president Lai Ching-te, who will be sworn in as Taiwan\u2019s new president after winning the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) an unprecedented third term in January. Days before the election, Tsai summed up the island\u2019s transformation over the past eight years in her last New Year\u2019s address as president. \u201cWhat has changed is that Taiwan is no longer overlooked,\u201d she said. \u201cIf someone were to ask me what my legacy for Taiwan is, I would say that I am leaving behind a Taiwan of the world.\u201d An unconventional politician Tsai is an unconventional politician in Taiwan. Reserved by nature, she cut a quiet figure in a boisterous democracy known for its festival-like rallies and emotional political speeches. She never married or had children and is an animal lover whose beloved pets frequently featured on her social media accounts, something that endeared her to many young people. She used to be so shy that she would lower her head to avoid meeting people\u2019s eyes when walking down the street, Wellington Koo, her national security advisor, said in Taiwan in Transition, a documentary on Tsai\u2019s presidency. In another documentary, Invisible Nation, Tsai admitted she never dreamed of becoming a president and dreaded talking to people when she was young. \u201cI wanted a quiet life. I thought I would become a historian or an archeologist to study things that happened in the past, (because) people that are dead already wouldn\u2019t jump up and argue with you,\u201d she said. But she ended up studying law and becoming a professor, before working as a trade negotiator for Taiwan and a government minister responsible for China policy. Years working as a non-partisan technocrat imbued her with a \u201cmodest, quiet and calm\u201d style of leadership, according to Invisible Nation\u2019s director Vanessa Hope. Tsai entered politics at 48 years old, when she joined the ruling DPP in 2004. Four years later, the political latecomer faced little competition to become DPP\u2019s chairperson as the party reeled from a crushing presidential election defeat. She first ran for president in 2012, but lost to incumbent Ma Ying-jeou from the Kuomintang (KMT). She succeeded at the second try, making history not only as Taiwan\u2019s first woman president, but also one of the first women in Asia elected to top office without hailing from a political dynasty. \u201cPeople always think that I\u2019m a very cold person,\u201d Tsai said in Invisible Nation. \u201cBut the day I was elected president, that was the most emotional moment in my life.\u201d \u2018Put Taiwan on the map\u2019 Since Tsai took office, Taiwan has been caught in an intensifying battle for dominance between China and the US, a global pandemic and the geopolitical and economic fallouts from raging wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Through it all, the island has boosted its international standing and recognition, bolstering its role as a key democratic partner and an indispensable link in the global microchip supply chain. In 2019, Taiwan became the first Asian jurisdiction to legalize same-sex marriage. In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, it won international praise for its exemplary response and efforts to help other countries, despite its exclusion from the World Health Organization (WHO). Taipei has also enjoyed a surge of international backing from like-minded partners, including the US, Japan and the Czech Republic. \u201cShe\u2019ll be known as the one who put Taiwan on the map internationally,\u201d said Wen-ti Sung, a Taipei-based fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global China Hub. During China\u2019s rapid rise to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy and a major power, Taiwan had at times found itself something of an afterthought.\u00a0Now, the island\u2019s strategic importance \u2013 it is the world\u2019s largest producer of advanced semiconductors \u2013 has thrust it to the center of geopolitical calculations, with peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait becoming a matter of global concern. Amid hardening global fault lines, Tsai worked to strengthen ties with the US during both the Trump and Biden administrations. The two sides bolstered economic cooperation, reciprocated high-level political visits and expanded US arms sales to Taiwan. Support for Taiwan has become one of the few issues of bipartisan consensus ahead of the US presidential elections. \u201cWe have seen a normative shift in the way that Western governments talk about Taiwan, in ways that legitimize its sovereignty,\u201d said Amanda Hsiao, senior China analyst for the International Crisis Group. \u201cUS-China competition and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine were also factors that accelerated this trend. But she took advantage of the geopolitical winds.\u201d Despite tightening ties with its most important security guarantor, the island\u00a0lost 10 diplomatic allies to Beijing during Tsai\u2019s tenure. It has also been excluded from the WHO\u2019s annual assembly since 2016, losing its previous observer status since Tsai took office. Standing up to China Poaching Taiwan\u2019s dwindling number of diplomatic allies and blocking it from attending the World Health Assembly as an observer is widely seen as part of Beijing\u2019s efforts to pressure Tsai into toeing its political line. Unlike the opposition KMT, Tsai and the DPP have refused to endorse the so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d that both Taiwan and the mainland belong to \u201cone China,\u201d but with different interpretations of what that means. Beijing, which deems the tacit agreement a precondition for dialogue, has cut official contact with Taipei since Tsai took office. In addition to the diplomatic squeeze, Xi has ramped up economic and military coercion, slapping tariffs on Taiwanese imports and routinely sending warplanes close to the island. Tensions came to a head in August 2022, when China fired missiles into waters around Taiwan and simulated a blockade with fighter jets and warships to show its displeasure with then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei. But Tsai also maintained a deliberately cautious stance, avoiding provoking Beijing with endorsement of Taiwan\u2019s formal independence, something many in her party openly favor and advocate for. Instead, she argued that Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China, is already \u201can independent country\u201d and therefore has no need to declare independence. Analysts say Tsai moved the DPP\u2019s position on cross-strait relations closer to the center of politics in Taiwan, from a more fiercely pro-independence stance. Polls show growing numbers of Taiwanese \u2013 especially young people \u2013 view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese and have no desire to be part of China. Less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification, and only 3% identify primarily as Chinese \u2013 while 67% see themselves as primarily Taiwanese. But Huang Kwei-bo, professor of diplomacy at Taiwan\u2019s National Chengchi University, criticized Tsai\u2019s pivot toward the US at the expense of ties with China. \u201cTaiwan needs to work closely with the US\u2026but it would be unwise of Taiwan to lose political communication channels with Beijing,\u201d he said, noting\u00a0that Taiwan can\u2019t simply rely on deterrence or military operations to defend itself. \u201cMaintaining political relations with Beijing is another necessary approach to better security for Taiwan,\u201d he added. Defense reforms Weeks after Tsai was sworn in, she attended a graduation ceremony at Taiwan\u2019s Military Academy and delivered a stern message: \u201cOur armed forces need to be reformed in a big, bold way\u2026We also need to reform our national defense systems and culture.\u201d Since then, she has often shown up at military events, sometimes donning bulletproof vests and helmets among soldiers \u2013 challenging prejudices that question women\u2019s ability to command the military. Over her tenure, Tsai has boosted military spending, extended mandatory military service from four months to a year and accelerated the development of its indigenous weapons program to boost combat readiness, including the island\u2019s first domestically produced submarine. These developments \u201cgive confidence to Taiwan\u2019s security partners in terms of the island\u2019s determination for its own fair share for providing its own security,\u201d Sung said. Taipei has also been talking with Washington to establish a \u201ccontingency stockpile\u201d of munitions on Taiwanese soil. The US is bound by law to supply Taiwan with weapons to defend itself, and for decades the Taiwanese military has been purchasing fighter jets and missiles from Washington. But under Tsai, Taiwan has sought to enhance its asymmetric defense capabilities, developing and procuring cheaper and more mobile weapon systems that could be instrumental in halting a potential Chinese invasion. Taiwanese military experts have increasingly advocated for such an approach, noting that Taiwan can never match China in military might and assets. Despite the increases, Taiwan\u2019s defense budget is still dwarfed by that of China, accounting for less than 10% of Beijing\u2019s military spending. But Taiwan can still make itself an enormously costly place for China to try and overrun without having to match its far larger, wealthier neighbor. The war in Ukraine has shown Taiwan the effectiveness of portable missiles and drones on the battlefield in fending off a more powerful enemy, experts say. \u201cThe international environment shifted and that contributed to this awareness in Taiwan of how close war could be,\u201d Hsiao said. \u201cTsai opened the door to defense reform and the idea that defending Taiwan requires a whole-of-society effort.\u201d Domestic challenges Tsai has also left a mixed domestic legacy. Her push to legalize same-sex marriage angered conservatives, especially in rural regions, but made Taiwan the envy of LGBTQ communities across Asia. This week, days before stepping down as president, Tsai invited Taiwanese drag queen Nymphia Wind to perform the first ever drag show at the presidential office, following her win on hit TV series \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d last month. Tsai has also sought to revitalize economic growth and address social inequality, nurturing emerging industries such as renewable energy and launching pension reforms. During her tenure, Taiwan\u2019s economy grew at an average rate of over 3%, but many residents say the economic benefits are little felt in their everyday lives. Instead, Tsai\u2019s administration has faced mounting discontent over stagnant wages, skyrocketing housing prices and cost of living. She has also been criticized for sluggish judicial reforms, failure to rein in online scams and a plan to phase out nuclear energy, as well as not going far enough in implementing transitional justice and promoting indigenous rights. \u201cUnder her reign, there has been a squeeze on airtime for more local and bread-and-butter issues,\u201d said Sung. \u201cAnd you see this reflected in the election results as well.\u201d Tsai\u2019s DPP suffered huge losses in two mid-term elections, where local issues normally trump national security as voters\u2019 primary concern. Near the end of her first term, Tsai\u2019s approval ratings plummeted and her chance for a second term was looking increasingly uncertain \u2013 until pro-democracy protests erupted in Hong Kong in 2019 against Beijing\u2019s tightening grip. She campaigned heavily on promises to not allow Taiwan to become another Hong Kong, and received a landslide victory. In January\u2019s presidential elections, public grievances over livelihood issues became a focal point of criticism against the DPP, splitting votes \u2013 especially from young people \u2013 to a third-party candidate who promised a more \u201cscientific and pragmatic\u201d approach in addressing those issues. The DPP also lost its majority in the national legislature, leaving more potential political gridlock for the incoming Lai administration to push through policies and legislation. As Tsai hands the baton to Lai, analysts say it might still be too early to draw conclusions on her legacy. \u201cHow we ultimately judge her legacy will depend on what happens in the next administration as well, as in what they do with what Tsai has achieved,\u201d Hsiao said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/asia/tsai-taiwan-map-china-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_world_boeing-starliner-helium-leak-delay-update-scn", "text": "The target date for the highly anticipated inaugural crewed mission of Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft has moved yet again. Starliner\u2019s first flight carrying astronauts was expected as soon as May 21 after two previous delays this month, but mission teams need more time to \u201cwork through spacecraft closeout processes and flight rationale,\u201d and are now aiming to launch no sooner than 3:09 p.m. ET on May 25, according to a NASA release. The update comes just days after Starliner teams reported a small helium leak in the service module of the spacecraft. They traced the leak to a flange on a single reaction control system thruster, where helium is used to allow the thrusters to fire. Additional time before launch will give specialists more time to evaluate this issue, though tests thus far have found that the leak doesn\u2019t pose a threat to the mission, according to NASA\u2019s latest update. \u201cPressure testing performed on May 15 on the spacecraft\u2019s helium system showed the leak in the flange is stable and would not pose a risk at that level during the flight,\u201d the space agency said in its news release. \u201cThe testing also indicated the rest of the thruster system is sealed effectively across the entire service module. Boeing teams are working to develop operational procedures to ensure the system retains sufficient performance capability and appropriate redundancy during the flight.\u201d This mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing\u2019s spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. The historic crewed flight was about two hours from liftoff on May 6 when it was scrubbed due to an issue with the a valve on the second stage, or upper portion, of the Atlas V rocket that Starliner will ride to space. The NASA astronauts set to crew the mission for a weeklong stay at the International Space Station, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, have been in preflight quarantine but returned to Houston on May 10 to spend time with their families, Boeing said. Williams and Wilmore will fly back to NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida closer to the new launch date, according to the space agency\u2019s latest release. Boeing\u2019s historic aims The Crew Flight Test is a decade in the making \u2014 the culmination of Boeing\u2019s efforts to develop a spacecraft worthy of ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station under NASA\u2019s commercial program. The launch would mark only the sixth maiden voyage of a crewed spacecraft in US history, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted in a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIt started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX\u2019s) Dragon \u2014 and now Starliner,\u201d he said. Boeing designed the Starliner to rival SpaceX\u2019s prolific Crew Dragon capsule and expand US options for ferrying astronauts to the space station. On board, Williams will also make history as the first woman to embark on such a mission. A rocky start Development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner\u2019s path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing\u2019s rival under NASA\u2019s commercial crew program \u2014 SpaceX \u2014 has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency\u2019s astronauts. Williams and Wilmore were already in their seats aboard the Starliner capsule May 6 when engineers found an issue and halted the launch. The United Launch Alliance team,\u00a0which builds the Atlas V rocket, identified a pressure regulation valve on a liquid oxygen tank that needed replacing.\u00a0The valve has since been replaced, but the latest issue with the helium leak on the Boeing spacecraft that sits atop the rocket\u00a0has caused further delay. If the spacecraft does launch next week as planned, it and the astronauts inside will break away from the Atlas V rocket after reaching orbit, as Starliner begins firing its own engines. The vehicle will likely spend more than 24 hours gradually making its way to the space station. Williams and Wilmore are set to spend about a week at the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board, while the Starliner remains docked outside. The history-making crew will then return home aboard the same Starliner capsule, which is expected to parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/world/boeing-starliner-helium-leak-delay-update-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_weather_houston-storms-power-severe-weather-south", "text": "As officials assess the damage from destructive storms in the Houston area that killed at least seven people and knocked out power amid rising temperatures, residents in the Southeast and Gulf Coast face a severe weather threat through Saturday that could bring another round of excessive rainfall and severe thunderstorms. A complex of storms with winds up to 100 mph and a tornado left a trail of destruction Thursday across the Houston area that damaged multiple skyscrapers, caused a sewage spill and triggered power outages that could stretch on for weeks amid soaring temperatures. At least four people died from the storm in Houston, including two killed by fallen trees and a third who died in a crane accident, Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said Thursday. Another three storm deaths were reported in Harris County on Friday evening. One man collapsed while trying to move a downed electrical pole, and a woman died after lightning struck the trailer she was inside and sparked a fire, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a post on X. Gonzalez said another victim who had lost power reportedly went out to his truck to plug in his oxygen tank and was found unresponsive Friday morning. \u201cHeartbreaking! My condolences go out to the families that lost a loved one during yesterday\u2019s severe weather event,\u201d Gonzalez said. The damaging storms will be followed by high temperatures in the 90s through the weekend and beyond while many are without air conditioning. Over 366,000 customers in Harris County remain without power Saturday evening following the line of storms, down from a peak of more than 900,000, according to PowerOutage.us. Authorities have warned that restoring power to all customers will be a lengthy process. CenterPoint Energy \u2013 the primary electrical provider in the area \u2013 said the storm system caused \u201cextensive damage to the company\u2019s transmission and distribution electric systems.\u201d Thousands of workers are being deployed to help with restoration efforts, the company said. More than 376,000\u00a0of its customers have been affected and power was restored to more than 259,000\u00a0customers in the last 24 hours as of Saturday night, the company said on its website. \u201cCenterPoint Energy is working to have restorations substantially complete to customers who are available to receive service by end of day Wednesday,\u201d CenterPoint Energy said. \u201cHardest hit areas of our territory include: Bellaire, Cypress, Baytown, Greenspoint, Humble and Spring Branch.\u201d The rainfall, combined with high winds and power outages, also resulted in the spillage of more than 100,000 gallons of domestic wastewater, otherwise known as sanitary sewage. The spillage occurred in three separate locations across the city, but Houston Public Works assured residents that drinking water from the City of Houston remains safe. With burgeoning heat, the City of Houston opened cooling centers for residents on Friday, officials said in a news release. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could hit triple-digits by next week, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. \u201cThe weather pattern is shifting into a hot and dry pattern starting on Saturday, so it is going to be important to have a way to stay cool,\u201d the National Weather Service warned on Friday. Houston Mayor John Whitmire, who signed a local state of disaster declaration for the city on Friday, toured the downtown area and said the \u201cdevastation is significant.\u201d \u201cWe urge everyone to stay away from the area for your safety and to allow public works personnel to do their vital jobs,\u201d Whitmire said. The weather service classified the line of severe storms that moved through Texas and Louisiana Thursday as a derecho, a potentially destructive weather event characterized by widespread wind damage associated with a long-lived line of thunderstorms. Derechos have consistent wind gusts of 58 mph or greater along a path of at least 400 miles, along with several well-separated wind gusts of greater than 75 mph. The determination was made based on the path\u2019s length and intensity. More flash floods and damaging wind gusts possible Saturday Excessive rainfall and severe thunderstorm chances will persist across parts of the Southeast through Saturday, the National Weather Service said. From the Southeast to the north-central Gulf of Mexico, newly developing thunderstorms will bring the potential for more flash flooding and damaging wind gusts on Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. A slight level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms has been issued across parts of the Southeast into the Carolinas on Saturday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cIsolated to scattered severe thunderstorms appear possible across portions of the Southeast and Carolinas on Saturday, and parts of the Upper Midwest,\u201d the center said. \u201cDamaging winds should be the main threat, but occasional severe hail and a tornado or two may also occur.\u201d A slight level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall has also been issued for part of the northern Gulf Coast Saturday due to the threat of flash, urban and riverine flooding, the weather service said. Heavy rain is also forecast to continue into Saturday across the Mid-Atlantic and central Appalachians, where scattered instances of flash flooding could occur. On Sunday, thunderstorms are expected to form over the central High Plains and spread east in the evening. The greatest chances for severe weather are across parts of Nebraska and Kansas, with a slight level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms issued by the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cLarge hail and damaging gusts will be the main hazards, though a tornado or two also will be possible,\u201d the center said. By the end of the weekend, thunderstorm chances will diminish for most of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, the weather service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/weather/houston-storms-power-severe-weather-south/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_sport_xander-schauffele-pga-championship-2024-winner-spt-intl", "text": "American golfer Xander Schauffele won the 106th PGA Championship on Sunday, holding off compatriot Bryson DeChambeau in a nail-biting finale to clinch a long-awaited first major title. World No. 3 Schauffele was pushed to the final hole at Valhalla Golf Club\u00a0in Louisville, Kentucky,\u00a0but the 30-year-old held his nerve to birdie and finish one stroke ahead of LIV Golf\u2019s DeChambeau at 21-under par overall. A final round six-under 65 was just enough to clinch a maiden major title for Schauffele, shredding his unwanted title as one of the most talented golfers to never win one of golf\u2019s four flagship events. The Californian had finished runner-up twice and 12 times inside the top 10 at the majors but broke his duck in style, opening Thursday with a spectacular 62 \u2013 the joint-lowest round score in major history \u2013 and signing off with a nerveless putt from just over six feet. \u201cI was actually kind of emotional after the putt lipped in,\u201d eight-time PGA Tour winner Schauffele, who claimed a $3.33 million winner\u2019s cut of an $18.5 million prize purse, said as he was presented with the Wanamaker Trophy. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve won, and I really just kept saying it all week, \u2018I just need to stay in my lane.\u2019 Man, was it hard to stay in my lane today, but I tried all day to just keep focus on what I\u2019m trying to do and keep every hole ahead of me.\u201d \u201cI just told myself, \u2018This is my opportunity, and just capture it,\u2019\u201d he added. DeChambeau laments his \u2018B\u2019 game  A fired up DeChambeau played a near-perfect round to push Schauffele to the death, shooting a bogey-free 64 as he hunted a second major crown. Having finished tied-sixth at the Masters, the big-hitting Californian looks to be getting closer to the form that helped him win the US Open in 2020. \u201cFirst \u2026 proud of Xander for finally getting the job done. He\u2019s an amazing golfer and a well deserved major champion now,\u201d DeChambeau told reporters. \u201cOn my side of the coin, disappointing, but, whatever. I played well. Didn\u2019t strike it my best all week. Felt like I had my \u2018B\u2019 game pretty much \u2026 but one that gives me a lot of momentum for the rest of the majors. \u201cI said today it was closing time, but it will be closing time hopefully over the next couple majors.\u201d Two shots behind DeChambeau in third, Norway\u2019s Viktor Hovland remains stuck with the unwanted title Schauffele has now escaped: \u2018nearly-man.\u2019 The 26-year-old had arrived at the final tee level with DeChambeau but could only bogey, resigning him to his third top-four major finish without silverware in the last two years. Collin Morikawa had been level with compatriot Schauffele at tee off on Sunday but, despite bogeying just once, could only muster the same number of birdies. The two-time major champion\u2019s even par 71 saw him finish in a share of fourth with Belgium\u2019s Thomas Detry at 15-under overall. Scheffler finishes with a flourish It was a suitably frenzied climax to a chaotic week in Lousville, with the event upended by the arrest of world No. 1 and tournament favorite Scottie Scheffler before Friday\u2019s second round. The 27-year-old is facing four charges, including felony assault, but returned to play mere hours after his release from jail to shoot a stellar 66. Last month\u2019s Masters champion went one better with a closing 65 but had left himself with too much ground to make up to clinch a second consecutive major after carding a frustrating two-over 73 on Saturday. He finished eight shots behind Schauffele in a share of eighth, a \u201cgood\u201d end to a \u201chectic\u201d week. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say that I played poorly yesterday because of what happened on Friday,\u201d Scheffler, who said he planned to play the PGA Tour\u2019s next event in Texas on Thursday, told reporters. \u201cI just had a bad day out on the course and was proud of how I came out here and bounced back today. \u201cSaturday morning, I think it finally hit me what really happened. Friday most of the day I didn\u2019t really even eat \u2026 as somebody who\u2019s a pretty big eater, that was a strange feeling, so obviously my body was a bit off with what had happened in the morning. \u201cI did my best to leave that behind me and come out here and compete and do what I love, and the support I got from the fans was amazing. I think they were cheering extra loud for me this week, and I got a lot of support from the players and caddies as well.\u201d Scheffler will undoubtedly be among the favorites again when the US Open, the next men\u2019s major on the calendar, tees off at Pinehurst Resort and Country Club in North Carolina on June 13. Nail-biter For a golfer who had faced questions over his ability to get over the line on the biggest stage, Schauffele looked at ease in the driving seat, rolling in a fourth birdie of the day at the ninth hole to make the turn with a two shot cushion. Yet by the time he approached the 11th tee, he was second. Schauffele\u2019s bogeyless run had come to to a shuddering halt at the previous hole when his four-foot putt lipped out. The window had opened by a crack for the first time and Hovland went crashing through it, lasering home his second birdie in a row \u2013 and his sixth of the round \u2013 at the 13th to surge into solo first. A collective thought of \u201chere we go again\u201d rippled around Valhalla, but clearly didn\u2019t reach the man it concerned. Schauffele responded immediately and emphatically, sinking back-to-back birdies to wrestle his lead back from Hovland. DeChambeau would not allow a two-horse race to materialize though, his superb play aided by a remarkable slice of luck at the 16th when his hooked tee shot \u2013 destined for the woods \u2013 careened off a tree and onto the fairway. A subsequent birdie saw him join playing partner Hovland within touching distance of Schauffele. The LIV Golf star roared in delight as his final putt just about trickled in for birdie, sending him back to the clubhouse fist-pumping and level with Schauffele. The picture was now simple but bubbling with tension. With Hovland missing his chance and Morikawa well behind, Schauffele had two holes to either win it, send it to a playoff, or suffer another agonizing near-miss. A par at the penultimate hole put the championship on a knife-edge at the par-five 18th. As DeChambeau warmed up for a potential playoff on the range, he watched a nearby screen intently as Schauffele\u2019s drive settled in a nasty-looking position on the edge of a bunker. His feet planted in the sand, it was a disaster waiting to happen, but Schauffele made it look easy. Two sublime shots later, he stood six feet away from a first major. After years of heart-wrenching close calls, it was perhaps poetic that the ball took a beat-skipping journey around the lip of the cup before dropping in. A long wait had ended, and euphoric celebrations could begin.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/sport/xander-schauffele-pga-championship-2024-winner-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_world_black-holes-einstein-plunging-region-scn", "text": "Albert Einstein was right: There is an area at the edge of black holes where matter can no longer stay in orbit and instead falls in, as predicted by his theory of gravity. Using telescopes capable of detecting X-rays, a team of astronomers has for the first time observed this area \u2014 called the \u201cplunging region\u201d \u2014 in a black hole about 10,000 light-years from Earth. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ignoring this region, because we didn\u2019t have the data,\u201d said research scientist Andrew Mummery, lead author of the study published Thursday in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. \u201cBut now that we do, we couldn\u2019t explain it any other way.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time that black holes have helped confirm Einstein\u2019s grand theory, which is also known as general relativity. The first photo of a black hole, captured in 2019, had previously strengthened the revolutionary physicist\u2019s core assumption that gravity is just matter bending the space-time fabric. Many of Einstein\u2019s other predictions have turned out to be correct over the years, among them gravitational waves and the universal speed limit. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough man to bet against at this point,\u201d said Mummery, a Leverhulme-Peierls Fellow in the department of physics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. \u201cWe went out searching for this one specifically \u2014 that was always the plan. We\u2019ve argued about whether we\u2019d ever be able to find it for a really long time,\u201d Mummery said. \u201cPeople said it would be impossible, so confirming it\u2019s there is really exciting.\u201d \u2018Like the edge of a waterfall\u2019 The observed black hole is in a system called MAXI J1820 + 070, which is made up of a star smaller than the sun and the black hole itself, estimated at 7 to 8 solar masses. The astronomers used NASA\u2019s space-based NuSTAR and NICER telescopes to collect data and understand how hot gas, called plasma, from the star gets sucked into the black hole. NuSTAR is short for the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, which orbits Earth, and NICER, formally known as the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer, is located on the International Space Station. \u201cAround these black holes there are big discs of orbiting material (from nearby stars),\u201d Mummery said. \u201cMost of it is stable, which means it can happily flow. It\u2019s like a river, whereas the plunging region is like the edge of a waterfall \u2014 all of your support is gone and you\u2019re just crashing headfirst. Most of what you can see is the river, but there\u2019s this tiny region at the very end, which is basically what we found,\u201d he added, noting that while the \u201criver\u201d had been widely observed, this is the first evidence of the \u201cwaterfall.\u201d Unlike the event horizon, which is closer to the center of the black hole and doesn\u2019t let anything escape, including light and radiation, in the \u201cplunging region\u201d light can still escape, but matter is doomed by the powerful gravitational pull, Mummery explained. The study\u2019s findings could help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of black holes. \u201cWe can really learn about them by studying this region, because it\u2019s right at the edge, so it gives us the most information,\u201d Mummery said. One thing that\u2019s missing from the study is an actual image of the black hole, because it is too small and far away. But another team of Oxford researchers is working on something even better than a picture: the first movie of a black hole. To achieve that, the team will first need to build a new observatory, the Africa Millimetre Telescope in Namibia, which Mummery expects to be online within a decade. The telescope, which will join the international Event Horizon Telescope collaboration that captured the groundbreaking 2019 image of the black hole, will enable scientists to observe and film large black holes at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and beyond. A link to the past According to Christopher Reynolds, a professor of astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, finding actual evidence for the \u201cplunging region\u201d is an important step that will let scientists significantly refine models for how matter behaves around a black hole. \u201cFor example, it can be used to measure the rotation rate of the black hole,\u201d said Reynolds, who was not involved in the study. Dan Wilkins, a research scientist at Stanford University in California, calls it an exciting development, and points out that in 2018 there was an enormously bright outburst of light from one of the black holes within our galaxy, paired with an excess of high-energy X-rays. \u201cWe had hypothesized at the time that this excess was from the hot material in the \u2018plunging region,\u2019 but we did not have a full theoretical prediction of what that emission would look like,\u201d said Wilkins, who also was not involved with the new study. This study actually performs that calculation, he added, using Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity to predict what the X-rays emitted by material in the \u201cplunging region\u201d would look like around a black hole, and compares it with the data from that bright outburst in 2018. \u201cThis will be prime discovery space over the next decade or so,\u201d Wilkins said, \u201cas we look towards the next generation of X-ray telescopes that will give us more detailed measurements of the innermost regions just outside the event horizons of black holes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/world/black-holes-einstein-plunging-region-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Planning an event can be daunting, so here are our top tips on how to embark on your Call to Earth Day preparations. Identify your goals To get started it\u2019s important to figure out what you hope to achieve with your event. It could focus on reducing plastic pollution, tackling deforestation, protecting biodiversity, or a different environmental issue that is close to your heart. Decide what to do Last year, groups around the world carried out beach and river cleans, held tree-planting sessions, and crafted ambitious art projects. For inspiration, you can check out a selection of last year\u2019s amazing events here. Decide which environmental issue you want to take action on and try to figure out how your group can help. Get help If you need a little encouragement, you can use our Call to Earth Day activity prompts \u2013 they are particularly good for events involving younger children. If you are still struggling to figure out what to do, we\u2019re here to help. Drop us an email at calltoearth@warnermedia.com and one of the team will be in touch to help you craft your event. Register your event Once you have a plan, the next step is to let us know what your event will be. You can register your Call to Earth Day event below. Spread the word Now you need to let your network know what you\u2019re doing, and when, where, and why your event is taking place. (We find emails, social media, and word of mouth are a little better for the planet than posters.) When the day comes, make sure to let the world know about your event. Please be sure to take pictures and videos of what you get up to and post them on social media. Please use the hashtag #CallToEarth or #CallToEarthDay so we can find the posts and potentially feature them in our coverage of the day. If you want to make beautiful videos of your event, you can download special Call to Earth music to put in the background below. If you use music that we don\u2019t own, then we sadly won\u2019t be able to share your videos!", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/registration-call-to-earth-day-2024-c2e-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_18_middleeast_american-majd-kamalmaz-syria-dead-intl", "text": "Majd Kamalmaz, an American man detained in Syria more than seven years ago, has died, according to a statement from the Bring Our Families Home Campaign (BoFH). \u201cTragically, he did not survive the brutal conditions of the prisons, enduring seven long years without a case, trial or any form of communication with his family,\u201d read a statement from Jonathan Franks, spokesperson for BoFH, a\u00a0group that campaigns on behalf of Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained overseas. \u201cHe was a kindhearted, loving and caring person who embodied these qualities as a son, husband, father, grandfather, brother and uncle.\u201d Kamalmaz, a Texas psychotherapist, was detained in 2017 at a checkpoint in Damascus, Syria, while on a trip to visit family. In 2020, CNN reported that Kamalmaz\u2019s family members, who had not heard from him since his detainment, were hopeful that there would be momentum in his case, following a visit to Damascus from Trump administration officials. The visit was held in an effort to secure the release of American prisoners believed to be held by the Syrian government. But Kamalmaz did not return home \u2014 and the silence since his 2017 detainment persisted. \u201cWe do feel invisible,\u201d said Maryam Kamalmaz, speaking on the first-ever Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day about her father\u2019s disappearance earlier this year. She and other family members of detained Americans called on President Joe Biden to meet with them, CNN reported, but that request was not fulfilled. \u201cFor the last seven years, we have been struggling to come to grips with my father\u2019s absence,\u201d Maryam Kamalmaz said in the statement announcing her father\u2019s death. \u201cThe anguish and emotional turmoil that our family has been through has taken a heavy toll on our lives. He will be missed tremendously, yet we hope that his legacy of helping others in need lives on and is carried out by many.\u201d The FBI did not confirm Kamalmaz\u2019s death but reaffirmed the trauma psychologist had not been heard from since he first went missing. \u201cIn 2017, Majd Kamalmaz, a trauma psychologist who worked with individuals affected by war and natural disasters, traveled to Syria to visit a family member,\u201d a statement from the FBI\u2019s Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell read. \u201cKamalmaz has not been seen or heard from since his disappearance in Syria in February 2017. No matter how much time has passed, the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell works on behalf of the victims and their families to recover all U.S. hostages and support the families whose loved ones are held captive or missing.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/middleeast/american-majd-kamalmaz-syria-dead-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_middleeast_israel-gaza-yoav-gallant-intl-latam", "text": "Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0to publicly rule out Israeli governance over Gaza and to lay out his\u00a0post-war plans, warning that he opposes Israeli rule in the Palestinian enclave. \u201cThe \u2018day after Hamas,\u2019 will only be achieved with Palestinian entities taking control of Gaza, accompanied by international actors, establishing a governing alternative to Hamas\u2019 rule,\u201d Gallant said during a news conference at the Kirya, Israel\u2019s military headquarters Wednesday. \u201c\u2060I call on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make a decision and declare that Israel will not establish civilian control over the Gaza Strip, that Israel will not establish military governance in the Gaza Strip, and that a governing alternative to Hamas in the Gaza Strip will be raised immediately,\u201d he added. Gallant\u2019s remarks come as serious questions about Israel\u2019s long-term strategy in Gaza are being raised both inside and outside of Israel after the Israeli military sent troops back into areas of northern Gaza it had withdrawn from months ago to battle Hamas militants who had returned amid a power vacuum. Israeli military officials have quietly warned that the lack of a long-term strategy for post-war governance will result in this pattern repeating throughout Gaza. And top US officials are doing so publicly, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken warning Wednesday that Israel must \u201cfocus on what the future can and must be\u201d to avoid \u201canarchy and a vacuum that\u2019s likely to be filled by chaos.\u201d Gallant has previously said he opposes Israeli control over post-war Gaza, but his remarks Wednesday were his most direct on the topic as he warned of the consequences of a long-term Israeli military presence in Gaza and called out Netanyahu directly. \u201cI will not agree to the establishment of Israeli military rule in Gaza. Israel must not establish civilian rule in Gaza,\u201d he said, warning that a military occupation of the Palestinian territory would take a heavy toll in \u201cbloodshed and victims, as well as a heavy economic price,\u201d he warned. Netanyahu appeared to respond to Gallant\u2019s remarks later on Wednesday, saying in a video statement posted to social media that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority would be acceptable entities to govern Gaza. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to replace Hamastan with Fatahstan,\u201d he said, referring to Fatah, the Palestinian political party that dominates the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu also said that a complete routing of Hamas would be his prerequisite for a new civilian government in Gaza.\u00a0\u201cAs long as Hamas remains in place, no other entity would enter Gaza to administer the civilian aspects, especially not the Palestinian Authority,\u201d he said. Gallant\u2019s remarks set off a political firestorm in Israel, with a number of right-wing lawmakers condemning\u00a0Gallant\u2019s statement and some even urging Netanyahu to remove him from his position. War cabinet member Minister Benny Gantz meanwhile has endorsed Gallant\u2019s stance, saying he was \u201cspeaking the truth\u201d. The public clash between Gallant and Netanyahu follows repeated calls by the US for Israel to produce a clear plan for post-war Gaza. \u201cWe do not support and will not support an Israeli occupation. We also of course, do not support Hamas governance in Gaza,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony\u00a0Blinken\u00a0told journalists at press conference\u00a0in\u00a0Kyiv, Ukraine, on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWe also can\u2019t have anarchy and a vacuum that\u2019s likely to be filled by chaos.\u201d \u201cThere needs to be a clear and concrete plan, and we look to Israel to come forward with\u00a0its\u00a0ideas,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/middleeast/israel-gaza-yoav-gallant-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_16_tech_damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system", "text": "A pair of recent ransomware attacks crippled computer systems at two major American health care firms, disrupting patient care and exposing fundamental weaknesses in the US health care system\u2019s defenses against hackers. In both cases, federal officials and private cyber experts scrambled to try to limit the damage and get computers back online. But the cascading effects from the hacks, with ambulances diverted from hospitals and pharmacies unable to process insurance, has underscored for some US lawmakers, senior Biden administration officials and policy experts that the health care system is ill-prepared for the ripple effects of a cyberattack and needs new security regulations. Health care lags other industries such as big financial institutions and energy providers when it comes to IT security, according to some experts. \u201cIndustry has successfully demanded voluntary cybersecurity for years \u2014 and this is what we get,\u201d Joshua Corman, a cybersecurity expert who has focused on the health sector for years, told CNN. Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the finance committee, told CNN that \u201cevery new devastating hack hammers home the need for mandatory cybersecurity standards in the health care sector, particularly when it comes to the largest companies that millions of patients depend on for care and medicine.\u201d Without action, the senator said, \u201cpatients\u2019 access to care and their personal health information will be compromised and ransomed by hackers over and over again.\u201d In 2023, 46 hospital systems in the US, comprising 141 hospitals, were impacted by ransomware,\u00a0according\u00a0to a tally from cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.\u00a0That\u2019s up from 25 hospital systems hit by ransomware in 2022, according to the firm. The two ransomware attacks hit different nerves of the health care system. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue, snarled service at pharmacies across the US and\u00a0may have compromised\u00a0the personal data of a third of Americans. In early May, cybercriminals used a different type of ransomware in an attack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals and 40 senior living facilities in 19 states. The hack\u00a0forced\u00a0the health network to divert ambulances from some hospitals. The Biden administration is preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals, senior White House cyber official Anne Neuberger confirmed this month. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would effectively re-victimize victims of cyberattacks by imposing penalties after they are hacked. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services previously said\u00a0they are willing to use a number of measures,\u00a0including\u00a0imposing\u00a0monetary fines, to both force and encourage health care organizations to better secure their systems. Momentum is also growing on Capitol Hill to force health care organizations to meet basic cybersecurity standards. A bill\u00a0introduced\u00a0in March by Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, would allow \u201cadvanced and accelerated\u201d Medicare payments to be sent to hacked health care providers as long as those providers and their contractors meet minimum cybersecurity standards. An unhealthy situation The ransomware attacks on Change Healthcare and Ascension have spotlighted the health sector\u2019s cybersecurity weakness like no other events before it, experts told CNN. And even if there are new regulatory requirements for cybersecurity, the sector \u201cwill continue to struggle from such attacks if the business of providing\u00a0healthcare remains financially fraught [and forces] leaders to prioritize only revenue generating investments,\u201d Carter Groome, chief executive of cybersecurity firm First Health Advisory, told CNN. The Change Healthcare ransomware attack, in particular, has brought fresh attention from policymakers and experts on what many see as the over-consolidation of the US health care industry. If hackers can defeat security measures at one company, millions of patients who rely on that health network can be affected. \u201cUS healthcare is in a death spiral,\u201d said Corman, who co-founded I am the Cavalry, a volunteer group that focuses on cybersecurity for resource-poor organizations in the health sector, among others. \u201cDistressed hospitals get acquired into too-big-to-fail conglomerates. Ransoms cause distress for the little ones, and multi-week, multi-state outages for the ones \u2018saved\u2019 by the big ones.\u201d Any new cybersecurity regulations should be strong enough to force meaningful improvements in the sector\u2019s cybersecurity, Corman argued. \u2018Yes. cybersecurity is costly,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we can clearly see\u2026 neglect is more costly.\u201d Change Healthcare\u2019s parent firm, UnitedHealth Group, owns a significant portion of the US health care market. The company, which reported $371 billion in revenue last year, handles one in three American patient records,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Hospital Association. Optum, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, employs about 90,000 physicians. \u201cYour revenues are bigger than some countries\u2019 GDP,\u201d Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican,\u00a0told\u00a0UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty in a Senate hearing this month.\u00a0\u201cAnd how in heaven\u2019s name did you not have the necessary redundancies so that you did not experience this attack and find yourself so vulnerable?\u201d The Justice Department has been pursuing an antitrust investigation into UnitedHealth Group, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in February. More broadly, the Justice Department last week\u00a0announced\u00a0a\u00a0task force to examine \u201chealth care monopolies and collusion\u201d that will guide the department\u2019s approach to \u201ccivil and criminal enforcement in health care markets,\u201d where warranted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_sport_jurgen-klopp-liverpool-farewell-spt-intl", "text": "The journey\u2019s end was as expected for someone so revered. How could there not be tears for a man who traded on emotion and transformed Liverpool Football Club, bringing hope first then glory during his near nine-year stay? On a sun-soaked Sunday at Anfield, Jurgen Klopp managed Liverpool for the last time and salty tears filled eyes; from the man himself to his players and fans. Klopp announced at the beginning of the year that this season would be his last for Liverpool. It was time, he said. Liverpool\u2019s fans, on the other hand, have ever since reluctantly been preparing themselves for this day. Thousands lined the streets as the team bus made its way to Anfield, flares tinting the air with Liverpool red. A mural of the German\u2019s name adorned one stand before the match and fans waved \u201cnormal one\u201d flags, referencing his description of himself at his first press conference as Liverpool manager. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to take as a human being,\u201d Klopp told Sky Sports before the match of the adoration bestowed on him. But more was to follow. He was serenaded throughout the match, one which Liverpool won 2-0 against Wolves \u2013 not that the day was about results. For the last 10 minutes fans increased the decibels, the idolization, to such an extent that Klopp could no longer hold back the tears. Television cameras panned to his wife, Ulla, who was also crying in the stands. It would be easy to rattle off the trophies Liverpool have won since Klopp arrived at Anfield in October 2015 \u2013 a Premier League title, the Champions League, the FA Cup, two League Cups and more \u2013 but his impact on the club cannot be quantified in silverware alone. \u201cA man who made a seismic impact on this city and its people,\u201d the stadium announcer said as Klopp walked onto the pitch for his post-match presentation. There were many trophies, arguably there should have been more \u2013 two Champions League finals lost, a Europa League final lost, the Premier League lost by a point twice. But, for Liverpool\u2019s fans, this gregarious German brought joy back to the club, lifting a team which was mid-table when he took over to the higher echelons of European soccer. He  created one of the greatest teams in the club\u2019s history \u2013 one that won trophies and played with verve and, in 2020, ended a 30-year wait for a league title. At the final whistle Klopp hugged his players, and some opposition players, too. Captain Virgil van Dijk looked close to tears on their embrace. \u201cI\u2019ve got no words, it\u2019s a very emotional day,\u201d said Van Dijk told Sky Sports. Upon his arrival, Klopp said he was \u201cthe normal one,\u201d but he is, in truth, anything but. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely the special one,\u201d goalkeeper Allison told Sky Sports afterwards. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful and grateful that I had the opportunity to work under Jurgen Klopp.\u201d The matchday programme had \u201cDanke Jurgen\u201d written on the cover. What more could Liverpool fans say? \u201c\u2026 as much as I know it is the right time for me to leave I know also that it will take some getting used to,\u201d Klopp wrote in his programme notes. It will arguably take Liverpool fans, and even the Premier League, longer to get used to a post-Klopp era. The stadium remained full after the final whistle as fans stayed to listen to Klopp\u2019s farewell speech. \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone,\u201d the club\u2019s anthem rang around the stadium one last time for the German. Trent Alexander-Arnold, who has not played for any other manager, was in tears. No one wanted to leave because that would mean it was the end. \u201cThis season we aimed for the moon and ended up in the stars,\u201d Klopp wrote of a campaign which promised a quadruple of trophies but ended with the League Cup and a third-placed finish in the league. There will be no one else like Klopp. After all, few managers get to choose their ending in such a high-pressured sport. The Klopp era will not be replicated, Liverpool fans know that, which is why he was given such a special farewell.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/sport/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-farewell-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

The service warned, \u201cTo protect your life, TAKE COVER NOW!\u201d While stormy conditions should wind down across the central Gulf Coast, the severe storm threat increases throughout the Central Plains on Sunday and Monday. About 30 million people across the United States at risk of severe thunderstorms Sunday, including along coastal Florida, Georgia, and southern South Carolina. The main threat, however, is focused over the Central Plains. \u201cDestructive wind swaths of 80-100 mph may occur, with localized extreme gusts exceeding 100 mph possible,\u201d the Storm Prediction Center warned. \u201cVery large hail and a few tornadoes are also anticipated.\u201d  In its outlook for Sunday, the Storm Prediction Center said the storm system includes the potential for a derecho, which produces widespread, long-lived, straight-line winds associated with a fast-moving group of severe thunderstorms. The severe weather in Houston Thursday included a derecho with 100 mph winds. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to highlight with just one word, the worst, most damaging wind event that you can potentially expect,\u201d Matt Elliott, Storm Prediction Center warning coordination meteorologist, told CNN last year. \u201c\u2026 when you hear that term, it means that we\u2019re talking about something extremely serious.\u201d A Level\u00a04 of 5\u00a0risk of severe weather is in place across western and central Kansas, including the cities of Dodge City, Salina, Hutchinson, Garden City and Hays. Storms on Sunday afternoon and evening could potentially bring damaging wind gusts\u00a0up to 100 mph, large hail over 2 inches and a few tornadoes, according to the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cScattered severe storms are expected to affect the region Sunday afternoon and evening,\u201d the National Weather Service in Wichita said. \u201cThe strongest storms will be capable of producing up to tennis ball size hail, 80 mph wind gusts, and a tornado cannot be ruled out.\u201d Portions of the east coast of Florida also face a slight risk, Level 2 of 5, for severe thunderstorms on Sunday. Large hail will be probable, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Through early next week, the Central US faces an increasing threat of severe weather and excessive rainfall, according to the National Weather Service. On Monday, the severe thunderstorm risk drops to a slight Level 2 out of 5 for the Central Plains, and a Level 1 threat spreads east to include parts of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois, encompassing the cities of Chicago and Detroit. Hail and strong wind gusts will be the primary threats, though isolated tornadoes are also possible across the Central Plains and portions of the Midwest. \u201cSevere thunderstorms are possible across parts of the central Plains Monday evening into the overnight hours,\u201d the Storm Prediction Center said. \u201cAdditional more isolated strong to severe storms are possible from the Middle Mississippi Valley to Lower Michigan through Monday afternoon.\u201d Severe thunderstorm chances will persist on Tuesday across parts of the Mississippi Valley, according to the center. Though damaging winds will be the primary concern, large hail and tornadoes will also be possible. Triple-digit heat\u00a0in Houston amid outages Meanwhile, Houston area residents who are still picking up the pieces from Thursday\u2019s storms will contend with a much different danger through early next week: sweltering heat. It\u2019s a stark contrast from the soaking, windy weather in Harris County that killed at least seven people, damaged skyscrapers, toppled trees, downed power lines, caused a sewage spill and made debris ridden roads impassable. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could hit triple-digits by next week, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. Days after the storm has passed, power remains out for more than 296,000 homes and business across Harris County as of early Sunday evening, according to poweroutage.us. With increasingly high heat and humidity, those residents will have to cope with heat indices from the 90s Sunday and Monday into the 100s Tuesday and Wednesday without air conditioning. Authorities have warned restoring power to all customers could take weeks. \u201cWidespread power outages continue across the Houston metro area. Please use safety precautions when using generators,\u201d the National Weather Service in Houston said. \u201cAlso, with high temperatures around 90\u00b0 this weekend, know the symptoms of heat exhaustion/stroke.

And at that point, I had a group of friends. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t even like I met him and it changed everything. But he became a major component of me no longer seeking to possibly go back to the States.\u201d Quality of life She and her husband went on to have two sons, Theodore and Jefferson. Regan was hugely impressed by the care she received during childbirth, explaining that new mothers in the country commonly stay in hospital for a few days. She feels blessed to have been able to raise her children in France due to the \u201cwonderful quality of life,\u201d stressing that although she works \u201cvery hard,\u201d she\u2019s at home for dinner with her family every night. \u201cWe have school vacation every six weeks,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo every six weeks, the kids are off from school for two or three weeks. \u201cAnd in that time, it is culturally accepted that you take vacation. It\u2019s normal.\u201d She goes on to explain that she feels as though her children are safer in France than they would be in the US as \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same issues with guns.\u201d \u201cFrom the age of 10 or 11, they [kids] start going to school by themselves,\u201d adds Regan. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just a cultural norm. \u201cSo as a parent of relatively young children, just the quality of life is just so much better.\u201d Regan has also found France to be more affordable for her family, despite Paris being ranked as one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in. She credits this, at least partly, to the French healthcare system, which provides universal coverage for all legal residents. \u201cYou have the social system, and then you have private health care provided by companies,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have that same level of stress.\u201d Regan recently spent around five weeks in the US and she admits to being stunned by how much prices had increased. International city \u201cI was really shocked by the price increase in inflation of groceries, for example,\u201d she says. \u201cOver here [in Paris,] we\u2019ve had a price increase in inflation, but not as dramatic.\u201d While Regan has now lived in Paris for over two decades, she admits that it was a long while before she felt completely at home in the city. \u201cI would say it took me two years to really love my current life,\u201d she says. \u201cIt probably took me eight years to really feel like this was home. \u201cAnd now I can\u2019t imagine a different place that I would want to live my life.\u201d Over the years, Regan has seen Paris go through many changes, and feels that the city has become \u201ceven more international\u201d with \u201cmore and more foreigners.\u201d \u201cTwenty years ago, you would really struggle to have a life here, if you didn\u2019t speak French,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd now that has changed.\u201d Although she\u2019d taken a few months of intensive French language courses before arriving in France, Regan concedes that it was a while before she felt like a relatively competent French speaker. She recalls how she struggled at big dinner parties as she would often be the only English speaker. However, she feels that this wouldn\u2019t be the case now, as there are far more people in the city who speak other languages. \u201cI think it\u2019s become much, much easier [to relocate to Paris],\u201d she says. Regan initially came to France on a student visa, before obtaining a working visa. After marrying a French national, she was eligible for a French residence permit, or a Carte de Sejour, which she renews every 10 years. She is currently eligible for French citizenship, but is yet to begin the process. \u201cIt\u2019s a large administrative task,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I feel like every single year, I\u2019ve had another priority.\u201d Regan now runs a Paris-based real estate agency, which provides property services to international clients. \u201cI guess the thing I\u2019m very proud of is that we really help people,\u201d she says, explaining that many newcomers struggle with the \u201cslower administrative process\u201d in France, and want advice on pinpointing \u201cwhich neighborhoods are the most safe and adapted for foreigners.\u201d She tends to advise those interested in relocating to Paris to do as much research as they can before coming over and to get any documents they might need ready well ahead of time. The \u2018Emily\u2019 effect? Netflix series \u201cEmily in Paris,\u201d which centers around an American marketing executive who moves to Paris for a new job, has put the city back in the spotlight in recent years, with many fans of the show flocking to the French capital to try to recreate some of the experiences portrayed. While Regan notes that the show has likely helped to attract newcomers, she stresses that \u201cParis has always been top of the list.\u201d \u201cI was a young twenty-something 25 years ago, and it was my dream to come, even before \u2018Emily in Paris,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s probably opened that up to a larger audience that maybe didn\u2019t necessarily have the opportunity to travel internationally previously.\u201d Regan regularly returns to the US to visit her family and says she relishes the opportunity to dress more casually, as \u201crolling out of bed in sweats, putting on a hat\u201d and going about your day is somewhat frowned upon in Paris. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a little bit more formal over here,\u201d she says, noting that while most of her Parisian friends get their hair and nails done before going on vacation, she does \u201cthe opposite\u201d when going back to the US. \u201cI take off my nail polish. I don\u2019t do any makeup. It\u2019s a little bit more relaxed.\u201d While she still has strong connections to America, Regan can\u2019t imagine herself ever returning and feels as though she ended up where she was meant to be. \u201cI definitely see myself where I am,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a huge amount of faith that things work out the way they\u2019re always supposed to. \u201cThese past 25 years have been just wild. It\u2019s been incredible, with ups and downs\u2026\u00a0 I personally have just been very blessed.\u201d When asked if she considers herself a Parisian now, Regan says she\u2019s not sure whether that\u2019s something she can \u201cself declare,\u201d but she feels close to being a Parisian \u201cby adoption.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/us-woman-traveled-to-paris-ended-up-staying-for-good/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_weather_flooding-south-storms-houston-friday", "text": "At least seven people were killed in the Houston area on Thursday as a destructive complex of storms with winds up to 100 mph tore through the area, triggering power outages that could stretch on for weeks amid soaring temperatures. The death toll rose Friday evening from the four fatalities officials reported earlier in the day. More than 900,000 homes and businesses lost power in Houston\u2019s Harris County during the peak of the storm\u2019s violent winds, and nearly 600,000 remained in the dark Friday evening, according to PowerOutage.us. \u201cFor some folks, the luckier ones, (power restoration) might be days, not hours. For many, many people, it\u2019s going to be weeks and not days,\u201d Harris County Judge Lina Hildago said in a Friday news briefing. Hidalgo said the weeks-long restoration timeframe was for homes and businesses tied into the 10 steel power transmission towers downed in the state, seven of which were in Harris County. It\u2019s unclear which areas are tied into the transmission lines, she said. It\u2019s a troubling timeframe for power restoration, especially as high temperatures reach the 90s through the weekend and beyond. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could hit the triple-digits by next week, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. The City of Houston planned to activate cooling centers for residents on Friday, officials said in a news release. Fallen trees appear to have caused two of the reported deaths, and a crane accident caused another, Houston Fire Department Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said in a news conference. The Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Friday evening identified three others in the county who died from the storm. One man collapsed while attempting to move a downed electrical pole, and a woman died after lightning struck the trailer she was inside and caused a fire, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a post on X Friday. Gonzales said another victim who had lost power reportedly went out to his truck to plug in his oxygen tank. \u201cHe was found unresponsive this morning and pronounced deceased at the scene,\u201d the sheriff said Friday, adding the additional deaths occurred in unincorporated Harris County. Houston Mayor John Whitmire, who signed a local state of disaster declaration for the city on Friday, toured the downtown area and said the \u201cdevastation is significant.\u201d \u201cWe urge everyone to stay away from the area for your safety and to allow public works personnel to do their vital jobs,\u201d Whitmire said.  Additional powerful, drenching storms could plague parts of the Gulf Coast Friday. Here\u2019s the latest on Friday\u2019s storms and destruction in Texas and other parts of the South: Thursday\u2019s severe weather classified as derecho: The weather service classified the line of severe storms that moved through Texas and Louisiana as a derecho, a potentially destructive weather event characterized by widespread wind damage associated with a long-lived line of thunderstorms. Derechos have consistent wind gusts of 58 mph or greater along a path of at least 400 miles, along with several well-separated wind gusts of greater than 75 mph. The Storm Prediction Center and several National Weather Service offices made the determination based on the path\u2019s length and intensity. Most of Houston\u2019s traffic lights are down: Traffic lights across the city are out and debris from damaged buildings and toppled trees are covering roadways, making driving conditions dangerous. \u201cDowntown is a mess. It\u2019s dangerous due to the glass and the lack of traffic lights. So stay at home,\u201d Mayor Whitmire said Thursday. Hurricane-force wind gusts reported in Texas and Louisiana: Wind speeds reached as high as 100 mph in downtown Houston, a National Weather Service storm damage survey crew determined Friday. Wind gusts of 74 to 78 mph were measured just east of the Houston metro\u00a0Thursday evening,\u00a0according to the weather service. The National Weather Service in New Orleans reported wind gusts as strong as 84 mph around the city. Major flooding leads to water rescues: There were up to 20 water rescues after residents in Bryan, Texas, drove into the floodwaters, police spokesperson Seth Waller said. Nearby in College Station, heavy rain Thursday flooded a park, videos shared with CNN showed. Roads flooded in several Texas counties including Bosque, Bell, McLennan and Falls. Waterlogged parts of Texas and Louisiana recorded widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches in just a few hours late Thursday and early Friday morning. Spate of storms exhausts Texas: The Lone Star State has been in the bull\u2019s-eye of seemingly unrelenting rounds of flooding downpours. Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday requested a presidential disaster declaration for areas impacted by the onslaught of severe weather and flooding, citing \u201cextensive damage caused by these severe storms, historic river flooding, and tornadoes\u201d that began on April 26. Houston area bears brunt of destructive storms Houston\u2019s mayor advised residents to stay off the roads and stay at home because of widespread damage to the area. \u201cMany roads are impassable due to downed power lines, debris, and fallen trees,\u201d Mayor Whitmire\u2019s office said in a statement Thursday evening. The storm was so powerful it blew out the windows of buildings in downtown Houston, littering the area with glass as traffic lights went dark. Shoppers at a Costco in Houston used their phones as the only source of light as they huddled inside the store when the power went out, with employees closing the doors to block out the rain and winds. The violent storm conditions partially collapsed a nightclub and partially ripped roofing off the downtown Hyatt Regency, showering the hotel lobby with rain and debris, according to witness video. CenterPoint Energy says its skyscraper in downtown Houston sustained damage from the storm, according to a spokesperson. The Houston Independent School District announced campuses will be closed on Friday and reopen Monday \u201cdue to widespread damage across Houston.\u201d More than a dozen Houston-area school districts also announced they would close Friday, including Aldine Independent School District, Channelview Independent School District and Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District. More damaging storms possible Friday Damaging, soaking storms were ongoing in parts of the Gulf Coast Friday morning following Thursday night\u2019s violent weather. Additional storms will usher in renewed threats later Friday. A Level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place from southern Louisiana to parts of Georgia and Florida. Any of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and even a tornado. Storms will also unload gushing rainfall. A Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place for portions of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The heaviest rain late Friday will likely fall during the overnight hours. Storms could produce rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour and quickly restart or worsen any ongoing flooding. Widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches are expected from Texas to Georgia through Saturday morning. A few spots caught under multiple torrential storms may pick up 8 inches or more of rain. Some areas could record close to a foot of rain in about 48 hours.
