The hostages were identified as Shani Louk, Amit Bouskila, and Itshak Gelernter, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a press conference in Tel Aviv. All three were taken hostage on October 7 and were\u00a0killed while escaping the Nova music festival and their bodies taken into Gaza, the IDF said. \u201cThey were celebrating life in the Nova music festival and they were murdered by Hamas,\u201d he said. The bodies were identified by authorities and the families have been informed, Hagari said, adding that the bodies had been transferred to medical professionals for forensic examination. Hagari did not disclose where the bodies were found during the press conference. He said the bodies were recovered during a joint IDF and Shin Bet operation. CNN analyst and Axios reporter Barak Ravid,\u00a0citing an IDF spokesperson,\u00a0reported\u00a0the bodies were found in a tunnel in Gaza. Nissim Louk, father of Shani Louk whose body was one of those recovered also told Israeli media his daughter\u2019s body was very well preserved because it had been kept in a \u201cdeep and very cold tunnel\u201d. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his grief in a\u00a0post on X\u00a0on Friday. \u201cThe heart breaks for the great loss. My wife Sara and I grieve with the families. All our hearts are with them in this hour of grieving,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will return all our hostages, the dead and the alive alike. I congratulate our brave forces who, with determined action, have returned our sons and daughters home,\u201d he added. Of the three hostages, only Louk had previously been confirmed dead by the Israeli government. The 23-year-old German-Israeli woman was declared dead by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs in late October. A source involved with her identification told CNN Louk\u2019s death was announced after forensic examiners found a bone fragment from her skull. Her lifeless body was seen on video on the back of a Hamas truck after the music festival attack. Louk\u2019s family said they feel some closure now that her body has been recovered. In a statement given to CNN, the family said the IDF came to their house on Friday and informed them that they were able to rescue Louk\u2019s body from a tunnel in Gaza and bring her back to Israel. \u201cEvery news like this brings us back to the horrific moment we had to find out that our loving daughter was brutally murdered by Hamas on the 7th of October. However,\u00a0it is also a relief to get the body back and we are now able to bury her close by. It gives us some kind of closure,\u201d the family said. \u201cWe want to remember Shani as the beautiful and peace-loving person she was, who loved music, dancing and life. She brought us and many other people in the world light and the belief in good. This is how we choose to remember Shani,\u201d the statement added. Around 240 people were taken hostage and moved to Gaza during Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel that also killed more than 1,200 people. A little more than 100 were freed during a release deal in November, but the IDF believes there are still 132 hostages being held in Gaza, 128 of whom were taken on October 7. The IDF believed that of those 132 hostages, 40 are believed to be dead, including two who were taken in 2014. A deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages has remained elusive for months, despite rounds of talks between Israeli and Hamas negotiating teams. Last Friday, Hamas militants said Israel\u2019s rejection of a ceasefire plan submitted by mediators at negotiations in Cairo had sent hostage release talks back to \u201csquare one.\u201d The statement came a day after the latest round of Gaza truce and hostage deal talks ended in Cairo, without a deal. The militant group also accused Netanyahu of hindering the ceasefire talks, so as to use negotiations as a cover to attack the southern Gaza city of Rafah.

{"id": "2024_05_12_middleeast_palestinian-young-amputees-us-intl", "text": "Ahed Bseso lay on the kitchen table in her home in northern Gaza, watching as her uncle amputated her injured right leg with a knife. Standing by, her mother cried, \u201cAhed is dead!\u201d But 18-year-old Bseso was very much alive, and she has survived to tell her story, from a hospital in Greenville, South Carolina. Bseso said that on December 19 last year, she went to the top floor of her house in Gaza to get a cellphone signal when an Israeli tank outside fired at her building. It destroyed part of her home\u2019s wall, which came crashing down on her leg, along with heavy debris. With her neighborhood under siege and no possibility of medical attention, her uncle, who used to work as an orthopedic surgeon, used kitchen supplies to amputate her leg below the knee and dress it with unsterilized gauze. The days that followed were horrifically painful. \u201cFor four days, I couldn\u2019t leave the house because the Israelis wouldn\u2019t let me,\u201d she told CNN through a translator, at the Shriners Children\u2019s hospital. \u201cThere was no medication I could take to inhibit the pain or to help me with my condition. So, I just sat in agony for four days.\u201d The video of her amputation\u202fwent viral\u202fand caught the attention of the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund (PCRF), a US organization that provides free health care to thousands of injured and ill Palestinian children in the Middle East. The organization worked for weeks to evacuate her from northern Gaza and bring her to the United States for medical care, according to Tareq Hailat, head of the Treatment Abroad program at PCRF. She is one of three Palestinians who received PCRF\u2019s help to come to the US for leg injury treatment. At least 1,000 children in Gaza have had one or both legs amputated, UNICEF reported\u202fin December. Though he couldn\u2019t give an exact figure, UNICEF spokesperson Joe English told CNN that the number has since grown. Nearly 26,000 children \u2014 or just over 2% of Gaza\u2019s child population \u2014 were  killed or injured in the Gaza Strip in the first six months of the Israel-Hamas war, according to international nongovernmental organization\u202fSave the Children. From October 7, 2023 \u2014 the date of the Hamas attack on Israel \u2014 to early April, more than 13,800 children were killed and at least 12,009 were injured, the organization said. Avoiding amputations Two-year-old Jood Damo\u2019s\u202fhouse was struck by a tank shell on December 26 last year, killing his mother and fracturing his right leg. His father, Ahmed Damo, who accompanied him to the US, told CNN that the toddler witnessed his mother dying. \u201cTo this day, he still has episodes where he asks about his mom,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, he wakes up in the middle of the night, just crying and screaming, and asking about his mother.\u201d Now, doctors at another hospital in Chicago are assessing whether his injured leg will respond to treatment and grow at the same rate as his left leg. If not, it could significantly delay his path to recovery and treatment plan, PCRF said. Ayham Musalm, 13, said his left leg was fractured and had glass shrapnel lodged in his knee when debris from a strike on a neighbors\u2019 house came straight into his home on December 10. He went months, however, without anyone identifying what was wrong. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to see any physician for a long time,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThen one physician just sewed my wound, and said it wasn\u2019t serious and sent me home.\u201d In the care of Shriners Children\u2019s hospital in Greenville, Musalm has had access to imaging and MRI processes, which helped American experts find the shards of glass inside his knee. That led to surgery and further treatment, and he avoided amputation. He is now in physical therapy. It took PCRF weeks and sometimes months to get children out of Gaza. Besides the time needed to secure their US visas, evacuating the children \u2014\u00a0or even moving them from one part of the strip to the other \u2014\u00a0required Israeli approval, which can be a complicated process, according to Hailat, who works on the evacuations. This delay in treatment for such injuries can result in grave repercussions, said Dr. Amber Alayyan from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders), an international aid NGO. \u201cThe longer they wait without care, the worse it\u2019s going to be,\u201d she said. Alayyan, who has traveled in and out of Gaza several times, said the enclave could have handled the care for such injuries before its\u202fhealthcare system was devastated\u202fby the war. \u201cWe see people who, despite their burns, walk into the clinic without a jaw because the healthcare system has completely collapsed and there are no spaces to take care of these people in the hospitals,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were 3,500 beds in the hospitals in Gaza before the war. But there are so many displaced people living, squatting, seeking shelter in hospitals, that there\u2019s not even space for the patients.\u201d \u201cAs a result, the wounds that these patients are suffering from are beginning to literally rot,\u201d she added. \u201cThey smell now.\u201d In these overwhelming conditions, doctors are struggling to identify infections and types of injuries, and the focus is entirely on saving lives. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to carry out these life-saving amputations because you would have had a system that functioned. You would have had reconstructive surgery. Possibly, you would have had immediate lifesaving surgery possible, and they would have been able to save these limbs,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now we are doing everything we can just to save lives in the moment.\u201d PCRF\u2019s Hailat said he doesn\u2019t know if Bseso\u2019s injury required an amputation either. But with Gaza under siege, and no immediate medical attention, hospital care, and sterilized equipment available, amputation was the only choice. When she arrived in the United States, the bone in her other leg was also deeply infected. Doctors feared that she may have needed both legs amputated, but with adequate care and treatment, she has avoided that outcome. An anxious wait to return home Evacuating to the United States is not the obvious answer for all injured children, Hailat said. The country has accepted 20 children from Gaza for treatment, but Hailat said he has rerouted 17 of them to other nations. Some injuries are so severe that Hailat said he has to choose medical care as quickly as possible \u2014 which means staying in the region \u2014 over expertise and the advanced level of care in the United States. He also said he wants to ensure that the children who are evacuated to the US need treatment that\u2019s specifically available in the country. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to limit how many people we bring to the United States. We would much rather bring people to local areas and local countries around Gaza,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, if specific treatment of that particular child is needed to be done in the United States, then we will go out of our way to ensure that happens. Culture is also important for care and recovery, Hailat said. \u201cCulturally, you don\u2019t want to separate them so far away from their homeland that it\u2019s difficult for them to adapt,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want them to be close to Gaza. This is a very sensitive time, and I don\u2019t want them to feel as though we are separating them from their country.\u201d Back home, Bseso said her mother fell sick as\u202fmalnourishment has plagued northern Gaza. She worriedly waits for more news and updates from home, and she knows that her family would be trying to make their way to the top of their residential building, to find a cell signal to contact her \u2014 the same ritual that put her in the Israeli line of attack. Her hope is to reunite with them in a safe place. \u201cWe really need our family to be with us together,\u201d she said. Musalm, too, wants his treatment to finish so he can return to Gaza and see his family. But there is no knowing when that may be. After their treatments, which Hailat said will most likely take a year, PCRF will ensure it is safe in Gaza before returning the children there. \u201cWe will not do that if it puts them in danger,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we will have to wait to ensure that Gaza is able to be a safe location for them to return.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/middleeast/palestinian-young-amputees-us-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_15_weather_canada-wildfires-fort-mcmurray-climate-wednesday", "text": "Improving winds and a storm moving into western Canada are providing a temporary boost to firefighters battling massive wildfires, but the danger remains heightened as they burn close to three communities. Drought-starved vegetation and days of gusty winds have fueled more than 100 wildfires tearing across Canada that have choked the air with smoke and forced thousands to evacuate since the weekend. But weather conditions took a turn midweek and are providing some help for firefighters working to gain the upper hand on the flames. Winds have died down in some areas and shifted in others, pushing flames away from Alberta\u2019s Fort McMurray, a city still haunted by a catastrophic 2016 fire dubbed \u201cThe Beast.\u201d A large, slow-moving storm will also track through western and central Canada from midweek into the weekend. Cooler air from the storm will flow across fire-torn provinces while relative humidity levels rise and chances for rain increase. While the assist from Mother Nature will not last indefinitely, any potential containment is welcome news for the thousands of people whose homes and businesses are at risk. Roads out of Fort McMurray were crammed with evacuating cars Tuesday as an out-of-control 51,000-acre wildfire\u00a0crept toward the city\u2019s edge. The approaching flames conjured up terrifying memories for residents who lived through the 2016 fires, which forced 90,000 people to evacuate and wrought billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses. Evacuation orders were issued for the city\u2019s neighborhoods of Prairie Creek, Beacon Hill, Abasand and Grayling Terrace on Tuesday. The rest of the city and several surrounding suburbs are on alert to evacuate at a moment\u2019s notice. Roughly 6,600 people in Alberta had evacuated as of Wednesday,\u00a0local officials said during a Wednesday news conference. Residents can expect to be away from their homes until at least May 21, the regional municipality said in a news release. A veil of thick smoke made it difficult for firefighters to see as they battled \u201cextreme fire behavior,\u201d Tuesday Alberta Wildfire Information Officer Josee St-Onge said. Safety concerns have prompted some firefighters to be removed from the front lines. Officials sought to assuage the concerns of residents who vividly recall the 2016 fires, which tore through more than 1.4 million acres and destroyed about 2,400 homes and businesses \u2013 the most expensive natural disaster in Canada\u2019s history. \u201cI want to recognize the anxiety that this brings, certainly to those residents that were here in 2016, and to those where this is their first experience and have heard the stories,\u201d said Regional Fire Chief Jody Butz. \u201cWe are confident that we have the resources to defend these areas, but we need people out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d St-Onge said Wednesday less than 1 millimeter of rain fell on the fire overnight. \u201cActive fire behavior is expected today but should be less than yesterday, thanks to cooler temperatures and weaker winds,\u201d she said, adding firefighters would begin establishing a containment line. Currently, 117 firefighters and 21 helicopters have been assigned to the firefight, according to St-Onge. But despite the weather improvements, St-Onge warned there was \u201ca lot of work to be done to contain this fire and we are still expecting high fire activity today.\u201d The country\u2019s wildfire season is off to a troubling pace as new fires ignite each day and dormant so-called \u201czombie\u201d fires reanimate. The 2024 fire season isn\u2019t yet on par with last year\u2019s record-shattering season but with wildfire behavior worsening in a warming world it\u2019s no wonder Canadian fire officials are warning of an \u201cexplosive\u201d season that may rival last year. Hazardous smoke from the blazes has also been wafting into the US and reducing air quality. Degraded air quality levels were in place Wednesday from the Dakotas into Oklahoma. The central US will remain the focal point for Canadian smoke through at least midweek, before it is pushed from the area by an incoming storm system. \u2018It\u2019s a war zone\u2019 Multiple blazes exploded in size across several provinces early this week, forcing thousands of Canadians to flee their homes with children, pets and bags stuffed with essentials and cherished possessions in tow. \u201cThis is a very difficult time for people who have been asked to leave behind their home, their belongings and their community without the certainty of what will remain when they return,\u201d Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said in a Tuesday statement. Manitoba first responders are tackling one of the largest wildfires in Canada, which has consumed at least 78,000 acres and was within a mile of the Cranberry Portage community as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the province\u2019s media release. More than 500 residents had been evacuated from the area as several neighborhoods were ordered to leave. In British Columbia, more favorable weather conditions helped slow the advance of the northeastern Parker Lake Fire toward the town of Fort Nelson. At least 4,800 people in the area are under evacuation orders, including the Fort Nelson First Nation. Rick Seidel, the owner of a local construction and trucking company,\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Canadian news partner CBC he stayed back to help fight the flames. \u201cWe\u2019ve had all our equipment ready and all our water trucks were loaded. When the call came we jumped into action,\u201d Seidel told CBC on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad. It\u2019s a war zone right now,\u201d Seidel said. Climate change fuels worsening wildfires Gusty winds are driving ongoing fires in Canada, but the seeds of fire activity were sown over the winter and in past years as the world continues to warm because of human-driven climate change. \u201cThis region has experienced multiple years of drought, with a below normal snowpack this past winter,\u201d said Ben Boghean, fire behavior specialist for the BC Wildfire Service. \u201cAs a result of this, our forests in the Fort Nelson zone are very receptive\u00a0to new fire ignitions and rapid rates of spread.\u201d Declining snow, increasing temperatures and worsening droughts are all hallmarks of climate change and are projected to keep driving larger and more intense fires across Canada,\u00a0according to Environment Canada. Last year was Canada\u2019s most devastating fire season on record, including in British Columbia, where fires burned through hundreds of homes and an area the size of Maryland, according to the\u00a0BC Wildfire Service. There are more than 130 fires burning across Canada, 42 of which are considered out of control,\u00a0according to the Canadian Interagency Fire Centre. Some of the blazes are so-called \u201choldover fires\u201d also known colloquially as \u201czombie fires,\u201d the smoldering remains of last season\u2019s epic blazes, burning deep in the ground throughout the winter and reigniting when exposed to warmer temperatures in the spring. \u201cIn the past, the winter conditions are what put out a lot of holdover fires,\u201d said Bowinn Ma, British Columbia\u2019s minister of emergency management and climate readiness. \u201cIn this case, what we\u2019ve seen is that due to higher temperatures and persistent drought through the last year, many of these holdover fires were not put out like they normally are.\u201d CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/weather/canada-wildfires-fort-mcmurray-climate-wednesday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_americas_haiti-mss-unodc-guns-drugs-intl-latam", "text": "On the rare days that the hills surrounding Port-au-Prince fall silent, people notice. \u201cIf you can\u2019t hear shooting somewhere, the gangs are probably running low on ammunition,\u201d a police source in the\u00a0Haitian capital told CNN. \u201cBut when there\u2019s a lot of shooting, they\u2019ve definitely received a fresh shipment.\u201d For over two months, Port-au-Prince has been cut off from the world, its international seaport and airport shuttered following an explosion of gang attacks in late February. All major roads are blocked by gang checkpoints. For most people living here, there is no way out \u2013 and no way to bring in desperately needed food and medicine. Encircling the Caribbean nation is another closed perimeter, this one created by\u00a0Haiti\u2019s neighbors. The Dominican Republic has sealed the island\u2019s shared border and airspace. The Bahamas has launched\u00a0a naval blockade\u00a0to keep\u00a0Haitians from fleeing the crisis by boat; the UK has\u00a0sent a warship\u00a0to ward off anyone seeking refuge in Turks and Caicos, a British overseas territory; and the US state of Florida has\u00a0increased marine and aviation patrols. And yet guns, bullets and drugs keep pouring in, crossing international waters and airspace to reach the embattled country \u2013 most of the firepower originating from the US. \u201cHaiti\u00a0doesn\u2019t produce guns and ammunition, yet the gang members don\u2019t seem to have any trouble accessing those things,\u201d says Pierre Esperance, executive director of\u00a0Haiti\u2019s National Human Rights Defense Network. Since the start of the year, thousands of people have been killed in gang-related violence and hundreds kidnapped, including at least 21 children, UN figures show. Stopping the flow of guns to\u00a0Haiti\u00a0would likely have an immediate impact on the bloodshed, according to police and human rights experts. \u201cWe have to cut the gangs\u2019 weapons supply lines. This is absolutely the most important thing now,\u201d the police source told CNN. \u201cBecause when they don\u2019t have bullets, their machine guns become nothing more than clubs.\u201d And as a Kenyan-led multinational security support force (MSS) prepares to deploy to\u00a0Haiti, starving the gangs of ammunition should be a top priority for the US, says William O\u2019Neill, the UN Designated Expert of the High Commissioner on the situation of Human Rights in Haiti. \u201cAll of these countries that are contributing their young men and women (to the MSS), how can we make it safer for them to do their job? One way the US could help immediately and directly would be to really seriously crack down on the flow of illegal weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gangs have literally nothing else; their only currency is intimidation and fear.\u201d Defying a global arms embargo Eighteen months ago, the UN Security Council imposed\u00a0an arms embargo on\u00a0Haiti, which bans the export of weapons to anyone in the country other than the government. The US has also taken independent steps to crack down on illicit exports, appointing a regional coordinator for firearms prosecution in the Caribbean and a\u00a0special unit\u00a0to investigate transnational crimes in\u00a0Haiti. Yet the guns keep coming. In January, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) warned that\u00a0Haiti-bound firearms and ammunition were being \u201croutinely incorporated into outbound shipments at warehouses near seaports and airports\u201d in Florida, citing interviews with US customs officials. The following month,\u00a0Haiti\u2019s gangs put their weapons to devastating use, taking the country hostage in an explosion of coordinated violence that forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign, and led to the creation of a transitional governing council that has so far been mired in disagreement. \u201cThe planes have not stopped flying. There continue to be exchanges of both ammunition and arms across the border,\u201d Sylvie Bertrand, the UNODC regional representative, told CNN recently, urging the global community to enforce the arms embargo. But amid today\u2019s chaos, experts say it is likely becoming easier than ever for the gangs to resupply, as they now control major routes and infrastructure to bypass official controls. \u201cThere are always weapons coming in. There are always bullets,\u201d Vitel\u2019homme Innocent, leader of the Kraze Bary\u00e9 gang, told CNN in April, his masked entourage bristling with a globally manufactured assortment of firepower. Weapons experts who later analyzed some of CNN\u2019s images from the encounter said they could spot weapons and accessory parts originating from Israel, Turkey, the Czech Republic, probably Brazil \u2013 and, overwhelmingly, from the United States. An \u2018iron river\u2019 from the United States The guns\u00a0Haiti\u2019s gangs wield are a mix of stolen and smuggled, and the United States is by far the main source of the latter, according to UN experts. From 2020 to 2022, over 80% of the weapons seized in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0and submitted to US authorities for tracing were manufactured in or imported from the United States,\u00a0UNODC\u00a0reported in January,\u00a0citing the most-recent available tracing data. \u00a0They are typically purchased in the US from federally licensed retail outlets, gun shows or pawn shops through \u201cstraw man\u201d intermediaries, the agency also found. It\u2019s all part of a phenomenon that experts in Latin America and the Caribbean call the \u201ciron river\u201d \u2013 a flood of guns bought in US states with lax gun laws, and then shipped across the region to criminal groups. The Mexican government, which has been outspoken about the issue, currently has a $10 billion lawsuit pending against several US gun manufacturers whose products, it says, arm powerful cartels. A senior agent at the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which investigates the diversion of lawfully purchased guns to illegal ends, told CNN that Miami is a significant source of weapons sent to\u00a0Haiti, which have historically been trafficked in small freighters by family networks. \u201cThose are difficult to enforce because they\u2019re not your typical commercial freighter\u2026 it\u2019s relatively easy to conceal a small number of firearms in those shipments,\u201d he said. Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia are also sources of weapons trafficked to the Caribbean, where the ATF has a specialized gun intelligence unit to track and stop such flows, he added. Asked whether the US was doing enough, he emphasized that combatting gun trafficking was a top priority. \u201cIt is a very high priority of the United States government and ATF\u2019s role in that, to stem the flow of illegal firearms, whether domestic or international, and particularly places like\u00a0Haiti\u00a0where the rule of law is under extreme threat.\u201d In January, Joly Germine \u2013 leader of the gang 400 Mawozo \u2013 pleaded guilty to\u00a0US charges over a gunrunning scheme\u00a0that saw dozens of rifles, handguns and a shotgun purchased legally in Florida under false pretenses, and smuggled into\u00a0Haiti. Land of mountains From above, traces of Haiti\u2019s extensive smuggling networks come into focus: the scars of a clandestine airstrip in its sun-bleached Central Plateau, a dock jutting from gang-held territory into the still waters of the Gulf of Gonave. Sea and air are the main means of transport for the guns and the drugs trans-shipments that fund more weapons purchases, experts say. And while\u00a0Haitian authorities have seen some successes in seizing illicit cargo over the years, the dramatic peaks and plains of this \u201cland of mountains\u201d add difficulty for an already understaffed police force and customs agency. Haiti\u2019s secluded and sparsely populated rural areas are ideal for landings and take-offs by small planes aiming to avoid observation. There are at least 11 known informal or clandestine airstrips in the country, according to UNODC, many originally built for humanitarian purposes following the country\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake. \u201cHere, you don\u2019t have anything around you. So, you just go, probably in the middle of the night, with a couple vehicles parked on each side of the improvised runway so the pilot can identify the area. They land, drop off or pick up stuff, and take off again all outside of\u00a0Haitian jurisdiction,\u201d a\u00a0security expert in Port-au-Prince told CNN. The sea is the preferred option for arms smugglers given the weight of their cargo.\u00a0Haiti\u2019s roughly horseshoe shape offers\u00a0over 1,100 miles of coastline, a challenging distance to comprehensively patrol for\u00a0Haiti\u2019s coast guard. Haiti\u2019s south in particular has emerged as a strategic location for smugglers, the UNODC reported in April, offering entry points for cocaine from South America, cannabis from Jamaica and firearms from across the region. \u201cOne popular method of moving illegal products involves \u201cbanana boats,\u201d go-fast vessels that arrive at night, beach on coastal banana plantations, and are subsequently destroyed after unloading their cargo,\u201d the UNODC report details. Guns and ammunition that arrive in the south are frequently sent onward to Port-au-Prince via the gang-controlled Route National 3, it also said, identifying the Mariani gang, Grand Ravine gang, and 5 Segond gang as \u201cmajor players in the organization and distribution of arms, munitions and drugs.\u201d In 2022, 5 Segond group attacked\u00a0Haiti\u2019s largest flour mill. It would have been an incongruous target if not for its location, positioned right next to Port-au-Prince Bay with a large jetty to accept deliveries. Just about a mile inland lies a major highway, and in between the two is a massive warehouse; a perfect distribution set-up for any import entrepreneur. Today, the entire area is controlled by 5 Segond, with security sources telling CNN that they believe the mill has been taken over and no longer functions. \u201cIzo has the jetty, so he has access to the sea. And boats keep coming in and out of that area, which again is completely controlled by his gang\u2026 and is kept under tight control, with barricades in the surroundings,\u201d the same security expert said, referring to 5 Segond\u2019s rapper frontman\u00a0Andre Johnson, who often posts videos of gang members flashing guns and paramilitary gear set to music on social media. Containers and corruption Contraband arriving via secretive small boats and planes is just part of the picture. Last month,\u00a0Haitian National Police and Customs agents seized\u00a0more than two dozen firearms, including 12 assault rifles, and nearly a thousand cartridges\u00a0from a shipping container that had arrived\u00a0in Haiti\u2019s northern city of Cap\u00a0Haitien. Drugs and arms smuggling has a long history in\u00a0Haiti, much of it facilitated through official channels by government agents and even, in one 2022 case, by a rogue Episcopal church staffer who allegedly hid guns and thousands of rounds in a shipping container reportedly labeled as church donations, before it was seized by customs agents in Port-au-Prince. Customs officials\u00a0trying to do their job\u00a0on the front lines in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0can face threats to their lives. In 2018, local press reported that several customs agents at the Malpasse border crossing between the Dominican Republic and\u00a0Haiti\u00a0were burned alive after an argument erupted in the course of a cargo inspection. Allegations of smuggling and gang affiliations have also been made at the highest levels of\u00a0Haiti\u2019s government. Four former\u00a0Haitian senators\u00a0have been sanctioned by the US for alleged drug trafficking, as have multiple past presidents and prime ministers of\u00a0Haiti\u00a0for allegedly financing the country\u2019s gangs. They\u2019re part of what gang leader Innocent refers to as the country\u2019s \u201coligarchs,\u201d who historically created and armed local gangs to become their enforcers-for-hire as they profited from white-collar crime schemes. \u201cAs a\u00a0Haitian human rights defender, I can\u2019t say that all the responsibility for these guns is on the US \u2013 I think it\u2019s the\u00a0Haitian government too. They need to regain control of the port, they need to control customs. The problem is corruption,\u201d says Esperance, the human rights advocate. That\u2019s why, he says, the planned deployment of an international police force to restore calm to\u00a0Haiti\u00a0is destined to fail unless the US and global community also commit to fighting corruption, building frameworks for good governance, and closing legal loopholes abused by the country\u2019s elite. \u201cNow, of course, the government is completely destabilized, it\u2019s easy for the gangs to smuggle weapons themselves. But how did they begin? Just two years ago, smuggling was going through official channels, and it happened that way because everyone was corrupt,\u201d Esperance said. Bertrand, the UNODC representative, also emphasized the importance of building up\u00a0Haiti\u2019s institutions as its new government takes shape. Her agency is working to strengthen the country\u2019s customs authority and coast guard, for example, including providing much-needed equipment from protective gear to cargo scanners. \u201cIt\u2019s time for people in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0to live peacefully \u2013 for their kids to go back to school, for them to be able to eat every day.\u201d And that means, she says, ensuring that \u201cnational authorities are well-trained, well-equipped, and ready to face and curb down the level of violence.\u201d CNN reached out to Homeland Security Investigations, part of the US Department of Homeland Security; the US Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement, Haiti\u2019s National Police and Haiti\u2019s General Customs Administration for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/americas/haiti-mss-unodc-guns-drugs-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_africa_tiwa-savage-water-and-garri-nigeria-spc", "text": "Despite her extraordinary success in Afrobeats music, Tiwa Savage has long harbored a secret aspiration: to pursue a career in acting. \u201cActing, I would say, was my first love before music,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Larry Madowo during a recent interview in Lagos. At 44, the multifaceted, award-winning Nigerian artist has transformed her dreams into reality. On May 10, her much-anticipated debut film, \u201cWater & Garri,\u201d hit Prime Video, marking her leap into acting. Executive produced by Savage and directed by her long-time music video director Meji Alabi, \u201cWater & Garri\u201d is a collaboration between Everything Savage, Unbound Studios, and JM Films. The concept was born from Savage\u2019s idea to create a visual album for her 2021 EP of the same name. Because of that, it \u201cinitially it was only supposed to be like a short film,\u201d Savage said, \u201cand then it grew on its own and took its own identity.\u201d Written by Comfort Emmanuel, the film is set in a fictional town on the Cape Coast of Ghana and follows a determined fashion designer named Aisha (Savage) who returns to her hometown due to a family tragedy after a decade in the US. However, upon her return home, she finds her once familiar surroundings altered by escalating violence and heightened tensions. As she reconnects with her family, old friends, and a former flame, Aisha must confront her past and face the guilt of what she left behind \u2013 an experience Savage says drew parallels to her own life. \u201cWe both felt like we had to go somewhere to chase our dreams,\u201d said Savage, who spent two weeks in intensive training in London to prepare for the role of Aisha. \u201cIt was just to break me out of my shell, to break me out of Tiwa Savage and just empty me out \u2013 and then just allow me to be or embody like a whole different character,\u201d she added. Experimenting with a new sound As the production of the film pressed forward, Savage didn\u2019t only shed her superstar persona, she moved on from the initial musical inspiration for the film, instead opting to create an original soundtrack for the movie. \u201cIt was supposed to include the first five songs on the EP; by the time we finished filming, it just took on a whole different identity, and we just created a whole new soundtrack,\u201d the singer explained. The album served as a platform for Savage to push her vocal boundaries and delve into new musical genres. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been boxed to a certain sound because I\u2019ve done it for over 10 years,\u201d Savage said. The 10-song soundtrack included collaborations with French Nigerian singer Asa on the folk song \u201cEmotions,\u201d\u00a0American gospel artist Zacardi Cortez on \u201cI Need You,\u201d and Richard Bona & The Cavemen on the jazz track \u201cWater & Garri.\u201d \u201cCreating the soundtrack allowed me to explore those different genres, and I think I didn\u2019t feel like I would have been able to do that as Tiwa Savage,\u201d she said. \u201c(So) I was able to explore those pockets of my talent.\u201d \u00a0 The singer admits she has always loved Jazz, R&B, and gospel music, but after acting in \u201cWater & Garri\u201d and performing the soundtrack, she says has discovered how much she has grown as an artist and feels encouraged to be limitless in her creativity. \u201cI\u2019m not limiting myself to the sound that people know me for; I\u2019ve definitely grown even in a performance \u2013 like I used to have a lot of dances and do routines,\u201d the singer-turned-actress explained. \u201cNow I think I\u2019m more about vocal delivery,\u201d she added. \u201cGoing forward from that \u2026 I feel like I can do anything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/africa/tiwa-savage-water-and-garri-nigeria-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_airplane-spotted-passenger-overhead-bin", "text": "Airplane overhead compartments. Home to luggage of all shapes and sizes, the odd coat or two, several duty-free bags, a fair bit of dust and\u2026 passengers? Last week, a video was posted on TikTok appearing to depict a traveler on a Southwest Airlines flight peering out from inside an overhead locker. The clip quickly spread across social media, although the original TikTok seems to have since been deleted. It\u2019s not the first time a video like this has hit the internet. In 2019, a flight attendant \u2013 also on a Southwest flight \u2013 was captured on film poking their head out of an overhead compartment. At the time, the airline released a statement saying the crew member was enjoying \u201ca brief moment of fun,\u201d before confirming \u201cthis is not our normal procedure.\u201d A Southwest representative told CNN Travel the airline was also \u201caware\u201d of last week\u2019s locker incident and is currently \u201clooking into it.\u201d Not a \u2018certifiable place for passengers\u2019 Given passengers are advised to stay in their seats for the duration of a plane journey \u2013 usually with their seatbelt fastened \u2013 it should go without saying that climbing into the overhead locker is a bad idea. As British flight attendant Kris Major tells CNN Travel, the overhead bin is \u201cnot a certifiable place to be as a passenger.\u201d \u201cIf we encountered turbulence they could get hurt \u2013 if they got blown out they could really get hurt and they could also hurt someone underneath them,\u201d says Major, adding that a passenger in an overhead bin also wouldn\u2019t have access to an oxygen mask in the event of an emergency. His words are echoed by Guido van Geenen, vice president of corporate communications for overhead bin supplier Diehl Aviation. Van Geenen tells CNN Travel that while the lockers are designed to accommodate \u201cquite a lot of weight\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a safe place for passengers. \u201cClimbing in and out of an overhead bin may also be dangerous,\u201d adds van Geenen. In order to get into a locker, a person would have to clamber onto the back of the airplane seat, which could buckle under the weight. Van Geenen also makes the important point that \u201cbins do not have a way to open them from the inside\u201d \u2013 meaning if you\u2019re inside a locker and someone closes it from the outside \u201cyou have a problem.\u201d \u201cAll in all, we definitely do not recommend using the overhead bins for a nap,\u201d says van Geenen. \u201cThey are designed to safely hold the passengers\u2019 bags, but not made for a casual nap.\u201d Flight attendant\u2019s perspective Flight attendant Major\u2019s witnessed a lot in his 25 years of flying, but he\u2019s never actually seen a traveler inside the luggage bin. \u201cIf I saw a passenger trying to climb into an overhead locker, it would take me a few seconds to believe that was what was happening in front of me,\u201d he says. That said, Major admits he has \u201cseen photographs of crew in lockers\u201d and suggests it\u2019s the kind of thing that, while \u201cpretty frowned upon\u201d does happen from time to time when crew have the aircraft to themselves before boarding. While there\u2019s been a recent uptick in unruly passenger behavior on airplanes, Major says that if he encountered a passenger inside the locker, he wouldn\u2019t automatically assume they were being deliberately disruptive. His goal, first and foremost, would be to \u201cjust get them out\u201d and ensure they were safe. \u201cIt would depend on why they were up there as to my reaction,\u201d says Major. \u201cI would get them out, and then ascertain what was going on. I would assume that they were either under the influence of something, or mentally unwell.\u201d If a passenger spots another passenger inside an overhead locker, Major advises they notify a crew member, rather than intervene themselves \u2013 this same advice applies if passengers witness any untoward or unusual behavior on board. \u201cA passenger could inadvertently create a passenger disruption incident, because they could create conflict \u2013 whereas the crew are trained to de-escalate,\u201d Major says. Major also discourages passengers from filming and posting about an incident like this one. What might seem like a funny viral moment could have negative consequences, says Major, especially if the person in the video is already vulnerable. Future of overhead lockers While the airplane overhead locker is currently out of bounds for passengers, some as-yet-to-be-realized airplane cabin concepts reimagine this area as a space for travelers to stretch out and relax mid-flight. Take Toyota Boshoku\u2019s CLOUD CAPSULE concept, which envisages the area above the economy seat as an additional space for passengers to retreat to once the airplane reaches cruising altitude. In 2021, this design was nominated for a Crystal Cabin Award, a prestigious aviation design prize. While this concept might seem futuristic, the idea of passengers making use of the overhead locker space has some precedent. Way back in the 1950s, travelers who flew with Pan American Airways across the Atlantic on the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser were able to sleep in overhead compartments mid-flight. Major says flight attendants \u201calways look out for future developments,\u201d but he suggests crew are more focused on overhead lockers becoming bigger to accommodate more bags, rather than being adapted to accommodate passengers. \u201cHand luggage is one of the biggest issues facing flight attendants,\u201d says Major. \u201cIt causes problems if we can\u2019t get all those bags away or if we can\u2019t get passengers to put their bags away or if they\u2019re bringing too much on\u2026\u201d On most flights, overhead locker space is \u201cat a premium\u201d as Major puts it. Bins are so packed with travelers\u2019 bags and belongings that the idea of a person squeezing in there too is laughable. But Major is keen to stress that while the idea of someone climbing into the overhead locker might \u201cseem funny,\u201d it\u2019s important to remember an airplane cabin is a very specific environment and safety restrictions are there for a reason. \u201cYou\u2019re barrelling through the sky at 35,000 feet \u2013 500, 600 miles per hour,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to create an issue on board the aircraft, it\u2019s not the place to do it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/airplane-spotted-passenger-overhead-bin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_sport_fifa-to-take-legal-advice-on-calls-to-suspend-israel-football-association", "text": "World soccer governing body FIFA will hold a special council meeting within the next two months to determine if the Israel Football Association (IFA) will be suspended from international competition, president Gianni Infantino said Friday at a\u00a0congress\u00a0gathering in Bangkok, Thailand. The Palestinian Football Association (PFA) had called for a vote to ban Israel before Infantino made the announcement over accusations that the IFA had violated FIFA rules during the continued war in Gaza. \u201cDue to the obvious sensitivity of these matters, FIFA will mandate, as of now, independent legal expertise to analyse and assess the three requests made by the Palestinian Football Association and ensure that the statutes and regulations of FIFA are applied in the correct way,\u201d Infantino said. \u201cIn order to ensure a fair and due process, of course, this legal assessment will have to allow for input and claims of both member associations.\u201d Infantino said the results and recommendations would be forwarded to all FIFA Council members before attending an extraordinary meeting that will be scheduled to take place before July 20, where the PFA\u2019s proposal to suspend Israel from international matches will be addressed. Prior to Infantino\u2019s announcement, the PFA President Jibril Rajoub had called for immediate action from FIFA. \u201cAs I speak to you today, the Palestinian people, including the Palestinian football family, are enduring an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe. We are witness\u00a0[to]\u00a0a live televised genocide unfolding in Gaza,\u201d Rajoub said. \u201cI ask you to stand on the right side of history and vote now. The suffering of millions, including thousands of footballers, deserves as much. If not now, then when? Mr President, the ball is in your court.\u201d Rajoub went on to call for FIFA \u201cto temporarily suspend the IFA as a member of FIFA with immediate effect.\u201d Jordan Football Association general secretary Samar Nassar backed Rajoub, saying: \u201cWe are not here to deliberate on the human tragedy. We are here to take a vote, the world is witnessing what FIFA will do today.\u201d \u201cFIFA has stood on the right side of history before when it banned Yugoslavia, when it banned Russia, and when it banned South Africa for more than 20 years. And I think we have a role to take today,\u201d Nassar added. Reacting to the calls for the IFA\u2019s ban, the association\u2019s President Shino Moshe Zuares said: \u201cToday, maybe more than ever, I believe that football must be a key element in healing the fractures and wounds, helping us and everyone to recover. Yet once again, we are facing a cynical, political and hostile attempt by the Palestinian Association to harm Israeli football.\u201d \u201cMake no mistake, the IFA never violated rules set by FIFA and UEFA and will never do so in the future,\u201d he added. \u201cSeven months after the terrible day, when football matches cannot be played in large parts of Israel, north and south, and over 130 Israelis are still being held in Gaza, it is injustice that even in these circumstances we find ourselves fighting for our basic right to be part of the game.\u201d In his closing remarks on the debate, Infantino said: \u201cLike everyone, I was extremely, extremely shocked by what happened on October 7 in Israel. And like anyone else, I was extremely, extremely shocked, and am extremely shocked at what\u2019s happening in Gaza.\u201d \u201cI pray for all those people who suffer the unimaginable \u2026 and I want, like all of you, just one thing: peace.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/sport/fifa-to-take-legal-advice-on-calls-to-suspend-israel-football-association/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_17_americas_gary-allen-srery-alberta-canada-deaths", "text": "After 48 years of investigation, Alberta Royal Canadian Mounted Police linked the deaths of four young women killed in the Calgary area in the 1970s to one man \u2013 a serial sexual offender who they believe may have committed more violent crimes until his death. Police say Gary Allen Srery killed\u00a0junior high school friends Eva Dvorak and Patricia McQueen, both 14 years old, in 1976, before killing Melissa Rehorek, 20, and Barbara MacLean, 19, in the span of a year. \u201cSrery\u2019s criminality spanned decades, over multiple jurisdictions, under numerous aliases, and the Alberta RCMP believe there may be more victims,\u201d Alberta RCMP said in a news release Friday. Crime scene DNA was seized during the initial homicide investigations, but due to a lack of DNA technology at the time, police failed to link a suspect to the killings. About 30 years later, in 2003, police were able to confirm the same suspect was linked to Rehorek and MacLean\u2019s deaths through DNA evidence. And in 2021, resubmitted crime scene evidence from the Dvorak and McQueen investigations unearthed a link with those of Rehorek and MacLean, according to RCMP. \u201cThe same unknown male DNA profile was identified on both victims that matched the unknown male DNA profile from the Rehorek and MacLean murders,\u201d police said in a news release. \u201cIn light of this new information, the RCMP believed that the same male offender was responsible for the deaths of all four victims.\u201d Advancements in forensic science technology and the use of forensic investigative genetic genealogy, which combines DNA analysis with traditional genealogy research, have allowed more breakthroughs with DNA evidence collection. Police used genetic genealogy to identify, Srery, an American who died of natural causes in an Idaho state prison in 2011 while serving a sentence for rape. \u201cWith assistance from Interpol and Idaho State Police Forensic Services, Srery\u2019s DNA was confirmed as a match to the unknown male DNA profile present on all four Calgary victims,\u201d police said. At the time of the killings, Srery was living illegally in Canada, having fled the US in 1974 after posting bail for a rape charge in California, according to RCMP. Before coming to Calgary, Srery had an extensive criminal record in the US for sexual offenses, including forcible rape, kidnapping, burglary and sexual perversion. Srery lived in Alberta and British Columbia from the mid 1970s until he was deported in 2003, police say. He used several aliases, including Willy Blackman and Rex Long. \u201cFor over forty years, investigators did not give up in their pursuit to identify those responsible for these murders,\u201d said David Hall of the Alberta RCMP. \u201cIdentifying the perpetrator does not bring Eva, Patsy, Melissa or Barbara back. It is our hope however, that the families are finally able to have some answers as to what happened to their loved ones all of those years ago,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_14_americas_venezuela-essequibo-guyana-csis-intl-latam", "text": "Venezuela continues to build up military infrastructure and hardware close to the border with Guyana as President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters scale up their threats to annex an\u00a0oil-rich piece of Guyanese land. In a report shared with CNN, the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that while the Venezuelan government \u201chas little to gain and much to lose from a full-blown conflict\u201d it continues to play \u201ca dangerous game\u201d over its claim over the densely forested Essequibo region. \u201cThe constant drumbeat asserting \u2018the Essequibo is ours,\u2019 alongside the creation of new military commands and legal structures to oversee the defense of the region, is helping to institutionalize a sense of perpetual prewar footing,\u201d it wrote. Tension over the region, which amounts to about two-thirds of Guyanese national territory, mounted last year after a Venezuelan referendum in which voters assented to creating\u00a0a Venezuelan state within the disputed region. Guyana had called the move a step towards annexation and an \u201cexistential\u201d threat as the specter of armed conflict loomed over the region. CNN previously reported in February about an expansion of operations at Venezuela\u2019s Anacoco Island military base despite both countries agreeing in December to pursue a diplomatic avenue to resolve the conflict. Using satellite imagery and social media, CSIS found that the expansion of Anacoco Island\u2019s military base has continued. A bridge is seen being built across the Cuyuni River to connect the Venezuelan riverbank to the island, which has been a point of contention between the countries after it was awarded to Guyana in an 1899 ruling by an international tribunal. Venezuela annexed it in the 1960s. The island\u2019s airfield has expanded and now includes a small control tower, CSIS writes. Satellite imagery from March showed an area next to the airfield with more than 75 field tents, \u201cenough for a battalion-sized unit of several hundred personnel.\u201d The field tents have since been relocated to the southern side of the airfield \u201cdemonstrating the base\u2019s continued ability to provide logistics and resupply for a sizeable military force continuously for over a month,\u201d it wrote. Meanwhile, by the coast, at least two Iranian-built\u00a0Peykaap III (Zolfaghar) fast missile boats are seen at Venezuela\u2019s small coast guard station at Punta Barima, \u201cplacing Venezuelan missiles and naval forces within arm\u2019s reach of the Guyana-administered Essequibo\u201d as it just 40 miles (64 kilometers) from the Guyanese border. Maduro could \u2018fall victim to own rhetoric\u2019 The threats to Guyana have concerned its partners. Last week, two US Navy F/A-18 fighter jets flew over the capital Georgetown, demonstrating \u201cour routine security cooperation and expanding bilateral defense partnership with Guyana,\u201d the US Embassy in Guyana wrote. While smaller than Idaho, Guyana is home to vast oil reserves and is on track to become the world\u2019s highest per capita oil producer. It, however, has an army estimated to be less than 5,000 soldiers, and lacks the hardware or manpower to face possible Venezuelan aggression. All things considered, \u201cif you\u2019re if you\u2019re Guyana, and your army is 5,000 people, it doesn\u2019t seem like the Venezuelans are taking their foot off the gas,\u201d Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program\u00a0at CSIS and lead author of the report, told CNN. There has been speculation that the upcoming Venezuelan elections at the end of July have given Maduro the motivation to escalate against Guyana, using it as a way to distract from his record: Millions of people have fled the country due to poor economic conditions, food shortages and limited access to health care. CSIS argues that instead of tamping down the aggression after the vote, \u201cMaduro may be tempted to ramp up both rhetoric and action related to the Essequibo in a true gambit to manufacture a regional crisis in the aftermath of a stolen election.\u201d It may not be in Maduro\u2019s interest to \u201cinitiate a full-blown conflict with neighbor Guyana, but his escalatory rhetoric tethers his political reputation and legitimacy to his willingness to back his words with force\u201d especially with his key internal ally, the armed forces, CSIS writes. \u201cThus, one of the most concerning possibilities is that Maduro will fall victim to his own rhetoric. He has whipped up nationalist passions without providing an escape valve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/americas/venezuela-essequibo-guyana-csis-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

The two attended an event Saturday held by Nigeria\u2019s Defence Staff and \u2018Nigeria: Unconquered\u2019 \u2013 a local charity supporting wounded servicemembers inspired by the Duke of Sussex\u2019s Invictus Games Foundation. After arriving at an officer\u2019s mess late morning local time they were immediately taken to watch a sitting volleyball game. They were given scarves in the green and white colors of Nigeria as they took their seats\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0arena. Harry caused a lot of excitement when he joined in the game \u2013 his Invictus team on one side, the other led by a team of members of the Nigerian military, which won the game 25 to 21.

Nigeria loves you. Welcome home.\u201d They presented her with a book and a Nigerian fabric. Meghan revealed in 2022 that she discovered she was 43% Nigerian from a genealogy test. Wounded service members shared their thoughts about the importance of the Sussexes visit. \u201cHonestly, Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s visit to Nigeria, it means a lot to me personally,\u201d flight sergeant Ifeoma Loveleen Nwagbo told CNN. \u201cThis [Invictus] initiative is very, very fantastic because it makes me understand that yes: I can actually achieve what I couldn\u2019t achieve before in my life. And then [Harry] coming to Nigeria \u2013 Wow! I\u2019m just feeling on top of the world, because I will meet him \u2013 it\u2019s fantastic!\u201d she said.

A male suspect entered the building early Friday morning and threw what appeared to be a Molotov cocktail, the local mayor said. The man climbed on top of a trash bin and got to the second floor of the synagogue,\u00a0then threw the projectile into the building causing a fire, Rouen mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol told journalists at the scene. \u201cHe was [quickly] brought down by security forces before trying to wrestle with them. He then tried to assault security forces with a knife, a long knife,\u201d the mayor said, adding it was then when security forces opened fired and killed the suspect. No one was hurt during the attempted attack, according to Mayer-Rossignol. Police arrived very quickly, partially because they saw the suspect on security cameras, he said. The local prosecutor\u2019s office has launched two inquiries, one into the arson and the other into the police firing of arms, Mayer-Rossignol said. Chmouel Lubecki,\u00a0a rabbi at the synagogue, told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Friday morning: \u201cUnfortunately, we were expecting this.\u201d \u201cWe all have this worry inside of us, but when it actually happens, it is still shocking,\u201d he added.

I congratulate them on their responsiveness and courage,\u201d Darmanin said. Rouen authorities had increased police presence at the city\u2019s synagogue following the October 7 attacks in Israel. Security measures have ramped up at Jewish institutions across France in response to tensions around the ongoing Israel-Gaza war. Darmanin last month announced additional security at synagogues and Jewish schools. \u201cAs Passover approaches and given the current international situation, I have told local officials to significantly step up security at places visited by our Jewish compatriots, especially with regards to synagogues and Jewish schools,\u201d the minister wrote on X.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/europe/france-armed-man-synagogue-rouen-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_americas_new-york-city-chinese-migrants-flushing-intl-latam", "text": " A simple act of walking into a mosque with his wife and two children in New York City is what made the past six months of struggle worth it for Ye Chengxiang \u2013 even if not everyone is celebrating his arrival. \u201cIt\u2019s only been over two months here, but we can feel the spirit of freedom, inclusiveness, and equality,\u201d he said over a bowl of noodles. It was his only day off from working 12-hour shifts at a Chinese restaurant in New York City. The slim former restaurant owner left China last October. The ruling Communist Party\u2019s crackdown on his Hui Muslim ethnic group and growing restrictions on personal life gave his family no choice, he says. \u201cWhen I was in China, I had a pent-up feeling in my heart,\u201d he said of living as a Muslim in China, where his children were banned from entering a mosque. Ye and his wife drained $40,000 of their life savings and illegally crossed the United States\u2019 southern border in December after an exhausting weeks-long journey that saw the family take a hazardous boat journey from Colombia to the edge of the Darien Gap, a mountainous rainforest region that connects South and Central America. His anxieties melted away as Ye crossed into the US, which he described as entering a warm embrace. \u201cI felt like I was home, and that feeling was very real,\u201d he said. Their destination was New York City\u2019s Flushing neighborhood, home to a Chinese community going back generations. The city has integrated\u202fmillions\u202fof migrants over the decades, and it continues to inspire newcomers like Ye \u2013 even as the arrival of such migrants has turned into a flashpoint in US politics ahead of the November elections. After arriving in New York, Ye spent a week in a Manhattan shelter. Then, with the help of a group of other Chinese Muslim\u202fasylum\u202fseekers, he found a place to live and a job making noodles as his family proceeded through the religious\u202fasylum claim process.\u202f Their first court date is in October He is exhausted, barely having time to learn English or explore the new city. But he is happy. The first time that he walked to a mosque in Flushing with his wife and daughters, \u201cI immediately felt that rock, that lump in my heart, dissolve away,\u201d he told CNN. On downtown Flushing\u2019s Main Street, people hand out fliers offering help, for a fee, for the undocumented to secure drivers\u2019 licenses. Alongside the street vendors hawking vegetables, undocumented migrants walk into buildings with employment agencies offering restaurant and sales jobs. This is what draws Chinese migrants toward enclaves like Flushing and Sunset Park, where immigrant networks, legal service centers, job markets and nonprofits form a vital support system. For Chinese\u202fasylum\u202fseekers like Ye, there is a well-trodden route to residency in the US. Chinese nationals have the\u202fhighest\u202fnumber of asylum claims granted\u202f\u00a0in the US compared to other nationalities, because their \u201cpathway to claiming political\u202fasylum\u202f[for Chinese nationals] is more codified,\u201d said Amy Hsin, a sociology professor at Queens College in New York, who specializes in immigration and social inequality.\u00a0 The US expanded\u202fasylum\u202fpathways\u202ffor Chinese citizens in the past due to geopolitical events and policies, like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and the one-child policy, she explained. Recently, growing restrictions on freedoms in China and its stuttering economy have led to this new influx of disillusioned Chinese citizens. More than 37,000 Chinese citizens were picked up by law enforcement crossing illegally from Mexico in 2023, US government data shows. That\u2019s up from around 3,800 people the year before, and many of them were headed to New York City, according to experts. In a statement to CNN, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it is on \u201ca human rights development path suited to its national conditions,\u201d emphasizing the country\u2019s stunning economic transformation over the past few decades. \u201cAs a country under the rule of law, the Chinese government protects its people\u2019s freedom of speech and freedom of religious belief in accordance with the law,\u201d it also said. \u2018America is better\u2019 On the fourth floor of an old mall, migrant workers walk into a legal service center. They say they have lost their passports, or had them confiscated, in the melee of voluntarily turning themselves in for\u202fasylum\u202fwith the Customs and Border Protection. The office, which helps them in their\u202fasylum\u202fapplications, also connects them with the Chinese Embassy to apply for new travel documents. In the waiting room, migrants told CNN how videos on social media, providing detailed instructions on how to cross Central America to the US, inspired them to make the journey. They spoke of the socio-economic pressures back in China, made worse by pandemic restrictions and its lack of economic rebound, forcing them to leave the country. The center\u2019s owner, who declined to be named in this story because he does not have a license to practice law in the US, has helped more than 100 Chinese nationals since opening the office two years ago. The burden of proof for\u202fasylum\u202fclaims in the US is high and the owner said many of his clients have struggled to provide concrete evidence of political and religious repression they faced in China. Many go on to protest against the Chinese government once in the US, freed from Chinese authorities and its censors, he said. Dressed simply in jeans and a black jacket, Jiang Zhen said the\u202fsweeping crackdown\u202fon free speech, civil society and religion was suffocating him in China. He believes he was blacklisted for criticizing China\u2019s government on social media sites, his accounts banned or suspended. Poverty in rural China, like in his hometown in Hunan province, had become unbearable, with relatives and parents of friends \u201cdrinking pesticides, drowning themselves in rivers, or hanging themselves \u2026 especially when they are suffering from diseases like cancer and have no money for treatment,\u201d he said, adding that the Chinese government ignores \u201cthe living conditions of the lower classes.\u201d As he waits for his work permit, which can take up to 18 months to approve, the 33-year-old now works illegally cleaning dishes at a Cantonese restaurant in Queens. He earns $4,000 a month, slightly more than what he earned as a business owner in the coastal Chinese province of Guangdong. Next to him, a woman in a pearl-colored puffer jacket, who asked to remain anonymous because she works illegally in the country, said the US was not what she had imagined. She joked that China\u2019s infrastructure bests what she has seen in New York. \u201cFrom movies I watched when I was younger, I remembered Chinatowns being bustling and beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after coming here, I found that Chinatown is in a state of\u202f\u200b\u200bdisrepair. It\u2019s broken and dirty. I was so surprised,\u201d she said as the room burst out in laughter. When asked why she has chosen to remain in the US, she replied: \u201cBecause the US is actually more powerful, despite sometimes the broken appearance,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not starving in China, but everyone wants a better life. Obviously, America is better.\u201d Anti-China measures Both China and US authorities have been concerned with the uptick in migration to the southern border \u2013 but for entirely different reasons. A Chinese government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to comment publicly, told CNN that they believed some new Chinese migrants are participating in violent anti-China demonstrations in the US to help with their asylum cases.\u00a0The official pointed to clashes between anti-China protesters and pro-China supporters in San Francisco in November, when Chinese leader Xi Jinping was attending a forum in the city. In the US, a\u202frecord number\u202fof migrants at the southern border has been seized upon by Republicans who claim it as proof of the Biden administration\u2019s impotence, pushing immigration control to a top election issue. While most migrants at the southern border hail from Latin American countries, some politicians have focused on Chinese migration as a security concern; Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, claimed last May that some Chinese migrants at the border had military experience,\u202faccording to his blog, though he did not offer evidence. Wan Yanhai, a human rights activist based in New York, said the implication that the Chinese\u202fasylum\u202fseekers could be soldiers or spies was \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d There would be little reason for the Chinese government to embed spies among southern border arrivals, he pointed out, considering migrants are not the demographic that would gain access to state secrets in the US. \u201cThese migrants in the US are doing low-level jobs and don\u2019t speak the language, so they can\u2019t do this kind of work. \u2026 It\u2019s impossible for them to be spies.\u201d But the rhetoric around the rise of undocumented Chinese migrants highlights growing tensions between the US and Chinese governments. Geopolitical and security concerns\u202fhave led an increasingly hawkish Biden administration\u202fto unravel years of technological and economic integration with its chief rival in the Pacific. But Jiang, the\u202fasylum\u202fseeker who believes he was blacklisted by Beijing, is unfazed by the growing intergovernmental tensions. \u201cIt\u2019s not really anti-China, it\u2019s anti-Communist Party. I\u2019m also against the Communist Party, I don\u2019t have a good impression of them either, right?\u201d \u2018Deportation can\u2019t stop me from embracing freedom\u2019 Wan, a prominent former\u202fHIV activist in China, had to leave the country in 2010 due to harassment by Chinese authorities, he says. He received permanent US residence a year later and has gone on to help Chinese migrants in Flushing. Many of the new arrivals head to the enclave\u2019s unlicensed hostels, he said. He worries that rising hostel prices \u2013 upwards of $20 per night \u2013 could lead to a rise in homelessness, especially for the low-income elderly population in Flushing. Li Jiada lives in one of those hostels, sharing a cramped room with five other men, sparsely decorated except for a calendar hanging above his single bed. Life has not been easy for the 26-year-old, soft-spoken former fashion photographer since he arrived in the US on January 2023. He had spent three months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center after failing an initial screening for\u202fasylum\u202fwhen he crossed the southern border. He was released this year pending deportation proceedings expected within the next year. He initially struggled to find a job in New York. When he found one, he says, he was sexually harassed by a client and has since found a new role as a manicurist, earning $2,000 a month. His costs are higher than what he earns, but he says, \u201cThere\u2019s no regret because coming here has given me more options.\u201d He is desperate to stay in the US and thinks Christianity, which he discovered while in detention, will save him from deportation. The Communist Party\u202fsees any large\u202fgroup outside its dominion as a threat, has banned the online sale of Bibles, and has arrested Christians for \u201cinciting subversion of state power.\u201d \u201cMaybe my only way forward is through Jesus,\u201d he said. Li plans on filing a new\u202fasylum\u202fapplication based on his new-found religion. Sitting in a Baptist church in Flushing, Li spoke about the stress of the looming deportation and thinks back about the first thing he did when he arrived in New York: seeing the Statue of Liberty, a sculpture that has become a symbol of hope for millions of immigrants before him. \u201cAfter the treacherous journey to get here, I needed to see the embodiment of my beliefs: democracy, freedom, equality, and rule of law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US has yet to accept me, but deportation can\u2019t stop me from embracing freedom.\u201d The ethnic enclave has largely shielded the migrants CNN spoke to from a recent\u202frise\u202fin anti-Asian crimes in the city. Still, Li thinks he may have been targeted for being Chinese: Someone threw a full can of soda at him as he waited for a train back to Flushing from Manhattan, he said. And like a true New Yorker, he gave the assailant a piece of his mind. \u201cAt that moment, I felt like I could suddenly speak English fluently,\u201d he joked. \u201cMy talent was unleashed, and I said: \u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/americas/new-york-city-chinese-migrants-flushing-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_sport_scottie-scheffler-detained", "text": "The world\u2019s top-ranked golfer, Scottie Scheffler, was arrested, charged with felony assault and released from jail before shooting a stellar 5-under par at the PGA Championship on Friday in a whirlwind few hours that upended the typically staid world of professional golf. \u201cI feel like my head is still spinning. I can\u2019t really explain what happened this morning. I did spend some time stretching in a jail cell. That\u2019s a first for me,\u201d Scheffler said Friday afternoon. \u201cI was fortunate to be able to make it back out and play some golf today.\u201d Scheffler, 27, was attempting to drive to the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky, for the second round of the tournament at about 6 a.m. when he came to the scene of a fatal crash. He allegedly injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was then detained and arrested, according to police. Scheffler was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. He was released from jail and returned to the golf course for his tee time. Shortly after 10 a.m., he struck his first tee shot of the day, earning a round of applause from the crowd, and birdied the first hole. Scheffler began Friday tied for 12th place at 4-under par. After his arrest, he shot 5-under par in the second round and was tied for third place when he finished play. The arrest of the World No. 1 golfer \u2013 known as an \u201cupright, outstanding\u201d player who became a father just days ago \u2013 dramatically shook up one of golf\u2019s major tournaments. Scheffler won his second Masters title last month and\u00a0was the overwhelming favorite in the PGA Championship. Scheffler\u2019s attorney told CNN he plans to plead not guilty to the charges. In a statement, Scheffler called the incident a \u201cbig misunderstanding.\u201d \u201cThis morning, I was proceeding as directed by police officers.\u00a0It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier, and there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do,\u201d he said in a statement on Instagram.\u00a0\u201cI never intended to disregard any of the instructions.\u00a0I\u2019m hopeful to put this to the side and focus on golf today.\u201d Speaking after his round, Scheffler declined to comment further on the specifics of what led to the arrest but said he believed it would be \u201cresolved fairly quickly.\u201d Scheffler said he was \u201cpretty rattled\u201d by the arrest and that his heart rate was up during play. Still, he praised the officers at the jail, who he said made jokes while he was fingerprinted, and said he was grateful for the police. What led to the arrest The incident began when Scheffler drove to the Valhalla Golf Club for the second round of the tournament around 6 a.m., according to ESPN\u2019s Jeff Darlington, who witnessed and filmed the arrest. Earlier in the morning, a pedestrian had been fatally struck by a bus while trying to cross the main road leading to the course, Louisville Metro Police Department spokesperson Dwight Mitchell said. Because of that, there was an increased police presence around the course\u2019s entrance. When Scheffler arrived in a marked player courtesy vehicle, he tried to drive around the crash scene on a median, according to ESPN, which first reported Scheffler\u2019s detention. \u201cA police officer instructed Scheffler to stop, but Scheffler continued to drive about 10 to 20 yards toward the entrance,\u201d ESPN said. \u201cScheffler then stopped his vehicle at the entrance to Valhalla. The police officer then began to scream at Scheffler to get out of the car. When Scheffler exited the vehicle, the officer shoved Scheffler against the car and immediately placed him in handcuffs,\u201d Darlington posted on X. Police escorted a handcuffed Scheffler into a police vehicle, Darlington\u2019s video shows. \u201cRight now he\u2019s going to jail,\u201d an officer at the scene says in the video. According to a Louisville Metro Police report, Scheffler was trying to gain access to the golf course when he was stopped by an officer wearing a full police uniform and a yellow reflective rain jacket. The officer, identified as Det. Bryan Gillis, stopped Scheffler and attempted to give instructions. \u201cSubject refused to comply and accelerated forward, dragging Detective Gillis to the ground,\u201d the report states. The detective suffered pain, swelling and abrasions to his left wrist and knee and was taken to the hospital for further treatment, the report states. His uniform pants, valued at about $80, \u201cwere damaged beyond repair,\u201d the report adds. Louisville police issued a statement saying they were still gathering information and investigating what happened. \u201cWe are in the process of conducting a thorough investigation. We are appreciative that all parties involved are fully cooperating,\u201d police said. Attorney says Scheffler \u2018did not do anything wrong\u2019 Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steven Romines, told CNN in a statement Friday that Scheffler was headed to the golf course to prepare for his tee time at the\u00a0PGA Championship. \u201cDue to the combination of event traffic and a traffic fatality in the area it was a very chaotic situation. He was proceeding as directed by another traffic officer and driving a marked player\u2019s vehicle with credentials visible,\u201d Romines said. \u201cIn the confusion, Scottie is alleged to have disregarded a different officer\u2019s traffic signals resulting in these charges.\u201d Romines says multiple eyewitnesses have confirmed that Scheffler \u201cdid not do anything wrong\u201d but drove as directed. \u201cHe stopped immediately upon being directed to and never at any point assaulted any officer with his vehicle,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe will plead not guilty and litigate this matter as needed.\u201d Scheffler\u2019s arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday. PGA of America, the organizer of the PGA Championship, identified the pedestrian who died in the earlier crash as John Mills, a worker with a vendor for the\u00a0organization. \u201cOur primary concern today remains with the family of John Mills, who lost his life in a tragic accident early this morning while reporting to work,\u201d the organization said. \u201cAs it relates to the incident involving Scottie Scheffler, we are fully cooperating as local authorities review what took place. While the legal process plays out, questions should be directed to Scheffler\u2019s attorney or local authorities.\u201d In separate statements, both Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear offered condolences to the victim\u2019s family and described the ensuing incident with Scheffler and police as \u201cunfortunate.\u201d \u201cLMPD is fully investigating this incident and the legal process will proceed.\u00a0We appreciate everyone\u2019s cooperation,\u201d Greenberg said. The man\u2019s death \u201ctruly puts everything in perspective,\u201d Scheffler said in his statement. Scheffler became father days ago Scheffler\u2019s arrest represents a stark contrast from his clean image, said David Dusek, senior writer at Golfweek. \u201cScottie Scheffler is one of the most squeaky clean, upright, outstanding, well-respected players out here on the PGA Tour,\u201d Dusek said. \u201cHe is someone who is known for having a very calm, level head on the golf course and he keeps that when he\u2019s off the golf course as well.\u201d After a stellar 2023 campaign that saw him retain the PGA Tour\u2019s Player of the Year title, Scheffler this season has only consolidated his status as the dominant force in men\u2019s golf. Just one week after a\u00a0commanding victory at The Arnold Palmer Invitational, he mounted a stunning late charge to become the\u00a0first player to ever defend The Players Championship. Since then, the 27-year-old has looked borderline unstoppable, as\u00a0victory at the RBC Heritage\u00a0\u2013 just one week on from\u00a0easing into his second green jacket\u00a0at Augusta \u2013 made it four wins in five starts. Scheffler last week stepped away from competitive action to be with wife Meredith as she gave birth to the couple\u2019s first child, Bennett. \u201cSitting at home with the girl I dated in high school with our child and then the Green Jacket sitting in the closet is a pretty insane feeling,\u201d he said, \u201cand I just wanted to be as thankful as possible.\u201d Following play Thursday in Louisville, Scheffler was looking ahead to trying to \u201cclean up a few of the mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cI missed two putts I felt like I should have holed today, but that\u2019s going to happen when the greens get a little chewed up,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like there was a couple things I can clean up going into tomorrow, but overall today was a solid round.\u201d Correction: An earlier version of this story had the wrong last name for attorney Steve Romines.

{"id": "2024_05_16_tech_damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system", "text": "A pair of recent ransomware attacks crippled computer systems at two major American health care firms, disrupting patient care and exposing fundamental weaknesses in the US health care system\u2019s defenses against hackers. In both cases, federal officials and private cyber experts scrambled to try to limit the damage and get computers back online. But the cascading effects from the hacks, with ambulances diverted from hospitals and pharmacies unable to process insurance, has underscored for some US lawmakers, senior Biden administration officials and policy experts that the health care system is ill-prepared for the ripple effects of a cyberattack and needs new security regulations. Health care lags other industries such as big financial institutions and energy providers when it comes to IT security, according to some experts. \u201cIndustry has successfully demanded voluntary cybersecurity for years \u2014 and this is what we get,\u201d Joshua Corman, a cybersecurity expert who has focused on the health sector for years, told CNN. Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the finance committee, told CNN that \u201cevery new devastating hack hammers home the need for mandatory cybersecurity standards in the health care sector, particularly when it comes to the largest companies that millions of patients depend on for care and medicine.\u201d Without action, the senator said, \u201cpatients\u2019 access to care and their personal health information will be compromised and ransomed by hackers over and over again.\u201d In 2023, 46 hospital systems in the US, comprising 141 hospitals, were impacted by ransomware,\u00a0according\u00a0to a tally from cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.\u00a0That\u2019s up from 25 hospital systems hit by ransomware in 2022, according to the firm. The two ransomware attacks hit different nerves of the health care system. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue, snarled service at pharmacies across the US and\u00a0may have compromised\u00a0the personal data of a third of Americans. In early May, cybercriminals used a different type of ransomware in an attack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals and 40 senior living facilities in 19 states. The hack\u00a0forced\u00a0the health network to divert ambulances from some hospitals. The Biden administration is preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals, senior White House cyber official Anne Neuberger confirmed this month. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would effectively re-victimize victims of cyberattacks by imposing penalties after they are hacked. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services previously said\u00a0they are willing to use a number of measures,\u00a0including\u00a0imposing\u00a0monetary fines, to both force and encourage health care organizations to better secure their systems. Momentum is also growing on Capitol Hill to force health care organizations to meet basic cybersecurity standards. A bill\u00a0introduced\u00a0in March by Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, would allow \u201cadvanced and accelerated\u201d Medicare payments to be sent to hacked health care providers as long as those providers and their contractors meet minimum cybersecurity standards. An unhealthy situation The ransomware attacks on Change Healthcare and Ascension have spotlighted the health sector\u2019s cybersecurity weakness like no other events before it, experts told CNN. And even if there are new regulatory requirements for cybersecurity, the sector \u201cwill continue to struggle from such attacks if the business of providing\u00a0healthcare remains financially fraught [and forces] leaders to prioritize only revenue generating investments,\u201d Carter Groome, chief executive of cybersecurity firm First Health Advisory, told CNN. The Change Healthcare ransomware attack, in particular, has brought fresh attention from policymakers and experts on what many see as the over-consolidation of the US health care industry. If hackers can defeat security measures at one company, millions of patients who rely on that health network can be affected. \u201cUS healthcare is in a death spiral,\u201d said Corman, who co-founded I am the Cavalry, a volunteer group that focuses on cybersecurity for resource-poor organizations in the health sector, among others. \u201cDistressed hospitals get acquired into too-big-to-fail conglomerates. Ransoms cause distress for the little ones, and multi-week, multi-state outages for the ones \u2018saved\u2019 by the big ones.\u201d Any new cybersecurity regulations should be strong enough to force meaningful improvements in the sector\u2019s cybersecurity, Corman argued. \u2018Yes. cybersecurity is costly,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we can clearly see\u2026 neglect is more costly.\u201d Change Healthcare\u2019s parent firm, UnitedHealth Group, owns a significant portion of the US health care market. The company, which reported $371 billion in revenue last year, handles one in three American patient records,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Hospital Association. Optum, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, employs about 90,000 physicians. \u201cYour revenues are bigger than some countries\u2019 GDP,\u201d Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican,\u00a0told\u00a0UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty in a Senate hearing this month.\u00a0\u201cAnd how in heaven\u2019s name did you not have the necessary redundancies so that you did not experience this attack and find yourself so vulnerable?\u201d The Justice Department has been pursuing an antitrust investigation into UnitedHealth Group, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in February. More broadly, the Justice Department last week\u00a0announced\u00a0a\u00a0task force to examine \u201chealth care monopolies and collusion\u201d that will guide the department\u2019s approach to \u201ccivil and criminal enforcement in health care markets,\u201d where warranted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_africa_prince-harry-meghan-nigerian-visit-intl-scli", "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex landed in Nigeria on Friday, launching a three-day private visit to the West African nation, where they will meet with wounded soldiers and visit local charities, officials said. The Sussexes are visiting the country as it\u2019s now a \u201cpart of the Invictus community,\u201d Air Vice-Marshal Abidemi Marquis, director of sports for the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, said during a media briefing Thursday. Their first engagement was an event hosted at a school in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, where Meghan told students: \u201cI see myself in all of you.\u201d Outside the Lightway Academy, students lined up patiently to welcome the royal couple, alongside a troupe of dancers. They were there to kick off a two-day mental health summit run by the GEANCO Foundation, which supports girls and young women across the country with menstrual health products and education. \u201cWe\u2019re so honored to be with you. We have got to acknowledge those amazing dance moves! My husband was excited to jump up!\u201d Meghan told cheering students in the school\u2019s hall. Harry then jumped into the conversation, asking the children about their knowledge of mental health and reminding them to look after themselves and each other. \u201cWill you promise to us that after today, no more being scared, no more being unsure of mental health. If you are unsure, then ask. Ask your teachers. Ask your friends. Be there for one another,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see your friend in your class not smiling, what are you gonna do? You gonna check in with them? Are you gonna ask him if they\u2019re okay? \u2018cause it\u2019s okay not to be okay.\u201d As they were leaving, the couple were given a traditional wooden mask and a set of books about Nigerian heritage. \u201cI need to read these now,\u201d the duchess added. Prince Harry and Meghan were invited to Nigeria by the chief of defense staff, Christopher Musa, the country\u2019s highest-ranking military official. He formally welcomed them to Nigeria at a meeting Friday lunchtime at the defense headquarters in the heart of Abuja. The duke expressed gratitude to their hosts, commending Nigeria for recognizing the power of sport in the rehabilitation process for the injured or wounded. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first country to notice that it not only transforms lives but saves lives. I\u2019m eternally grateful to you all of you for joining the Invictus movement for Nigeria and for every single soul who\u2019s been injured protecting the freedoms of Nigeria,\u201d he said. Marquis said the duchess was keen to accompany her husband on the visit \u201cas part of her lineage and heritage.\u201d Meghan revealed in 2022 that she discovered she was 43% Nigerian from a genealogy test. The trip to Nigeria sparked a wave of excitement among the public when it was announced two weeks ago. Oyeyemi Aderibigbe, 38, a Lagos-based lawyer, told CNN, \u201cI have watched Harry\u2019s evolution and quest for personal expression\u2026 and I love how bold he is about living authentically. Meghan was my favorite character in the \u2018Suits\u2019 series. I love how she has spent so much time using her voice for good, openly sharing her experiences.\u201d \u201cTogether, they are using their influence to democratize opportunity and push causes for the advantage of underrepresented groups. I would love to see them at an event with young people in politics in Nigeria,\u201d she added. Entrepreneur Ife Durosinmi-Etti spoke of her joy that Meghan was \u201ccoming to a place that she\u2019s absolutely loved and welcomed.\u201d \u201cIt got me all giddy when I found out about her Nigerian heritage because Nigerian women are smart, resilient, multitalented, they go after what they want and that\u2019s exactly how I see her, so when I heard; I was like, \u2018Yup, that\u2019s it, it\u2019s the Nigerian Spirit in her,\u2019\u201d the 35-year-old said. A packed itinerary This is the Sussexes\u2019 first trip as a couple to Nigeria, where they will be heavily promoting Invictus as well as the themes of mental health and female empowerment.  Harry flew to Abuja after a quick visit to London, where he attended events marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games, a Paralympics-style event for wounded, injured and sick military personnel and veterans. Meghan flew in from Los Angeles, and together, they are following a busy schedule, which includes visiting a military rehabilitation center and local organizations dedicated to supporting veterans\u2019 welfare. On Saturday, the duke is also scheduled to join wounded veterans during a sitting volleyball game and later, his wife is expected to co-host a women\u2019s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director-general of the World Trade Organization. As it has been described as a private visit, the royal couple will not be meeting with Nigeria\u2019s president, Bola Tinubu. However, they will meet with the governors of Lagos and Kaduna State. The UK\u2019s high commissioner to Nigeria, Richard Montgomery, told local media that there wouldn\u2019t be a meeting with the Nigerian leader because \u201cthey are visiting in a private capacity, not an official one.\u201d Profound challenges Nigeria\u2019s military personnel face profound challenges, particularly as the country has been combating the Boko Haram insurgency since 2009. On Friday, Musa told the couple more about some of the issues \u2013 like terrorism and criminality \u2013 that the armed forces contend with, adding that IEDs present \u201cthe greatest challenge\u201d for them. In response, the duke shared that he was looking forward to visiting a hospital supporting military personnel in Kaduna, a city in the north of the country. The couple\u2019s hosts, the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, are eager to be involved further in the Invictus Games and to be part of the wider Invictus community. Recalling how the most recent games, which were held in Germany last year, saw Nigeria become the first African country to participate, Harry reminisced: \u201cThe team that turned up in D\u00fcsseldorf was small but mighty. They danced their way into the stage. They won medals and danced off the stage. They were the life and soul of those games. Our goal now is to help you grow that team and provide as much opportunity and resource here in Nigeria and for the games that are coming at the beginning of next year.\u201d Marquis said taking part in the Invictus Games recovery program has boosted the morale of Nigerian soldiers and Nigeria has expressed interest in hosting the games, which take place every two years. He added: \u201cEighty percent of our soldiers involved in these recovery programs have a better outlook in life and say it has given them the opportunity to improve their self-esteem and mental health.\u201d Cpl. Effiom Antigha, captain of Team Nigeria, told CNN last year that the games gave him a new lease on life. \u201cBefore now, I didn\u2019t think I could engage myself in any of these sporting activities. The Invictus Foundation has helped develop me physically and mentally.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/africa/prince-harry-meghan-nigerian-visit-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Lear paid what was a record-breaking price for a Hockney work when he acquired the painting in 1978, according to the auction house, but nowadays the artist\u2019s most valuable pieces sell for tens of millions rather than tens of thousands. The painting, created in 1967, is acrylic on canvas and features a number of sprinklers spraying a green lawn, with a gray building and a fence in the background. It is the top lot in a collection which also features Ed Ruscha\u2019s painting \u201cTruth,\u201d as well as works by Willem de Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg and Ellsworth Kelly.

{"id": "2024_05_16_europe_vovchansk-evacuation-ukraine-russia-intl-latam", "text": "In a recurring nightmare, horrors usually repeat themselves. For the Ukrainian border town of Vovchansk, they\u2019re getting worse. Every street seems aflame. The shelling is constant. Torn up tanks and Humvees litter its streets. Small arms fire can be heard as Russian forces inch forwards. Locals in the town lived through occupation and liberation for seven grueling months in 2022. But now they bear the brunt of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s race to grab as much land as he can before Ukraine eventually feels the benefit of US weapons arriving. Moscow on Friday launched its most surprising operation since the initial invasion, crossing Ukraine\u2019s northern border, in a repeat attempt to push south towards the country\u2019s second most-populous city. The devastating weight of the offensive has torn Vovchansk up. The Russian military claims the action has left close to a dozen villages under its control. Most consequentially, Kyiv is now scrambling to send forces from other over-stretched frontlines where Russia is also seeing progress, to stop Moscow\u2019s guns getting in range of Kharkiv city proper. In Vovchansk, the onslaught means that one local man Mykola, his wife, and his 85-year-old mother are for the first time leaving behind the house they built and lived in for 40 years. They were one of 35 groups of residents who called the Ukrainian authorities Thursday and asked to be rescued before Russian troops \u2013\u00a0now just a few hundred meters to the north \u2013 reach their door front. The sounds of artillery shells echoes off the cinderblock walls as a young police officer pulls up outside their house. Mykola walks out, trips on rubble in his yard, and curses. \u201cHop in!\u201d says the police officer, Maksim, as he hustles the family and their few possessions toward the car. He\u2019s been driving into the town continuously since Russia\u2019s advance, shuttling people out. He moves fast. The smell of burning homes hangs in the air, and smoke clogs out the sunlight \u2013 the remnants of the artillery shells that rain down on houses day and night. Mykola and his wife grab plastic bags of eggs, and shuffle across their vegetable patch. The airstrikes last night were just too much, they admit. Less than five minutes later, they\u2019re away, dodging the potholes and rubble that litter the street. At a roundabout on the edge of town, an aging Soviet-era fighter jet, once a proud display of military prowess past, has been knocked off its pedestal. They swerve between the charred body and turret of a Ukrainian tank that\u2019s been blown apart \u2013 recently enough that its ammunition spills out onto the street, untouched. Fifteen minutes down the road, they pull into a gas station. With a wide smile, 85-year-old Maria walks haltingly to an awaiting police van. \u201cIt\u2019s not scary,\u201d she says of the shelling. \u201cI just don\u2019t want it.\u201d Her family admits she is hard of hearing, and so the intensity of the bombardment may not have impacted her as much. Yet she still had reached her limit. She sits next to her former neighbor, Inna. \u201cAt night, they dropped so many aerial bombs,\u201d she says. \u201cHorrible.\u201d Friends of theirs, who now volunteer to extract residents, tried to reach them the previous day but had to turn back. \u201cThey were shooting close to us. Firing at everything,\u201d said Inna. Harrowing memories of Russian control They recall their months under Russian occupation in 2022 \u2013 living under the military control of a country they had for decades lived amicably with, mere kilometers away from them across the border. Mykola\u2019s wife said of the occupation: \u201cIt was alright. They didn\u2019t touch us. They did touch other residents.\u201d Yet Inna recalls how the Russians sought out Ukrainian soldiers who had fought against Russian forces and their proxies in the first phase of the war in 2014. \u201cThey mostly tortured the boys who served. We have a factory there, where they had a prison. The Russians held our boys there.\u201d \u00a0There has been widespread reporting of mistreatment of Ukrainian civilians under Russian occupation, allegations the Kremlin has typically dismissed as fake. As soon as they\u2019ve dropped the residents off, the police set off again for Vovchansk. Just past the town entrance, they pull off into a line of trees. Sitting at a picnic table, they examine a map and assess which of the three rescue calls they can answer. Only one group of people requesting their help is accessible, they assess. Yet their debate is interrupted by a low whining noise. Is it a drone? They peer from beneath the tree cover upwards.\u00a0 The noise comes and goes. But then a drone is spotted \u2013 one of three. A larger one that hovers, and two other smaller devices that race around. The two policemen point their weapons at the sky. \u201cOver us!\u00a0 Look!\u201d one says. \u201cShould I f*** it up?\u201d he asks a colleague. \u201cWhat if it is ours?\u201d he replies. If the police open fire, they may actually draw the attention of the drone on them. The wait is nerve-shredding. The noise grows. The police and the CNN crew can only hope they are either obscured by the trees, or considered not an important enough target for the Russian drone. It does appear fixated on something else nearby. But then the noise grows louder. It is time to leave.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/europe/vovchansk-evacuation-ukraine-russia-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

The crowd on Saturday waved\u00a0Georgian, European Union and some Ukrainian flags and in a break with the past, included more older protesters as well as the many young people who have thronged the streets over the past month. \u201cThe government should hear the free people of\u00a0Georgia,\u201d said one protester in her 30s who gave her name as Nino, waved a large\u00a0Georgian flag and led one of three columns that converged on the city center, which blocked many of the city\u2019s roads and filled the cobblestoned heart of Tbilisi\u2019s old town. \u201cWe want to enter the European Union with our proud nation and our dignity,\u201d she said.

Opposition groups had called for a fresh wave of protests from Saturday. The crisis has pitted the\u00a0Georgian Dream ruling party against a coalition of opposition parties, civil society, celebrities and the country\u2019s figurehead president, with mass demonstrations shutting down much of central Tbilisi almost nightly for more than a month. Georgian opponents of the bill have dubbed it \u201cthe Russian law,\u201d comparing it to legislation used to target critics of\u00a0President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u2019s Kremlin. The European Union, which granted\u00a0Georgia\u00a0candidate status in December, has said that the bill will pose a serious obstacle to further integration if passed. Georgian Dream says the bill will promote transparency and\u00a0Georgian national sovereignty. Bidzina\u00a0Ivanishvili, the founder of\u00a0Georgian Dream, has said the law is necessary to stop the West trying to use\u00a0Georgians\u00a0as \u201ccannon fodder\u201d in a confrontation with Russia. Sullivan\u00a0said that\u00a0Georgian Dream appeared to be deliberately trying to break with the West, even as both the ruling party and\u00a0Georgian public opinion has traditionally been in favor of the country joining the EU and the US-led NATO military alliance. Sullivan wrote: \u201cGeorgian Dream\u2019s recent rhetoric, proposed legislative changes, and actions go against the aspirations of the\u00a0Georgian people and are designed to isolate\u00a0Georgians from the United States and Europe.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/europe/georgia-foreign-agents-bill-protests-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_australia_university-palestinian-protests-melbourne-intl-hnk", "text": "Pro-Palestinian protesters occupying a building at the University of Melbourne have been told to leave by university officials, who say they\u2019ve \u201ccrossed a line\u201d by entering the building and disrupting class for thousands of students. \u201cStudents have a right to protest but that is not a blank check,\u201d said the university\u2019s Deputy Vice Chancellor Michael Wesley in a video message distributed to media on Thursday. \u201cThey have crossed a line when they have occupied the Arts West building \u2026 the university\u2019s patience is now at an end.\u201d On Wednesday, students at the university were among thousands who rallied across the country to remember the 1948 al-Nakba or \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d when around 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes by armed Jewish groups seeking to establish the state of Israel. Dana Alshaer, from UniMelb for Palestine, said after the rally a smaller group of students \u201cindependently\u201d decided to occupy the Arts West building, and others supported them. Several banners have since been hung around the room, including one renaming the building \u201cMahmoud\u2019s Hall\u201d after Mahmoud Alnaouq, a Palestinian student who had won a scholarship to study in Australia but was killed in Gaza last October. Around 1:30pm on Wednesday, Deputy Vice Chancellor Pip Nicholson addressed the group inside the building on a loudspeaker, telling them their choices that afternoon would have \u201cserious consequences.\u201d According to a video posted online, she said: \u201cIn the event that you are not out of here within an hour \u2026 the university will make decisions that will regrettably and unavoidably escalate the tension.\u201d On the video, protesters said they wouldn\u2019t leave until the university responded to their demands, which include divesting from weapons companies and condemning Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. \u201cWe come in peace,\u201d a protester said off-camera. \u201cWe came here to learn, to study, to make an impact on the world, and the fees that we\u2019re paying are going towards companies committing an act of genocide right now. Speak to us about that.\u201d By Thursday, more than 150 classes had been cancelled, affecting 6,000 students and staff, the university said. Victoria Police said it was monitoring the protest activity and hadn\u2019t been asked to intervene. Alshaer denied reports students had blocked the building\u2019s doors and said the university had disabled them. \u201cThe people here are opening the doors for anyone, students and uni staff to come in and out whenever they want. It\u2019s not closed. It\u2019s not barricaded,\u201d she said. Tension building after weeks of protest Since the first tents appeared at universities in Australia over three weeks ago, more students have joined the protest action, demanding the institutions cut ties with weapons companies linked to Israel\u2019s attacks. More than 35,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched a war against Hamas after its October 7 attack in southern Israel, according to health officials. The Hamas attack killed 1,200 people and saw some 250 others taken hostage. Around 100 are still in captivity and Hamas\u2019 top leadership is still at large despite the Israeli onslaught. Protests in support of both sides have flared around the world, with a widespread pro-Palestinian movement launching demonstrations at university colleges. So far, protest sites in Australia have remained relatively peaceful, unlike sister sites in the United States, where police violently evicted some students amid clashes with counter-protesters. Other universities in Melbourne and Canberra have put students on notice to leave. Protesters at\u00a0Deakin University\u00a0said Thursday they\u2019d received a second order to dismantle their camp on Thursday, in a letter shared with CNN that warned that failure to comply may constitute an act of student misconduct. Jasmine Duff, from Students for Palestine Victoria, told CNN the students had no intention of leaving. \u201cWe refuse to obey the directives of a university which is profiting from weapons research during a genocide,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, at least seven student protesters at Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra\u00a0have received letters from the university telling them to leave the site by the end of Friday. In the letter, shared with CNN by the university, students\u00a0were told the institution had received\u00a0\u201creports regarding the negative impact of the encampment on the wellbeing and safety of the broader University community,\u201d without specifying what they were. In a statement,\u00a0ANU said it supports students\u2019 right to protest but said \u201cthese activities must be safe and not cause unnecessary harm or damage to our campus or community.\u201d One of the letter\u2019s recipients, Nick Reich, said he and others are weighing their options. \u201cWe have to make the decision about how much and to what extent we participate in the protests against the university\u2019s investments in arms companies supplying Israel, but we can be certain that the encampment itself is going to remain set up and will continue to fight this fight,\u201d he said. In his video message distributed by the University of Melbourne, Wesley called on protesters to \u201cpeacefully end the occupation.\u201d \u201cRed lines have been crossed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe\u00a0occupation is now seriously disruptive and seriously intimidating for the vast majority of our staff and students who have nothing to do with the protests and are not interested in the protests.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/australia/university-palestinian-protests-melbourne-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_china_putin-xi-meeting-china-intl-hnk", "text": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to deepen their strategic partnership in Beijing on Thursday, in a stark show of their growing alignment as Moscow\u2019s troops advance in Ukraine. Putin \u2014 whose delegation includes top defense and security officials \u2014 was welcomed\u00a0by Xi to Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People earlier with full military pageantry, heralding the start of the Russian president\u2019s two-day state visit. A sweeping joint\u00a0statement released by the two leaders laid out their countries\u2019 alignment on a host of issues including energy, trade, security, and geopolitics with specific references to Ukraine, Taiwan and conflict in the Middle East. The visit \u2014 Putin\u2019s symbolic first overseas foray since starting a\u00a0new term as Russia\u2019s president\u00a0last week \u2014 is the latest sign of tightening relations as the two bind their countries closer in the face of heavy friction with the West. The statement proclaimed that China-Russian relations have stood \u201cthe test of rapid changes in the world, demonstrating strength and stability, and are experiencing the best period in their history,\u201d the two leaders calling each other \u201cpriority partners.\u201d Putin, whose country\u2019s economy has become increasingly reliant on China since his February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, hailed the countries\u2019 \u201cpractical cooperation\u201d in meetings with Xi, noting their record bilateral trade last year, while stressing the importance of bolstering energy, industrial, and agriculture cooperation, according to Russian state media Tass. Their meeting is Putin and Xi\u2019s fourth time speaking face-to-face since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine \u2014 weeks after the two declared a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership on the sidelines of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. This week\u2019s state visit comes amid mounting international concern about the direction of the war in Ukraine amid delays to aid for Kyiv and as Russia\u2019s economy and defense complex appears unbowed by Western sanctions \u2014 a situation that United States officials have alleged is linked to Chinese support, which Beijing denies. Putin says he and Xi will discuss the war in Ukraine in informal talks later Thursday evening, which are expected to include Russia\u2019s newly appointed Defense Minister Andrey Belousov and his predecessor Sergei Shoigu, now secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council. Mounting international pressure over Ukraine Putin\u2019s red-carpet welcome to Beijing comes a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced via his office that he would\u00a0halt all upcoming international visits, as his troops defend against a surprise Russian offensive in his country\u2019s northeastern Kharkiv region. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Kyiv earlier this week to reaffirm the Biden administration\u2019s support for Ukraine after months of Congressional delay in approving American military aid to the embattled country. Blinken pledged $2 billion\u00a0in foreign military financing and said much-needed ammunition and weapons are being rushed to the front lines. Pressure has also been mounting on Xi from both the US and Europe to ensure soaring exports from China to Russia since the start of the war aren\u2019t propping up the Kremlin\u2019s war effort. White House officials in recent weeks have confronted Beijing on what they believe is substantial support for Russia\u2019s defense industrial base \u2014 in the form of goods like machine tools, drone and turbojet engines and microelectronics exported from China. Beijing has slammed\u00a0the US as making \u201cgroundless accusations\u201d over \u201cnormal trade and economic exchanges\u201d between China and Russia. Beijing has never condemned Russia\u2019s invasion, rather it claims neutrality in the conflict and has released a vaguely articulated 12-point position on its resolution. Ahead of an expected peace conference in Switzerland next month, Xi has called for peace talks that take both sides\u2019 positions into account. \u201cChina hopes for peace and stability in Europe soon, and continues to play a constructive role,\u201d Xi said in a joint press appearance with Putin. On Ukraine, Russia said in Thursday\u2019s joint statement that it welcomed the readiness of China \u201cto play a constructive role\u201d in the political and diplomatic settlement of the conflict and that \u201cit is necessary to eliminate its root causes and adhere to the principle of the indivisibility of security,\u201d in an apparent allusion to their shared view that NATO is responsible for the conflict in Ukraine. Alignment on shared frictions This week\u2019s visit marks the leaders\u2019 43rd meeting in the more than one decade that Xi has been in power. Xi and Putin, known for their close personal chemistry, have steadily expanded their countries\u2019 diplomatic coordination and economic and security cooperation in that time \u2014 as both faced mounting frictions with the US and its allies. Even as Xi seeks to repair frayed relations with Europe and stabilize his country\u2019s ties with the US, he is widely seen as unwilling to sacrifice his partnership with Putin, who the Chinese leader sees as an indispensable partner in reshaping a world order both believe is unfairly dominated by the US and seeking to contain them. This shared worldview was also on show Thursday as Xi, speaking alongside Putin, decried a lingering \u201cCold War mentality,\u201d and said \u201cunilateral hegemony, camp confrontations and power politics threaten world peace and security of every country\u201d \u2014 using language typical of Beijing and Moscow\u2019s criticisms of the US and its allies. The two leaders said in the joint statement they will \u201cdeepen trust and cooperation\u201d in the military field by expanding the scope of joint exercises and combat training, regularly conducting joint sea and air patrols and improving the \u201ccapabilities and level of joint response to challenges and threats.\u201d Putin nodded to Xi\u2019s concerns about rising engagement between NATO and like-minded countries in Asia, calling for a \u201creliable and adequate architecture of security in the Asia-Pacific region, in which there will be no place for closed military-political alliances.\u201d \u201cWe think the creation of such alliances to be counterproductive and harmful,\u201d Putin said following meetings Thursday. In the statement, the two countries also expressed \u201cvery deep concern\u201d over what they described as US military activity with allies \u201cthat have a clear anti-Russian and anti-Chinese orientation,\u201d calling the actions \u201cextremely destabilizing.\u201d The two leaders \u201creaffirmed there can be no winners in\u00a0a nuclear war and it should never be fought,\u201d and called for revisions to global security arrangements to prevent military confrontation. Besides engagements in Beijing, which are expected to include a \u201cgala\u201d marking the two countries\u2019 75 years of diplomatic ties, Putin is also expected to attend trade and cooperation forums in Harbin, the capital of China\u2019s northeastern Heilongjiang province bordering Russia\u2019s Far East. The region is historically a site of long-simmering border tensions between the two neighbors, which erupted in conflict between China and the Soviet Union in 1969. It has seen increasing connectivity with parts of Russia\u2019s Far East in recent years. Putin is also expected to meet with the students and faculty of the Harbin Institute of Technology, a university sanctioned by the US government in 2020 for its alleged role in procuring items for China\u2019s military.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/china/putin-xi-meeting-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_china_xi-putin-china-visit-takeaways-intl-hnk", "text": "Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin\u2019s meeting in Beijing on Thursday left no question of how closely the Chinese and Russian leaders are aligned in their vision for the world \u2013 and on bolstering the \u201cpowerful driving force\u201d of their autocratic double act. The two vowed to deepen their strategic partnership, and took aim at a United States they painted as a destabilizing aggressor. In\u00a0a sweeping 7,000-word joint statement outlining their shared view on issues from Taiwan to the war in Gaza, they proclaimed: \u201cRussian-Chinese relations stand the test of rapid changes in the world, demonstrating strength and stability, and are experiencing the best period in their history.\u201d The meeting made for a deeply incongruous split-screen. As Xi and Putin sipped tea from wicker chairs in manicured gardens of the official Zhongnanhai compound and discussed how to \u201cpromote world peace and common development,\u201d Ukrainian civilians called for evacuation from villages under assault from Russian forces. Putin\u2019s two-day state visit comes as Western leaders have leant on Xi to ensure that soaring exports from his country aren\u2019t propping up the Russian war effort \u2013 a claim Beijing denies. But even as Putin\u2019s pomp-filled welcome in the Chinese capital seemed to fly in the face of Western concerns about the partnership, Putin appeared to depart Beijing with few,\u00a0publicly acknowledged\u00a0gains \u2014 though it remains unclear what happened in discussions behind closed doors. Here are three key takeaways from the meeting. Taking aim at a US-led world order Xi and Putin used their meetings and hefty statement to take aim at what they described as a global security system defined by US-backed military alliances \u2013 and pledged to work together to counter it. \u201c[We] intend to increase interaction and tighten coordination in order to counter Washington\u2019s destructive and hostile course towards the so-called \u2018dual containment\u2019 of our countries,\u201d the leaders pledged in their joint statement. The joint statement also called on the US not to arm its allies with missile systems, and condemned US cooperation with allies as \u201cextremely destabilizing.\u201d The US considers China the \u201cmost serious long-term challenge to the international order,\u201d and Russia \u201ca clear and present threat.\u201d The strident declaration comes as both Russia and China have criticized US support for Israel and its war against militant group Hamas and sought to bolster ties across the Global South, where there is mounting backlash against Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. On that conflict, they called for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, while also voicing their points of alignment on a range of other contentious geopolitical issues including Taiwan and North Korea. Growing military cooperation While slamming US military alliances, the two leaders pledged to \u201cdeepen\u201d military \u201ctrust and cooperation,\u201d saying they would expand joint exercises and combat training, regularly conduct joint sea and air patrols, and improve the \u201ccapabilities and level of joint response to challenges and threats.\u201d The two nations have grown their military drills around the world in recent years, continuing after Russia launched its war in Ukraine in February 2022 \u2013 drawing concern from Western observers that the two US rivals are working to enhance their military interoperability. Putin also traveled to Beijing with top security officials who the Russian president said Thursday would join informal talks on Ukraine. Newly appointed Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov, and his predecessor Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu, both attended. It wasn\u2019t clear if Chinese defense officials joined those talks, which took place, according to Russia state media, during four-hour informal negotiations behind the gates of the heavily secured Zhongnanhai compound \u2014 the residence for the leadership of the\u00a0Chinese\u00a0Communist Party. The Chinese Foreign Ministry quoted Xi as reiterating a call for a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d in Ukraine, as well as his support for a peace conference recognized by both sides. Observers say Putin was likely interested in discussing material support for Russia\u2019s war or defense industry, including dual-use items the US has said China is exporting to Russia, which power its defense industrial base. Beijing, which says it is neutral on the war, has repeatedly\u00a0defended its trade\u00a0with Russia as part of normal bilateral relations. But such negotiations may show the limits of the partnership, at least when it comes to China increasing its support to include weapons. Xi, analysts say, is seeking to keep Putin as a close partner, while not stepping over Western red lines. \u201cPutin has gone to China in order to ask for more help from China, help he is unlikely to receive \u2026 he\u2019s not going to get weapons and ammunition and other types of direct support from China for Russia\u2019s war effort,\u201d former US ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker told CNN. Broad rhetoric, few concrete pledges Despite the lofty rhetoric, information on any major deals brokered during the meeting was scant as Putin departed Beijing for the second day of the visit in northeastern China\u2019s Harbin. One deal apparently left un-inked was on plans for a \u201cPower of Siberia 2\u201d pipeline, which would funnel Russian natural gas to China. Beijing is widely seen as hesitating on the long-hyped deal, which Putin wants to replace revenue lost as Europe reduces its reliance on Russian fuels after the Ukraine invasion. Instead, the leaders in broad strokes pledged to \u201cjointly promote the implementation of large-scale energy projects,\u201d while upping energy cooperation across oil, liquified natural gas, natural gas, coal and electricity. They also called for strengthening industrial cooperation across a range of fields including civil aviation construction, electronics, chemical industry, shipbuilding and industrial equipment. These pledges, however vague, do\u00a0signpost more economic coordination in the years to come. \u201cFor Putin, it\u2019s a glory moment that Russia is still on its feet (economically) \u2026 mostly because of the lifeline provided by China,\u201d said Alexandra Prokopenko, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. For that reason, she added, \u201che\u2019s okay with on-going dependency between Russia and China \u2013 and with inequality in this relationship.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/china/xi-putin-china-visit-takeaways-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Fico was conscious and able to speak on Thursday afternoon, according to his long-time ally and the Slovakian President-elect Peter Pellegrini who visited him in the hospital. He said the prime minister was still in serious condition after being\u00a0shot five times from a close range and undergoing surgery. The assassination attempt rocked the central\u00a0European country and sparked global condemnation. Slovakia\u2019s Interior Minister Mat\u00fa\u0161 \u0160utaj E\u0161tok said the suspect told law enforcement officers that his action was motivated by his disagreement with the government and its reforms. The 59-year-old populist leader, who returned to power last year and whose controversial policy changes have sparked protests in recent weeks, was attacked on Wednesday after an off-site government meeting in the town of Handlova. \u0160utaj E\u0161tok said the police was pursuing only one investigative theory \u2013 that the attack was politically motivated. He said that the suspect told law enforcement officers that he disagreed with Fico\u2019s policies and that he decided to act after the recent presidential election, which saw a Fico ally \u2013 Pellegrini \u2013 emerge as the winner. \u201cThe reasons (the suspect gave) were the decision to abolish the special prosecutor\u2019s office, the decision to stop supplying military assistance to Ukraine, the reform of public service broadcaster and the dismissal of the judicial council head,\u201d \u0160utaj E\u0161tok said. He said the suspect is not a member of any extremist group, calling him \u201ca lone wolf\u201d who had in the past attended anti-government protests. The alleged shooter has been identified by multiple local media outlets. Asked whether the 71-year-old described in some media as Juraj C. from Levice, a town in southwest Slovakia, is the suspect, the spokesperson for the prosecutor\u2019s office, Zuzana Drobov\u00e1, told CNN on Thursday: \u201cI can confirm this is the person who has been charged.\u201d Slovakian media reported the shooter was a writer and a poet. The Slovak Writers\u2019 Association said Wednesday that the name identified in the local media was a member of the group. The prime minister had approached a small crowd of people waiting to meet him, when the suspected gunman in the crowd lunged forward and shot him five times from across a security barrier. Footage from the scene showed the injured prime minister being bundled into a vehicle by his staff, before it speeds away with him inside. Nobody else was injured in the attack. The alleged shooter has been identified by multiple local media outlets as a 71-year-old man from southern Slovakia. There has been no official confirmation of the identity of the shooter, but his face was clearly visible in some of the video footage of the attack and his subsequent arrest. Slovakian media reported the shooter was a writer and a poet. The Slovak Writers\u2019 Association said Wednesday that the name identified in the local media was a member of the group. Dramatic footage from the scene of the attack shows the gunman approaching Fico and firing at him from close range across a security barrier. The injured prime minister is then seen being bundled into a vehicle by his staff, before it speeds away with him inside. Fico was first rushed into a local hospital and then airlifted to a major trauma center in the nearby city of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, where he spent more than five hours in surgery, according to hospital officials. Officials said he was shot, among other places, in his stomach. Hospital director Miriam Lapun\u00edkov\u00e1 is said Thursday Fico was \u201cstabilized but in a very serious condition\u201d and that he would remain in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit. She added that the hospital had two surgical teams operating on the prime minister. On Thursday morning, the country\u2019s Defense Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k said Fico\u2019s condition \u201chas been stabilized overnight, more steps are being taken to better his health. The situation is really serious.\u201d The assassination attempt sent shockwaves across the country. Kali\u0148\u00e1k and \u0160utaj E\u0161tok delivered an emotional news conference outside the hospital on Wednesday night, saying the leader was \u201cfighting for his life.\u201d Visibly shaken and sometimes struggling for words, the two ministers appeared in deep shock over the attack. Later in the news conference, both men struck a more combative tone, blaming the attack on the \u201chatred\u201d being spread by \u201csome people\u201d and the media. Divisive figure in divided country Fico is the most powerful lawmaker in Slovakia. Unlike the president, whose role is more ceremonial and has limited scope, the prime minister holds rank as the decision-making head of government. Slovaks have been deeply divided over the country\u2019s direction and position in the world since Fico\u2019s return to power last year. Supporters see Fico as a caring leader who has their interests at heart; critics say he is a populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks for the country. Slovakia\u2019s defense and interior ministers blamed rising hate speech and division for the political atmosphere in the country, which they said led to the assassination attempt. As prime minister,\u00a0Fico made a major U-turn in Slovakia\u2019s foreign policy and its previously staunch support for Ukraine, pledging to end the country\u2019s military support for Kyiv and promising to block Ukraine\u2019s NATO ambitions. The government is also trying to shut down the public service broadcaster and replace it with a new national broadcaster that would be under tighter state control. The reforms have been extremely divisive and have led to months of largely peaceful protests. Fico previously served as Slovakia\u2019s prime minister for more than a decade, first between 2006 and 2010 and then again from 2012 to 2018.

{"id": "2024_05_16_weather_south-flooding-texas-louisiana-climate", "text": "At least four people are dead in Houston after hurricane-force winds and torrential rains tore a damaging path through the city Thursday \u2013 part of a lashing storm system that is bringing life-threatening flooding and power outages to parts of the South. Severe storms carved through parts of Texas Thursday before pushing into western Louisiana through Friday\u2019s early hours, prompting an overnight flash flood warning for New Orleans. As the sun rises Friday, several cities in the storm\u2019s path will begin to take stock of damage left in the storms\u2019 wake. One person was killed in Houston when a crane was toppled by strong winds and two other deaths were caused by fallen trees, according to Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a, citing preliminary information. Violent storms in Houston blew out skyscraper windows, partially collapsed a nightclub and ripped a strip of roofing off the downtown Hyatt Regency, showering the hotel lobby with rain and debris, according to witness video. All non-essential workers are urged to stay home tomorrow and city schools are closed as widespread power outages have darkened the city and disabled traffic lights, Mayor John Whitmire said. Streets are littered with debris, downed trees and power lines, and the downtown area is dusted with glass from broken windows, he added. Major flooding has prompted water rescues in at least one Texas city. As many as 20 drivers had to be helped from rising water in Bryan, about 100 miles northwest of Houston, police said. Power outages left more than 900,000 homes and businesses in the dark across Texas as of Thursday night. More than 200,000 are also without power in Louisiana as storms batter the state. Possible tornadoes posed a risk in Texas and Louisiana, and carried the threat of destructive winds and golf ball-sized hail. A reported tornado in Convent, Louisiana, downed trees and power poles late Thursday, the Storm Prediction Center said. Parts of Texas and western Louisiana are under a rare Level 4 of 4 high risk of excessive rainfall Thursday, the Weather Prediction Center said. More than 600,\ufeff000 people live in the high-risk zone. High risk days like this only happen on 4% of days each year, but account for more than 80% of all flood damage and more than a third of all flood deaths in the United States, according to the WPC. Just three other days have reached this concerning mark this year, including the most recent one nearly three weeks ago. It\u2019s a sign the atmosphere is primed to unload extreme amounts of rain, a phenomenon that is becoming more frequent in a warming world driven by human-caused climate change. Widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches are expected from Texas to Georgia through Saturday morning. A few spots caught under multiple torrential storms may pick up 8 inches or more of rain. It\u2019s not out of the question that one or two spots could record close to a foot of rain in about 48 hours. Texas and Louisiana have been in the bull\u2019s-eye of seemingly unrelenting rounds of torrential, flooding downpours since the start of April. Rainfall in the waterlogged area over the last two weeks is over 600% of what\u2019s typical, according to the WPC. Double-digit rainfall totals between 20 and 30 inches over the region in recent weeks have soaked the ground and left rivers swollen, priming the flood threat to extreme levels. Drenched soils are not expected to soak up any of Thursday\u2019s rainfall, the WPC warned Thursday morning. Widespread flash flooding could begin minutes after heavy rain starts to fall. Flooding ramps up Thursday and threat persists Friday Storms, some severe, rumbled to life Thursday afternoon in parts of Texas and prompted flash flood warnings for multiple cities, including Waco. Powerful, heavy storms will push south and east and reach Louisiana and Mississippi late in the day. More than 800,000 outages have been reported in Harris County, where Houston is located, according to PowerOutage.us. Harris County is the third-most populous in the United States. A tornado warning had been issued earlier Thursday evening in Harris County, including downtown Houston, according to the National Weather Service. The weather service also issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Houston with the highest-level \u201cdestructive\u201d tag. At around 6:30 p.m., the weather service in Houston noted a \u201cdestructive storm\u201d with wind gusts of up to 80 mph was over the metro area, and urged residents to take cover immediately in a post on X. Winds in the city were reported as high as 71 mph, according to the weather service.\u00a0On the east side of the city, there were reports of winds up to 78 mph \u2013 equivalent to the strength of a Category 1 hurricane. Multiple steel power transmission towers in Houston have been mangled by the storms, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. Along part of US Route 290, traffic was stopped as firefighters cleared downed lines draped over the roadway. Houston Mayor John Whitmire advised residents to stay off the roads. \u201cThe mayor and first responders are asking Houstonians to stay off the roads and avoid all unnecessary travel. Many roads are impassible due to downed power lines, debris, and fallen trees,\u201d the mayor\u2019s office said in a statement Thursday evening. \u201cThere are significant power outages and reports of damage across the city. We are working with Centerpoint, METRO and other regional partners to keep everyone safe.\u201d Rainfall rates up to 3 inches per hour are possible in the heaviest storms, which could lead to life-threatening flash flooding, according to the WPC. Damaging winds, hail and a couple of tornadoes are also possible. The greatest flooding danger will come as storms train later Thursday. Training storms track through and deluge the same areas over and over, like a train pulling its cars over the same stretch of track. Serious flash flooding is likely in any areas caught under multiple storms unloading 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour. Roadways may quickly become rivers and small streams could easily overflow their banks. More than 35 million people in the South are under a Level 2 of 4 or Level 3 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall Thursday. Many areas may only endure one torrential storm, but even brief downpours will be enough to cause flooding problems given how wet the South has been recently. Drenching storms from Thursday night will last into Friday for parts of the Gulf Coast. An initial round of flash flooding is likely in the first half of Friday before rain starts to taper off in the afternoon. Another bout of heavy rain will develop Friday night and continue into the earliest hours of Saturday morning, working over the same areas hit earlier in the day. These storms could produce rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour, and quickly restart or worsen any ongoing flooding. Extremely wet start to the year The rain will only add to already extreme rainfall totals in what\u2019s been one of the wettest years to date on record across the Gulf Coast. Some Southeast cities have recorded more than half a foot of rain above what\u2019s typical for the first several months of the year. Several dozen cities from Texas to western Georgia are pacing at a top 5 wettest year to date and at least two cities in eastern Texas are experiencing their wettest year, according to the\u00a0Southeast Regional Climate Center. Dallas is experiencing its third-wettest year to date while Shreveport, Louisiana, is amid its second wettest. Excessive rainfall has largely eliminated dryness and drought conditions along the Gulf Coast, but it hasn\u2019t come without a cost. Earlier this month, nearly 2 feet of rain fell in just five days and sent parts of eastern Texas underwater. Hundreds of people and animals were rescued from flooding as some area\u00a0rivers rose to levels\u00a0not reached since Hurricane Harvey in 2017.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/weather/south-flooding-texas-louisiana-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_middleeast_egypt-pyramids-nile-river-lost-ahramat-branch-scn", "text": "Egypt\u2019s Great Pyramid and other ancient monuments at Giza exist on an isolated strip of land at the edge of the Sahara Desert. The inhospitable location has long puzzled archaeologists, some of whom had found evidence that the Nile River once flowed near these pyramids in some capacity, facilitating the landmarks\u2019 construction starting 4,700 years ago. Using satellite imaging and analysis of cores of sediment, a new study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth & Environment has mapped a 64-kilometer (40-mile) long, dried-up, branch of the Nile, long buried beneath farmland and desert. \u201cEven though many efforts to reconstruct the early Nile waterways have been conducted, they have largely been confined to soil sample collections from small sites, which has led to the mapping of only fragmented sections of the ancient Nile channel systems,\u201d said lead study author Eman Ghoneim, a professor and director of the Space and Drone Remote Sensing Lab at the University of North Carolina Wilmington\u2019s department of Earth and ocean sciences. \u201cThis is the first study to provide the first map of the long-lost ancient branch of the Nile River.\u201d Ghoneim and her colleagues refer to this extinct branch of the Nile river as Ahramat, which is Arabic for pyramids. The ancient waterway would have been about 0.5 kilometers wide (about one-third of a mile) with a depth of at least 25 meters (82 feet) \u2014 similar to the contemporary Nile, Ghoneim said. \u201cThe large size and extended length of the Ahramat Branch and its proximity to the 31 pyramids in the study area strongly suggests a functional waterway of great importance,\u201d Ghoneim said. She said the river would have played a key role in ancient Egyptians\u2019 transportation of the enormous amount of building materials and laborers needed for the pyramids\u2019 construction. \u201cAlso, our research shows that many of the pyramids in the study area have (a) causeway, a ceremonial raised walkway, that runs perpendicular to the course of the Ahramat Branch and terminates directly on its riverbank.\u201d Hidden traces of a lost waterway Traces of the river aren\u2019t visible in aerial photos or in imagery from optical satellites, Ghoneim said. In fact, she only spotted something unexpected while studying radar satellite data of the wider area for ancient rivers and lakes that might reveal a new source of groundwater. \u201cI am a geomorphologist, a paleohydrologist\u00a0looking into landforms. I have this kind of trained eye,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile working with this data, I noticed this really obvious branch or a kind of riverbank, and it didn\u2019t make any sense because it is really far from the Nile,\u201d she added. Born and raised in Egypt, Ghoneim was familiar with the cluster of pyramids in this area and had always wondered why they were built there. She applied to the National Science Foundation to investigate further, and geophysical data taken at ground level with the use of ground-penetrating radar and electromagnetic tomography confirmed it was an ancient arm of the Nile. Two long cores of earth the team extracted using drilling equipment revealed sandy sediment consistent with a river channel at a depth of about 25 meters (82 feet). It\u2019s possible that \u201ccountless\u201d temples might still be buried beneath the agricultural fields and desert sands along the riverbank of the Ahramat Branch, according to the study. Why this branch of the river dried up or disappeared is still unclear. Most likely, a period of drought and desertification swept sand into the region, silting up the river, Ghoneim said. The study demonstrated that when the pyramids were built, the geography and riverscapes of the Nile differed significantly from those of today, said Nick Marriner, a geographer at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris. He was not involved in the study but has conducted research on the fluvial history of Giza. \u201cThe study completes an important part of the past landscape puzzle,\u201d Marriner said. \u201cBy putting together these pieces we can gain a clearer picture of what the Nile floodplain looked like at the time of the pyramid builders and how the ancient Egyptians harnessed their environments to transport building materials for their monumental construction endeavors.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/middleeast/egypt-pyramids-nile-river-lost-ahramat-branch-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Gallant\u2019s remarks come as serious questions about Israel\u2019s long-term strategy in Gaza are being raised both inside and outside of Israel after the Israeli military sent troops back into areas of northern Gaza it had withdrawn from months ago to battle Hamas militants who had returned amid a power vacuum. Israeli military officials have quietly warned that the lack of a long-term strategy for post-war governance will result in this pattern repeating throughout Gaza. And top US officials are doing so publicly, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken warning Wednesday that Israel must \u201cfocus on what the future can and must be\u201d to avoid \u201canarchy and a vacuum that\u2019s likely to be filled by chaos.\u201d Gallant has previously said he opposes Israeli control over post-war Gaza, but his remarks Wednesday were his most direct on the topic as he warned of the consequences of a long-term Israeli military presence in Gaza and called out Netanyahu directly. \u201cI will not agree to the establishment of Israeli military rule in Gaza. Israel must not establish civilian rule in Gaza,\u201d he said, warning that a military occupation of the Palestinian territory would take a heavy toll in \u201cbloodshed and victims, as well as a heavy economic price,\u201d he warned. Netanyahu appeared to respond to Gallant\u2019s remarks later on Wednesday, saying in a video statement posted to social media that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority would be acceptable entities to govern Gaza. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to replace Hamastan with Fatahstan,\u201d he said, referring to Fatah, the Palestinian political party that dominates the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu also said that a complete routing of Hamas would be his prerequisite for a new civilian government in Gaza.\u00a0\u201cAs long as Hamas remains in place, no other entity would enter Gaza to administer the civilian aspects, especially not the Palestinian Authority,\u201d he said. Gallant\u2019s remarks set off a political firestorm in Israel, with a number of right-wing lawmakers condemning\u00a0Gallant\u2019s statement and some even urging Netanyahu to remove him from his position. War cabinet member Minister Benny Gantz meanwhile has endorsed Gallant\u2019s stance, saying he was \u201cspeaking the truth\u201d. The public clash between Gallant and Netanyahu follows repeated calls by the US for Israel to produce a clear plan for post-war Gaza. \u201cWe do not support and will not support an Israeli occupation. We also of course, do not support Hamas governance in Gaza,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony\u00a0Blinken\u00a0told journalists at press conference\u00a0in\u00a0Kyiv, Ukraine, on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWe also can\u2019t have anarchy and a vacuum that\u2019s likely to be filled by chaos.\u201d \u201cThere needs to be a clear and concrete plan, and we look to Israel to come forward with\u00a0its\u00a0ideas,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/middleeast/israel-gaza-yoav-gallant-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

A Ukrainian regional official insisted Russia\u2019s progress was not yet \u201csignificant\u201d but admitted ground fighting in the area was spreading. Meanwhile, speaking on British television, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron acknowledged it was an \u201cextremely dangerous moment,\u201d adding that Russia had effectively \u201cinvaded [Ukraine] again.\u201d The precise goal of Russia\u2019s new push \u2013 which began in the early hours of Friday morning \u2013 is unclear. It may be to create a buffer zone designed to reduce Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, or possibly even a renewed assault on the city of Kharkiv, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south. Equally, it could be an attempt to draw Ukrainian forces away from other key Russian objectives further south \u2013 which was the rationale Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered in his Sunday evening address. \u201cThe idea behind the attacks in Kharkiv region is to stretch our forces and undermine morale and the motivational foundations of Ukrainians\u2019 ability to defend ourselves,\u201d he said. According to information from the Defense Ministry in Moscow, Russia now claims control over nine Ukrainian border villages, which are clustered in two areas, now just a few dozen kilometers apart, to the northeast of Kharkiv city. A Ukrainian military blogger, Myroshnykov, said Sunday afternoon that Russian troops had now pushed south and entered the town of Vovchansk, though the pace of advance there had slowed in the face of Ukraine\u2019s defending forces. Myroshnykov went on to predict an attempt by Russia to make its numerical advantage count and throw large numbers of infantry soldiers into the battle. \u201cThey will try to seize the area with a lot of cannon fodder,\u201d he wrote on his Telegram channel, referencing previous Russian offensives which reports suggest have resulted in many Russian troops killed. A Ukrainian military spokesman later denied reports Russian forces were inside Vovchansk, saying Ukraine\u2019s armed forces had succeeded in keeping them at bay. Ahead of any stepped-up Russian actions, Ukrainian officials have been evacuating hundreds of local residents to safety. An idea of the destruction being wrought on the town and surrounding villages came from regional Ukrainian leader, Oleh Syniehubov, who said Saturday that Russia had dropped more than 20 huge glide bombs on the area in under two days. These bombs have a minimum weight of 250 kgs, but can go up to 1,500 kgs, and are among the most destructive mass-produced devices currently used by Russia in the war. They have previously been used as a precursor to a major attempt to seize ground. Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine\u2019s army chief, told readers of his social media channels on Sunday that defensive operations were ongoing and that battlefield conditions were difficult. \u201cThis week, the situation in Kharkiv Oblast has significantly worsened. Currently, there are ongoing battles in the border areas along the state border with the Russian Federation,\u201d he wrote on Telegram. Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration, insisted control over the border villages was still contested rather than ceded, however the influential DeepStateMap group \u2013 a Ukrainian organisation monitoring developments on the battlefield \u2013 showed seven Ukrainian villages under either full or partial Russian control. So far, Russian gains are not sufficient to put its big artillery pieces within range of Kharkiv city, but residents there admit the situation is frightening. One woman, Anna Ivanova, speaking to Reuters, said: \u201cOf course it is scary, we keep on monitoring the situation, following the news but we remain home and are not planning to go anywhere. All depends on what happens.\u201d Another Kharkiv resident, Olena Pidhirna, said: \u201cDespite all those attacks, air raid alarms, we live normal lives, everyone keeps going out, playing, going to school, enjoying themselves, working. Life goes on, as normal.\u201d It is not just in Ukraine\u2019s north that Kyiv\u2019s armed forces are losing ground. DeepStateMap also shows Russia making further gains in two other key areas, most notably towards the town of Chasiv Yar, which has become an important forward military position, and further south in the industrial town of Krasnohorivka, where Russian troops are now in control of the town\u2019s main facility, a brick factory. Meanwhile, Russian authorities say eight people are known to have died in an explosion in a residential building in Belgorod. CCTV video of the blast shows a huge plume of dark grey smoke emerging from one of the building\u2019s lower floors, before part of the building collapses on itself. Russian television later broadcast video of rescuers at work looking for survivors among the rubble. Russian officials said the blast was caused by a Ukrainian missile attack. And in a separate development, a fire briefly broke out at the\u00a0Volgograd\u00a0oil\u00a0refinery, the largest oil\u00a0refinery\u00a0in southern\u00a0Russia, after a Ukrainian drone attack overnight into Sunday, according to the region\u2019s governor. \u201cOn the night of May 12, air defense and electronic warfare forces repelled a UAV attack on the territory of the\u00a0Volgograd\u00a0region,\u201d Andrey Bocharov said in a post on Telegram. \u201cAs a result of the consequences of a UAV crash with subsequent detonation, a fire broke out at the\u00a0Volgograd\u00a0Refinery\u00a0site,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_12_europe_sergei-shoigu-putin-replaces-defense-minister-intl-latam", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has replaced his defense minister and a long-time close ally Sergei Shoigu with an economist, a major reshuffle of military leadership more than two years after Moscow\u2019s grinding war against Ukraine has sent defense spending soaring. Andrey Belousov, a civilian who served as former first deputy prime minister and specializes in economics, was appointed to the top defense post, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday. Peskov tried to downplay the move, but the reshuffle comes amid speculation about\u00a0infighting at the highest echelons of power. Just last month, one of Shoigu\u2019s long-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9s at the defense ministry was arrested and charged with corruption. Shoigu was \u201crelieved\u201d of his position by presidential decree, Peskov said, but he will remain an influential part of Putin\u2019s administration as secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council, replacing Nikolai Patrushev, a former head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who would \u201ctransfer to another job.\u201d Shoigu will also become the deputy in Russia\u2019s Military-Industrial Commission, Peskov said, as Putin embarks on a fifth term as president. The timing of Shoigu\u2019s exit is notable, coming off the back of several significant advances by Russian troops in eastern Ukraine. Russia has launched its most serious cross-border ground assault since Ukraine recaptured the northern Kharkiv region in the late summer of 2022. There have been several months of increased Russian air attacks on the city of Kharkiv amid a grinding advance in Donetsk in the east that has seen incremental but significant progress. Shoigu had helmed the country\u2019s defense ministry for 12 years and led the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russian troops initially caught Kyiv by surprise but were soon beaten back, exposing the weaknesses of Moscow\u2019s corruption-riddled military and its willingness to send waves of poorly trained and equipped soldiers into what Ukraine and Russian troops have both dubbed a \u201cmeat grinder.\u201d His critics have frequently described Shoigu as remote and out-of-touch with the realities of the conflict. His most forceful critic was the late Wagner chief\u00a0Yevgeny Prigozhin\u00a0who accused the Defense Ministry of starving his fighters of resources and bureaucratic incompetence before launching an unsuccessful mutiny last year and dying weeks later in a plane crash. Despite the criticism, Shoigu has remained a popular politician in Russia. Having spent two decades as the minister of emergency situations, he cultivated an image of a helpful official who brings help when it\u2019s needed. He is also a rare outsider in Putin\u2019s original inner circle, which consists mostly of the president\u2019s allies from his St. Petersburg political beginnings and his former KGB colleagues. Shoigu was born and grew up in the remote Siberian republic of Tuva and got into politics through his association with the former president Boris Yeltsin. Rising military spending and need for \u2018innovation\u2019 Belousov\u2019s appointment suggests Russia\u2019s strategy will continue to focus on outgunning Ukraine. Belousov was selected by Putin because of a need for \u201cinnovation,\u201d Peskov said in a press call, during which he highlighted the ministry\u2019s rising budget, saying it was approaching levels last seen during the Cold War. \u201cToday on the battlefield, the winner is the one who is more open to innovation,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cTherefore, it is natural that at the current stage, the president decided that the Russian Ministry of Defense should be headed by a civilian.\u201d In a reference to the war in Ukraine, Peskov said that due to \u201cwell-known geopolitical circumstances, we are gradually approaching the situation of the mid-80s when the share of expenses for the security bloc in the economy was 7.4%. It\u2019s not critical, but it\u2019s extremely important,\u201d Peskov said. The budget currently amounts to 6.7% of GDP, he said. Peskov highlighted Belousov\u2019s previous leadership experience and economic background. \u201cThis is not just a civilian, but a person who very successfully headed the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, for a long time he was aide to the president on economic issues, and was also the first deputy chairman of the government in the previous cabinet of ministers,\u201d Peskov said. Much has been made of Belousov\u2019s civilian status, even though Shoigu himself has limited hands-on experience with the military. He holds a rank of a general as a result of his official roles and has never served in active service. Peskov added that the new appointment did not signal a shift in Russia\u2019s current military system. \u201cAs for the military component, this appointment will in no way change the current coordinate systems. The military component has always been the prerogative of the Chief of the General Staff [Valery Gerasimov], and he will continue his activities. No changes are currently envisaged\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0regard,\u201d he said. In his new role, Shoigu will oversee Russia\u2019s military industrial complex, Peskov said. \u201cHe is deeply immersed in this work, he knows very well the pace of production of military-industrial products at specific enterprises and often visits these enterprises,\u201d he said. The news follows the arrest last month of one of Shoigu\u2019s close allies, deputy defense minister Timur Ivanov, who was charged with taking a bribe in what was the country\u2019s highest-profile corruption scandal since Putin launched his full invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. Ivanov has been accused of accepting a bribe of 1 million rubles (at least $10,800), according to Russian state media TASS. Former US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told CNN in an interview Sunday that Putin\u2019s reshuffle is an \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cinteresting move.\u201d \u201cThe bigger argument coming out of Moscow right now is that Russia is moving toward a war economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re on a war footing.\u201d Esper said that \u201cone of the disappointing things about Shoigu\u2019s tenure is we thought the Russian army, at least during my time at the Pentagon, we thought they were professionalizing, that they were modernizing all their equipment, their doctrine, how they train and fight, and we really haven\u2019t seen that on the battlefield.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/europe/sergei-shoigu-putin-replaces-defense-minister-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo", "text": "Voice actor Paul Skye Lehrman took a job in 2020 for which he believed he was providing a set of one-off voice samples. Years later, he says he heard his voice narrating a YouTube video and then on a podcast \u2014 even though he had never recorded either of them. Now, Lehrman, along with fellow voice actor Linnea Sage, is suing AI firm Lovo for allegedly commissioning them for voice projects under false pretenses in order to create and sell AI-generated versions of their voices. The Berkeley, California based tech company advertises AI-generated voice technology to be used in marketing, education and product demos. Lehrman and Sage are suing Lovo and seeking class action status to include other people \u201cwhose voices and/or identities were stolen and used,\u201d according to the complaint filed Thursday in the Southern District Court of New York. The complaint was first reported by the New York Times. The voice actors\u2019 lawsuit is just the latest in a recent string of legal actions brought against various tech companies by creatives, writers and artists who say their work was used without their permission to train AI systems that could ultimately compete with them. Such lawsuits have added to a growing wave of concerns over how the training of AI models, which requires huge swaths of data, could run afoul of copyright and intellectual property laws. \u201cImplicit in LOVO\u2019s offerings to its customers is that each voice-over actor has agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms and conditions for customers to be able to access that actor\u2019s voice,\u201d the complaint states. But for Lehrman and Sage and any others \u201cwho have not agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms, the continued unauthorized use of Plaintiffs\u2019 voices is theft of service and misappropriation.\u201d Lovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. In May 2020, Lehrman says he received a request for voice-over narrative services on the gig work website Fiverr from an account called \u201cUser25199087.\u201d When he asked what the voice sample was for, he was told it would be used \u201cfor academic research purposes only\u201d and that \u201cthe scripts would not be used for anything else,\u201d according to the complaint. He was paid $1,200 for the job, the complaint states. Two years later, Lehrman came across a YouTube video that sounded as if it had his voice narrating it, although he\u2019d never been involved in its creation, the complaint states. Then in June 2023, Lehrman claims he heard his voice being used on a podcast about the dangers of AI technologies. Similarly, Sage was offered a job on Fiverr in 2019 producing \u201ctest scripts for radio ads\u201d that she was told would \u201cnot be disclosed externally,\u201d according to the complaint. She was paid $400. Sage says she later also discovered her voice in a YouTube video: a recording of a Lovo investor presentation demonstrating its technology. Lehrman and Sage allege that the people who contacted them on Fiverr were Lovo employees who misrepresented what their voice samples would be used for and later sold or raised money on the back of the AI-version of their voices. \u201cTo be clear, the product that customers purchase from LOVO is stolen property. They are voices stolen by LOVO and marketed by LOVO under false pretenses,\u201d the complaint states. The actors are seeking more than $5 million in damages, as well as a court order blocking Lovo from continuing the alleged use of their voices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_asia_romulus-whitaker-snakeman-india-spc-c2e", "text": "Moving from America to India as a child in the 1950s would likely be a challenging experience for most, but for Romulus Whitaker it was a dream come true \u2014 he had arrived in \u201cthe land of cobras,\u201d he explained to CNN. Whitaker would go on to earn the nickname \u201cSnakeman of India,\u201d and spend more than six decades dedicated to reptile research and conservation. He\u2019s written several books on snakes, spearheaded a lifesaving anti-venom program, and launched wildlife research stations throughout the country. His field work with snakes and crocodiles ultimately led his conservation efforts to help save India\u2019s rainforests. Today, Whitaker\u2019s focus is on educating Indians on how to protect themselves from snakes \u2014 part of a national campaign to reduce the snakebite mortality rate. CNN spoke with Whitaker recently at his home in Mysore, southwestern India, around the release of the first volume of his memoir: \u201cSnakes, Drugs and Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll: My Early Years.\u201d The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. CNN: How did you first become interested in snakes? Whitaker: I started out as a very young lad in northern New York state, turning over rocks and finding bugs and stuff, until I found a snake, and it was love at first sight. It really started then. But I must blame or thank my mother for when I first brought a snake home. She said, \u2018wow, how beautiful.\u2019 And now, which mother would do that? Not very many. Then, when my mother married Rama Chattopadhyay and we moved to India, that was something that opened up the world to me. Can you imagine an eight-year-old arriving in Bombay and being able to go out into the jungles of India? These are dreams that I had when I was a little kid, which came alive. CNN: What does a herpetologist do and what was your journey to becoming one? Whitaker: A herpetologist is a strange person who studies reptiles. I\u2019ve concentrated most of my work on snakes and crocodiles, but I am very interested in all the others \u2026 the turtles, the lizards, and of course the amphibians, the frogs and toads. I\u2019ve been doing this forever, ever since I was four years old when I picked up my first snake. [In 1960] I was going to college in America, but I flunked out. Then I got a job at the Miami Serpentarium and worked for this gentleman [Bill Haast] who handled king cobras with the greatest of ease and extracted their venom. That was part of the love affair that I generated for king cobras. But I had always yearned to come back to India and get out to Western Ghats, where I knew king cobras still lived, and start studying them. In 1969, I set up India\u2019s first snake park, the Madras Snake Park. And we\u2019ve learned more about king cobra behavior and about their wonderful lifestyle than had ever been known by anybody before. CNN: Have you ever been scared of a snake? Whitaker: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been scared of a snake. I\u2019ve been scared of myself sometimes doing stupid things. I saw a black-tailed [snake] disappearing into the bushes, and I thought, \u2018ah, big rat snake.\u2019 And I dove on it, typical football tackle, grabbed it by the tail and suddenly this hooded snake rises up over me and I looked up and said, \u2018oh no, I think I\u2019ve caught the wrong tail.\u2019 And I let it go. It was a king cobra, the first one I had ever found. It was scary. Okay, I am scared sometimes. CNN: How did you first get involved with the indigenous Irula tribe to help create anti-venom to treat people bitten by snakes? Whitaker: The Irulas are an aboriginal tribe here in South India. Their expertise is finding and catching snakes and their specialty [was] catching snakes for their skins. But they had run out of a way to make a living because the snakeskin industry had been banned [in 1972]. So we hatched an idea together to set up a venom cooperative, the Irula Snake Catchers Cooperative, wherein they would catch snakes from the wild, extract the venom, and then release the snakes back to the wild. And the venom, it was used to make anti-venom to save millions of lives. CNN: Today a big focus of your work is preventing snakebites in the first place. Tell us more about that. Whitaker: Up until recently, we really didn\u2019t know how many people are getting killed and injured by snakes. The Centre for Global Health Research and the University of Toronto started doing this Million Deaths Study. And I\u2019m a coauthor of two of the major papers produced out of this study, and it turns out that close to 50,000 people are actually killed by snake bite every year in India. Now that we know the figure, we are working very hard right now on an educational program, which is nationwide, trying to teach people how to avoid snakes and avoid getting bitten. It\u2019s fairly simple: at night when you walk around, use a light. When you sleep, use a mosquito net. We tell people when they\u2019re working in the field, when they\u2019re doing agriculture, use a stick. Don\u2019t use your bare hand because a snake could be there. So it\u2019s just educating people. These are simple methods. CNN: At what point in your career did you get involved with conservation? Whitaker: My early, formative years were not very conservation-oriented. I was the kid with a gun, and I would go out there and instead of being a bird watcher, I was a bird shooter. The transition from being from a hunter to a conservationist happened [in the 1970s] when I realized that things were really out of hand here, and crocodiles were almost extinct by that time. And we really had to do something about it. I realized that unless I got into conservation, there\u2019s not going to be anything left. I set up field stations along with my colleagues and they are magnets for people who want to get into working with reptiles. And we\u2019ve had dozens and dozens of people who have now turned out to be some of the greatest conservationists in India we can call graduates of these stations. CNN: You\u2019re currently working on a three-part memoir. What would you like your legacy to be? Whitaker: People will remember me, like it or not, as a snake freak. But it\u2019s wonderful to think [of] the influence that I have had or that our organizations have had to engender this incredible deep interest in something which people sneered at or ran away from all their lives, but now suddenly, hey, they\u2019re interesting, they\u2019re hip, they\u2019re in. Snakes rule! And it\u2019s wonderful to realize that dozens, if not hundreds, of young people have continued to do wonderful work with reptiles. It\u2019s just wonderful.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/asia/romulus-whitaker-snakeman-india-spc-c2e/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_middleeast_gaza-floating-pier-aid-trucks-intl-hnk", "text": "Trucks carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza have begun moving ashore after arriving through the floating pier built by the US military, according to the US Central Command (CENTCOM). The pier was anchored to a beach in Gaza on Thursday and will be used to funnel aid from various countries into the besieged strip, with most border crossings to the enclave closed and a catastrophic humanitarian disaster unfolding inside. No US troops went ashore in Gaza, according to CENTCOM. The goal is to get about 500 tons of humanitarian assistance into Gaza through the pier daily, according to Adm. Brad Cooper, the commander of CENTCOM. That means about 90 trucks worth of aid a day, and the goal is to build up to 150 trucks a day. One ship is expected to unload aid at the pier on Friday, a UN official told CNN, adding that it was unclear if the process of unloading aid had begun. The aid will go to the northern part of Gaza on one day and to the south on the next. The maritime corridor is coming at a critical moment \u2013 with the Rafah border crossing to Gaza having been closed for more than a week, preventing aid from getting through. That crossing was the only one between Gaza and Egypt \u2013 with all other border points in the strip controlled by Israel. Here\u2019s what we know about the new aid route: How was the pier built and how will it work? The US began building the floating pier in late April at a cost of $320 million and with the help of some 1,000 US soldiers and sailors. The US said that it is only a temporary measure that is \u201centirely humanitarian in nature.\u201d Pieces for the pier were loaded aboard ships on the East Coast of the US and then \u201ctransported 6,000 miles across the ocean,\u201d according to CENTCOM\u2019s Cooper. The pieces were assembled off the coast of Gaza, with final assembly taking place in the Israeli port of Ashdod. The aid delivered via the pier will go through several steps before reaching Gaza. It will arrive in Cyprus by either air or sea where it will be screened by the US and Israel and palletized before being brought by ship to a floating platform near the Gaza coast. Then it is finally transported to the floating pier and loaded onto trucks to distribute on land. The US has said the pier is not meant to replace aid that enters through land crossings, which aid workers have said are the fastest and easiest way to get relief into the territory. \u201cThis maritime route is additive and is not meant to replace land routes into Gaza,\u201d Cooper said. The UN\u2019s World Food Programme will be responsible for receiving and distributing the aid in Gaza. Why is aid being shipped this way? Most land crossings into Gaza remain either shut or congested due to lengthy inspections by Israel. That has led the US and other countries to start air-dropping aid into Gaza, which human rights organizations have criticized as insufficient. The UN has warned of famine setting in in parts of Gaza, calling on Israel to open more land crossings for aid. USAID Administrator Samantha Power, the top US humanitarian official, has also assessed it is \u201ccredible\u201d that famine is already occurring in parts of Gaza. In March, the first batch of humanitarian aid by sea was delivered in an operation separate from the US pier project. Today, only the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing and the \u201cWestern Erez\u201d Crossing in northern Gaza are open, although the amount of aid trickling through them is nowhere close to what Gaza needs. The UN\u2019s World Food Programme however says that since May 6, when Israel launched its Rafah operation, the organization has been unable to access and receive aid from the Kerem Shalom crossing. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees\u00a0(UNRWA) said the crossing was closed between May 6-10. The Rafah crossing with Egypt, the entry point for nearly a quarter of all aid into Gaza, was also closed last week after Israel seized it as part of a ground offensive into the city, and is yet to reopen. How much aid is getting into Gaza now? The US State Department has said that \u201cnot nearly enough\u201d trucks are getting into Gaza. The UN estimates that 500 trucks are needed per day to alleviate the suffering of Gazans, but on May 11, UN figures showed that only six trucks entered. No data is available after that date. Israel however said on Friday\u00a0that \u201caid is flowing into Gaza by land, sea, and air\u201d and through \u201cmultiple aid routes.\u201d The Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), the Israeli body that coordinates the flow of aid into the strip, said that 365 trucks \u201cwere transferred\u201d to Gaza Thursday. The UN\u2019s OCHA on Thursday said that crossings into Gaza have either been closed, are unsafe to access or not logistically viable. \u201cAid distribution is almost impossible with no regular fuel imports, unstable telecommunication and ongoing fighting,\u201d OCHA said on X. \u201cThe impact is devastating for over 2 million people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/middleeast/gaza-floating-pier-aid-trucks-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Instead, she\u2019s spending her days and nights at\u00a0Gaza\u2019s\u00a0European Hospital\u00a0on the outskirts of Rafah. Kattan, an anesthesiologist and specialist in critical care, is one of at least 22\u00a0American physicians trapped in Gaza after an Israeli military offensive in Rafah last week shuttered the city\u2019s critical border crossing to Egypt. Rafah had, until then,\u00a0served as the only entry and exit point for foreign aid workers into and out of Gaza. \u201cMy kids have already been texting me today saying, you said Tuesday that you were going to be home,\u201d\u00a0Kattan told CNN. \u201cThe\u00a0WHO\u00a0(World Health Organization) is trying to negotiate a safe exit for us. And it\u2019s not happening.\u201d The crossing has been closed since the Israeli military seized it early last week. Israeli and Egyptian officials have so far failed to reach an agreement on reopening it, instead trading blame for its continued closure. Meanwhile, dozens of foreign doctors are stuck in Gaza, while others are unable to get in as humanitarian conditions worsen inside the besieged enclave. FAJR Scientific, the\u00a0United States-based\u00a0nonprofit organization that brought\u00a0Kattan and 16 other physicians to Gaza, is now calling on the US government to help coordinate the team\u2019s safe exit from Gaza.\u00a0They had been due to leave on Monday. \u201cI am asking the\u00a0US government to step in and coordinate with the WHO to protect US citizens trapped in a war zone and bring them home ASAP,\u201d said Mosab Nasser, the organization\u2019s\u00a0chief executive, who is also in Gaza. At least one member of the team requires evacuation on medical grounds, he added. The 17 medics include 12 American citizens, three UK citizens, one Omani and one Egyptian. Kattan and her husband, who is also an anesthesiologist, arrived in Gaza more than two weeks ago, driven by the helplessness they felt watching the suffering in Gaza on\u00a0television\u00a0and knowing they could help. \u201cWe knew that anesthesiologists were needed for the civilians here, the women and the children. And we knew we had something we could offer,\u201d\u00a0said Kattan. \u2018This is what clean looks like in Gaza\u2019 The FAJR Scientific team recorded video diaries of their experiences\u00a0and the conditions they face\u00a0inside the European Hospital exclusively for CNN. In one video, Laura Swoboda, a nurse practitioner and wound specialist from Wisconsin,\u00a0describes\u00a0the buzz of drones overhead. \u201cEven in moments where we feel safe, the war is going on, and there\u2019s the potential for violence to resume,\u201d\u00a0she says. The dangerous conditions aren\u2019t only\u00a0to be found\u00a0outside the hospital. \u201cWe were not aware of how dire the situation is here. There wasn\u2019t soap to wash our hands between infected wounds with maggots. There wasn\u2019t\u00a0sanitizer wipes to wipe down the tables after each patient,\u201d Swoboda told CNN\u00a0in a Zoom interview. \u201cPeople were just coming in, person after person after person. We\u2019re out of gauze to clean the wounds. We\u2019re out of advanced dressings, we went through all of our cleansers, we\u2019re using whatever we can get our hands on at this point.\u201d \u201cThis is what clean looks like in Gaza,\u201d says\u00a0Kattan in\u00a0a\u00a0clip showing the state of an operating room, with plastic overalls strewn atop the operating table. Ahead of an operation to revise the amputations of a quadruple-amputee,\u00a0Kattan details the lack of anesthetics. Picking up a single vial of Propofol,\u00a0she\u00a0describes\u00a0how the\u00a0medics\u00a0were able bring it in with them from the US. No way out FAJR\u00a0Scientific operates under the umbrella\u00a0of WHO which, according to\u00a0FAJR\u00a0Scientific, has been attempting to coordinate an evacuation. At least one other international medical mission is currently at the European\u00a0Hospital, organized by the Palestine American Medical Association. Of the 19 members on the PAMA medical team, 10 are US citizens. The volunteers on the\u00a0FAJR\u00a0Scientific\u00a0mission all knew the risks involved in traveling to a war zone,\u00a0said Kattan,\u00a0but getting stuck in Gaza was not a scenario they had contemplated. Now, she is torn between the desire to get back home to her\u00a0children\u00a0and the guilt she feels\u00a0for\u00a0trying to leave Gaza at a time when the Israeli military could widen its offensive and the need for medical personnel is\u00a0expected\u00a0to rise. \u201cIt\u2019s just missing my kids and waking up in the morning and realizing they\u2019re not next to me. But the harder part is knowing that I get to leave eventually. And I get to go home and be safe.

{"id": "world_middleeast_dubai-worlds-biggest-waste-to-energy-facility", "text": "It\u2019s difficult to imagine that an empty cereal box, a banana peel, or a deflated football could contribute to powering your home. Yet in Dubai, nearly half of all discarded waste plays a role in household energy. Much of it ends up at a plant operated by the Warsan Waste Management Company. \u201cAround 45% percent of Dubai\u2019s total waste comes to this facility,\u201d says Tim Clarke, the company\u2019s CEO. Operational since March of this year, the Warsan plant will use 2 million metric tons of trash annually to produce electricity, enough to power approximately 135,000 homes, according to the company. It\u2019s known as a waste-to-energy plant, and about 13% of all urban waste worldwide ends up in a facility of this kind, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. This method of processing trash is widely adopted across Europe and in nations such as Japan, China, and the US. Yet the plant in Dubai distinguishes itself through its scale. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest facility of its kind in the world,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cWe operate at around 34% efficiency of producing electricity, which is much higher than would normally be expected from an energy waste plant, and that\u2019s partly because with this size we can operate at higher temperatures and higher pressures.\u201d The power of waste The process of converting waste into energy involves three steps: burning trash, using the heat to create steam, and directing the steam to drive a turbine, which generates electricity. The process has been used for more than 100 years, but modern facilities have far more control over the pollutants released as waste is incinerated. Flue gas treatment allows the plant to filter toxic substances and stop them from going into the air. \u201cWe inject reagents into [a reactor] to strip out all the harmful elements such as heavy metals, sulfur components, and they trap particles which are then taken away for disposal,\u201d explains the CEO. Not all pollutants are filtered out. Climate-warming carbon dioxide, for example, is released into the air. However, since the plant produces power, replacing the burning of fossil fuels, Warsan Waste Management believes the overall result is positive. \u201cWe emit CO2, but also we generate 200 megawatts of electricity that\u2019s not having to be produced by a fossil fuel source, which is primarily gas in the UAE,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cSo [we\u2019re] saving around 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.\u201d Facilities such as the one in Dubai also implement a few extra steps to maximize resource extraction. Metals, for instance, are separated for recycling. The mountains of ash, resulting from burning the trash, are collected and repurposed in road construction. According to Clarke, out of the 5,500 tons of waste that the facility receives per day, only 200 tons of residue that can\u2019t be reused remain after processing. Need for recycling Waste-to-Energy plants serve as an alternative to landfills, which contribute to approximately 11% of global methane emissions. \u201cIf we\u2019re globally putting more waste into open dumps, we\u2019re creating methane that is unmanaged. That methane then is creating a significant emissions challenge,\u201d explains Bryan Staley, CEO of the US-based non-profit Environmental Research and Education Foundation. \u201cAs a solution, waste-to-energy can create less emissions compared to a landfill setting,\u201d he adds. But some environmental groups, such as Zero Waste Europe, argue that burning waste to generate electricity discourages efforts to cut waste and initiatives to increase recycling. According to a document released by the government last year, the UAE recycles 20% of its treated waste, but hopes to increase that to 90% by 2050. Staley reinforces the need for recycling, as the most energy-efficient and environmentally friendly solution for waste management. \u201cThere can be this perception of, well, I\u2019ll just throw it in the trash can and it\u2019ll be taken care of,\u201d says Staley. \u201cBut your paper, your plastics, have a much better endpoint if they\u2019re recycled and recovered rather than going to a waste energy facility because you can turn those materials into products.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/middleeast/dubai-worlds-biggest-waste-to-energy-facility/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_travel_graffiti-english-castle-napoleon-scli-intl-scn", "text": "More than 50 etchings from soldiers have been discovered on an English castle door in an \u201castonishing discovery,\u201d including graffiti of what could depict the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte being hanged. The door was only recently discovered in Dover Castle, in southeast England, charity English Heritage said in a press statement Wednesday. It has now been \u201cpainstakingly conserved\u201d to go on display in July, the charity added. The graffiti on the door is thought to have been created by soldiers living inside the castle between 1789 and 1855. In the 1790s, the castle was renovated due to the threat of an invasion from Napoleon in France, being transformed from an \u201caging medieval castle\u201d to a \u201cmodern military garrison,\u201d the statement said. Thousands of soldiers were brought into the castle\u2019s walls. Six to 12 men would guard St. John\u2019s Tower - where the door was found - in the castle\u2019s great outer ditch at one time. English Heritage suggests that, with hours to kill and \u201cquestionable artistic talents,\u201d the soldiers may have whittled into the door to simultaneously whittle away the time. They likely created the unconventional artwork using knives or possibly bayonets. There are at least nine illustrations on the door of people being hanged, the statement said, with one such etching showing the hanging of a man wearing a military uniform and a bicorne hat, thought to perhaps be Napoleon. Napoleon declared himself emperor of France in 1804 and made a lasting impact on the country as a military leader and ruler, waging wars against many of the European powers of the time. After his defeat by the British at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, he abdicated and was exiled to the remote island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic, where he died in 1821. One carving shows a single-masted sailing ship, and another shows a chalice of wine with an elaborate cross, which English Heritage suggests may be a \u201crepresentation of Christian holy communion.\u201d As well as drawings, the graffiti also includes writing, including the last names Downam and Hopper/Hooper, and many sets of initials. Three significant dates are also inscribed onto the door, English Heritage said: 1789, the year of the French Revolution; 1798, a period of rebuilding in Dover Castle; and 1855, when changes were planned to St. John\u2019s Tower. \u2018Making their mark\u2019 Paul Pattison, English Heritage\u2019s senior properties historian, said that the door was discovered after someone scaled a ladder to the upper floor of St. John\u2019s Tower. \u201cSeeing these remarkable carvings on the door was an astonishing discovery,\u201d Pattison said. \u201cThis graffiti gives a unique glimpse into the minds of these soldiers, especially during such a charged period of time.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat makes this door such an extraordinary object is that it is a rare and precious example of the ordinary person making their mark; whether that be simply for the purpose of killing time or wanting to be remembered.\u201d The door will be on display at Dover Castle in July as part of an immersive visitor experience titled \u201cDover Castle Under Siege.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/travel/graffiti-english-castle-napoleon-scli-intl-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_middleeast_israeli-military-investigation-video-un-facility-gaza-intl", "text": "The Israeli military is calling on the United Nations to investigate the presence of armed militants at a UN facility in southern Gaza after releasing video that shows armed men at the facility. Drone footage published by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Tuesday, and geolocated by CNN, shows the armed men near UN-marked vehicles at an UNRWA logistics facility in Rafah, which served as a key aid distribution point. The Israeli military said the footage was filmed on May 11, three days before the IDF released it. CNN cannot independently verify the date the video was filmed. UNRWA, the main UN agency operating in Gaza, said it is \u201cunable to verify the authenticity or the content\u201d of the video, but said it is \u201clikely\u201d that the video shows an UNRWA warehouse that was evacuated last week. \u201cUNRWA condemns the use of UN facilities by any party to the conflict for military/fighting purposes. We have repeatedly called for independent investigations & accountability for the blatant disregard of UN staff lives, premises and operations,\u201d UNRWA spokeswoman Juliette Touma said in statement. \u201cWe reiterate our call on all parties to the conflict to respect the sanctity and neutrality of UN installations. Under no circumstances should anyone have or use weapons in a UN facility.\u201d Touma said that UNRWA staff were ordered to evacuate the facility last week \u201cfor their safety\u201d following Israeli military evacuation orders for parts of eastern Rafah. Touma said UNRWA staff left vehicles and flour at the facility. The Israeli military said COGAT, the Israeli agency charged with coordinating humanitarian aid to Gaza, shared the military\u2019s findings with \u201csenior officials in the international community,\u201d including UN officials. \u201cThis is a troubling phenomenon,\u201d IDF spokesman Maj. Nir Dinar told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time we are witnessing armed personnel present in UN facilities and vehicles.\u201d Dinar said that Israeli military \u201cdidn\u2019t strike the militants and vehicles because it was clear that they are in UN facility and are near UN personnel.\u201d The IDF has, however, carried out strikes at UN facilities in the past, including at the same eastern Rafah facility in March, according to a video of the strike released by the IDF at the time. It\u2019s unclear if the armed men in the IDF drone footage are part of Hamas or other militant groups in Gaza. The Israeli military released the video one day after a United Nations worker was killed and another injured when the UN-marked vehicle they were driving in was struck in Rafah.

{"id": "travel_stunning-secret-italian-lakes", "text": "Tourists regularly flock to Italy to enjoy its beaches and islands, they admire its historical cities \u2013 and of course they enjoy the food. Recently, they\u2019ve been coming in far greater numbers, leaving some destinations overwhelmed. However, there are still places to visit that offer an escape from the crowds as well as stunning scenery. We\u2019re talking lakes. But not Lake Garda, the huge body of water that nestles up against the Alps, busy with resort towns. And not celebrity-favorite Lake Como. Italy has dozens of secret smaller lakes that boast superb scenery, unknown to mass tourism, where locals get together on day trips and enjoy picnics. These are some of the best: Lake Turano One of the best-kept secrets of Lazio, the region around Rome, is Lake Turano. Visitors to Rome, many who wilt during the heat of the Eternal City\u2019s fiery summers, have no idea that nearby lies an enchanted place that has the views, the history, the food and a welcome breath of fresh air. It wasn\u2019t meant to be a vacation spot at first. When Benito Mussolini, Italy\u2019s former dictator, ordered the construction of this artificial lake in the 1930s to supply water to nearby power plants, the last thing he expected was for it to turn into a weekend detox retreat for people longing for open spaces. Lago del Turano has an ideal location, close to the capital but far from the noise and chaos. Set in the wild countryside north of Rome and surrounded by hills, the location was once home to the Fallisci, an ancient tribe, before they were wiped out by ancient Romans. Free-roaming cows and sheep greet visitors along a road cut through a deep forest that leads to the lake. Once out of the woods, the mesmerizing scenery of the lake forces drivers to stop at a belvedere with benches to take in the view. The lake brims with giant carp that draw anglers from across Italy for fishing contests. Two picturesque towns of stone dwellings with panoramic balconies overlook lake Turano - the clifftop medieval Castel di Tora and the even more ancient Colle di Tora, sit right on the shoreline. There\u2019s also a tall peninsula jutting out into the lake topped with an old monastery. The water is crystal-clear and the pebble shores are dotted with beach facilities where one can rent dinghies, canoes, boats, or simply suntan and sunbathe in tropical-like waters. Just one metal bridge runs over the water connecting Castel di Tora to the main road. In winter, most holiday homes are shut and the narrow alleys are largely deserted apart from cats. In spring, locals spruce up their outdoor patios and socialize in the little piazza. Fresh fish is served at restaurant L\u2019Angoletto, a stone cottage with an open panoramic veranda over the lake. Hotel Turano has cozy, no-frills lakefront rooms and a restaurant serving local specialties. Lake Scanno The most intriguing of all lakes however is Lake Scanno, the \u201cpearl\u201d of eastern Italy\u2019s Abruzzo region, which is as beautiful as it is mysterious. Over the years, tales and myths have been spun about this deep green, heart-shaped lake that persist today, attracting scientists and paranormal investigators who try to find explanations to weird happenings that have long baffled locals. Surrounded by the Apennines mountain range, it is said this natural lake, named after the overhanging village above, has magical powers. Locals believe the lake is alive and some have previously reported unusual phenomena such as shattering light bulbs, exploding TV screens and ceiling lamps dancing as if a small earthquake had just struck. They also tell stories of other unexplained events: sudden water level drops, divers compasses going berserk and dead fish and even long-lost World War II weapons floating on the surface. There\u2019s said to be a mysterious unidentified object buried in the lake bed. Lake Scanno\u2019s unusual atmosphere is almost palpable. In the heady days of summer, the sense of mystery hangs in the warm air. Despite its green color, caused by harmless algae in the water, bathing is permitted here as is windsurfing. The lake is also ripe for exploration, with a \u201cPath of the Heart\u201d trail that circles its banks and takes in a church, said to be a site of miracles, and an old hermitage. Along the shores there is a beach kitted out for summer bathing. There are mountain bike trails and it\u2019s possible to rent rickshaws, rowing boats and canoes.Other facilities include a children\u2019s playground, and a parking area for campers. Lakefront Agriturismo Miralago is a farm and B&B, where horses roam free. It serves traditional dishes like tagliatelle with wild boar. The village of Scanno, a puzzle of lavish bourgeois mansions and humble shepherd dwellings decorated with bright flower pots, is a must-see. Lake Iseo Located just a few miles from Milan, this picturesque spot formed from pure Alpine glacial meltwater is also a source of great sparkling wines, made from grapes grown on its banks. The lake has three islands. The two smallest are private while the largest, Montisola, a huge mountain sticking out of the deep blue water, is heaven for nature-lovers. Here, visitors can rent canoes or fishing boats for a private tour of the lake. Another shoreside attraction is the brightly colored dwellings built for fishermen that stand on stilts over the edge of the water, among them restaurant Locanda al Lago, known for its fish dishes and the sardines hung on the dock to dry. Hotel Sensole is a lakefront Baroque palazzo that contains a gourmet bistrot. Lake Nemi This small lake just beyond the southwestern suburbs of Rome is where locals flock for Sunday lunches with traditional porchetta pork sandwiches and heady red wines. They\u2019re treading in the footsteps of their ancient predecessors. Back in the days of Roman empire, senators and wealthy families came here to relax in lavish retreats around Nemi\u2019s shores, where succulent strawberries grow amid archeological ruins and dense forests. Sited among the Colli Albani hills on the edge of Rome, the lake is of volcanic origin and sits in an extinct crater. It\u2019s accessible by foot along an old route that winds down from a village on the slopes above it that shares the lake\u2019s name. Lakefront B&B Lago di Nemi is an old restyled farmhouse that rents out bicycles, while restaurant La Fiocina on the shore, serves fish specialties like fried whitebait with green peppers. Lake Orta Orta is one of the secret gems of Italy\u2019s Piedmont region, usually overlooked by visitors who flock to the more touristy Lago Maggiore nearby. Created by a melting Alpine glacier, it\u2019s a quiet idyll with picturesque villages, chapels and medieval towers along its banks. In the middle of Orta, the monastery-island of San Giulio rises from the water. Alongside myriad biking and horseback riding trails, it\u2019s possible to waterski and even scuba dive in the translucent waters that lie off its pebble beaches. L\u2019Approdo\u00a0is a four-star lakefront hotel restaurant with a panoramic terrace and pool. Lake Trasimeno This shallow lake formed millennia ago by tectonic movements of the Earth\u2019s crust is located in a less touristy part of Umbria, where just locals have holiday homes and shops in the overhanging village of Castiglione don\u2019t sell the usual souvenirs. Trasimeno\u2019s banks are dotted with medieval hamlets and wooden bridges that cross over the water that are great for birdwatching and sunset drinks. Beaches here rent out windsurf and kite equipment. B&B Dolce Dormire has cozy rooms in the ancient district of Castiglione, while La Casa di Campagna is a rural farm and tavern serving local specialties.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/stunning-secret-italian-lakes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_asia_thailand-lese-majeste-activist-death-netiporn-intl-hnk", "text": "A young activist jailed for insulting\u00a0Thailand\u2019s monarchy\u00a0died on Tuesday following a prolonged hunger strike, officials said, prompting an outpouring of grief and renewed calls for justice reform in the Southeast Asian kingdom Netiporn \u201cBung\u201d Sanesangkhom, 28, died after suffering a \u201csudden cardiac arrest,\u201d Thailand\u2019s Corrections Department said in a statement. A medical team tried to resuscitate her before transferring her to Bangkok\u2019s Thammasat University Hospital but she \u201cdid not respond to treatment,\u201d the department said. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death, the department added. Netiporn was a member of protest group Thalu Wang, which has pushed\u00a0for reform of Thailand\u2019s powerful monarchy and amendment of the country\u2019s draconian lese majeste law, in which criticizing the king, queen, or heir apparent can lead to a maximum 15-year prison sentence. The group\u2019s name\u00a0loosely translates to \u201cpiercing through the palace,\u201d in reference to its drive to hold the monarchy accountable; it campaigns by holding public opinion polls questioning the monarchy\u2019s power. Netiporn had been part of the nationwide 2020 youth-led protests that saw millions of young Thais take to the streets of major cities calling for constitutional, democratic and military reforms, and, for the first time, openly criticizing the monarchy and publicly questioning its power and wealth. She had been in jail since January 26 and was awaiting trial, according to legal advocacy group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. While in detention, Netiporn went on a 65-day hunger strike until April to protest the jailing of political dissidents without bail, the group said. During this time, she had been moved back and forth to the prison hospital due to her deteriorating health. After Netiporn was sent back to jail on April\u00a04, the Thai Corrections Department said she was able to eat and drink normally, but she was weak and suffered from swollen limbs and anemia. She had refused to take \u201cminerals and anti-anemia supplements,\u201d the department said. The activist faced seven criminal cases, including two lese majeste charges. She previously spent 94 days in jail in 2022 and conducted a hunger strike before being released on bail, which was later revoked. One lese majeste case against her was filed in relation to a 2022 protest where she held up a banner at a busy shopping mall in Bangkok that read: \u201cDid the royal procession cause an inconvenience?\u201d The other lese majeste charge is from a similar 2022 protest where she held a sign asking the public: \u201cDo you agree that the government allows the king to use power as he pleases?\u201d In an open letter Netiporn wrote from jail in March, she said growing up as a judge\u2019s daughter made her realize \u201cthis country doesn\u2019t exist to serve small people\u2019s justice.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a judge\u2019s daughter to understand the scale of the failure in the justice system. Their existence is not for the people, they exist shamelessly for the powers and a few groups of people in this country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBy simply asking question and honking a car, you go to jail.\u201d Calls for reform Netiporn\u2019s death has shocked many in the country and sparked renewed calls for reforms to the judicial system, which allows activists to be denied bail and held in detention for extended periods of time before trial. \u201cThis is a shocking reminder that Thai authorities are harshly denying pro-democracy activists their freedom in an apparent bid to silence the peaceful expression of dissent. Many are currently detained, with their right to temporary release on bail denied,\u201d said Amnesty International in a statement. \u201cThis tragic incident should serve as a wake-up call to Thai authorities to drop charges against and release all human rights defenders and other people who are unjustly detained.\u201d On Tuesday night, supporters held a candlelight vigil outside the Southern\u00a0Bangkok Criminal Court. Those attending included Panusaya \u201cRung\u201d Sithijirawattanakul, a fellow activist who also faces lese majeste charges for her involvement in the 2020 protests. \u201cI feel so shocked. I question myself, did she really die?\u201d Panusaya told CNN Wednesday. \u201cShe didn\u2019t receive any justice for her cases.\u201d Calling on the government of Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin to respond to her death, Panusaya demanded the release of all political prisoners in Thailand. \u201cDo we have to have more people die before you will care?\u201d she asked. On Wednesday, Srettha called Netiporn\u2019s death a \u201ctragic incident,\u201d adding he had ordered Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Justice to investigate the circumstances surrounding it. \u201cI would like to convey my condolences to her family. I am confident that we will give justice,\u201d he said. Responding to the calls for the release of all political prisoners, Strettha said, \u201cI believe that the justice minister has heard about the call, and he\u2019s working on looking into the whole legal system. We have to give justice to everyone.\u201d Thailand\u00a0has some of the world\u2019s strictest lese majeste laws and sentences for those convicted under Section 112 of the country\u2019s criminal code,\u00a0can be decades long. Hundreds of people have been\u00a0prosecuted in recent years, including Mongkol Thirakhot, who was sentenced to a record 50 years in prison in January for social media posts deemed damaging to the king. For years,\u00a0human rights organizations\u00a0and free speech campaigners have said lese majeste has been used as a\u00a0political tool\u00a0to silence critics of the Thai government. Rights groups say the right to freedom of expression in Thailand has come under increased attack since the 2020 protests. Despite the change from a military-backed government to civilian leadership last year, surveillance and intimidation against activists and students continues, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. The legal advocacy group said that since the start of those protests in July 2020 and up until March 2024, at least 1,954 people have been prosecuted or charged for their participation in political assemblies and for speaking out, with 286 of those cases involving children. At least 270 people have been charged with lese majeste during that time, the group added. \u201cThe death of Ms. Netiporn is evidence that the problems of political prosecution and detention of pro-democracy activists, especially in l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 cases, are still very much alive under the Pheu Thai government,\u201d the group\u2019s advocacy lead, Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate told CNN. Netiporn\u2019s death comes as Thailand is running for a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council and while the Thai government is negotiating a free trade agreement with the European Union, Akarachai added. \u201cThe right to bail must be granted to political detainees who have not been found guilty of any crimes by a final judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe price of fundamental freedoms should not be their lives.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/asia/thailand-lese-majeste-activist-death-netiporn-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_middleeast_egypt-warns-israel-dire-repercussions-rafah-operation-mime-intl", "text": "Egypt could consider downgrading relations with Israel if it presses on with a military operation in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah on the Egyptian border, an Egyptian official told CNN. \u201cEverything is possible and is on the table, including the downgrade of the relations. But we are not there yet. We are talking to the Israelis, trying to explain and reach a consensus,\u201d the official said. The official said that coordination between the two countries on the Rafah operation, which Egypt has publicly opposed, \u201cdidn\u2019t go well. And that\u2019s why we warned Israel of dire repercussions.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Israeli foreign ministry for comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Egypt was considering downgrading ties with Israel. The two countries had been at loggerheads this week after Israel began a limited military operation in Rafah last week and seized the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt. Egypt subsequently refused to coordinate aid deliveries into Gaza with Israel. The official told CNN earlier that aid deliveries to Palestinians could be halted because Egypt can\u2019t guarantee the safety of its trucks, as they may come under attack by Palestinian militants targeting Israeli troops. The top diplomats in both countries traded blame over the closure of the Rafah crossing as aid deliveries through the key land crossing halted. Rafah had been the entry point for nearly a quarter of the relief entering the Gaza Strip before Israel\u2019s operation. On Tuesday, the US State Department warned that only 50 humanitarian aid trucks made it through to Gaza on Sunday, down from hundreds per day in previous weeks, adding that the number is \u201cnot nearly enough.\u201d Israel placed the blame for the crossing\u2019s closure on Egypt. In a statement on X, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday said he had spoken to UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock \u201cabout the need to persuade Egypt to reopen the Rafah crossing to allow the continued delivery of international humanitarian aid to Gaza.\u201d The Israeli minister\u2019s comments drew backlash from Egypt\u2019s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, who rejected Katz\u2019 statement, calling it a \u201cpolicy of distorting the facts.\u201d Shoukry stated Egypt\u2019s \u201ccategorical rejection of the policy of distorting the facts and disavowing responsibility followed by the Israeli side,\u201d adding that Katz\u2019s remarks are \u201cdesperate attempts by Israel to hold Egypt responsible for the unprecedented humanitarian crisis facing the Gaza Strip.\u201d The crisis, Shoukry said, \u201cis a direct result of indiscriminate Israeli attacks against the Palestinians for more than seven months.\u201d Israel has said that it will never let Hamas take control of the border crossing. The Egyptian official told CNN that Egypt didn\u2019t want Hamas to be in control either, but that Israeli control is also unacceptable. \u201cIt needs to be in the hands of the Palestinians,\u201d the official said, adding that the crossing could be placed under the control of the Palestinian civil defense. \u201cThese are neither Hamas nor Fatah (a rival party to Hamas).\u201d Israeli troops at the Egyptian border Adding to tensions are Israeli military movements that have seen the Jewish state\u2019s tanks and soldiers operating on Egypt\u2019s doorstep, causing outrage in Egyptian media for alleged violations of the 1979 peace treaty signed between the two countries. Israeli troops have crossed into an area that was demilitarized in that treaty four decades ago \u2013 including parts of a border zone known as the Philadelphi Corridor, where the Rafah crossing lies. Videos released by the Israeli military last week showed Israeli flags raised on the Palestinian side of the frontier. The Philadelphi Corridor is a 14-kilometer (about 8.7 mile) long and 100-meter-wide strip of land running along the border between Gaza and Egypt. The corridor is key to the 1979 treaty, a pact that saw Egypt and Israel end their enmity and which restricted the number of troops each side can place near the other\u2019s territory. Changes to the security presence in the area must be made with mutual agreement. Over the years, amendments to security agreements between Egypt and Israel have allowed Cairo to boost its security presence in the Sinai Peninsula, which borders Israel. Israel has not disclosed the scale of its military presence in Rafah. But according to the 1979 peace treaty, which was drawn up before Israel unilaterally withdrew troops from Gaza in 2005, Israel is allowed a limited force of four infantry battalions in Zone D \u2013 where the Philadelphi Corridor lies. These battalions may consist of up to 180 armored personnel vehicles and a total of four thousand personnel. The presence of tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft missiles, except individual surface-to-air missiles, isn\u2019t allowed, the treaty says. It is unclear how many troops Israel now has stationed across the border in Rafah. Asked by CNN about the scale of its military operation in the city, and whether it was coordinated with the Egyptians, the IDF declined to comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/middleeast/egypt-warns-israel-dire-repercussions-rafah-operation-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_style_mona-lisa-setting-italian-town-claim", "text": "Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa \u2014 one of the most famous paintings in the world \u2014 is shrouded in mystery; from questions around the figures identity, to her puzzling, enigmatic expression. Now, at least one of the artwork\u2019s secrets has been revealed, according to a geologist based in Italy. Ann Pizzorusso, who is both a geologist and an art historian specializing in Leonardo and the Renaissance era, believes she has deduced the location of the Mona Lisa using her geological expertise. Three decades ago, Pizzorusso visited the town of Lecco on the southeastern shore of Lake Como in Italy \u2014 where she believes the painting is set \u2014\u00a0to retrace Leonardo\u2019s steps, armed with diary entries and drawings from the artist. \u201cIn his notebook he mentions being in Lecco,\u201d she told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cHe was working as an engineer.\u201d According to Pizzorusso, the project Leonardo was working on was canceled, but his geological field sketches remained (one red chalk drawing of a mountain range near Lecco belongs to the Royal Collection at Windsor, London). While Pizzorusso is not the first to have theorized on the location of the Mona Lisa (in 2011, an art historian attributed the painting\u2019s scenery to a small town called Bobbio, while another to Arezzo) she believes she is the first geologist. Previous calculations have concentrated on the arched bridge over the Mona Lisa\u2019s right shoulder. However, Pizzorusso insists more can be gleaned from the unique rock formation in the horizon. \u201cBridges are fungible,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look in the background, you\u2019ll see pinnacles. It\u2019s a type of erosion that happens in limestone that has fractures in it and breaks off in blocks, almost like a sawtooth pattern\u2026 We can show limestone exists in (Lecco). When you look at the Mona Lisa, there\u2019s a series of mountains in the background that have this sawtooth pattern.\u201d Similarly, the body of water behind Mona Lisa is geologically specific, believed by Pizzorusso to be Lake Como \u2014 a subalpine glacial lake dating back around 10,000 years. \u201cIf you look behind her you have the elongated glacial lakes that have a particular form like fingers,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause when the glacier moved it scoured out certain pieces of land.\u201d Despite her confidence, Pizzorusso kept her inkling quiet for 30 years, telling only other Leonardo scholars in casual conversation. She returned to Lecco this week, still assured that \u201ceverything added up,\u201d and will now present her findings at a geology conference in the town. While the pairing of earth science and art history may seem disparate, Pizzorusso argues the interdisciplinary approach can enrich the viewing experience of Leonardo\u2019s work. \u201cBotticelli, even Michelangelo did terrible backgrounds because they felt the figures were more important,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIf the background is painted right, it gives you more of an appreciation for nature.\u201d Though Pizzorusso admits she is surprised at the widespread interest. \u201cMaybe (Leonardo) was trying to channel me for the environmental movement or something,\u201d she joked. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to how much people love this painting.\u201d But the discovery may only lead to more mystery. If the location is Lecco, as Pizzorusso suggests, more questions remain as to why the renowned painter chose that particular spot, for this particular portrait. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who (Mona Lisa) is, some believe she was a rich Tuscan merchant\u2019s wife,\u201d she said, referring to a popular historical theory that proposes the figure was based on Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini. \u201cWhy did he put her in this wild, untamed environment? This is not Tuscany. What was he trying to tell us by putting this serene, enigmatic lady in this rugged, alpine environment?\u201d Said Pizzorusso. \u201cI\u2019m really intrigued as to what his message was to us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/style/mona-lisa-setting-italian-town-claim/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_17_weather_flooding-south-storms-houston-friday", "text": "At least seven people were killed in the Houston area on Thursday as a destructive complex of storms with winds up to 100 mph tore through the area, triggering power outages that could stretch on for weeks amid soaring temperatures. The death toll rose Friday evening from the four fatalities officials reported earlier in the day. More than 900,000 homes and businesses lost power in Houston\u2019s Harris County during the peak of the storm\u2019s violent winds, and nearly 600,000 remained in the dark Friday evening, according to PowerOutage.us. \u201cFor some folks, the luckier ones, (power restoration) might be days, not hours. For many, many people, it\u2019s going to be weeks and not days,\u201d Harris County Judge Lina Hildago said in a Friday news briefing. Hidalgo said the weeks-long restoration timeframe was for homes and businesses tied into the 10 steel power transmission towers downed in the state, seven of which were in Harris County. It\u2019s unclear which areas are tied into the transmission lines, she said. It\u2019s a troubling timeframe for power restoration, especially as high temperatures reach the 90s through the weekend and beyond. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could hit the triple-digits by next week, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. The City of Houston planned to activate cooling centers for residents on Friday, officials said in a news release. Fallen trees appear to have caused two of the reported deaths, and a crane accident caused another, Houston Fire Department Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said in a news conference. The Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Friday evening identified three others in the county who died from the storm. One man collapsed while attempting to move a downed electrical pole, and a woman died after lightning struck the trailer she was inside and caused a fire, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a post on X Friday. Gonzales said another victim who had lost power reportedly went out to his truck to plug in his oxygen tank. \u201cHe was found unresponsive this morning and pronounced deceased at the scene,\u201d the sheriff said Friday, adding the additional deaths occurred in unincorporated Harris County. Houston Mayor John Whitmire, who signed a local state of disaster declaration for the city on Friday, toured the downtown area and said the \u201cdevastation is significant.\u201d \u201cWe urge everyone to stay away from the area for your safety and to allow public works personnel to do their vital jobs,\u201d Whitmire said.  Additional powerful, drenching storms could plague parts of the Gulf Coast Friday. Here\u2019s the latest on Friday\u2019s storms and destruction in Texas and other parts of the South: Thursday\u2019s severe weather classified as derecho: The weather service classified the line of severe storms that moved through Texas and Louisiana as a derecho, a potentially destructive weather event characterized by widespread wind damage associated with a long-lived line of thunderstorms. Derechos have consistent wind gusts of 58 mph or greater along a path of at least 400 miles, along with several well-separated wind gusts of greater than 75 mph. The Storm Prediction Center and several National Weather Service offices made the determination based on the path\u2019s length and intensity. Most of Houston\u2019s traffic lights are down: Traffic lights across the city are out and debris from damaged buildings and toppled trees are covering roadways, making driving conditions dangerous. \u201cDowntown is a mess. It\u2019s dangerous due to the glass and the lack of traffic lights. So stay at home,\u201d Mayor Whitmire said Thursday. Hurricane-force wind gusts reported in Texas and Louisiana: Wind speeds reached as high as 100 mph in downtown Houston, a National Weather Service storm damage survey crew determined Friday. Wind gusts of 74 to 78 mph were measured just east of the Houston metro\u00a0Thursday evening,\u00a0according to the weather service. The National Weather Service in New Orleans reported wind gusts as strong as 84 mph around the city. Major flooding leads to water rescues: There were up to 20 water rescues after residents in Bryan, Texas, drove into the floodwaters, police spokesperson Seth Waller said. Nearby in College Station, heavy rain Thursday flooded a park, videos shared with CNN showed. Roads flooded in several Texas counties including Bosque, Bell, McLennan and Falls. Waterlogged parts of Texas and Louisiana recorded widespread rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches in just a few hours late Thursday and early Friday morning. Spate of storms exhausts Texas: The Lone Star State has been in the bull\u2019s-eye of seemingly unrelenting rounds of flooding downpours. Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday requested a presidential disaster declaration for areas impacted by the onslaught of severe weather and flooding, citing \u201cextensive damage caused by these severe storms, historic river flooding, and tornadoes\u201d that began on April 26. Houston area bears brunt of destructive storms Houston\u2019s mayor advised residents to stay off the roads and stay at home because of widespread damage to the area. \u201cMany roads are impassable due to downed power lines, debris, and fallen trees,\u201d Mayor Whitmire\u2019s office said in a statement Thursday evening. The storm was so powerful it blew out the windows of buildings in downtown Houston, littering the area with glass as traffic lights went dark. Shoppers at a Costco in Houston used their phones as the only source of light as they huddled inside the store when the power went out, with employees closing the doors to block out the rain and winds. The violent storm conditions partially collapsed a nightclub and partially ripped roofing off the downtown Hyatt Regency, showering the hotel lobby with rain and debris, according to witness video. CenterPoint Energy says its skyscraper in downtown Houston sustained damage from the storm, according to a spokesperson. The Houston Independent School District announced campuses will be closed on Friday and reopen Monday \u201cdue to widespread damage across Houston.\u201d More than a dozen Houston-area school districts also announced they would close Friday, including Aldine Independent School District, Channelview Independent School District and Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District. More damaging storms possible Friday Damaging, soaking storms were ongoing in parts of the Gulf Coast Friday morning following Thursday night\u2019s violent weather. Additional storms will usher in renewed threats later Friday. A Level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place from southern Louisiana to parts of Georgia and Florida. Any of these storms could produce damaging wind gusts, hail and even a tornado. Storms will also unload gushing rainfall. A Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place for portions of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The heaviest rain late Friday will likely fall during the overnight hours. Storms could produce rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour and quickly restart or worsen any ongoing flooding. Widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches are expected from Texas to Georgia through Saturday morning. A few spots caught under multiple torrential storms may pick up 8 inches or more of rain. Some areas could record close to a foot of rain in about 48 hours.

{"id": "2024_05_15_asia_new-caledonia-violence-france-vote-intl-hnk", "text": "The French government has declared a state of emergency in its South Pacific island territory of New Caledonia after deadly violence erupted for a third day Wednesday, with armed clashes between protesters, militias and police, and buildings and cars set on fire in the capital. At least four people have died in the unrest, which is considered the worst since the 1980s. In the capital Noumea, authorities have imposed a curfew and closed the main airport \u2014 usually a busy tourist hub \u2014 to commercial traffic. They have also banned public gatherings, carrying weapons and selling alcohol. The violence is the latest outburst of political tensions that have simmered for years and pitted the island\u2019s largely pro-independence indigenous Kanak communities \u2014 who have long chafed against rule by Paris \u2013 against French inhabitants opposed to breaking ties with their motherland. Protests began Monday involving mostly young people, in response to the tabling of a vote 10,000 miles (17,000 kilometers) away in the French parliament proposing changes to New Caledonia\u2019s constitution that would give greater voting rights to French residents living on the islands. On Tuesday, legislators voted\u00a0overwhelmingly\u00a0in favor of the change. \u201cThe last two days we\u2019ve seen violence of a scale we haven\u2019t seen for 30 years in New Caledonia,\u201d Denise Fisher, a former\u00a0Australian Consul-General in New Caledonia, told CNN. \u201cIt is kind of marking the end of 30 years of peace.\u201d \u201cThe Kanak people are objecting to [the vote in France] not just because it\u2019s been decided in Paris without them but also they feel that they want it to be part of a negotiation \u2026 which would include another self determination vote and a range of other things.\u201d The proposed changes to the constitution would add thousands of extra voters to New Caledonia\u2019s electoral rolls, which have not been updated since the late 1990s. Pro-independence groups say the changes are an attempt by France to consolidate its rule over the archipelago. France\u2019s interior ministry told CNN that 1,800 police officers and gendarmes are already present in New Caledonia and 500 additional police will arrive in the coming hours. The state of emergency will allow authorities to impose restrictions on movement and carry out house arrests and searches. A spokesperson for the French government said the measures were needed to \u201cdeal with the serious breaches of public order which are occurring.\u201d Lying in the South Pacific with Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu for neighbors, New Caledonia is a semiautonomous French territory \u2014 one of a dozen scattered throughout the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm, issuing a letter Wednesday to New Caledonian political leaders urging them to \u201cunambiguously condemn all this violence\u201d and inviting both pro- and anti-independence leaders to meet him \u201cface to face\u201d in Paris. Macron\u2019s administration has pushed for a pivot to the Indo-Pacific, stressing that France is a Pacific power, as China and the United States beef up their presence amid a battle for influence in the strategically important region. New Caledonia is at the center of that plan. \u201cThe stakes are high for France,\u201d Fisher added. \u201cFrance has identified an entire Indo-Pacific vision for itself.\u201d \u201cThe legitimacy of France\u2019s participation this way, having an influence in this way, is in question when you have scenes like this.\u201d The violence Three people - two men and a woman, all indigenous Kanaks - have been shot dead in the violent protests and looting, according to Charles Wea, spokesperson for\u00a0Louis Mapou, President of the Government of New Caledonia. A French police officer who was injured by gunfire in the riots also died, French interior minister\u00a0G\u00e9rald Darmanin said. Demonstrators have also set fire to buildings and cars in Noumea, defying a curfew that has been extended to Thursday. Thick plumes of black smoke covered the capital on Wednesday morning, social media video showed. Images showed burned-out cars, fires in the street, and shops vandalized and looted. \u201cSome are equipped with hunting rifles with buckshot as ammunition. Others were equipped with larger rifles, firing bullets,\u201d the French High commissioner to New Caledonia Louis Le Franc said. More than 140 people have been arrested, while at least 60 security personnel have been injured in the clashes between local nationalist groups and the French authorities, according to Le Franc. One Noumea resident told CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand of panic buying reminiscent of Covid-19. \u201cA lot of fire, violence\u2026but it\u2019s better I stay safe at home. There are a lot of police and army. I want the government to put the action for the peace,\u201d the person told RNZ, asking to remain anonymous. The vote Colonial France took control of New Caledonia in 1853. White settlement followed and the indigenous Kanak people were longtime victims of harsh segregation policies. Many indigenous inhabitants continue to live with high rates of poverty and high unemployment to this day. Deadly violence exploded in the 1980s eventually paving the way towards the Noumea Accord in 1998, a promise by France to give greater political autonomy to the Kanak community. Multiple referendums were held in recent years - in 2018, 2020 and 2021 - as part of the agreement offering voters in New Caledonia the option to secede from France. Each referendum was voted down, but the process was marred by boycotts from pro-independence groups and by Covid-19. Voter roles have been frozen since the Noumea Accord, the issue that France\u2019s parliament was seeking to address in the vote that sparked this week\u2019s violence. French lawmakers in Paris voted 351 \u2013 153 in favor of changing the constitution to \u201cunfreeze\u201d the territory\u2019s electoral rolls, enfranchising French residents who have been in New Caledonia for 10 years. The lists were frozen by the French government to appease pro-independence Kanak nationalists who believe new arrivals to the former colony, including from France, dilute popular support for independence. Both houses of France\u2019s parliament need to approve the constitutional change passed by the National Assembly. On Tuesday, French Prime Minister Gabriel\u00a0Attal said the government would not call a meeting of the parliament to vote on the motion before talks with Kanak leaders, including major independence alliance the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS). \u201cI invite New Caledonia\u2019s political leaders to seize this opportunity and come to Paris for talks in the coming weeks. The important thing is conciliation. Dialogue is important. It is about finding a common, political and global solution,\u201d\u00a0Attal said on the floor of the National Assembly. FLNKS issued its own statement Wednesday both condemning the vote at the National Assembly and calling for an end to the violence. \u201cFLNKS appeals to the youth involved in these demonstrations for appeasement and to ensure the safety of the population and property,\u201d the statement read.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/asia/new-caledonia-violence-france-vote-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_kazakhstan-destination-wedding-romance-chance-encounters", "text": "Ariff Hassan arrived at the wedding under strict instructions: \u201cStay away from the bridesmaid.\u201d It was August 2018. Ariff had traveled from his home in Singapore to Kazakhstan to attend the wedding of an old friend. This friend, like Ariff, had grown up in Malaysia. They\u2019d been close back in the day, but lost touch when Ariff moved to the UK in early adulthood. When Ariff relocated to Singapore, the two friends reconnected, and then the wedding invite followed. Ariff was touched and honored to make the guest list. Plus, his friend\u2019s soon-to-be wife was from Kazakhstan \u2013 the couple had met in Kuala Lumpur \u2013 and the celebrations were set to take place in Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city: Almaty. A keen traveler, Ariff never turned down the opportunity to explore somewhere new. Right away, he RSVPed \u201cyes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d been to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan before, and I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve not been to Kazakhstan. When else am I going to go?\u201d Ariff tells CNN Travel today. Ariff\u2019s friend was delighted that Ariff could make his celebrations. But before the big day, the friend took Ariff aside and gave him a firm warning. \u201cThe bridesmaid\u201d was his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s cousin. Ariff\u2019s friend wanted to avoid a potentially messy family situation, especially as he figured Ariff wasn\u2019t after anything serious. \u201cListen,\u201d said Ariff\u2019s friend. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to get married. And I don\u2019t want to have any problems later, with my extended family. So just give her a wide berth, OK?\u201d Ariff laughed, but he agreed. Anyway, he wasn\u2019t going to the wedding to meet women \u2013 he just wanted to cheer on his friend on his big day, and experience a new country and culture. In the week leading up to the wedding, the bride and groom planned daily activities for their wedding guests \u2013 many of whom, like Ariff, were in Kazakhstan for the first time. Ariff liked Almaty right away. He recalls thinking the city seemed like \u201ca great mix of old Soviet architecture and modern shiny buildings, quiet alleys and parks, and busy bars and restaurants.\u201d \u201cIt is surrounded by beautiful mountains,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe had the chance to stay in a chalet up there for a few days, where the views were absolutely breathtaking.\u201d Then, the night before the wedding, Ariff attended a dinner hosted by the bride\u2019s side of the family. And that\u2019s when he saw Liliya Dauletaliyeva for the first time. \u201cI remember Lili walked in,\u201d says Ariff. She stood out to him right away. \u201cShe was wearing a check shirt. All the other girls were wearing evening dresses.\u201d Over dinner, Liliya was friendly, chatty and at the center of most of the conversations. To Ariff, she projected self-confidence. \u201cShe was doing the translating, between Russian and English, for everybody\u2019s benefit,\u201d Ariff recalls. But when Liliya approached Ariff and tried to make conversation, Ariff made only noncommittal, vague and decidedly awkward responses. He really wanted to talk to Liliya, find out more about her. But Ariff\u2019s friend\u2019s warning was ringing round his head. Because Liliya was \u2013 of course, inevitably \u2013 the bridesmaid Ariff had been warned to stay away from. First impressions Back in 2018, Liliya Dauletaliyeva, born and raised in Almaty, was in her early 20s and living in the Kazakh capital of Astana. She\u2019d recently finished up her bachelor\u2019s degree and enrolled in a master\u2019s program. Liliya was firmly focused on her studies and \u201cnot planning to get married\u201d any time soon. When she wasn\u2019t working late in the library, Liliya was planning future travels. She loved exploring the world, and prioritized adventures whenever she could. She\u2019d just got back from a trip to Iceland, and was looking forward to her cousin\u2019s wedding partly because she\u2019d get to meet a bunch of people from across the world. At the pre-wedding dinner, Liliya noticed her cousin\u2019s fianc\u00e9 only had a couple of friends who\u2019d flown in for the celebrations. One of the guys seemed outgoing and talkative. The other \u2013 Ariff \u2013 seemed more reserved. Liliya wondered if he was shy, or perhaps nervous. \u201cI know a lot of people, their first impression of Kazakhstan, it might be a bit of a cultural shock,\u201d Liliya tells CNN Travel. \u201cSo I thought that he must be feeling a bit weird \u2013 or maybe even awkward because he just reconnected with his friend that he hadn\u2019t seen for ages.\u201d Liliya tried to talk to Ariff to make him feel \u201cmore comfortable.\u201d But she approached him, his eyes widened and he seemed even more awkward than before. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk back,\u201d says Ariff. \u201cI had instructions to follow.\u201d The wedding the next day was \u201can almost 12-hour affair,\u201d as Ariff recalls. \u201cA Kazah wedding is very different from a Southeast Asian wedding,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of drinks and a lot of dancing.\u201d It was a great day, and when the celebrations wrapped up at around 1 a.m., the party continued at a nearby hotel. \u201cThere was a huge karaoke venue at that hotel,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cAnd so all the young people \u2013 the bridesmaids and the friends and family, we all went there.\u201d That\u2019s how, in the early hours of the morning, Ariff and Liliya found themselves sitting side by side in the karaoke bar. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when we started talking, \u201c says Liliya. \u201cAfter all this singing and drinking and dancing. We just sat down and talked.\u201d After \u201ceight or nine hours of drinking\u201d Ariff was no longer preoccupied about his friend\u2019s warning. \u201cThe instructions went out the window,\u201d he says. Connecting at 1 a.m. At first, Liliya and Ariff talked about Kazakhstan. Liliya asked Ariff what he thought of her home country, commenting that Ariff seemed to be one of very few friends of the groom who\u2019d traveled for the wedding. \u201cWhy did you decide to come?\u201d she asked him. \u201cI know many people are like, \u2018Oh Kazakhstan, what is this place? Why would we go there?\u2019\u201d \u201cI like adventures,\u201d said Ariff. \u201cI love traveling and exploring new countries.\u201d Ariff mentioned the wedding invite had come through when he was planning a trip to Iceland. He\u2019d abandoned those plans, and prioritized Kazakhstan instead. \u201cI told him that I just came back from Iceland a couple of months before,\u201d recalls Liliya. \u201cWe realized that we both love traveling. And then just started talking about all these adventures and travel plans, where we want to go\u2026\u201d Liliya and Ariff spent the rest of the evening deep in conversation, but parted ways without exchanging contact details. Still, Ariff was hopeful they might see each other again \u2013 following the Kazak wedding, Ariff\u2019s friend and Liliya\u2019s cousin had a second wedding celebration planned in Malaysia in a few weeks time. Ariff figured Liliya, as a bridesmaid, would likely be there, although he didn\u2019t know for sure. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to figure out how to contact her without obviously asking my friend or his wife for help \u2013 because, you know, the instructions were to stay away from the cousin.\u201d In the end, Ariff tracked Liliya down on Facebook and dropped her a friend request and a message: \u201cHey, I hear you\u2019re coming to Malaysia this weekend for the second leg of the wedding,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to hang out or something, here\u2019s my number.\u201d \u201cAnd then we did hang out,\u201d says Ariff. It was a fun few days \u2013 Ariff showed Liliya his favorite places in Kuala Lumpur and recalls that they \u201cwere quite excited to see each other.\u201d Still, it wasn\u2019t obvious where their connection would go from there. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of long distance,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cI kept thinking, \u2018Maybe we can be friends.\u2019\u201d Taking a risk Before she left Malaysia, Liliya \u2013 on a whim \u2013 invited Ariff to come and visit Kazakhstan again, in a month\u2019s time, for her 24th birthday party. \u201cI obviously sat on the decision for about a week and a half, because I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve just been there,\u2019\u201d recalls Ariff. He remembers turning the idea over in his mind. Ariff really liked Liliya and wanted to see her again. But traveling across the world on a bit of a whim seemed \u201ccrazy.\u201d \u201cI was kind of hesitating to go, because I thought, \u2018This is insanity,\u2019\u201d says Ariff. Ariff mentioned the dilemma to an older family friend whose opinion he trusted. Ariff\u2019s confidant told him that, some 40 years ago he\u2019d \u201cmissed an opportunity with a girl\u201d and still regretted it to that day. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Don\u2019t be me. Go and live your life,\u2019\u201d Ariff recalls. So Ariff put aside his hesitations and embarked on the 19-hour journey to visit Liliya. \u201cI took three planes,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSingapore to Bangkok, Bangkok to Almaty, Almaty to Astana.\u201d \u201cI remember I went to pick him up from the airport,\u201d Liliya says. \u201cI was so nervous. I called my friends and I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. Why did I even agree to that? What did I sign up for? This guy, I only saw him for like, four or five days.\u2019\u201d Liliya wondered what she and Ariff were going to talk about, what were they going to do together, would it be awkward? But as soon as they were together again, Liliya and Ariff\u2019s respective worries melted away. \u201cWe literally spent every single day together. He stayed for 10 days. And every minute that I was not in school, we tried to spend together,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cIt was so much fun.\u201d Liliya also felt heartened that Ariff had followed through \u2013 she\u2019d invited him, he\u2019d said he\u2019d come, and then he did. \u201cI was pleasantly surprised,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was like, \u2018That\u2019s the person that keeps his word, that you can rely on.\u2019 I started thinking, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t mind starting a relationship with a person like this.\u2019\u201d Deciding on the future By the end of the 10 days, both Liliya and Ariff were certain about their future. \u201cThat first trip, we decided we were going to get married,\u201d says Ariff. It wasn\u2019t really a formal conversation, says Liliya: \u201cWe were just having dinner and talking.\u201d Neither of them had been looking for love, let alone marriage. But after meeting each other, Ariff and Liliya were sure they wanted to be together, and to commit to a life side by side. They knew the whole thing was \u201cpretty nuts,\u201d as Ariff puts it today. But they were confident in their feelings and in each other. A month later, in October, Liliya went with Ariff to visit his parents in Malaysia. That Christmas, Ariff\u2019s mother invited Liliya on a family trip to the UK. Ariff\u2019s parents liked Liliya right away \u2013 and, certain marriage was on the cards, Ariff\u2019s mother suggested she and Liliya go shopping for wedding dresses while they were in London. Lilya and Ariff wanted to avoid extended periods of long distance, so around this time Liliya decided to quit her master\u2019s degree and move to Singapore to be with Ariff. \u201cObviously my family didn\u2019t approve,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cBut I thought, \u2018You know what, I can get my master\u2019s in Malaysia or Singapore, and that\u2019s probably an even better option. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u2019\u201d In general Liliya and Ariff\u2019s friends and loved ones were supportive, but a little concerned about the speed at which the romance was moving. \u201cIt was really fast,\u201d admits Liliya. \u201cSome of my friends, they\u2019re still shocked. They\u2019re like, \u2018He hadn\u2019t even proposed and his mom took you to pick a wedding dress.\u2019\u201d Liliya and Ariff shrugged off the concerns, and in December 2018, Liliya moved to Singapore. A couple of months later, Ariff formally proposed, on Valentine\u2019s Day 2019. The couple liked the idea of a \u201ca very small, intimate wedding,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cJust friends and family members, somewhere fun.\u201d \u201cMaybe somewhere in the Mediterranean, a bit of a party with friends,\u201d says Ariff. This dream wasn\u2019t to be. \u201cParents had different ideas,\u201d says Ariff, laughing. Ariff and Liliya ended up with several wedding celebrations \u2013 a small ceremony to sign the legal papers in April 2019, followed by a 300-person wedding in Malaysia in the summer \u201cwith a lot of food and alcohol\u201d and another big party in Kazakhstan. Amid all the planning \u2013 and parental negotiations \u2013 Ariff and Liliya took a break and went on a pre-wedding honeymoon. \u201cIt was great to go on a honeymoon before. We picked places where it was very hard to reach us,\u201d says Ariff. The couple returned from their vacation refreshed and ready to enjoy the August 2019 celebrations. Liliya and Ariff Kazakhstan wedding celebration incorporated a number of Kazakh traditions. \u201cWe had \u2018qyz uzatu,\u2019 a Kazakh traditional ceremony where the bride is sent off from her parental home to the groom\u2019s family, marked by a farewell party attended by close relatives and friends,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cThe event includes ceremonial rites, blessings from elders, presenting gifts to the groom\u2019s family, and the singing of traditional Kazakh songs. Parents give their blessings and advice to the bride.\u201d The Malaysian celebration also included \u201crecitations of prayers and blessings, a traditional meal, and an exchange of gifts,\u201d says Liliya. All of the celebrations were \u201ca blast,\u201d says Ariff. There was lots of laughter, and moving moments too. The family friend who encouraged Ariff to take a risk and visit Liliya was one of the witnesses when the couple signed the papers. Meanwhile, friends from across the world came to celebrate with the couple \u2013 including, of course, Ariff\u2019s childhood friend and Liliya\u2019s cousin, who\u2019d unwittingly kicked off Ariff and Liliya\u2019s love story the year before. \u201cI don\u2019t have any siblings, but I grew up with my cousin,\u201d says Liliya. \u201cWe are very close. So obviously she came to both our weddings, and we\u2019re still super close.\u201d Ariff\u2019s friend had forgiven him for breaking his promise to \u201cstay away from the bridesmaid.\u201d But he still worried, right up until the wedding, that it wouldn\u2019t work out. \u201cI think my friend was very stressed until we got married, until we legally signed the papers because he was like, \u2018Please don\u2019t mess it up,\u2019\u201d says Ariff. \u201cNow we\u2019re all part of one big family,\u201d says Liliya. Taking risks together Post-wedding, Liliya and Ariff settled into an easy rhythm in their relationship. The couple \u201cdon\u2019t have many cultural differences,\u201d says Liliya, even though they grew up in different countries. \u201cWe quickly learned that Kazakh and Malay cultures are very similar, both emphasizing the importance of family, traditions, and community,\u201d she says. Still, they like learning new things about each other\u2019s \u201chistory, people, food\u2026\u201d says Liliya. They enjoy sharing these learning moments with one another. After a few years in Singapore, in 2021 Liliya and Ariff moved to Malaysia. And another big shift occurred last year, when Liliya decided to recommence the master\u2019s course she quit back in 2018. \u201cEven after years of working, this idea of me leaving something incomplete kept bothering me, so I decided to apply again,\u201d she says. Liliya was excited to return to academia, but felt the associated upheaval would only be \u201cworth it\u201d if she was attending one of the best universities in the world. That\u2019s how she ended up accepting a place at the University of Oxford, in the UK. Liliya is loving the experience studying there. The only downside is she and Ariff are now contending with the long distance they actively avoided at the start of their relationship. That is slightly \u201cironic,\u201d admits Ariff. But he\u2019s really proud of Liliya and excited for her next career steps. He visits Oxford every month, and is able to work remotely from the UK for significant chunks of time. In between, the couple video chat regularly. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually much easier to have a long distance relationship when you\u2019ve already been in this relationship for quite some time,\u201d says Liliya. The fact Liliya and Ariff both love traveling also makes journeying back and forth a little easier. \u201cWe want to keep exploring the world and experience living in as many countries as possible,\u201d says Liliya, adding they \u201ccan\u2019t imagine their lives without the thrill of new adventures.\u201d \u201cWe like to take risks, both of us, daily,\u201d says Ariff, pointing out that mindset\u2019s woven into their love story. When they first met, they both jumped into the unknown, flying across the world to visit one another, and then deciding to be together, despite the obstacles. Today, Liliya and Ariff find it surreal to think Liliya barely knew Ariff when she moved across the world to be with him. After five years together, they\u2019re just as certain that they made the right choice. And while they know each other much better, they\u2019re still learning new things about each other. Liliya thinks that\u2019s a big part of what it means to be in love with someone. \u201cIt\u2019s just a great feeling when you feel like you just met this person, because you feel like you keep rediscovering, keep learning something new every day,\u201d she says. \u201cIt never gets boring.\u201d \u201cThinking about how all these puzzle pieces, how they all came together \u2013 I just started believing in destiny. What else can it be?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/kazakhstan-destination-wedding-romance-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Lucero L\u00f3pez Maza, the mayoral candidate for the municipality of La Concordia, was killed in the attack, which, according to preliminary investigations, was a confrontation between armed civilians. Two other people were injured, the Attorney General\u2019s Office of Chiapas said. This comes as political violence has spiked across the country as Mexico heads toward its largest election in history on June 2. The Attorney General\u2019s Office said three of the victims, one of whom was a minor, were women, and three men. All died from gunshot wounds. The investigation is ongoing as police search for the identities and whereabouts of the perpetrators. IEPC condemned the attack, saying, \u201cthat events of this nature generate fear and uncertainty among citizens\u201d and risked discouraging people from participating in the upcoming election. Since the electoral process officially began in September 2023, an average of at least two people a day have suffered some type of political violence, according to private consulting firm Integralia. The official government figures are lower. Violence has been on the rise in the southern state, which borders Guatemala, as cartels fight for control of lucrative routes for migrant and drug smuggling routes. Earlier this week, eleven people were killed in mass shootings in the neighboring municipality of Chicomuselo, the state prosecutor said. The Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel have been engaged in a turf war in the area, with hundreds forced to flee their homes in January. Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador acknowledged that the region has been dealing with violent clashes recently, but claimed that the problem was being sensationalized. \u201cIt is very unfortunate but there is\u00a0a lot of profit made from murders and human pain.

{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_ai-high-school", "text": "At Princeton High School, students are trying to combat the rapid decline of indigenous languages with some unlikely help: a furry, wide-eyed stuffed animal named Che\u2019w. But Che\u2019w isn\u2019t a standard plush toy. He\u2019s a wildly intelligent generative AI robot that speaks Mam, a Mayan language spoken in the western highlands of Guatemala and Mexico and by a small population of the school\u2019s students.\u00a0The language is currently at risk of extinction, according to UNESCO; the students hope Che\u2019w can help change that. At a time when some high schools are restricting the use of AI in the classroom, others, like Princeton High School, are leaning into it. In the short 18 months since the launch of viral chatbot ChatGPT, generative AI has emerged as a revolutionary technology in the field of artificial intelligence. Its capabilities have impressed both users and experts with its ability to perform a range of tasks, from generating creative content, essays and games to conducting mathematical equations, summarizing complicated concepts and more. All that is already reshaping various parts of our lives, including education. But the technology has leaped ahead far faster, in many cases, than schools\u2019 understanding of how to use it. And with new products out this week from Google\u2019s XYZ initiative and OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o, many teachers and districts realize they cannot avoid the subject. Dr. Joy Barnes-Johnson, the science administrator for PHS, said the school is \u201ctrying to embrace AI\u201d as much as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a tool, just like a pencil is technology that helps communication.\u201d She said the school will host an AI summit this summer with its teachers and administrators to have a conversation about how generative AI should or shouldn\u2019t be used in the classroom. \u201cIn the beginning of the school year, we talked about how AI is the world we\u2019re in now and we have a responsibility to prepare kids for the world they will inherit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea is that it will help people connect and learn, so we [as teachers] have to not be afraid of it.\u201d Proceeding with caution When ChatGPT launched in November 2022, teachers worried that the tool, which can generate convincing responses and essays in response to user prompts, could make it easier for students to cheat on assignments. Some also worried ChatGPT and similar tools could be used to spread inaccurate information. Not long after its launch, New York City public schools became one of the first school districts to ban students and teachers from using ChatGPT on the district\u2019s networks and devices. Other schools reacted similarly in the weeks and months that followed, including the Los Angeles Unified School District and Seattle Public Schools, which blocked access to ChatGPT on their networks. Some of these districts have evolved their policies over time. The LAUSD, for example, has since launched a chatbot named \u201cEd\u201d to act as a student advisor, with the ability to inform parents about information ranging from children\u2019s test results to their school attendance. Many schools also continue to grapple with how to best approach the technology inside the classroom. \u201cThere is acceptance by educators, but we\u2019re still seeing a lot of caution,\u201d said Noel Candelaria, the secretary-treasurer of the National Education Association who is leading the charge around the union\u2019s AI policy. \u201cThe challenge is there isn\u2019t a lot of guidance on the district level, so the concern educators have is that it\u2019s being something done to them, instead of with them.\u201d He added: \u201cThere are also major concerns around data confidentiality and where data is being pulled from.\u201d Candelaria told CNN that educators feel strongly that they want their voice to influence how it can be applied to schools. The NEA is developing a task force with educators across the country to address many of these issues. Beyond generative AI Some high schools around the country are\u00a0trying to teach students how to use other forms of artificial intelligence for a greater good. At one prestigious public school in New York City, Stuyvesant High School, students created an app for the blind that uses artificial intelligence and tactile feedback to help people detect threats and navigate obstacles.  Similarly, at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Colorado, a team of students developed an AI-powered\u00a0wildlife detection system called Project Deer to help cut down on car crashes. Although researchers have tried to combat such accidents before, studies have shown wildlife don\u2019t consistently react to any one stimulus. So the students instead derived an AI-based predictive solution to alert the driver to an imminent threat on the road. Using four $5 infrared detection sensors placed on vehicles, the students developed a system for\u00a0AI to scan the surroundings and emit a high-pitched sound when an animal\u2019s body heat is detected, a signal that may help to scare the animal away. The school, which was the\u00a0Colorado State Winner in Samsung\u2019s annual Solve for Tomorrow competition, said it is partnering with the University of Colorado in Boulder this summer to help boost its success rate. The Solve for Tomorrow contest featured more than 1,000 schools submitting STEM-based solutions to real-world problems. Samsung told CNN there was a \u201cdefinite uptick in\u201d submitted AI-powered innovations this year compared to previous years. Computer science teacher Tylor Chacon told CNN the group\u2019s big vision is to one day have the technology regulated or adopted by the state for greater use. School administration has told teachers to help create rubrics or lesson plans, Chacon told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged to embrace it and look into ways we can use it to maximize our own job effectiveness and ease the burden on us,\u201d he said. It\u2019s an increasingly common trend among teachers to use AI tools to create assignments, quizzes, polls, videos and interactives for classroom use. Some are even turning to AI tools and platforms \u2014 such as ChatGPT, Writable, Grammarly and EssayGrader \u2014 to assist with grading papers or writing feedback, a practice that is also raising ethical considerations. Saving a language, learning the future Still, as schools continue to weigh the benefits or disadvantages to teaching and using artificial intelligence, some teachers and administrators feel strongly that it\u2019s the future. At Princeton High, a group of about 14 students met during school hours for months to build out Che\u2019w\u2019s conversational capabilities, drawn from artificial intelligence neural networks that are trained to recognize patterns, solve problems and understand words, sentences and phrases from spoken and written language. Che\u2019w, which translates to \u201cstar\u201d in Mam, was trained to understand the language by the students so it can serve as a personal tutor. The robot is also trained to speak Spanish and English. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t lose patience or get sick of talking to them,\u201d said Mark Eastburn, Princeton High School\u2019s science, research and engineering teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s taking [AI] off the screen and putting it onto a physical structure that looks like a friend that can help you do whatever you need to do.\u201d In April, the students were one of the top three National Winners at the Samsung Solve For Tomorrow\u2019s competition. AI is now a part of students\u2019 lives, Eastburn said. \u201cAnd it will be there when they\u2019re in college and also in their careers,\u201d he added, \u201cso they might as well learn and use it in appropriate ways in high school, if not even earlier.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/ai-high-school/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_europe_eurovision-song-contest-winner-switzerland-nemo-intl", "text": "Switzerland\u2019s Nemo won a chaotic and politically fraught Eurovision Song Contest, triumphing in a competition overshadowed by controversy and booing over the presence of Israel. The typically jovial event \u2013 one of the most watched in the world\u2019s cultural calendar \u2013 descended into turmoil in recent days, as organizers in host country Sweden tried and failed to contain anger aimed towards Israel\u2019s delegation. But Nemo, a favorite throughout the process, won over crowds with a stunning rendition of \u201cThe Code,\u201d a genre-bending anthem about their journey towards accepting their non-binary identity. \u201cI hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue to stand for peace and dignity for every person,\u201d Nemo said after accepting the trophy. \u201cI have to say this whole experience was really intense and not just pleasant all the way. There were a lot of things that didn\u2019t seem like it was all about love and unity, and that made me really sad,\u201d Nemo said. Their win \u2013 the first for a non-binary person \u2013 was Switzerland\u2019s first triumph since Celine Dion won in 1988. Malmo hosted the competition on the 50th anniversary of ABBA\u2019s Eurovision breakout, but the event quickly found itself facing political controversy, and tension grew in the hours leading to the final. Protesters said the event was \u201cartwashing\u201d Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians since being launched in the wake of the militant group\u2019s October 7 attacks on Israel. But organizer the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) defended Israel\u2019s presence, and insisted the contest is non-political \u2013 a line that became increasingly untenable as artists, broadcasters and fans clashed over the presence of Israel\u2019s singer Eden Golan. Golan was booed by some members of the crowd during her performance, while a few turned their backs or left the arena, but more attendees cheered the Israeli performance. And outside the arena, police surrounded a small group of pro-Palestinian protesters, keeping them separate from crowds arriving for the event as they chanted \u201cFree, free Palestine!\u201d and \u201cBoycott the Eurovision.\u201d Ireland\u2019s Bambie Thug meanwhile told CNN in the build-up to the event that it was \u201cthe wrong decision\u201d not to exclude Israel, as Russia had been two years ago. Nemo told CNN before the final that Eurovision was \u201ceven bigger and crazier than I expected it to be. There\u2019s so much depth to Eurovision that I didn\u2019t know of before.\u201d \u201cIf I win, I will throw a big party on the lake of my hometown, Biel,\u201d they told CNN. Just hours before the event, it was thrown into added turmoil when the EBU disqualified the Dutch entrant for a backstage incident involving a female crew member. The EBU said police were investigating the incident involving the singer Joost Klein and that it would not be appropriate for him to participate. Some fans made their anger at the decision clear during the final by booing EBU representatives when they appeared onscreen. The Saturday-night showpiece event featured celebrations of ABBA and other Swedish musical stars, and performances from 26 finalists that spanned genre, language and style. Next year\u2019s event will take place in Switzerland, after Nemo\u2019s win.

{"id": "2024_05_15_europe_slovakia-prime-minister-fico-shooting-intl", "text": "Slovakia\u2019s Prime Minister Robert Fico was rushed to hospital in critical condition on Wednesday after he was shot five times in an assassination attempt that shocked the country. The attack took place after an off-site government meeting in the central Slovak town of Handlova. The suspected gunman was among a small crowd of people waiting to greet the prime minister on the street outside the cultural center, where the meeting took place, local media reported. Footage from the scene shows the gunman approaching Fico and firing at him from close range across a security barrier. The injured prime minister is then seen being bundled into a vehicle by his staff, before it speeds away with him inside. Fico was taken to a local hospital and then transferred by helicopter to a major trauma center about 20 miles (30 kilometers) away in Banska Bystrica. No one else was injured in the attack, officials said. Both the country\u2019s Defense Minister Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k and Interior Minister Mat\u00fa\u0161 \u0160utaj E\u0161tok called the shooting \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d with \u0160utaj E\u0161tok saying that \u201cthe suspect made the decision to do it shortly after the presidential election.\u201d In an emotional news conference outside the hospital, the two ministers said Fico was \u201cfighting for his life\u201d after the shooting and had been, at that point, in surgery for three and half hours. Later in the evening, Slovakian deputy Prime Minister Tom\u00e1\u0161 Taraba said he believed the prime minister would survive following surgery that \u201cwent well\u201d and was \u201cnot in a life-threatening situation at this moment.\u201d \u201cI was very shocked and tried to contact people to figure out how serious his condition was,\u201d Taraba said in an interview with BBC\u2019s Newshour program on Wednesday, recalling the moment he heard about Fico\u2019s shooting. \u201cFortunately, as far as I know the operation went well and I guess in the end he will survive,\u201d he said. Taraba told the BBC that Fico \u201cwas heavily injured\u201d and a bullet \u201cwent through the stomach and the second one hit the joints.\u201d Fico is the most powerful lawmaker in Slovakia. Unlike the president, whose role has limited scope, the prime minister holds rank as the decision-making head of government. The official statement posted on Fico\u2019s official Facebook said the PM was taken to Banska Bystrica instead of the capital city of Bratislava because \u201can acute intervention\u201d was necessary. Handlova is about two hours\u2019 drive from the capital Bratislava. Slovak President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 said the suspected gunman was detained by the police. She said law enforcement agencies will release more information when they can and asked the public not to spread unconfirmed rumors. \u010caputov\u00e1 condemned what she called a \u201cbrutal and reckless\u201d attack on the 59-year-old politician. Speaking at a news conference later in the afternoon, she said the shooting was \u201can attack on democracy as well.\u201d Slovakia\u2019s defense and interior ministers blamed rising hate speech and division for the political atmosphere in the country, which they said led to the assassination attempt. Speaking to reporters in front of the hospital where Fico is being treated, Defense Minister Kali\u0148\u00e1k\u00a0said: \u201cHate is not an answer to hate.\u201d Visibly shaken and struggling for words at multiple moments during the news conference, Kali\u0148\u00e1k\u00a0said it was \u201ctime for some people to have a hard look into the mirror.\u201d \u201cThere is no question that this was politically motivated. The inability to accept the choice of people, which some may not like \u2026 it leads to this,\u201d he said. Interior Minister \u0160utaj-E\u0161tok called for calm, saying \u201cthose who are endorsing this attack as well as those who are calling for some sort of a revenge. And I am asking you, the media too, please, use your power, your influence. Because until now, it was some of you who sow the hate,\u201d he said. Following the shooting, \u0160utaj-E\u0161tok said the country is \u201cexperiencing the worst day of its democracy.\u201d \u201cFor the first time in the 31 years of our democratic sovereign republic, someone has decided to express a political opinion not in an election but with a gun on the street,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. Slovaks have been deeply divided over the country\u2019s direction and position in the world since Fico\u2019s return to power last year. Supporters see Fico as a caring leader who has their interests at heart; critics say he is a populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks for the country. The country has seen weeks of largely peaceful protests over his coalition government\u2019s controversial domestic reforms. The government is also trying to shut down public service broadcaster RTVS and plans to replace it with a new national broadcaster, which would be under tighter control of the government. Felt like a \u2018nightmare\u2019 Social media footage appeared to show the moment Fico was attacked. As he approaches a crowd of people, a man is seen lunging towards Fico with what appears to be a gun pointed at him.  Five shots are heard and Fico falls to the ground. An eyewitness who was at the scene where Fico was shot said the attack felt like a \u201cnightmare\u201d after hearing three \u201cquick\u201d shots, fired one after the other as if you were to \u201cthrow a firecracker on the ground.\u201d \u201cI heard three shots, it was quick one by one like if you throw a firecracker on the ground,\u201d eyewitness\u00a0Lubica Valkova told Reuters, adding that \u201che (Fico) fell next to the barrier.\u201d \u201cI think it is a nightmare, I\u2019ll tell you I think I will not wake up from this,\u201d the 66-year-old said. \u201cThat this is not possible to happen in\u00a0Slovakia.\u201d Valkova said she had been waiting a long time to shake Fico\u2019s hand and was taking pictures of him when he walked out of the building in Handlova. \u201cAt this moment we heard something like a bang, we thought someone made a joke and threw a firecracker on the ground, that was my first reaction,\u201d Valkova recalled. The Slovak resident told Reuters she had been waiting from 10 a.m. local time. She claimed police did not search people who were waiting at the event, adding that \u201cwe could have shown our empty hands.\u201d Ally of Moscow In what was a stunning comeback for the controversial politician, Fico won a third term as Slovakian prime minister last October after running a campaign that criticized western support for Ukraine. As prime minister, he made a major U-turn in Slovakia\u2019s foreign policy and its previously staunch support for Ukraine: Fico had pledged an immediate end to Slovak military support for Ukraine and promised to block Ukraine\u2019s NATO ambitions. Ahead of the election, Fico made no secret of his sympathies towards the Kremlin and blamed \u201cUkrainian Nazis and fascists\u201d for provoking Vladimir Putin into launching the invasion, repeating the\u00a0false narrative Russia\u2019s president\u00a0has used to justify his invasion. While in opposition, Fico became a close ally of Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, especially when it came to criticism of the European Union. Domestically, his coalition government is also pushing controversial reforms that have prompted weeks of large-scale peaceful protests. Attempts to overhaul the criminal justice system have been particularly controversial, as the government seeks to reduce penalties for corruption and has already abolished Slovakia\u2019s special prosecutor\u2019s office, which was tasked with investigating serious and politically sensitive corruption cases, including some that involved people connected to Fico and his party SMER (\u201cDirection \u2013 Social Democracy\u201d). Fico previously served as Slovakia\u2019s prime minister for more than a decade, first between 2006 and 2010 and then again from 2012 to 2018. He was forced to resign in March 2018 after weeks of mass protests over the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fianc\u00e9e, Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1. Kuciak reported on corruption among the country\u2019s elite, including people directly connected to Fico and his party SMER. World leaders immediately condemned the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a telegram to Slovakia\u2019s president that \u201cthere can be no justification for this monstrous crime\u201d and wished Fico a speedy and complete recovery. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, tweeted: \u201cI strongly condemn the vile attack on Prime Minister Robert Fico. Such acts of violence have no place in our society and undermine democracy, our most precious common good.\u201d And Hungarian Prime Minister Orban added: \u201cI was deeply shocked by the heinous attack against my friend, Prime Minister Robert Fico. We pray for his health and quick recovery!\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed \u201csolidarity with the people of Slovakia\u201d following the \u201cappalling\u201d assault on Fico. US President Joe Biden said he was \u201calarmed\u201d by the attempted assassination of Fico, calling it a \u201chorrific act of violence.\u201d \u201cJill and I are praying for a swift recovery, and our thoughts are with his family and the people of Slovakia,\u201d he said in a statement. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he \u201cstrongly condemns the shocking attack.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_05_16_sport_harrison-butker-commencement-speech-analysis-cec", "text": "The NFL is distancing itself from controversial comments by Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker during a recent commencement address. In addition to calling Pride Month a \u201cdeadly sin\u201d and bemoaning diversity and equity initiatives, Butker set off waves of criticism when he suggested that women find more fulfillment through getting married and having children than by pursuing careers \u2013 directly after quoting a song by Taylor Swift. The backlash has been building since Butker made the comments Saturday in an address to graduates at Benedictine College, a small Catholic school in Atchison, Kansas. The NFL issued a statement Wednesday, saying Butker\u2019s comments don\u2019t reflect the views of the league. \u201cHarrison Butker gave a speech in his personal capacity. His views are not those of the NFL as an organization,\u201d said Senior Vice President Jonathan Beane, the league\u2019s chief diversity and inclusion officer. \u201cThe NFL is steadfast in our commitment to inclusion, which only makes our league stronger.\u201d GLAAD also issued a statement calling Butker\u2019s speech \u201ca clear miss\u201d and \u201cwoefully out of step with Americans about Pride, LGBTQ people and women.\u201d The Chiefs, defending Super Bowl champions and one of the NFL\u2019s marquee teams, have not responded to requests for comment. However, plenty of women (and Taylor Swift fans) have made their feelings plainly known, including the sisters of Mount St. Scholastica monastery, a founding institution and sponsor of Benedictine College. \u201cThe sisters of Mount St. Scholastica do not believe that Harrison Butker\u2019s comments in his 2024 Benedictine College commencement address represent the Catholic, Benedictine, liberal arts college that our founders envisioned and in which we have been so invested,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cInstead of promoting unity in our church, our nation, and the world, his comments seem to have fostered division.\u201d Such pushback could keep Butker\u2019s social media feeds clogged with criticism for the foreseeable future. It also could be an optical problem for the NFL and the Chiefs, who have both enjoyed increased support from female fans in the past year. What Butker said about women \u2014 and Taylor Swift In front of the crowd of about 485 male and female graduates, Butker suggested that a woman\u2019s accomplishments in the home are more valuable than any academic or professional goals. \u201cI want to speak directly to you briefly because I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolical lies told to you,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many of you are sitting here now about to cross this stage and are thinking about all the promotions and titles you are going to get in your career? Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.\u201d Butker also praised his wife Isabelle, saying she \u201cwould be the first to say her life truly started when she began living her vocation as a wife and as a mother.\u201d Judging from the hundreds upon hundreds of critical comments on Butker\u2019s Instagram posts and about him on X and TikTok, his remarks did not sit well with many people. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a case of foot-in-mouth. It was a well-prepared speech,\u201d wrote columnist Sam McDowell in the Kansas City Star. \u201cWomen listening in the audience, rather than being rewarded with a diploma on graduation day, were made to listen as he promoted the role of homemaker \u2014 not as an acceptable choice, but as their duty as a husband\u2019s servant.\u201d It also didn\u2019t sit well with many people that Butker invoked Swift, the pop star who is dating Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce and who was a frequent sight at Chiefs games this past season, including the Super Bowl. Butker likely became the first person in history to quote a Taylor Swift song while criticizing Catholic priests for catering too much to the feelings of their parishioners. \u201cAs my teammate\u2019s girlfriend says: \u2018Familiarity breeds contempt,\u2019\u201d Butker said at one point, quoting Swift\u2019s song \u201cBejeweled\u201d (and, by extension, a common turn of phrase). Conservative voices have praised Butker\u2019s speech for being \u201c100% correct\u201d and for reflecting his self-professed deep Catholic faith. However, his reference to Swift \u2014 a childless, unmarried superstar and feminist figure who by Butker\u2019s own definition is not living up to her potential \u2014 has prompted additional outcry. Feminists and Taylor Swift fans have fired back Butker, 28, has been with the Chiefs for seven seasons. He kicked four field goals as the Chiefs edged the San Francisco 49ers, 25-22, in February to win the Super Bowl. Before his speech, Butker\u2019s Instagram account was rather innocuous: Mostly photos of his gameday outfits paired with Bible quotes, posed shots next to conservative figures and bits of Christian wisdom, all met with generally hospitable commentary from fans. Now, nearly every recent post on his account has been overrun with insults, some questioning how Butker feels about women like Swift, who have found success outside of marriage and motherhood: \u201cI feel bad for those poor women who looked forward to their graduation and had you inflicted upon them.\u201d \u201cHave a talk with Travis about how you can be successful, masculine AND still incredibly supportive of your girlfriend\u2019s career.\u201d The deluge of criticism reached almost every corner of social media, and people took notice. \u201cAs a woman, does watching Harrison Butker get cooked online count as being in the kitchen,\u201d reads one popular post on X. \u201cI\u2019ll let the Swifties handle Harrison Butker,\u201d reads another. Commenters and social influencers also picked up on another piece of information that appears at odds with Butker\u2019s worldview. His mother, Elizabeth Keller Butker, is a medical physicist at Emory University\u2019s Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta and holds, among other academic accolades, a degree in chemistry from Smith College, a private women\u2019s liberal arts college in Massachusetts. \u201cWhat does your mom think about your little speech, Harrison?\u201d asked Vicki Chan, a doctor and TikTok creator with more than 500,000 followers. CNN has reached out to Benedictine College, where Butker gave his address, and is awaiting a response. The backlash comes as the NFL is trying to court female fans While the fallout from Butker\u2019s address is messy enough already, there\u2019s another complicating detail to consider. The NFL has tried to woo female fans for years. When Swift began appearing at Chiefs games last fall to support her boyfriend Kelce, female interest in the NFL skyrocketed. Super Bowl LVIII, in which the Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers and the superstar couple shared picture-perfect embraces after the victory, was the most-watched Super Bowl ever. Even NFL commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged the \u201cTaylor Swift effect\u201d on the season. To many, Butker\u2019s comments are a kick in the face to a burgeoning, and valuable,  demographic of NFL fans. \u201cHey NFL. If you want to continue to grow your female fan base and any other marginalized group (straight white men are already watching your product), come get your boy,\u201d tweeted former \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d reporter Lisa Guerrero. Some commenters also asked the Chiefs to issue a response to Butker\u2019s remarks in the interest of their female fans. So far, the Chiefs have not made a public comment. Butker\u2019s speech contained other polarizing comments While Butker\u2019s remarks about women and Taylor Swift inspired a very specific sort of backlash, critics had plenty to say about the other parts of his speech, too. A few details in particular have stirred up discontent: \u2022 Butker criticized President Joe Biden, who is Catholic, and other unnamed Catholic leaders for \u201cpushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to transgender rights. \u2022 In a swipe at LGBTQ communities, Butker encouraged graduates to have Catholic pride, but \u201cnot the deadly sin sort of pride that has an entire month dedicated to it.\u201d \u2022 Butker also waded into the DEI debate, saying, \u201cThe world around us says that we should keep our beliefs to ourselves whenever they go against the tyranny of diversity, equity and inclusion.\u201d In response to his comments about diversity, Tennessean reporter Andrea Williams pointed out Butker shares the field with Patrick Mahomes, who is considered one of the best players of his generation and is one of only a handful of Black quarterbacks to win a Super Bowl. \u201cHarrison Butker doesn\u2019t have three Super Bowl rings without Patrick Mahomes,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd without those Super Bowl rings, he doesn\u2019t have the aforementioned praise or platform.\u201d Some women also pointed out that Butker\u2019s understanding of Catholicism \u2014 and what the faith asks of its adherents \u2014 is far from universal. Journalist Yvette Walker wrote a faith-based critique for the Kansas City Star, noting the many women of the Bible who contributed to their communities outside of traditional gender roles. \u201cI hope the women in the audience who didn\u2019t agree with everything Butker said remember that they can think for themselves, read the Bible for themselves, and choose the reasoning God granted to live a full and worthwhile life whether you have a family or not,\u201d she wrote.

{"id": "2024_05_16_europe_robert-fico-shooting-analysis-violent-attacks-intl-cmd", "text": "The horrific scenes in Slovakia following the assassination attempt on Prime Minister Robert Fico are a stark and brutal reminder of the dangers facing those who seek public office. Fico, a pro-Russia left-wing populist, was recovering Thursday after being shot multiple times in the stomach. Government ministers closely aligned with the prime minister quickly called the shooting \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d pointing the finger of blame for the toxic political atmosphere at the opposition and the media. But Fico himself has been guilty of using emotive language in the past. He claimed the country\u2019s outgoing progressive President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 was an \u201cAmerican agent\u201d and accused her \u2014 without any proof \u2014 of acting in the interests of the US financier George Soros, a frequent target for\u00a0conspiracy\u00a0theories. \u010caputov\u00e1\u2019s allies said the comments have led to death threats. The issue is obviously not isolated to Slovakia. Politics across Europe and elsewhere have become bitterly divided over the past decade, with far-right and radical left-wing populists increasing their influence both in domestic politics and at a European level. Ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza have added to these tensions, as citizens look to their leaders to take a stand on highly contentious issues. These tensions exist in the same space as a political system that obliges elected officials to meet and mix with the people who vote them into office. The shooting came at a time of extreme political divisions over Slovakia\u2019s position in the world and its future. Fico is, and has always been, a highly divisive politician. His supporters see him as a caring leader who has their interests at heart. His opponents say he is a corrupt populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks. Fico\u2019s comments prompted \u010caputov\u00e1 to take legal action against Fico, suing him for defamation. Despite being one of the most popular Slovakian politicians, \u010caputov\u00e1 announced last year that she would be stepping down and would not run again. She specifically cited verbal attacks against her and her family as being among the reasons why she felt she \u201cdidn\u2019t have enough strength\u201d to serve for another term. The assassination attempt against Fico came as his coalition government is trying to push through a number of divisive measures, sparking months of large-scale peaceful protests. Fico\u2019s attempts to overhaul the criminal justice system are particularly controversial. The government is seeking to reduce penalties for corruption and has abolished the special prosecutor\u2019s office, which was tasked with investigating serious and politically sensitive corruption cases, including some that concerned people directly connected to Fico and his party, SMER. The government is also trying to shut down the public service broadcaster RTVS, planning to replace it with a new national broadcaster, which would be under tighter control of the government. That plan has sparked large-scale protests in Slovakia. Slovakia is not unique in its political divisions and move towards populism. Only this week, the Netherlands came one step closer to having a coalition government with a far-right party at its helm. In 2022, Giorgia Meloni became Italy\u2019s prime minister after running on an anti-immigration, socially conservative ticket. While both these leaders are on the right and Fico is on the left, specific definitions between the left and right are becoming less helpful across Europe in the context of populism. The swing towards populism is expected to play out in the European Parliamentary elections next month. Current polls suggest there will be enough far-right Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) that they will be able to block legislation. Political division, emotive overseas conflicts, high levels of migration and struggling economies all add to a pressure cooker that makes it dangerous to be a politician these days. Politicians are especially vulnerable to violent attacks for a few reasons. They are people whose position gives them a public platform that isn\u2019t dissimilar to that of a minor celebrity. Unlike minor celebrities, they are human representations of policies that people have extremely strong feelings about. If a politician belongs to a party that won\u2019t call for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, they support genocide in the eyes of some voters. If a politician supported Covid lockdowns, they stripped people of their liberties, in some people\u2019s thinking. If an elected representative wants to keep funding Ukraine rather than encourage talks with Russia, some will see them as a warmonger thwarting peace. Politicians are also obliged to mix with the general public. In Britain, two sitting parliamentarians were murdered while holding meetings with the people they represented. In 2016, Jo Cox, a left-wing MP who had spoken in support of Syrian refugees, was killed by a far-right white supremacist. David Amess, a Conservative MP, was killed while meeting constituents at a church hall by an ISIS sympathiser. The threat of violence can be felt by politicians far beyond\u2019s Europe\u2019s borders. Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot dead in July 2022 as he gave a campaign speech. Last year, Ecuadorian presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio \u2013 an anti-corruption campaigner and lawmaker \u2013 was shot dead during a campaign rally, 10 days before the first round of voting. As long as they have these obligations to meet and mix, there is no amount of security that would completely remove this risk for politicians. Besides, limiting access to politicians could make the disconnect between the public and their elected representatives even worse. Finally, if you are someone looking to make a political point through a public act of violence, then who better than the human representation of what you oppose? It may be horrible to admit that politically motivated violence against a politician is an effective way of gaining attention for your cause, but that is the calculation that those who carry out these attacks will make. Attacking a random member of the public will not attract the media attention that attacking a politician will. Targeting someone with a public profile who actually represents something means that you can claim to be a political martyr rather than a simple murderer. There are two obvious ways of reducing this risk: restricting access to politicians and obtaining better intelligence on potential attackers. The first, while probably more effective, runs the risk of further alienating the public from their leaders. The second is time-consuming, requires increased investment in intelligence and security operations and results are not guaranteed. The third, less obvious, way of improving the situation is to lower the temperature of political discourse. In the days following the attack on Fico\u2019s life, the public will likely hear politicians across Europe calling for civility in politics and condemning radicalism. Next month\u2019s European elections and the discourse in the run-up to them will show how serious they are about calming political tensions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/europe/robert-fico-shooting-analysis-violent-attacks-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_world_black-holes-einstein-plunging-region-scn", "text": "Albert Einstein was right: There is an area at the edge of black holes where matter can no longer stay in orbit and instead falls in, as predicted by his theory of gravity. Using telescopes capable of detecting X-rays, a team of astronomers has for the first time observed this area \u2014 called the \u201cplunging region\u201d \u2014 in a black hole about 10,000 light-years from Earth. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ignoring this region, because we didn\u2019t have the data,\u201d said research scientist Andrew Mummery, lead author of the study published Thursday in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. \u201cBut now that we do, we couldn\u2019t explain it any other way.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time that black holes have helped confirm Einstein\u2019s grand theory, which is also known as general relativity. The first photo of a black hole, captured in 2019, had previously strengthened the revolutionary physicist\u2019s core assumption that gravity is just matter bending the space-time fabric. Many of Einstein\u2019s other predictions have turned out to be correct over the years, among them gravitational waves and the universal speed limit. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough man to bet against at this point,\u201d said Mummery, a Leverhulme-Peierls Fellow in the department of physics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. \u201cWe went out searching for this one specifically \u2014 that was always the plan. We\u2019ve argued about whether we\u2019d ever be able to find it for a really long time,\u201d Mummery said. \u201cPeople said it would be impossible, so confirming it\u2019s there is really exciting.\u201d \u2018Like the edge of a waterfall\u2019 The observed black hole is in a system called MAXI J1820 + 070, which is made up of a star smaller than the sun and the black hole itself, estimated at 7 to 8 solar masses. The astronomers used NASA\u2019s space-based NuSTAR and NICER telescopes to collect data and understand how hot gas, called plasma, from the star gets sucked into the black hole. NuSTAR is short for the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, which orbits Earth, and NICER, formally known as the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer, is located on the International Space Station. \u201cAround these black holes there are big discs of orbiting material (from nearby stars),\u201d Mummery said. \u201cMost of it is stable, which means it can happily flow. It\u2019s like a river, whereas the plunging region is like the edge of a waterfall \u2014 all of your support is gone and you\u2019re just crashing headfirst. Most of what you can see is the river, but there\u2019s this tiny region at the very end, which is basically what we found,\u201d he added, noting that while the \u201criver\u201d had been widely observed, this is the first evidence of the \u201cwaterfall.\u201d Unlike the event horizon, which is closer to the center of the black hole and doesn\u2019t let anything escape, including light and radiation, in the \u201cplunging region\u201d light can still escape, but matter is doomed by the powerful gravitational pull, Mummery explained. The study\u2019s findings could help astronomers better understand the formation and evolution of black holes. \u201cWe can really learn about them by studying this region, because it\u2019s right at the edge, so it gives us the most information,\u201d Mummery said. One thing that\u2019s missing from the study is an actual image of the black hole, because it is too small and far away. But another team of Oxford researchers is working on something even better than a picture: the first movie of a black hole. To achieve that, the team will first need to build a new observatory, the Africa Millimetre Telescope in Namibia, which Mummery expects to be online within a decade. The telescope, which will join the international Event Horizon Telescope collaboration that captured the groundbreaking 2019 image of the black hole, will enable scientists to observe and film large black holes at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and beyond. A link to the past According to Christopher Reynolds, a professor of astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, finding actual evidence for the \u201cplunging region\u201d is an important step that will let scientists significantly refine models for how matter behaves around a black hole. \u201cFor example, it can be used to measure the rotation rate of the black hole,\u201d said Reynolds, who was not involved in the study. Dan Wilkins, a research scientist at Stanford University in California, calls it an exciting development, and points out that in 2018 there was an enormously bright outburst of light from one of the black holes within our galaxy, paired with an excess of high-energy X-rays. \u201cWe had hypothesized at the time that this excess was from the hot material in the \u2018plunging region,\u2019 but we did not have a full theoretical prediction of what that emission would look like,\u201d said Wilkins, who also was not involved with the new study. This study actually performs that calculation, he added, using Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity to predict what the X-rays emitted by material in the \u201cplunging region\u201d would look like around a black hole, and compares it with the data from that bright outburst in 2018. \u201cThis will be prime discovery space over the next decade or so,\u201d Wilkins said, \u201cas we look towards the next generation of X-ray telescopes that will give us more detailed measurements of the innermost regions just outside the event horizons of black holes.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/world/black-holes-einstein-plunging-region-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

A senior A-League player allegedly took instructions from the mastermind and arranged the infractions with teammates in designated games last year, according to New South Wales Police. Those arrested have not yet been named by police. Junior players would get 10,000 Australian dollars ($6,666) for getting yellow cards and conceding penalties in those games to influence results, assistant police commissioner Michael Fitzgerald said during a press conference on Friday. He said the alleged crimes happened in November and December last year, adding that \u201cthese players betrayed the trust of their supporters.\u201d Three players, age 27, 32, and 33, are set to appear in court later this month and next month, facing charges relating to \u201cconduct that corrupts a betting outcome of an event.\u201d Authorities are after a fourth player, who is currently out of state, for questioning, they added.

From the gleaming home of Asia\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, towering over \u201cBillionaires\u2019 Row,\u201d to the waterfront mansions of Bollywood stars, Mumbai is the place where ambitions are realized. But as India\u2019s financial capital prepares to vote in the country\u2019s massive general election, many residents say they want a fairer share of its wealth \u2013 with better education the key to opportunity. In the densely packed Dadar neighborhood, hustlers and dreamers alike spill out of train stations and shopping complexes, a whirl of humanity weaving through congested streets where market traders tout for business. Next to piles of potatoes and onions, 34-year-old grocer Sachin Chaudhary cites rising prices and a tough job market as his biggest concerns ahead of the city\u2019s first voting phase later in May. \u201cThe change I want to see is, things should become less costly,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd children are getting good educations, so there should also be better opportunities in the employment sector.\u201d As India\u2019s wealthiest city, Mumbai is often likened to New York \u2013 a place of opportunity where everyone is from somewhere else, hoping to make it big and support their families, often in poorer rural hometowns.

They have parents, but the thing is they (don\u2019t have the right) financial conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cSomebody should do something for them.\u201d Many poor children in the city are not even 10 years old when they start helping their parents to earn a living. It\u2019s especially common in Mumbai\u2019s infamous slums, which were depicted in the 2008 Oscar-winning film \u201cSlumdog Millionaire.\u201d Kalpita Shinde, a 43-year-old government worker, also highlights the need for India\u2019s next government to provide its people with greater upward mobility. \u201cAll should have employment, and the jobs should be on par with the better education opportunities we have,\u201d she says. \u201cIf people have good jobs, then it\u2019s not just the individual who grows. The whole family also grows and leads a better life.\u201d Banker Helen D\u2019Souza, 60, agreed with that sentiment. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot to be done in this country, as regards (to) the middle class,\u201d she said over the thrum of Dadar\u2019s traffic. \u201cA lot of people are unhappy \u2026 When you don\u2019t get something, you lose trust.\u201d \u2018I want Narendra Modi\u2019 Every Mumbaikar who spoke to CNN emphasized the importance of voting as a civic duty, but only supporters of one party openly expressed their voting intentions. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are widely expected to win a third straight five-year term this election, extending his popular but controversial rule into a second decade. That dominance is reflected in the sheer amount of BJP campaign material displayed across the city, with scant signs of India\u2019s opposition. Modi\u2019s face beams from billboards and hangs off bridges, posters listing his achievements and election promises. For Bhat, the answer to India\u2019s poverty-stricken girls and women lies in Modi, who has been credited with boosting the country\u2019s economy, infrastructure and global standing. \u201cI want Narendra Modi \u2013 that\u2019s it. He\u2019s a true leader,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore Narendra Modi, nobody was aware about who\u2019s the president, who\u2019s the prime minister. \u201cBut now everybody\u2019s aware of that because he\u2019s going out, keeping relationships (with other countries), so that our country can cope with upcoming problems.\u201d Chatting to CNN between sips from a paper cup of chai, salesperson Parag Sawla, 42, echoes that sentiment. \u201cI will vote for the BJP as they are the perfect party,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me in this election, we need a party that focuses not only on global issues but on issues that matter to individuals in the country.\u201d But not every BJP voter is so enthusiastic. \u201cThere is no strong opposition, so I will vote for the BJP, as there are no other (significant) political parties. The BJP is ruling everywhere,\u201d says Chaudhary, the vegetable seller. \u201cIf there was a strong opposition, I would have more choice \u2013 but sadly, we don\u2019t.\u201d Religious tensions Education and employment aside, several other issues loom in the minds of Mumbai\u2019s voters \u2013 especially longstanding religious tensions that have spiraled under Modi\u2019s tenure. Modi and his BJP have been accused of driving religious polarization with Hindu-nationalist policies, giving rise to a wave of Islamophobia and deadly communal clashes. Many of the country\u2019s 230 million Muslims say they are being sidelined and marginalized in the world\u2019s largest democracy. One major point of contention is the BJP\u2019s attempt to pass a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), a set of common laws for personal matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance \u2013 replacing religious laws followed by different groups. Some critics fear the government\u2019s Hindu-nationalist policies could unduly influence the legislation, further threatening the rights and freedoms of minorities. Others, however, say the reform of religious laws represents progress. Sanjay Sardesai, a 60-year-old retired airline worker, wouldn\u2019t indicate who he\u2019s voting for but says the civil code is the most important election issue. \u201cIt means that all sections of society, irrespective of their religion, shall be treated equally,\u201d he tells CNN while resting on his motorbike in Dadar. \u201cThat should be implemented so we are given the same rights all across India.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/india/india-election-mumbai-wealth-gap-issues-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Yet almost two years after her death, new pictures of Britain\u2019s longest-reigning monarch have emerged for an exhibition opening at Buckingham Palace this week. Among the most striking is a touching image from 1964 of four royal mothers and their babies - including the Queen and her youngest son, Prince Edward. Alongside them are the Queen\u2019s sister, Princess Margaret, plus Princess Alexandra and the Duchess of Kent, all holding their newborn babies. The never-before-seen image was taken by Princess Margaret\u2019s then-husband, photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones - or Lord Snowdon as he was known as then - as a personal thanks for the royal obstetrician who delivered the four babies within two months of that year. Shown alongside it is a handwritten letter from Princess Margaret to her sister in which she asks \u201cDarling Lilibet\u201d to sign a print \u201cas a souvenir of an extraordinary two months of delivery.\u201d \u201cRoyal Portraits: A Century of Photography,\u201d which opened in The King\u2019s Gallery of the palace on Friday, has more than 150 items from the Royal Collection and Royal Archives, which chart the evolution of royal portrait photography since the 1920s. Also on show for the first time are several wartime images taken by Cecil Beaton, who captured the royal family on camera over six decades. Among them is one of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth inspecting bomb damage at the palace in 1940, while another shows them with their two daughters - Elizabeth and Margaret - around the King\u2019s desk at the Royal Lodge in Windsor. Beaton was the official photographer for Elizabeth\u2019s coronation in 1953. The exhibition features a contact sheet of proofs of the coronation sitting, alongside a note from Martin Charteris, the Queen\u2019s assistant private secretary, recommending to Prince Philip which images should be sent to the royal family and maids of honor. The picture that was subsequently chosen and sent to the Queen Mother can also be seen, signed by both the Queen, her husband and Beaton. In a week where many headlines were made about the new official painting of the King, the exhibition offers an altogether different view of Charles. It features a black and white shot of Charles, then a young prince, alongside his sister, Princess Anne, in 1956. There are numerous official photographs taken to mark royal birthdays, including a portrait by Beaton of Princess Margaret for her 25th birthday - together with her dog Pippin.  Separately, she and her sister, the Queen, can be seen laughing and talking in a contact sheet of images shot by Norman Parkinson on the occasion of their mother\u2019s 80th birthday. Another highlight is the earliest surviving color print of a member of the royal family. Taken in 1935 by pioneering female photographer Madame Yevonde, it shows Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester - sister-in-law to King George VI and Edward VIII - on her wedding day. The exhibition, which runs until October, charts the innovations in portraiture, featuring Andy Warhol\u2019s 1985 image of the Queen sprinkled with diamond dust and Rankin\u2019s 2001 photograph of the smiling monarch, superimposed against the union flag. Meanwhile, Paolo Roversi\u2019s memorable 40th birthday portrait of the Princess of Wales, shows Catherine bearing a striking resemblance to Alexandra, Princess of Wales, by Franz Xaver Winterhalter in 1864. Curator Alessandro Nasini said in a press release: \u201cThe Royal Collection holds some of the most enduring photographs ever taken of the Royal Family, captured by the most celebrated portrait photographers of the past hundred years \u2013 from Dorothy Wilding and Cecil Beaton to Annie Leibovitz, David Bailey, and Rankin. \u201cAlongside these beautiful vintage prints, which cannot be on permanent display for conservation reasons, we are excited to share archival correspondence and never-before-seen proofs that will give visitors a behind-the-scenes insight into the process of creating such unforgettable royal portraits.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/style/unseen-photos-royal-family-gbr-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_catalonia-elections-socialists-win-intl", "text": "Barcelona, Spain \u2014 Spain\u2019s Socialists won the biggest share of the vote in Sunday\u2019s Catalan elections, dealing a serious blow to more than a decade of separatist governance and the independence dreams still nursed by some in the wealthy northeastern region. The Socialists, led locally by Salvador Illa, had 42 seats in the 135-seat chamber with more than 99% of the vote counted, while hardline separatist party Junts was in second place with 35 seats, and the incumbent more moderate separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) had 20 seats. Spain\u2019s largest opposition party, the conservative People\u2019s Party, also had a good night, seeing the biggest increase since the last vote in 2021 from three seats to 15 on Sunday. Turnout for the vote was notably low at 58%. The result looks to be an existential threat for separatist governance in Catalonia which led a 2017 illegal independence referendum and declaration of independence that caused Spain\u2019s worst institutional crisis in more than 30 years but whose movement has lost energy and unity more recently. It also represents a vindication of Spain\u2019s Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s controversial bid to normalize relations with restive Catalonia, including issuing pardons for convictions over the independence drive and, more recently, a controversial amnesty including others still facing prosecution. Speaking as the voting count concluded, Illa hailed a \u201cnew era\u201d for the region. However, with no party holding a clear majority and deep ideological divisions between them, there remains the risk the vote will have to be repeated. The separatist parties combined of the ERC, Junts, far-left CUP and far-right Alianca Catalana, do not have the required 68 seats to be able to form a coalition government. Illa\u2019s Socialists will also need to forge an agreement - most likely with the ERC - but separatist parties until now have rejected any suggestion of helping the national ruling party govern in Catalonia. Illa might instead attempt to form an unorthodox alliance with not only far-left Sumar, its coalition partner in national government, but also the conservative People\u2019s Party and far-right Vox, with whom the socialists have long said they would not negotiate. On Sunday night, the ERC\u2019s leader Pere Aragones, Catalonia\u2019s outgoing president, told reporters that his party would move into opposition, effectively ruling out backing the Socialists. Junts\u2019 leader Carles Puigdemont said his party had performed well but turnout among separatist voters remained low and without a strong showing by the ERC, AC and CUP, his options were limited. He previously said that if he didn\u2019t win and the Socialists allied with the PP to lead the region he might withdraw his support from its minority national government - offered after inconclusive national elections in July, risking fresh instability on a national level. Political analyst and historian Joan Esculies said whatever came next, the night\u2019s headline was the tamping down of Catalan separatist sentiment: \u201cThe pro-independence movement has run out of ideas to convince or mobilize people as they did before.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/europe/catalonia-elections-socialists-win-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_weather_canada-wildfires-fort-mcmurray-climate-thursday", "text": "Colossal wildfires burning across Canada over the last week have driven thousands of people to evacuate with their kids, pets and precious belongings in tow \u2013 many uncertain when they may be able to return home. Firefighters battling more than 100 blazes across the country could see temporary relief in some regions as a large mid-week storm tracks through western and central Canada, bringing increased chances of rain and blasts of cooler air. Even so, several volatile fires are raging within miles of neighborhoods. Fire officials warn slight changes in weather conditions or wind direction could quickly place nearby homes and businesses at risk. More than 6,000 people have evacuated from Fort McMurray in Alberta since Tuesday as a 51,000 acre fire burns less than 5 miles from the city\u2019s edge. Residents should plan to be away from their homes until at least May 21, possibly longer, the regional municipality said. The fire near Fort McMurray was still active Wednesday, but winds were expected to begin pushing the blaze away from the city and its major highway, Alberta Wildfire Information Officer Josee St-Onge said. Rain showers are forecast to begin in the area Wednesday night and drop up to 1 inch of rain through tomorrow. Around-the-clock firefighting efforts have helped keep the flames at bay, including water helicopters equipped with night vision. Firefighters \u2013 some of them defending their own communities \u2013 have also been pulling grueling and dangerous shifts. \u201cTo the firefighters braving the flames to defend Fort McMurray and other areas of the province, we appreciate your heroic efforts more than we can say and we pray for your safe return,\u201d Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said Wednesday. For many Fort McMurray residents, the smoke-blackened skies and anxious evacuations recall painful memories of a catastrophic 2016 fire dubbed \u201cThe Beast,\u201d which forced 90,000 people to evacuate and wrought billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses. Resident Jocelyn Routhier, whose neighborhood has yet to be ordered to evacuate, has watched from her back porch as the scene grows eerily similar to the previous disaster. She shared two uncanny pictures of the fires taken eight years apart. \u201cThis is a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that I would rather not experience. Let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t turn into a reality,\u201d Routhier said in social media post alongside the images. \u2018It\u2019s hard to think anything but the worst\u2019 New fires are cropping up every day across Canada and several out-of-control blazes are threatening populous neighborhoods, prompting scores of evacuating residents to look for lodging in hotels, emergency shelters and camp and RV sites. Mackenzie Spenrath is among the nearly 5,000 people ordered to evacuate the Fort Nelson area in British Columbia, where the 31,000-acre Parker Lake Fire is burning just 1.5 miles from the community. He told CNN affiliate CBC he has become consumed with watching the news and scrolling social media \u201ctrying to figure out if my town is still standing.\u201d  Fort Nelson fire crews may be aided by under an inch of rain forecast Wednesday night and through Thursday evening. But that is far from the amount of precipitation needed to offset drought conditions and extinguish the fires, the British Columbia Wildfire Service said. \u201cIt\u2019s not entirely hopeless, obviously. But the fire is just so close to town that it\u2019s hard to think anything but the worst,\u201d Spenrath said. Extraordinarily dry conditions are also posing challenges for fire personnel battling a blaze that has come within a mile of the Cranberry Portage community in western Manitoba. About 580 people have been evacuated and there is no estimated time for their return. \u201cBecause the conditions are so extremely dry up there, the fires burned down deep,\u201d Earl Simmons, the director of the Manitoba Wildfire Service, told CBC. \u201cSo the firefighters have to get in there and dig really deep into the ground to put it out. And we\u2019re not just talking a few inches, we\u2019re talking meters into the ground in spots.\u201d The dry conditions driving Canada\u2019s wildfires are aggravated by warming conditions caused by human-driven climate change. \u201cThis region has experienced multiple years of drought, with a below normal snowpack this past winter,\u201d said Ben Boghean, fire behavior specialist for the BC Wildfire Service. \u201cAs a result of this, our forests in the Fort Nelson zone are very receptive\u00a0to new fire ignitions and rapid rates of spread.\u201d Declining snow, increasing temperatures and worsening droughts are all hallmarks of climate change and are projected to keep driving larger and more intense fires across Canada,\u00a0according to Environment Canada.

{"id": "2024_05_16_asia_south-korea-space-out-competition-intl-hnk", "text": "More than 100 people gathered silently on yoga mats over the weekend to do absolutely nothing, in a Seoul event that is part physical challenge, part art piece, and part respite from South Korea\u2019s hyper-competitive society. The annual Space-out competition, held on Sunday, finds who\u2019s best at zoning out for 90 minutes without falling asleep, checking their phone or talking. Participants\u2019 heart rates are monitored, while onlookers vote for their 10 favorite contestants. Whoever has the most stable heart rate among the 10 takes home the trophy. Among those taking part was speed skater Kwak Yoon-gy, a double Olympic silver medalist. \u201cI tried out for the Olympics five times and have never taken a proper rest while training for 30 years,\u201d said the 34-year-old short-track specialist, who took third place. \u201cI heard this place is where I can clear my mind and rest at least during this time, so I came here thinking, \u2018Wow, this is what I needed so much.\u2019\u201d More than 4,000 people applied to participate in the competition, hosted by the city government. The 117 contestants selected ranged from a child in second grade to people in their 60s. For many participants, it was a way to recover from burnout and stress, often from their work, in a country with high academic stress and extreme pressure to succeed. \u201cI usually had a lot of worries and stress, so I applied [to participate] because I thought it would be nice to blow away such stress and worries by spacing out in the competition,\u201d said 26-year-old YouTuber Kim Seok-hwan. This year marks the tenth anniversary of the Space-out competition, founded by a visual artist, who goes by the pseudonym Woopsyang, after she suffered severe burnout.  \u201cI wondered why I was so anxious about doing nothing,\u201d she recalled, adding that that\u2019s when she realized her anxiety came from comparing herself to other people leading busy lives. \u201cIn fact, those people could also be wanting to space out and do nothing like me,\u201d Woopsyang said. \u201cSo, I created a competition thinking that it would be nice to pause all together at the same place at the same time.\u201d Competitive idling \u201coverturns the social convention that spacing out is a waste of time in today\u2019s busy society and turns it into a valuable activity,\u201d she said. \u201cThis contest tells you that spacing out is no longer a waste of time but a time that you really need.\u201d The competition is also performance art, she said. \u201cAlthough the contestants are staying still inside the competition venue, the audience is constantly moving around,\u201d Woopsyang said, adding her goal was to \u201ccreate a visual contrast between a group that does nothing and a group that is busy.\u201d Since the first Space-out competition was held in Seoul in 2014, it has expanded internationally, with contests taking place in various cities such as Beijing, Rotterdam, Taipei, Hong Kong and Tokyo. This year\u2019s competition in Seoul was won by freelance announcer Kwon So-a, who works multiple jobs, and took home a trophy shaped like the Auguste Rodin sculpture \u201cThe Thinker.\u201d \u201cEspecially here in Korea, it\u2019s such a competitive country, where people think that if they do nothing that they are a little behind,\u201d Kwon, 35, said. \u201cI think everyone has to have their own pace and sometimes just slow down.\u201d Doing nothing is \u201cgood for your mental health as well as your physical health because your body has to relax, but your body can only relax when your brain relaxes,\u201d she added. \u201cFor both of these reasons, people should space out.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/asia/south-korea-space-out-competition-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Hakh said the first alleged incident occurred during a business meeting when Dharamlall was Guyana\u2019s senior minister of regional development. \u201cThe fact that he is still in that party is mind boggling to me,\u201d Hakh said.

Dharamlall rejected the allegations in a statement posted on his Facebook page, saying \u201cI wish to categorically and most vehemently deny each and every one of the allegations made.\u201d He accused Hakh of being on a \u201ccampaign to tarnish my reputation,\u201d claiming that \u201cher demeanor towards me changed fundamentally after I rebuffed her advances and spurned her attempts to engage in an intimate relationship.\u201d CNN has reached out to Dharamlall for comment and has contacted the office of Guyana President Irfaan Ali. Dharamlall resigned from Guyana\u2019s cabinet and parliament last year after an indigenous teenage girl accused him of rape in an unrelated incident, which he has denied. The girl later withdrew the claim according to officials and no charges were filed, President Ali said\u202fin a video statement\u202flast July. He emphasized at the time that his government had \u201callowed the system to work. We have not intervened; from day one,\u201d apparently referencing public criticism over how the girl\u2019s case was handled by authorities. Her withdrawal however was seen by some as a sign of government corruption, with the public speculating her family had been paid off. In a March statement, Guyanese women\u2019s rights group Red Thread criticized officials for failing the accuser. \u201cIt is of great concern that the public nature of this complaint, the powerful political status of the suspect, the discontinuance of the matter at this early stage and the haste with which this investigation was ended, will reinforce the perception of impunity, and inevitably discourage other victims of sexual violence from coming forward,\u201d it wrote. \u2018Violated against my will\u2019 Hakh, who was seen as a rising star in Guyana, said she was first assaulted by Dharamlall during what was supposed to be a meeting about her taking a role as a regional executive officer in September 2020. She alleged that Dharamlall took the then-25-year-old into his bedroom, disrobed and forcibly performed oral sex on her without her consent in the Anna Regina State House, a town on the country\u2019s coast. Hakh told reporters on Friday that she told Dharamlall to stop several times, saying she is a lesbian and \u201cthis is not something I came here expecting to do and can\u2019t offer anything.\u201d \u201cI was violated against my will by a man who exploited my situation and tried to entrap me in a compromising situation due to my future contract with the ministry,\u201d she said. Hakh also alleged that a second incident took place in 2021, in the Cummings Lodge neighborhood on the outskirts of Georgetown, when she says she met Dharamlall to discuss several grievances she had with the ministry of local government. During their meeting, Hakh alleges Dharamlall tried to remove her clothes. Hakh told CNN she didn\u2019t file a police report in 2020 or 2021 due to fears of police corruption and that she would be shunned publicly and within her family, which she says did business with Dharamlall. \u201cI knew I was going up against something that was dangerous and my whole strategy was that if I made a report that was preemptive, and it didn\u2019t go anywhere, I automatically had no credibility,\u201d she told the press conference on Friday, adding that she finally filed a police report on May 9. Hakh said she also filed cyberbullying charges against Dharamlall on May 8.\u202f CNN has contacted Guyanese police for comment. Hakh said she decided to go public with her allegation because \u201cI need to give victims the strength to know that they\u2019re not alone, and that there is no shame in what happened to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/americas/guyana-nigel-dharamlall-sexual-assault-allegations-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_sport_scottie-scheffler-profile-pga-championship-spt-intl", "text": "Scottie Scheffler is a man well-accustomed to making global headlines, but almost never for events beyond the confines of the golf course. The extraordinary scenes that saw the world No.1 arrested outside Kentucky\u2019s Valhalla Golf Club were rendered even more remarkable given his background. This is a golfer, a new father, who has been dominating his sport in unassuming fashion. A devout Christian, he once said he played the sport because he was \u201ctrying to glorify God.\u201d The 27-year-old is the favorite to win the PGA Championship this weekend and arguably not since Tiger Woods in his prime has a player been so superior on the course. \u2018My identity isn\u2019t a golf score\u2019 Born in Ridgewood, New Jersey, but a Dallas native since the age of 6, Scheffler burst onto the golf scene by winning a flurry of junior titles. In 2014, at 17, as an amateur he made a hole-in-one and the cut on his first PGA Tour start. After turning professional four years later, Scheffler was crowned the PGA Tour\u2019s Rookie of the Year in 2020 and made a triumphant Ryder Cup debut the following season. Without a PGA Tour victory heading into 2022, by April of that year he was a four-time victor, the world No. 1 and \u2013 thanks to a dominant display at The Masters \u2013 a major champion. Scheffler coasted to victory at Augusta National that year, a marked contrast to his stress before the final round. \u201cOverwhelmed,\u201d the University of Texas alumni had \u201ccried like a baby\u201d that morning, he later admitted. It was a conversation with wife, Meredith, that helped steady the golfer, he said. The high-school sweethearts had married in 2020, and Scheffler paid tribute to her and his Christian faith after easing into his first green jacket. \u201cThe reason why I play golf is I\u2019m trying to glorify God and all that He\u2019s done in my life.So for me, my identity isn\u2019t a golf score,\u201d Scheffler, who met his current caddie Ted Scott in Bible study, told reporters. \u201cAll I\u2019m trying to do is glorify God and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here \u2026 it\u2019s not about a golf score.\u201d \u2018I feel like I live two separate lives\u2019 Scheffler\u2019s efforts at Augusta helped him to be subsequently crowned the PGA Tour Player of the Year in 2022, a title he defended after a stellar 2023 campaign that saw him tally another two wins. That included a win at The Players Championship, often dubbed \u201cthe fifth major,\u201d in which Scheffler\u2019s 88-year-old grandmother Mary followed him on the course for all 72 holes, achieving internet fame in the process. \u201cGrandma and I are not big on social media, so we actually only found out the other day that she went viral, whatever that must mean,\u201d Scheffler told CNN Sport\u2019s Don Riddell earlier this year. In his winner\u2019s news conference, Scheffler had outlined his celebratory plans to head to his grandmother\u2019s nearby home for dessert.\u00a0It reinforced the world No. 1\u2019s image as the self-effacing star of the PGA Tour, a perception he is content to endorse. Scheffler\u2019s prolific early career has rocketed him to eighth on the all-time list of career earnings on the PGA Tour, not even halfway through his fifth year on the circuit. Yet despite his $61 million in winnings, as recently as 2022 he still drove the same Chevrolet Suburban that his father bought for him when he was in college, clocking some 175,000 miles in the car. Asked by Riddell about his flashiest purchase, Scheffler settled on his home in Dallas. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t really describe my house as extravagant, but that\u2019s definitely our most expensive purchase,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I live two separate lives. I have my life when I\u2019m out here on the road and you\u2019re playing golf in front of people and I\u2019ve got to do interviews and stuff like that. But then when I go home and I go about my life, golf\u2019s not really that crazy of a popular sport. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m quarterback for the [Dallas] Cowboys or anything like that. \u201cSo living life around home is pretty easy for us. Not much has really changed on the home front. But out here, yeah, things have changed a significant amount.\u201d It was a somewhat bittersweet 2023 season, however, as Scheffler narrowly missed out on adding to his major haul before suffering a painful defeat with Team USA at the Ryder Cup, including a match loss so catastrophic in proportion that it left Scheffler in tears. \u2018Family always comes first\u2019 Yet those scenes in Rome seemed a lifetime away after Scheffler\u2019s start to 2024. He has won four times in his last five starts, including a commanding victory at The Arnold Palmer Invitational and a historic first-ever defense of The Players  a week later. Yet the pick of the bunch was a second Masters triumph last month. Scheffler had vowed to leave the tournament if Meredith went into labor but did not receive the call, leaving him a clear run at another green jacket. \u201cMy buddies told me this morning, my victory was secure on the cross,\u201d he said after winning. \u201cI believe that today\u2019s plans were already laid out many years ago, and I could do nothing to mess up those plans. I have been given a gift of this talent, and I use it for God\u2019s glory. That\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d The couple welcomed their first child, Bennett, last week, but not before Scheffler lifted one more trophy, at the RBC Heritage. His 10th PGA Tour title, it made him the first golfer since Woods in 2006 to win a PGA Tour event the week after triumphing at a major. To put his supremacy into context, the world ranking points gap between Scheffler (629.6) and his closest chaser Rory McIlroy (344.4) following that victory was wider than that between the Northern Irishman and world No. 784, Woods (4.64), who had then-made just five competitive appearances since the start of 2023. Despite his recent transition into fatherhood, Scheffler shrugged off any concerns of a lack of preparation ahead of his pursuit of a second consecutive major at this week\u2019s PGA Championship, having relished his time away from the fairways. \u201cSitting at home with the girl I dated in high school with our child and then the green jacket sitting in the closet is a pretty insane feeling, and I just wanted to be as thankful as possible,\u201d he said ahead of the tournament. A level of disruption was always on the cards at Valhalla, with caddie, Scott, scheduled to leave Louisville to attend his daughter\u2019s high school graduation during Saturday\u2019s third round. And as the overwhelming tournament favorite, few would be surprised to see Scheffler at the center of attention in Valhalla. Nobody though, could have foreseen the developments that put him there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/sport/scottie-scheffler-profile-pga-championship-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_europe_russia-ukraine-cross-border-kharkiv-intl", "text": "Russian forces\u00a0have made two cross-border assaults inside northern Ukraine, according to information from Ukrainian sources and officials, in what President Volodymyr Zelensky is calling a \u201cnew wave of counteroffensive actions\u201d by Russia. In the first development, Russian soldiers\u00a0penetrated\u00a0at least one kilometer towards the town of Vovchansk, a Ukrainian military source told CNN. The aim, the source said, \u201cwas to get 10 km deep and create a buffer zone at the border to secure Russian territory from feeling the war.\u201d In an official statement, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry said Russian soldiers supported by armored vehicles had moved across the border at about 5 a.m. Friday, following a day of stepped-up attacks on the border area with guided aerial bombs and artillery. The statement added that Ukrainian reserve units had been deployed to strengthen defenses in the area. On Saturday, local authorities said more than 20 air glide KAB bombs had been launched at the town and its surrounding settlements. The region\u2019s governor Oleh Syniehubov said two civilians were killed when the bombs hit private houses. A second Ukrainian source with direct knowledge of frontline developments told CNN that Russian forces had also penetrated 5 kilometers inside Ukraine towards the village of Krasne, which lies about 75 km along the border, west of Vovchansk. The source said the Russian ground assault towards Krasne was carried out by four Russian battalions - about 2,000 men. Ukrainian officials have not given much information about the second Russian push, though Ukraine\u2019s General Staff, in its Friday evening update, did note Russian attacks in the area of Krasne and two neighboring villages. It is also noteworthy that DeepStateMap, a Ukrainian monitoring group which updates frontline developments daily, showed four villages next to each other - including Krasne - in the grey area, representing territory currently contested rather than under full Ukrainian control. DeepStateMap also noted on its Telegram channel that the number of Russian forces deployed in the two cross-border pushes was not enough for a deeper advance into Ukrainian territory, but it also drew attention to the fact Moscow has many more troops positioned along the border - estimated to be around 40,000. Asked about developments, Zelensky did not downplay their seriousness but said Ukraine\u2019s military had been expecting such a move. \u201cRussia launched a new wave of counteroffensive actions in [northern Kharkiv region]. Ukraine met them there with our troops, brigades and artillery,\u201d he told reporters early Friday afternoon. \u201cBut our military and military command were aware of this and anticipated their forces to meet the enemy with fire. Now there is a fierce battle in this area [\u2026] I think as of now we have stopped the enemy with artillery fire,\u201d Zelensky said. In an address Saturday evening local time, Zelensky said Ukraine was \u201cstrengthening our positions\u201d and adding forces to the Kharkiv region. Residents of border villages have been told to evacuate by authorities. National police posted photos and a video on social media showing officers helping people pack their belongings into police vehicles ahead of being driven to safer locations. A total of 1,775 people have so far been evacuated from Kharkiv region, a day after Russia\u2019s surprise assault, the head of the region\u2019s military administration said Saturday. The developments mark the most serious cross-border ground assault by Russia since Ukraine re-captured the northern Kharkiv region in the late summer of 2022, after it was first taken by Russia in the opening weeks of its full-scale invasion. It also comes after several months of increased Russian air attacks on the city of Kharkiv, which have knocked out all the city\u2019s power-generating capacity, as well as its sub-stations. Governor Syniehubov insisted the latest Russian ground assaults did not put the city, which lies just 30 km south from the Russian border, under heightened risk. \u201cThe enemy group does not pose a threat to Kharkiv city, its forces are only enough for provocations in the northern direction.\u201d However, analysts note that if Russian forces were able to push much further south, that could bring the northern edge of the city within range of Russian artillery, which can fire about 20 km.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/europe/russia-ukraine-cross-border-kharkiv-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_africa_meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam", "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on what was officially dubbed a 3-day private visit to Nigeria, yet it unfolded with all the grandeur and attention typically reserved for royal tours. Their first day saw them receive a red-carpet welcome complete with cultural dancers following their arrival in the Nigerian capital\u00a0of\u00a0Abuja, where they kicked off a multi-day mental health summit at Lightway Academy. There, they also unveiled a partnership between their Archewell Foundation and the\u00a0GEANCO Foundation to provide students with school supplies and menstrual products. The pair had been invited to the West African nation by the country\u2019s highest-ranking military official, Christopher Musa. After meeting him at the\u00a0Nigerian Defence Headquarters, Meghan signed a guest book thanking officials for \u201cwelcoming me home.\u201d Despite the private nature of their visit, the couple\u2019s itinerary resembled previous official tours they carried out before stepping back as senior working royals in 2020. They were warmly received everywhere they went, with Nigerians showcasing their famed hospitality. The couple were showered with gifts, including\u00a0a touching portrait of a young Harry with his mum. For both Nigeria and the Sussexes, this visit held significant weight. It was an opportunity for Nigeria to demonstrate its capability to host such high-profile guests and dispel any doubts raised by skeptics, especially considering the country\u2019s standing in the eyes of the UK\u2019s Foreign Office as one of the most dangerous countries to visit in the world. Nigeria has security issues with a terrorist insurgency in the northeast and northwest.\u00a0However, it is a huge country \u2014\u00a0 larger than the US state of Texas\u00a0 \u2014 and the other areas\u00a0visited by the royal couple over the past several days are relatively safe. Meanwhile, for Prince Harry and Meghan, this marked their first major trip to Africa since relinquishing\u00a0their official royal duties. It was a chance for them to engage in a hearts-and-minds charm offensive, which they executed with aplomb. Meghan, in particular, embraced exploring her Nigerian ancestry\u00a0after discovering several years ago\u00a0that she is 43% Nigerian\u00a0through a genealogy test. On Saturday, she co-hosted a women\u2019s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, for about 50 leading women from across Nigerian society and politics, business, media, and culture. During a panel discussion, moderated by Nigerian media mogul Mo Abudu, the duchess\u00a0spoke passionately about uncovering\u00a0her Nigerian roots and its significance to her own identity. She described Nigeria as \u201cmy country,\u201d adding\u00a0that \u201cbeing African American, part of it is not knowing so much about your lineage or background, where you come from specifically. And it was exciting \u2026 to discover more and understand what that really means.\u201d It was here that Meghan\u2019s natural ability to connect really shone through. She chatted\u00a0effortlessly with attendees, posed\u00a0for selfies and engaged\u00a0in heartfelt conversations. At another event on Sunday at the prestigious Delborough Hotel in Lagos\u00a0- where the great and good of Nigerian society had gathered to welcome the couple\u00a0-\u00a0she appeared visibly moved when three powerful traditional rulers honored her with royal titles. The Obi of Onitsha, His Majesty Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe christened Meghan \u201cAda Mazi,\u201d which means \u201cthe daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace.\u201d While, the Oluwo of Iwoland, southwest, Nigeria,\u00a0Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi christened her with the Yoruba name of \u201cAdetokunbo\u201d which means \u201croyalty from across the seas.\u201d Their engagements during the three-day visit were centered around their core passions:\u00a0sports rehabilitation,\u00a0mental health, and women\u2019s empowerment. For Harry\u2019s part, the duke\u00a0demonstrated his compassion and connection to his late mother, Princess Diana, as he visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kaduna, 150 miles from Abuja. His first stop was to drop in on the governor of Kaduna state, Senator Uba Sani, where he was again welcomed by a troupe of dancers and a red carpet.\u00a0Governor Sani sat opposite him and praised Harry as a \u201csymbol of courage,\u201d and \u201cpraised his service to his country.\u201d He added, \u201cPlease give our regards to the Duchess of Sussex, Princess Meghan.\u201d Harry toured about six wards at the Nigerian Army Reference\u00a0Hospital and met young men recuperating from their injuries. Many had been shot, ambushed by Boko Haram, or lost limbs due to blasts. One moment captured by photographer Misan Harriman, showing Harry holding a wounded soldier lying on the hospital bed resonated deeply and went viral on social media. Corporal Yusef, 23, who had been shot through the knee, spoke with the duke, who\u00a0asked him about his rehab. \u201cAre you going to try for the Invictus Games team? Are you preparing for that?\u2026 We will see you there,\u201d Harry said. Their visit also extended to cultural experiences, such as witnessing a vibrant dance performance and a polo match at the historic Lagos Polo Club. Polo holds special significance for Harry and the event provided a platform to showcase his longstanding commitment to the sport and its charitable endeavors. Amid the festivities, the couple expressed gratitude for Nigeria\u2019s warm reception.\u00a0As they bid farewell to Nigeria, Meghan declared: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to come back!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/africa/meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Dressed as a yellow water lily\u00a0she twirled, sashayed and even did the splits in front of outgoing president Tsai Ing-wen, all while lip-syncing to Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cMarry the Night\u201d and Taiwanese singer Huang Fei\u2019s \u201cChase, Chase, Chase.\u201d \u201cThis is probably the first presidential office in the world to host a drag show,\u201d Nymphia told Tsai after her performance and thanked Tsai for her service. \u201cThank you for your contributions to this country, so that I could grow up to be like this today,\u201d Nymphia added with tears in her eyes. \u201cThank you for your eight years of dedication, becoming our Taiwan mother.\u201d Taiwan is a vibrant democracy of 24 million people that Beijing\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims as its territory \u2013 despite never having controlled it. But it is not recognized as an independent country by most governments in the world and has lost a string of diplomatic allies to Beijing in recent years. Tsai and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have championed LGBTQ+ rights, making it a more liberal bastion in conservative Asia.\u00a0The self-ruled island is one of the most progressive societies for sexual minorities.\u00a0In a first for the region, Taiwan legalized same-sex marriage in 2019.\u00a0Across the strait, China has been fast moving the opposite direction under Chinese leader Xi Jinping,\u00a0with crackdowns\u00a0on LGBTQ groups and content. Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, hosts East Asia\u2019s largest Pride march every October. Last year, Vice President Lai Ching-te, who will take office on Monday as Taiwan\u2019s next president, became the most senior government leader ever to attend the celebration. Reactions to the spectacle on social media were largely positive. \u201cThank you for allowing us to be at the forefront so that we can proudly show the world how free we are,\u201d said one\u00a0user commenting on Nymphia\u2019s performance on Tsai\u2019s official Facebook account, which concluded with her singing to popstar Jolin Tsai\u2019s gender equality hit \u201cWomxnly\u201d and joined by five of her fellow drag queens. \u201cI wanted to cry at the end; Taiwan has come such a long way from a time where we were called feminine, to having same sex marriage legalized and drag queens performing at the presidential palace today,\u201d wrote another. Not everyone was fan. One user wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t know what drag queens are, but I don\u2019t want my kids to be like this.\u201d While on China\u2019s Weibo, some took issue of the performance taking place in front of the bust of Sun Yat Sen, who is often called the father of modern China and whose legacy is claimed by the governments of both China and Taiwan. Nymphia, the alter-ego of Taiwanese American dressmaker Leo Tsao, was the first East Asian to win \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d and she made it a point during her time on the show to raise awareness and appreciation of her cultural background. On the show\u2019s finale she wore a dramatic outfit inspired by bubble tea, one of Taiwan\u2019s biggest cultural exports, and many of her outfits referenced Asian heritage. Nymphia is a well-established artist on Taiwan\u2019s thriving drag scene, known for over-the-top outfits that she creates herself. She has performed in Taiwanese temples and undertook a photoshoot at wet markets dressed as bananas in various stages of ripeness. The tropical fruit is a common motif in Nymphia\u2019s creations that\u2019s become a trademark of sorts. It\u2019s a cheeky reclamation of the sometimes derogatory term used to describe Asians growing up in the West, being yellow on the outside but white on the inside. As she accepted her crown and sceptre on \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d she said: \u201cTo those who feel like they don\u2019t belong, just remember to live fearlessly and have courage to live your truth \u2013 and Taiwan this is for you!\u201d Tsai told Nymphia after her performance: \u201cI want to thank you for demonstrating your fearless beauty, standing up and breaking down barriers,\u201d adding that her story \u201cwill bring courage to many young people in Taiwan, so they stay fearless and stay true to their hearts.\u201d Additional reporting by Reuters.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/style/drag-queen-nymphia-wind-taiwan-president-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
