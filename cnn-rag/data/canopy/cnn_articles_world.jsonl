But we are not there yet. We are talking to the Israelis, trying to explain and reach a consensus,\u201d the official said. The official said that coordination between the two countries on the Rafah operation, which Egypt has publicly opposed, \u201cdidn\u2019t go well. And that\u2019s why we warned Israel of dire repercussions.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Israeli foreign ministry for comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Egypt was considering downgrading ties with Israel. The two countries had been at loggerheads this week after Israel began a limited military operation in Rafah last week and seized the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt. Egypt subsequently refused to coordinate aid deliveries into Gaza with Israel. The official told CNN earlier that aid deliveries to Palestinians could be halted because Egypt can\u2019t guarantee the safety of its trucks, as they may come under attack by Palestinian militants targeting Israeli troops. The top diplomats in both countries traded blame over the closure of the Rafah crossing as aid deliveries through the key land crossing halted. Rafah had been the entry point for nearly a quarter of the relief entering the Gaza Strip before Israel\u2019s operation. On Tuesday, the US State Department warned that only 50 humanitarian aid trucks made it through to Gaza on Sunday, down from hundreds per day in previous weeks, adding that the number is \u201cnot nearly enough.\u201d Israel placed the blame for the crossing\u2019s closure on Egypt. In a statement on X, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz on Tuesday said he had spoken to UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock \u201cabout the need to persuade Egypt to reopen the Rafah crossing to allow the continued delivery of international humanitarian aid to Gaza.\u201d The Israeli minister\u2019s comments drew backlash from Egypt\u2019s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, who rejected Katz\u2019 statement, calling it a \u201cpolicy of distorting the facts.\u201d Shoukry stated Egypt\u2019s \u201ccategorical rejection of the policy of distorting the facts and disavowing responsibility followed by the Israeli side,\u201d adding that Katz\u2019s remarks are \u201cdesperate attempts by Israel to hold Egypt responsible for the unprecedented humanitarian crisis facing the Gaza Strip.\u201d The crisis, Shoukry said, \u201cis a direct result of indiscriminate Israeli attacks against the Palestinians for more than seven months.\u201d Israel has said that it will never let Hamas take control of the border crossing. The Egyptian official told CNN that Egypt didn\u2019t want Hamas to be in control either, but that Israeli control is also unacceptable. \u201cIt needs to be in the hands of the Palestinians,\u201d the official said, adding that the crossing could be placed under the control of the Palestinian civil defense. \u201cThese are neither Hamas nor Fatah (a rival party to Hamas).\u201d Israeli troops at the Egyptian border Adding to tensions are Israeli military movements that have seen the Jewish state\u2019s tanks and soldiers operating on Egypt\u2019s doorstep, causing outrage in Egyptian media for alleged violations of the 1979 peace treaty signed between the two countries. Israeli troops have crossed into an area that was demilitarized in that treaty four decades ago \u2013 including parts of a border zone known as the Philadelphi Corridor, where the Rafah crossing lies. Videos released by the Israeli military last week showed Israeli flags raised on the Palestinian side of the frontier. The Philadelphi Corridor is a 14-kilometer (about 8.7 mile) long and 100-meter-wide strip of land running along the border between Gaza and Egypt. The corridor is key to the 1979 treaty, a pact that saw Egypt and Israel end their enmity and which restricted the number of troops each side can place near the other\u2019s territory. Changes to the security presence in the area must be made with mutual agreement. Over the years, amendments to security agreements between Egypt and Israel have allowed Cairo to boost its security presence in the Sinai Peninsula, which borders Israel. Israel has not disclosed the scale of its military presence in Rafah. But according to the 1979 peace treaty, which was drawn up before Israel unilaterally withdrew troops from Gaza in 2005, Israel is allowed a limited force of four infantry battalions in Zone D \u2013 where the Philadelphi Corridor lies. These battalions may consist of up to 180 armored personnel vehicles and a total of four thousand personnel. The presence of tanks, artillery and anti-aircraft missiles, except individual surface-to-air missiles, isn\u2019t allowed, the treaty says. It is unclear how many troops Israel now has stationed across the border in Rafah. Asked by CNN about the scale of its military operation in the city, and whether it was coordinated with the Egyptians, the IDF declined to comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/middleeast/egypt-warns-israel-dire-repercussions-rafah-operation-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

The girls decided to step down and give (up) their dream of a lifetime \u2014 a crown, a national title. Why would two girls decide to give that up?\u201d It is the first time the mothers have spoken publicly about the ordeal, which roiled the pageant world last week. It marked the first time a titleholder in Miss USA or Miss Teen USA had resigned, and both happened in quick succession. On Instagram, UmaSofia Srivastava said her values \u201cno longer aligned\u201d with those of the organization, while Noelia Voigt cited her mental health, though her long, cryptic statement seemed to spell out \u201cI am silenced\u201d in the first 11 sentences. Speaking on Good Morning America, Jackeline declined to answer whether the supposed secret message was intentional. But responding to whether she feels as if her daughter was silenced, she said \u201cShe is, and she would be the rest of her life if this NDA is not (lifted).\u201d Voigt\u2019s resignation letter to Miss USA, obtained and published by CNN on Saturday, revealed a range of allegations against Miss USA CEO Laylah Rose, including a \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d rife with \u201cbullying.\u201d According to the letter, Rose is \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control, the antithesis of women\u2019s empowerment, that is\u2026unsafe for future titleholders and employees,\u201d Voigt wrote. Among the issues, Voigt claimed that Rose failed to provide her with appropriate travel accommodations or an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d leading to an incident where she was left alone in a car with a stranger at a parade in Sarasota, Florida, where an unnamed man sexually harassed her, she wrote. Her mother, who was with her in Sarasota, saw her just after the alleged incident occurred, she said in the interview. \u201cI saw Noelia so stressed out, and I said, \u2018What happened?\u2019 and she said, \u2018Mom, get in the car,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe told Noelia, \u2018Are you into old men with money?\u2019 and made Noelia very, very uncomfortable.\u201d Rose did not apologize, according to Jackeline. In her resignation letter, Voigt said that Rose told her that the organization \u201ccannot prevent people saying things to you at public appearances\u201d and that it is \u201cunfortunately, part of the role.\u201d Barbara Srivastava said that during their reigning year, the titleholders were \u201cill-treated, abused, bullied and cornered.\u201d Jackeline called for the Miss Universe Organization, which owns Miss USA, to \u201cspeak to us or apologize.\u201d The parent organization, owned by JKN Global Group, has been silent over the past week. The Miss USA and Miss Universe Organization did not immediately return a request for comment, and did not respond to CNN\u2019s earlier requests for comments on Friday. For now, the mothers are warning prospective pageant contestants about getting involved with Miss USA. On Wednesday, the runner-up for Miss USA, Savannah Gankiewicz from Hawaii, will step up and take the title in a ceremony. But Miss Teen USA remains open, as the runner-up from 2023, New York\u2019s Stephanie Skinner, declined to be crowned in a public statement on Instagram. CNN has contacted the second runner-up, Miss Pennsylvania Teen Maggie Ross, on whether she will take the title, but no announcement has been made. \u201cLook at what happened to Noelia and UmaSofia. Right now, it\u2019s not the right time to participate,\u201d Jackeline said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want these families and these girls to go through what we\u2019re going through,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/style/miss-usa-mothers-gma/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

It\u2019s devastating that my world title has just been taken away from me.\u201d Hughes has since said on X that she would like a re-match.

{"id": "2024_05_07_tech_apple-unveils-new-ipad-lineup", "text": "Apple is hoping its latest iPad lineup will breathe new life into its sluggish tablet market. In a pre-recorded live streamed event from its Cupertino, California headquarters, the company introduced the latest versions of its iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets, and an all-new Apple Pencil Pro. CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday\u2019s announcement marked \u201cthe biggest day for iPad since its introduction.\u201d At the heart of the new iPad Pro is Apple\u2019s new custom M4 processor, which delivers 4 times the performance as its existing iPad Pro models. Considering Apple\u2019s latest MacBook lineup currently runs on the M3 chip, this is, as Cook put it, an \u201coutrageously powerful chip for AI.\u201d The company is expected to show off its first batch of AI-tools for the iPhone and iPad at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. The latest iPad Pro comes in two sizes: 11 inches and 13 inches. Apple said the 11-inch model is its thinnest yet, at 5.1 mm, and less than a pound. The display combines two OLED panels to maximize brightness. The iPad Pro comes in two finishes, silver and space black. Meanwhile, the iPad Air, for the first time, comes in the same two sizes: an 11-inch ($599) and 13-inch ($799) design. The bigger size, inspired by the iPad Pro with a larger screen, has 30% more screen real estate than the 11-inch display. The iPad Air is powered by Apple\u2019s custom M2 processor with faster GPU and neural engine that\u2019s 50% faster than the previous iPad Air. The company said it better supports AI-powered software. It also features a front-facing landscape camera. Meanwhile, an upgraded Apple Pencil ($129) comes with a new squeeze function that allows users to bring up tools, customize drawing layers of what they\u2019re working on and includes haptic feedback. It also supports Find My to locate the pencil when it inevitably goes missing. Apple also showed off a redesigned Magic Keyboard with a haptic trackpad to make the iPad more like a laptop. Some key apps, including Final Cut, also received substantial upgrades, including the ability to add AI-based audio or edit with AI. The new iPad lineup is available for pre-order starting Tuesday and in stores next week. The event comes just days after Apple reported its iPad revenue of $5.6 billion for its latest quarter, down 17% year over year. However, the company said it expects its iPad business to grow in double digits for the June quarter. Apple also reported last week a first-quarter revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% year over year, as the tech giant continues to struggle with growth challenges, particularly in China, amid an uncertain economic environment. It announced a $110 billion share buyback \u2013 the largest in the company\u2019s history \u2013 as iPhones sales declined 10%. Ben Wood, a chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight, said the unexpected introduction of the iPad Pro\u2019s new M4 chip and its significant performance jumps may be enough to ignite some excitement among consumers. \u201cWhile these new iPads are unlikely to return the category to growth immediately, they represent a much-needed reason to upgrade for customers with aging products,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emphasis on artificial intelligence was palpable with Apple determined to seize back the initiative in this area given the huge focus on this topic by all its rivals over the last 18 months.\u201d On the earnings call last week, Cook teased that generative AI tools could be coming to Apple products in the \u201cweeks ahead,\u201d at a time when it\u2019s currently behind competitors. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/tech/apple-unveils-new-ipad-lineup/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_tech_microsoft-ai-wisconsin", "text": "Microsoft said it is pouring $3.3 billion into building a data hub in Wisconsin that aims to train employees and manufacturers on how to best use artificial intelligence. President Joe Biden will appear at the site in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, on Wednesday to highlight the administration\u2019s efforts to invest in job growth in America. The news comes six years after the Trump administration announced a $10 billion investment by tech manufacturer Foxconn \u2013 with the promise to bring 13,000 jobs to the area \u2013 on the same Wisconsin land, a plan that never materialized. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. Microsoft said it will use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state on generative AI by\u00a02030, thanks in part to a partnership with United Way Wisconsin, United Way Racine and other community partners. It also plans to open a lab on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to help companies and manufacturers infuse the technology into their businesses. Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella earned a master\u2019s degree in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, according to his company profile. In his remarks Wednesday, Biden plans to directly point his finger at Trump for the failed project, according to a White House official. In a statement sent to CNN, Foxconn parent company Hon Hai Technology Group said it \u201ccontinues to grow\u201d in Wisconsin and \u201csupports expansion of technology and innovation to the state.\u201d Foxconn, which said it has invested about $1 billion into the state, still has a major manufacturing site for data servers in Racine County with more than 1,000 employees. It has facilities in 205 locations across 24 countries. \u201cEmployment at Foxconn Wisconsin has grown at least 42% in the three years since 2020,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe have been Racine County\u2019s largest taxpayer in recent years.\u201d The president\u2019s visit to the key battleground state will also present an opportunity for the White House to try to highlight some of the Biden administration\u2019s key first term achievements \u2014 and specifically, funding from legislation like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the so called \u201cChips Act,\u201d which invests in semiconductor chip manufacturing in the United States, that will boost the Badger State. In a fact sheet released by the White House ahead of the president\u2019s visit, the administration says that 177,000 jobs have been added in Wisconsin \u2013 4,000 specifically in Racine \u2013 since the president took office in 2021. Last year, Biden signed an executive order on AI aimed to get entrepreneurs access to technical assistance and resources, help small businesses commercialize AI breakthroughs, and expand grants for AI research in areas such as healthcare and climate change. The White House also introduced an order in 2023 to require AI system developers to share results of their safety tests with the federal government before they are released to the public. Microsoft\u2019s move comes at a time when the government seeks to monitor and regulate the risks of artificial intelligence. In March, Biden urged Congress during his State of the Union address to pass legislation to regulate artificial intelligence, including banning \u201cAI voice impersonation and more.\u201d He said lawmakers need to \u201charness the promise of AI and protect us from its peril,\u201d warning of the technology\u2019s risks to Americans if left unchecked.

{"id": "2024_05_09_europe_missing-woman-henao-spain-husband-arrest-cec", "text": "About 9:30 p.m. on February 2, a man in a helmet entered Ana Maria  Knezevich Henao\u2019s apartment building in an exclusive neighborhood in Madrid. Henao, who was on vacation in Spain from south Florida, was in the building at the time and planning a trip to Barcelona with her friends in three days. A surveillance camera captured the man fastening the building\u2019s lock with duct tape to disable it. He looked straight into the camera as he spray-painted the lens, partially obscuring it. After about an hour in the building, he emerged from the elevator with a suitcase. Henao was reported missing soon after, and no one has seen her since. But the FBI said this week they\u2019ve arrested the mystery man who entered her Madrid apartment building that night: her estranged husband. David Knezevich, 36, was detained at Miami International Airport on Saturday for his alleged involvement in her kidnapping, the latest in an international mystery involving law enforcement officials from two continents. A can of spray paint, security camera footage, stolen license plates and rental car records helped tie him to the crime, according to a criminal complaint obtained by CNN. So did his messages to a woman he\u2019d met on a dating app \u2014 and a Google search by the woman\u2019s mother. Knezevich\u2019s attorney, Kenneth Padowitz, told CNN in February that his client is innocent and \u201chas never been to Spain.\u201d Padowitz declined to comment Wednesday after Knezevich\u2019s arrest.  The couple owned properties in Florida but had separated Knezevich and Henao lived in Florida, where records show they own several properties in Fort Lauderdale.\u00a0They are also listed as CEO and project manager of EOX Technology Solutions Inc., which provides computer support for businesses in south Florida. CNN contacted the company this week but did not immediately get a response. The couple was planning to divorce amid a separation that was contentious because Knezevich did not want to evenly split marital assets, court documents said. But Knezevich\u2019s attorney told CNN in February that their separation was amicable, \u201cwith anticipation of a divorce.\u201d Henao, 40, boarded a flight from Miami to Spain the day after Christmas, court records show. At the time of her disappearance six weeks later, her husband was in his native Serbia and had nothing to do with it, Padowitz said in February. Knezevich had spoken to Spanish police, provided his credit card details and other information and was cooperating in the investigation, the attorney said then. Padowitz is based in Florida. But federal officials said records show Knezevich flew from Miami to Turkey in January and then went to Belgrade, Serbia, where he rented a small Peugeot on January 29. The owner of the rental car agency told investigators that when the car was returned in mid-March, someone had tinted its windows and added a new license plate frame, and it had traveled nearly 4,800 miles, the criminal complaint said. Toll booth cameras captured images of the same model Peugeot, with tinted windows, near Madrid in the late night and early morning of February 2 and 3. It had license plates stolen from another vehicle on the Madrid street where Henao was living, the complaint said. FBI spokesperson James Marshall declined to answer questions this week, citing an ongoing investigation. \u201cWe appreciate the public\u2019s attention to our case and continue to encourage those with information, even if they\u2019re not certain of its value, to come forward,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cTo preserve the integrity and capabilities of the investigation, I cannot share details of the ongoing process.\u201d Her friend received puzzling texts from her phone Henao was last seen on camera entering her building in Madrid\u2019s upscale Salamanca neighborhood on the afternoon of February 2. At 9:27 p.m. that evening, records show the man in the helmet entered the building and tampered with the surveillance camera. He had \u201cphysical characteristics\u201d that resembled her husband, court documents said. Henao, a US citizen originally from Colombia, was in constant communication with her loved ones while overseas. She was planning a trip to Barcelona with her friends on February 5, her brother told CNN, making her sudden lack of contact more concerning. Two days before the trip, her friend Sanna Rameau received a puzzling WhatsApp message from Henao indicating she was running off for a few days with a man she\u2019d just met. The message, seen by CNN, read: \u201cI met someone wonderful!! He has a summer house about 2h (hours) from Madrid. We are going there now and I will spend a few days there. Signal is spotty. I\u2019ll call you when I get back.\u201d The man had approached Henao on the street a day earlier while she was walking, the message said, adding: \u201cAmazing connection. Like I never had before.\u201d Rameau said she\u2019d spoken with Henao by phone hours before she went missing and she had not mentioned meeting a man. Concern grew when Henao did not show up at a Madrid train station for the trip as planned. Spanish firefighters entered her apartment for a welfare check and she was nowhere to be found, court documents said. Her phone, laptop and chargers were also missing. Now federal officials allege the text messages sent from her phone actually came from her husband.\u00a0And they were written with the help of another Colombian woman Knezevich had met on a dating app months earlier, court documents said. On February 3 \u2014 the day after Henao was last seen alive \u2014 Knezevich sent the woman several English sentences to translate into \u201cperfect Colombian,\u201d according to the criminal complaint. He told her it was for a friend in Serbia writing a script that had a Colombian character. The message he sent to the unidentified Colombian woman to translate was the same one sent from Henao\u2019s phone saying she\u2019d met a new guy, court documents said. Investigators also identified other clues Investigators on both sides of the Atlantic searched for clues on what happened to the missing woman and who entered her building that day \u2014 and who might have abducted her. Then everything started coming together. Spanish investigators identified the brand of spray paint used to tamper with the camera and learned that a Madrid retailer had sold the same paint, along with two rolls of duct tape, to a man who resembled Knezevich the same day Henao was last seen, the criminal complaint said. And in a twist of fate, the woman Knezevich met on a dating app told her mother in Bogota about her new suitor, leading to yet another revelation. The woman\u2019s mother Googled his name and saw news reports about his missing wife. She notified her daughter, who realized that the text attributed to Henao before she vanished matched the exact wording of the message she\u2019d helped Knezevich put together, court documents said. Knezevich\u2019s next court hearing is scheduled for Friday. But a key question remains: What happened to his wife?

Beside them, a rescuer lowers their baby brother, 2-year-old Arian, to the rooftop, a sheet tied around his waist that was used to pull him from the raging floodwaters below. \u201cTake it, let\u2019s get take off the rope from his body,\u201d the rescuer says on the video. \u201cBring his mother to hold him in her arms and be warm.\u201d In the past few days, at least 300 people have been killed in flooding in 18 districts across at least three provinces in northern Afghanistan, according to the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme (WFP), with at least 200 injured. Videos show raging torrents of mud washing away mud houses \u2013 and people, their limbs flailing, in the fast-moving brown current, as would-be rescuers watch from\u00a0higher ground, beyond reach. The rescued children, ages 3, 5 and 6, were among eight siblings who were at home with their parents in Folo, in the Bulka district of Baghlan, when the flooding hit. Their uncle Barakatullah, son of Haji Wakil Besmillah, the local school headmaster, told CNN something ominous seemed to be brewing late last week when severe wind swept through the district and neighboring areas, enveloping everything in darkness. \u201cVisibility was so poor that we couldn\u2019t even see each other,\u201d he said. Then the rain started falling gently during Friday prayers \u2013 an unusual event for locals, who say it doesn\u2019t rain very often so high in the mountain region, home to around 10,000 people, he added. As the rain got heavier, suddenly the situation \u201cturned dire.\u201d \u201cPeople fled to higher ground, seeking refuge in mountains and hills. Unfortunately, some individuals who were unable to leave their homes fell victim to the floodwaters,\u201d he said. Aerial photos show belongings piled in plastic bags on rooftops, among them the hooded figures of women forced to cover their entire bodies even in times of disaster. \u201cWomen who were rescued are forced to wear mud-soaked garments, while even infants as young as 2 to 3 months old are clothed in similarly soiled attire,\u201d Barakatullah said. In Folo, more than 100 people are believed to have been killed, he said \u2013 mostly women and children. Some burials began over the weekend, but many more are already believed to be buried deep beneath mud. From drought and hunger to flooding The torrent swept away animals and farmland in an area already facing severe food shortages, according to Timothy Anderson, head of the WFP in Afghanistan. He said the areas hit by floods had already been marked vulnerable to starvation after a difficult summer when searing heat brought drought. \u201cIt was already pretty grim. And now it\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d he told CNN. Most years, locals expect to see flash flooding, he said.\u00a0But this year, it\u2019s been far worse. The loss of the homes and their land is devastating for survivors, who were already among some of the country\u2019s most impoverished people, Anderson said. \u201cWhen people lose a bit of livestock, that\u2019s actually their livelihood,\u201d he said. Road access to the worst affected areas has been cut by floodwaters, forcing the WFP to use donkeys to send in supplies. Within the first day, the WFP had distributed high energy biscuits and food for children. They\u2019re also supporting local bakeries to supply free bread. In the next days, teams will start distributing food to feed families for a month \u2013 what happens next is unclear. Anderson said 17 joint assessment teams are being sent to the area, along with other UN partners.\u00a0He said it\u2019ll take four or five days for the teams to properly examine the impact of the floods on people, and their housing and infrastructure. \u2018Bearing the brunt\u2019 of climate crisis This latest natural disaster comes after drought in Afghanistan, and is being seen as an example of a climate crisis hitting those who have least contributed to rising global temperatures. \u201cThey\u2019re not net emitters of carbon,\u201d said Anderson of the WFP. \u201cThis is a subsistence agriculture community and society. So, they\u2019re bearing the brunt of it, without having necessarily contributed to the issue very much.\u201d He said during the recent dry months, efforts had been made to help the community capture rainfall in dams and irrigation canals to sustain crops. Now those efforts have been washed away, posing another challenge. \u201cThe need is massive, not just in Afghanistan. The world is seeing the impacts of much larger, more severe events, whether that\u2019s drought, rainfalls cyclones,\u201d Anderson said. Richard Bennett, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan said the recent floods \u201care a stark reminder of Afghanistan\u2019s vulnerability to the climate crisis.\u201d And\u00a0in a statement Sunday,\u00a0Teresa Anderson, the Global Climate Justice Lead at ActionAid International, said: \u201cThe climate crisis continues to rear its ugly head.\u201d \u201cWith the latest incident, Afghanistan joins a long list of Global South countries grappling with floods this year,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/asia/afghanistan-flooding-children-rescued-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_tech_tiktok-sues-us-app-ban", "text": "TikTok sued Tuesday to block a US law that could force a nationwide ban of the popular app, following through on legal threats the company issued after President Joe Biden signed the legislation last month. The court challenge sets up a historic legal battle, one that will determine whether US security concerns about TikTok\u2019s links to China can trump the First Amendment rights of TikTok\u2019s 170 million US users. The stakes of the case are existential for TikTok. If it loses, TikTok could be banned from US app stores unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells the app to a non-Chinese entity by mid-January 2025. In its\u00a0petition filed Tuesday at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, TikTok and Bytedance allege the law is unconstitutional because it stifles Americans\u2019 speech and prevents them from accessing lawful information. The petition claims the US government \u201chas taken the unprecedented step of expressly singling out and banning\u201d the short-form video app in an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power. \u201cFor the first time in history,\u201d the petition said, \u201cCongress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than 1 billion people worldwide.\u201d The White House referred questions about TikTok\u2019s legal challenge to the Justice Department, which didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit follows years of US allegations that TikTok\u2019s ties to China could potentially expose Americans\u2019 personal information to the Chinese government. Debate over data sharing TikTok has strongly denied that it has ever given Chinese government officials access to US user data and says it has taken steps to protect that information by hosting the data on servers owned by US tech giant Oracle. Those moves are part of a 90-page draft agreement before a government panel known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multiagency body that has been reviewing TikTok\u2019s US operations since 2019, the petition said. That same draft deal also includes the ability for the US government to shut down TikTok if it or ByteDance \u201cviolate certain obligations under the agreement,\u201d the petition said. But those assurances have not eased US officials\u2019 concerns, which include fears that China could use TikTok\u2019s data to identify intelligence targets, spread propaganda or engage in other forms of covert influence. The US government has not publicly presented any concrete evidence showing Chinese government access of TikTok data to date; US lawmakers have received classified briefings by national security officials behind closed doors, but they have not declassified any materials from those meetings. Reactions to the briefings have been mixed, with one House Republican saying there was \u201cno specific information \u2026 that was well-founded evidence\u201d and one House Democrat saying the issue comes down to a judgment call about curbing \u201cmalign influence\u201d from China. But Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, an advocate for the TikTok legislation, said in remarks on the Senate floor in April that the briefings provided critical insight into the risk TikTok poses. \u201cMany Americans, particularly young Americans, are rightfully skeptical\u201d of the legislation clamping down on TikTok, Warner said in his remarks. \u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019ve not seen what Congress has seen. They\u2019ve not been in the classified briefings that Congress has held, which have delved into more deeply some of the threat posed by the foreign control of TikTok.\u201d In March, those fears culminated in legislation giving TikTok roughly six months to sell or face a US ban. Passed by the House, it stalled in the Senate before an updated version of the bill was fast-tracked and attached to a major foreign aid package benefiting Israel and Ukraine. US policymakers have described the law at issue as a forced divestiture of TikTok, not an outright app ban. TikTok has insisted, however, that a ban would be the only probable outcome if the law is upheld. \u201cThe \u2018qualified divestiture\u2019 demanded by the Act to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States is simply not possible,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s petition said, \u201cnot commercially, not technologically, not legally.\u201d First Amendment implications TikTok and ByteDance called the national security fears at the heart of the TikTok legislation \u201cspeculative and analytically flawed,\u201d adding in the petition that the bill\u2019s swift passage reflects how its congressional authors relied on \u201cspeculation, not \u2018evidence,\u2019 as the First Amendment requires,\u201d to make their case. First Amendment scholars say TikTok\u2019s claims have some merit. The Supreme Court has held, for instance, that the US government cannot prohibit Americans from receiving foreign propaganda if they so choose. Underscoring the point, legislation known as the Berman amendment also forbids US presidents from blocking the free flow of media from foreign countries, even those considered hostile to the United States. \u201cNational security claims should not trump the First Amendment,\u201d said Evelyn Douek, an assistant law professor at Stanford University who studies online platform regulations. \u201cOtherwise, it would make the Constitution a paper tiger. At the very least, the government should be forced to provide evidence for its claims. That said, there is precedent of the [Supreme] Court neglecting these principles, especially in the context of counterterrorism and foreign speech.\u201d TikTok notched some early court victories last year as several US states tried to clamp down on the app, foreshadowing the battle to come over online speech. In Montana, the only state to have passed its own TikTok ban affecting personal devices, a federal judge temporarily blocked the legislation \u2014 saying the state law unconstitutionally \u201charmed [users\u2019] First Amendment rights and cut off a stream of income on which many rely.\u201d The bipartisan nature of the law Biden signed might convince\u00a0the courts of the seriousness of the national security concerns around TikTok, said Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic at Cornell University. Still, Hans said, \u201cwithout public discussion of what exactly the risks are \u2026 it\u2019s difficult to determine why the courts should validate such an unprecedented law.\u201d In addition to potentially infringing on US TikTok users\u2019 speech rights, the federal law TikTok is challenging also implicates the constitutional rights of Apple and Google, whose app stores would be prohibited from carrying TikTok if a ban went into effect. \u201cThis raises concerns about potentially unconstitutional government intrusion into the decisions of these platforms regarding what content to host,\u201d wrote Jennifer Huddleston, a research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, in an op-ed last month. \u201cFurther, it could set a dangerous precedent of government intervention in the online space that many would find anathema in the offline space.\u201d The US government and more than half of US states have restricted TikTok from government devices, however, reflecting the authority that governments have to manage their own property. Internationally, TikTok has been banned on government devices in Canada, the United Kingdom and at the European Commission. The app has been subject to a complete ban in the entire country of India since 2020. Some US officials have been trying to ban TikTok from the United States since 2020, when former President Donald Trump moved to block the app by executive order. (Trump has since reversed his position, saying a TikTok ban would only help Meta, a company Trump blames for his 2020 election defeat.) The outcome of the TikTok case is likely to have far-reaching consequences for how the US government regulates technology and other foreign speech, Douek said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to think of this not in terms of just TikTok, but in terms of all foreign platforms in the future,\u201d Douek said. \u201cIn a globalized world, this issue is going to come up again and again. And if the government is handed the power to simply ban a platform based on what seems at this stage mere concerns about potential for future harm, rather than actual clear and present dangers, that would be extremely worrying.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/tech/tiktok-sues-us-app-ban/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_africa_from-anonymity-to-empowerment-the-journey-of-diary-of-a-naija-girl", "text": "In the bustling world of social media, where everyone strives to be heard, few voices rise above the noise to truly make an impact. One such voice is that of Ifedayo Agoro, the founder of Diary of a Naija Girl (DANG), a platform that started as a simple Instagram page and has since grown into a thriving community of nearly one million followers across social media sites. The journey for the Nigerian former oil and gas executive began with a simple idea in 2006 \u2013 to share her stories and opinions authentically and without fear or shame. \u201cI realized the culture of shame had grown so much and I thought to myself, \u2018This is not how I grew up\u2026 I\u2019m gonna tell my story, the good, the bad, and the ugly, and I will not be ashamed,\u2019\u201d Agoro recalled. Candid conversations Through candid conversations and shared narratives, members of the DANG community confront taboo topics such as gender-based violence, discrimination, body image, mental health, and reproductive rights. \u201cWhat drives the content is the platform\u2019s values; to live our best life, never be suppressed by shame and our experiences, and learn and unlearn everything. Whatever falls under these values is what we put out,\u201d she explained. Agoro, 40, champions the message of self-worth and autonomy, inspiring women to embrace their individuality and make decisions based on their desires, not societal expectations. \u201cWomen are beginning to understand that they are worthy anyway, with marriage or without it,\u201d she said. She is often accused of being anti-men and marriage and Agoro was keen to clarify her stance on relationships. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-marriage\u2026 I just know that my life is still full without it. \u201cHusbands would write to me that I\u2019m spoiling their wives and teaching them to be rude and not submissive. Men would throw jabs at me on Twitter\u2026 they were just not happy that I was expressing\u2026 what other women are too scared to say,\u201d she told CNN. Although she admits the vitriol has lessened considerably. \u201cI would attribute that to not backing down. I\u2019m a person that\u2019s just going to do what I want to do.\u201d Undeterred by detractors, Agoro continues to amplify women\u2019s voices and create a safe space for women to share without limits. This ultimately led Agoro to create the #DangAfterHours series, a no-holds-barred discussion on sex and sexuality, a real taboo subject in Nigeria, Agoro says. \u201cWomen in Nigeria are not really able to talk about sex without being labeled promiscuous. I want to talk about sex in a hilarious way, we can learn from it and bond on that topic. The response shows that the conversation needed to happen.\u201d Creating impact Over the years, Agoro has used the DANG platform to transform the lives of hundreds of women. A self-described \u201cempath\u201d she finds herself getting involved in the lives of the women who reach her for help and advice, often \u201cbawling her eyes out,\u201d over their triumphs and tribulations, she says. However, one moment stands out for her. \u201cA few years ago, there was a lady who was sick in the hospital in Lagos and at the time doctors were on strike. She sent me a message saying \u2018I\u2019m losing blood, pregnant and sick. There\u2019s no one to attend to me. Please help me I don\u2019t want to die.\u2019\u201d Angered, Agoro says she took to her social media and posted about the woman\u2019s predicament. \u201cAfter I posted that, the office of the then First Lady reached me and resolved the issue immediately and the lady was attended to quickly and her tests were done. That was the day I realized the power of what we were doing.\u201d When she started posting her story on Instagram, Agoro initially chose to remain anonymous, to avoid the pressure of public scrutiny. However, as her platform gained traction, she confronted a pivotal moment when her identity was threatened to be exposed. Rather than succumbing to fear, she decided to reveal herself. \u201cI initially didn\u2019t see the need to put my face\u2026 and when the platform became bigger\u2026 I realized that this may not be sustainable. I have ambitions to write a book, to create a company. Then, someone threatened to reveal my identity, so I outed myself and it has been a blessing in disguise, so thank you to the person,\u2019 she joked. Soon after, she launched her DANG Lifestyle and skincare business which has grown largely through word of mouth through the DANG community, Agoro says. \u201cWe started with candles and went into skincare and we haven\u2019t done any campaign at all but have sold over 400,000 units. I owe the trajectory of the DANG lifestyle to the community. But It\u2019s a business that has to leave our comfort zone in Nigeria. Dang Lifestyle is already in the UK, USA, Ghana, and Kenya and we want to take it to more countries,\u201d she said. Despite aiming her message squarely at women, Agoro doesn\u2019t discount a future where men would be integrated into the community. \u201cI now get men commenting and saying to me, \u2018We are DANG men too, include us in the conversation.\u2019 We are happy to have them in the conversation. I can see that some of them want to learn and do better. I believe we have to tell them kindly and gracefully what we want or we don\u2019t get the change we want,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/africa/from-anonymity-to-empowerment-the-journey-of-diary-of-a-naija-girl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

The suspect was indicted on a charge of forced disappearance in the case involving the three tourists, whose bodies were found last week dumped in a 50-foot well with gunshot wounds to the head. The prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement Wednesday that it would also press charges of homicide. Brothers Jake and Callum Robinson and their friend Jack Carter Rhoad were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana when they went missing. Mexican authorities believe that at some point between the afternoon of April 27 and the following morning, several people approached the surfers intending to steal their vehicle, and \u201cdue to the reaction of the victims, they deprived them of their lives.\u201d Authorities said the suspect \u2013 one of three Mexican citizens who have been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping in the case \u2013 was captured a \u201cfew hours\u201d later. \u201cOther evidence was also collected, such as rods from tents, firearm casings, plastic gallon bottles, blood stains, and drag marks, in the place where they were presumably camping,\u201d authorities said. While Baja California\u00a0has been plagued by drug cartel violence in recent years, it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada. Dozens of people held a protest last week in Ensenada calling on authorities to do more to tackle violence facing tourists and locals alike. Many held up surfboards with slogans written on them in tribute to the three slain tourists. Drug cartels have terrorized Mexico with ever-increasing levels of violence, fueled in part by huge demand for drugs from US consumers and armed with an arsenal of weaponry from north of the border. While parts of Mexico are established tourist destinations, violent crime including kidnapping and human trafficking plague parts of the country, particularly in border areas.

Chi Leung (Peter) Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, are also accused of foreign interference,\u00a0the statement said, without specifying who the men were allegedly spying on.

The British government has criticized Hong Kong\u2019s Beijing-backed crackdown on almost all opposition in the years following the protests, while Hong Kong authorities have bristled at Britain providing a safe haven for pro-democracy leaders sought by the Hong Kong police. On Tuesday, Hong Kong\u00a0Chief Executive John Lee claimed the British charges against thre three men were a \u201cfabrication.\u201d \u201cThe Chinese side firmly rejects and strongly condemns the UK\u2019s fabrication in the so-called case and its unwarranted accusation against the Hong Kong government,\u201d Lee\u00a0said,\u00a0referring directly to a statement from the Chinese Embassy in London\u00a0that was also issued in response to the charges. On Monday, the Chinese Embassy statement, strongly condemned what it called the United Kingdom\u2019s \u201cunwarranted accusation against the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government.\u201d The charges against the three men allege that between December 20, 2023 and May 2, 2024, Yuen, Wai and Trickett agreed to undertake information gathering, surveillance and acts of deception that were likely to materially assist a foreign intelligence service, according to PA media. Police also alleged that on May 1, the three forced entry into a UK residential address, according to PA.

{"id": "travel_cancun-mexico-cenotes-mayan-temples", "text": "Cancun. It\u2019s all just sun, sand and partying, right? Well, wrong. This famous tourist hotspot on the Yucatan Peninsula may have become a byword for excess, but from Lucha Libre to Mayan history to the natural beauty of its nearby jungles, Cancun offers so much more than a beach vacation. Heading here right now is special too. It\u2019s 50 years since the first hotel opened in Cancun. Back in the early 1970s, this was an empty, beautiful stretch of coastline, save for a small fishing village. The boom here, though, was not organic, but actually part of a plan to create what the Mexican government at the time dubbed a \u201cmultimillion-dollar playground.\u201d That plan, called The Cancun Project, gained approval in 1969 and ground was broken in 1970, with the purpose of building a new city from scratch. It would feature an area still known as the Hotel Zone, a part of town for local residents and workers to live and an airport for flying in people desperate for good weather and a good time. Quintana Roo, which became a Mexican state in 1974, the same year that first hotel opened, is now home to a series of resorts, of which Cancun is the original. Fast-forward and Cancun has become a runaway success. Some 21 million visitors headed here in 2023, beating tourism ministry projections and reminding everyone that it is Mexico\u2019s ultimate must-see. Wrestling with the past A night out on the town in Cancun doesn\u2019t have to involve shots, bashing each other with balloons and dancing in the street, although all of these things have their place. For something truly local, it\u2019s best to get sporty, with a night of Lucha Libre, Mexican wrestling. A sport with a massive fanbase, wrestlers known as Luchadores wrestle in masks which, when they lose, they can never wear again. It all makes for a colorful but brutal experience, one you can\u2019t help but enjoy, whether it\u2019s wrestlers being chucked out of the ring or the delicious tamales you get to snack on before showtime. While this historic form of entertainment, which goes way back into the 1900s, offers visitors a glimpse of local culture, there\u2019s something even older to marvel at in Cancun. Thousands of years before Cancun\u2019s arrival on the tourist scene, the Mayan Empire built temples and cities here, their ruins still visible between the pyramid-like hotels which ape their original design. Diving into history To truly get to grips with the highly developed civilization which grew up here, it pays to go deep into the jungle. To Puerto Morelos and its iconic cenotes. These deep sinkholes, found throughout this part of Mexico, formed during the last ice age, when weakened limestone collapsed, offering up the only source of freshwater in the forest. The word is derived from the Mayan language, whose people believed that they were sacred spaces, a way to access the underworld. \u201cThey call it Xibalba,\u201d explains Roberto Rojo, a biologist and founder of Cenotes Urbanos, a nonprofit conservation organization. \u201cXibalba, that\u2019s the Mayan word for the underworld\u2026 it\u2019s not like hell. It\u2019s just another place in their universe. \u201cMany of the pyramids or the temples are built over a cenote or a cave, or very close to these places, because they were very important for them.\u201d So important, in fact, that whole cities and temples, like Chichen-Itza, designated one of the new seven wonders of the world in 2000, were built around them. Sacrifices were made too, with animals thrown deep into the water to appease the Mayans gods. At Cenote Zapote, in Puerto Morelos, it\u2019s even possible to dive to the bottom and catch sight of something that\u2019s been there for over 10,000 years. \u201cThis is a very special cenote because down there at the bottom [there is] a full skeleton of a big giant ground sloth that lived here during the ice age,\u201d says Rojo. A spiritual experience The peninsula\u2019s jungle also holds other secrets. Two hours from Cancun, in Tulum, hides a museum and arts center that is unusual, topsy-turvy and downright trippy. SFER IK opened in 2019. It\u2019s part museum, part gallery and part jungle, at one with its surroundings, with no flat floors or ceilings, constructed from local timber, vines and even living trees. The brainchild of architect and philanthropist Eduardo Neira Sterkel, also known simply as Roth, it\u2019s designed to bring visitors closer to nature and the beauty of the forest of the Yucatan. It does so in truly one-off style, from its undulating walkways to the way in which vines droop across paths, the trees soaring above. Roth explains that, with 200 trees making up SFER IK, it is a way of bringing nature into the everyday. \u201cI think that nature is the last resource we have, we have to take care of nature,\u201d he says, when asked about why creating this amazing space was so important to him. It\u2019s undoubtedly somewhere that you can feel calm and content, at one with the world around you. It is not the Cancun that is known for its hectic party scene. Far, far from it. Likewise, the healing powers of a Tamazcal Ceremony stand apart from the stereotypes associated with the region. This ancient Mayan tradition is still practiced in the jungle around Cancun today, a chance to relax, detox and purify among the greenery. There are even real local shamans on hand to lead the ceremony in the Temazcal, a stone igloo within which sits a hot fire. Think of it like a jungle sauna. The darkness of the space is designed to break down barriers between people, with ceremonies lasting up to eight hours which involve sharing feelings and thoughts. \u201cThis is very good for our body; we are healing, detoxing,\u201d explains the shaman from inside the Temazcal. It\u2019s believed the Mayans took part in such ceremonies after battle or court competition. Thousands of years ago, they, like so many ancient civilizations all over the globe, understood the power of mindfulness. The old, the new and everything in between While natural wonders draw tourists away from Cancun, the rain, which arrives here more often than you think, drives tourists indoors, into the town\u2019s myriad malls. This might be modern-day Mexico, but the souvenirs here have a distinctly Mayan bent, from the local handicrafts to the temple-covered fridge magnets. Mercifully, the sun is never far away, meaning there\u2019s time to simply marvel at the turquoise waters, the boats skimming the surface, the birds dotting the sky. There\u2019s simply no getting away from the fact that this is an extremely beautiful corner of the world. Like the Mayans, the visionaries of modern-day Cancun knew what they were doing when they created this tourist delight.

Tick Belrose (played by Hugo Weaving) is on stage lip syncing as his drag persona Mitzi Del Bra; clad in a silver sequin dress with matching gloves and a bouffant blonde wig. This is the opening scene from \u201cThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\u201d, which first screened at Cannes Film Festival 30 years ago this month. \u201cI made that dress for myself,\u201d Tim Chappel, one of the movie\u2019s costume designers, told CNN. \u201cThe weekend before, I\u2019d gone to the Miss Teen USA beauty pageant as Miss Silicon Valley, because (the dress) had joke plastic boobs inside. Stephan (Elliott, the film\u2019s writer and director) was really on my case because I wanted to do lots of obscure stuff (to costume the film\u00a0), and he wanted (the principal characters in drag) \u00a0to look like ladies. So I said we can make him look like a lady and take the piss at the same time, because the boobs are clearly from a party shop. And I\u2019d already made it, so it was cheap!\u201d In the film, Tick scoops up his freshly widowed friend Bernadette Bassenger (played by Terence Stamp) and flamboyant, fellow drag queen Adam Whitley/ Felicia Jollygoodfellow (actor Guy Pearce) and goes west \u2014 both musically and literally \u2014 for a road trip across the Outback in their affectionately-christened bus: Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. \u201cWe were just having a laugh!\u201d Chappel said, recalling the film\u2019s production. Sydney 30 years ago was at a unique point in time and culture; not yet tethered to the rest of the world via the internet, the somewhat isolated drag scene was able to cultivate its own sprawling visual language for storytelling and sexual politics, beyond the more recognizable female impersonation that Elliott might have initially pushed for. \u201cIt was my first opportunity to really express myself as a designer, and I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody stand in my way,\u201d Chappel said. \u201cI just really wanted to make (the film\u2019s wardrobe) unique and interesting.\u201d Serving looks, on a budget Film critic Susan Barber, despite calling out the problematic handling of female and non-white characters, dubbed \u201cPriscilla\u201d the \u201cdarling\u201d of the Cannes Film Festival after it premiered there in 1994. The film quickly drew attention for its costuming in particular, winning Chappel and fellow designer Lizzy Gardiner an Oscar in 1995. Among many iconic looks is the flip-flop (or \u2018thong,\u2019 if you\u2019re Australian) dress. It was made from shoes Chappel bought for $15 in Target using his mother\u2019s staff discount \u2014 \u201cwhich was good,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause that was about three quarters of our budget.\u201d Their mandated thriftiness meant that several costumes, \u201cmade with hot glue, chicken wire and duct tape\u201d, fell apart not long after the cameras stopped rolling. The flip-flop dress survived, though \u2014 that was made with cable ties, as well as duct tape. Two years passed between Chappel first joining the project and its (limited) funding being secured. The time allowed him to play with and re-do ideas, evolving initial plans into their extravagant final form. In one scene, for instance, Tick, Adam and Bernadette put on a fireside performance of Gloria Gaynor\u2019s \u201cI Will Survive\u201d for a group of First Nations people. Rather than mimic Gaynor\u2019s hairstyle directly, however, Chappel spent his elongated preparation time adding an increasing bouquet of flowers to the trio\u2019s headpieces, until eventually there was no hair left at all. \u201cI think that\u2019s definitely one of the most iconic looks,\u201d drag artist and costumer Philmah Bocks told CNN. Bocks has been designing costumes for 30 years, having broken into the drag scene around the same time \u201cPriscilla\u201d was hitting screens. \u201cThe thong dress is a very iconic piece too, because I think that\u2019s very (stereotypically) Australian. And of course the big finale look, with the emus on top of their heads. That\u2019s the beauty of \u2018Priscilla\u2019: they\u2019ve really captured a moment in Australian time and used Australian culture and flora and fauna to create these wonderful pieces.\u201d \u201cThe art of drag costuming is the ability to turn drab into fab,\u201d she continued. \u201c\u2019Priscilla\u2019 showed us a lot of that, because a lot of that type of design work was happening in and around Sydney in the early \u201890s. There was this sort of explosion of drag costuming that went beyond couture. Of course, queens were also on a budget. You couldn\u2019t always afford hundreds or even thousands of dollars to create the most beautiful pieces, but you could kind of get there with stuff we found in a dumpster! It\u2019s what you do with it that makes the difference\u2026 I\u2019ve been replicating (Chappel\u2019s) costumes for 30 years, so I\u2019ve got a lot to thank him for!\u201d Bocks is known for her foam, or \u2018Phoam\u2019, wigs, a look also popularized in \u201cPriscilla\u201d which she\u2019s made for London\u2019s hit musical \u201cPriscilla the Party!\u201d as well as for Katy Perry on an episode of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d. These creations also follow the \u201cdrab to fab\u201d ethos: they\u2019re made from materials bought at the hardware store. \u201cI remember buying this product from the hardware store knowing full well that it was going on Katy Perry\u2019s head, and that made me laugh a little,\u201d Bocks said. \u201cOf course, by the time I\u2019d finished with it, it looked nothing like it had originally.\u201d Spirit of Ecstasy Perhaps more so than any other costume, the enduring image from \u201cPriscilla\u201d is Adam/ Felicia\u2019s opera performance atop the moving bus, decked out in hundreds of meters of flowing silver lam\u00e9. Its inspiration came from the Rolls Royce \u201cSpirit of Ecstasy\u201d bonnet ornament, though once again the final product went far beyond the script\u2019s guidance. Felicia\u2019s windswept aria comes after their bus is scrawled in homophobic graffiti \u2014 a reflection of the community\u2019s resilience against hate and disaster in real life. \u201cPriscilla\u201d received her standing ovation at Cannes seven months before Australia decriminalized homosexuality at federal level; three years before Tasmania would become the final state to pass similar legislation, and at a time when the AIDS crisis was still at large. Despite that, Chappel remembers the film as coming at a positive turning point: new HIV treatments were being trialed, replacing toxic doses of the AZT drug that had previously been offered. \u201cAll of a sudden there was hope. Out of the blue,\u201d he said. \u201c\u201cPriscilla\u201d, I think, captures that energy of everybody coming back to life.\u201d Stephan Elliott has recently announced that a sequel to \u201cPriscilla\u201d is in the works, with Chappel on board. The newest addition to the empire will join \u201cPriscilla\u2019s\u201d musical adaptation, which has toured the globe in Chappel\u2019s costumes since 2006. The film\u2019s legacy can also be seen in Australia\u2019s drag scene today and, since 2021, has been broadcast to new audiences via contestants on \u201cRupaul\u2019s Drag Race Down Under\u201d. \u201cIf I get run over by a bus tomorrow,\u201d Chappel said, \u201cthe last little thought that goes through my head \u2013 besides \u2018ouch\u2019 \u2013 is going to be \u2018I\u2019ve left an impression, that\u2019s cool\u2019.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/style/priscilla-queen-of-the-desert-costumes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_world_boeing-starliner-delay-helium-leak-scn", "text": "The world will have to wait at least another week before the highly anticipated first crewed mission of Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft. The launch was expected on May 17 after a previous delay, but teams found a small helium leak in the service module of the spacecraft, according to a release from Boeing. Starliner teams traced the leak to a flange on a single reaction control system thruster, where helium is used to allow the thrusters to fire. \u201cThe teams now are targeting a launch date of no earlier than 4:43 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 21, to complete additional testing,\u201d the release said. This mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing\u2019s spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. Both Boeing and NASA are developing tests and solutions for the leak, the release said. Boeing plans to bring the propulsion system to the flight pressurization it would reach just before launch and then allow the helium system to naturally vent. A review of the data from a May 6 launch attempt has not shown any other issues, Boeing said. The NASA astronauts set to crew the mission for a weeklong stay at the International Space Station, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, have been in preflight quarantine but returned to Houston on May 10 to spend time with their families during the operations preflight, Boeing said. Williams and Wilmore will fly back to NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the coming days, according to the release. Boeing aims to make history The occasion is a decade in the making \u2014 the culmination of Boeing\u2019s efforts to develop a spacecraft worthy of ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station under NASA\u2019s commercial program. The launch would mark only the sixth maiden voyage of a crewed spacecraft in US history, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson noted in a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIt started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX\u2019s) Dragon \u2014 and now Starliner,\u201d he said. Boeing designed the Starliner to rival SpaceX\u2019s prolific Crew Dragon capsule and would join in NASA\u2019s push to collaborate with private industry partners, expanding US options for ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station. On board, Williams will also make history as the first woman to join on such a mission. A slowed start Development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starliner\u2019s path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeing\u2019s rival under NASA\u2019s commercial crew program \u2014 SpaceX \u2014 has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agency\u2019s astronauts. The launch was scheduled for May 6, with Williams and Wilmore already in their seats aboard the Starliner capsule when engineers found an issue and halted the launch. The United Launch Alliance team,\u00a0which builds the Atlas V rocket, identified a pressure regulation valve on a liquid oxygen tank that needed replacing.\u00a0The valve has since been replaced, but the new issue with the helium leak on the Boeing spacecraft that sits atop the rocket is causing further delay. If the spacecraft does launch next week as planned, it and the astronauts inside will break away from the Atlas V rocket after reaching orbit and begin firing its own engines. The Starliner will likely spend more than 24 hours gradually making its way to the space station. Williams and Wilmore are set to spend about a week aboard the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board, while the Starliner remains docked outside. The two will then return home aboard the same Starliner capsule, which is expected to parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/world/boeing-starliner-delay-helium-leak-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_climate_2023-summer-hottest-2000-years-climate", "text": "Last summer, marked by deadly extreme heat and devastating wildfires, was the warmest in at least 2,000 years, according to new research, which analyzed weather data and tree rings to reconstruct a detailed picture of the past. The findings offer a stark insight into the \u201cunparalleled\u201d warming the world is experiencing today thanks to humans burning vast amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels, according to the authors of the study published Tuesday in the Journal Nature.\u00a0And it\u2019s an alarming signal as some scientists warn 2024 is on track to be even hotter still. Global warming is currently tracked by comparing temperatures to the \u201cpre-industrial era,\u201d before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels, widely defined as the period between 1850 to 1900.\u00a0\u00a0Under the Paris Agreement in 2015, countries agreed to restrict global warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Last summer, the world temporarily breached this threshold, according to the report.  Using data taken from temperature instruments during this period, the scientists found the Northern Hemisphere summer in 2023 was 2.07 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial period. But observational data from this period is sparse, uncertain and skews warmer. So, for a fuller picture of how the climate varied naturally before the start of the pre-industrial era, the study authors looked much further into the past. To do this, they used detailed sets of tree ring records from thousands of trees across nine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America and Scandinavia, but excluding the Tropics which lack good tree data. Trees act as time capsules. The patterns of their rings \u2013 affected by sunlight, rainfall and temperature \u2013 provide a climate history for each year of their lives, going back centuries or even thousands of years. This complex tree ring data allowed the scientists to reconstruct annual temperatures for Northern Hemisphere summers between the years 1 and 1849 and compare them to last summer\u2019s temperatures. They found the summer of 2023 was warmer than any other summer during this period. It was at least 0.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the warmest summer during this period, the year 246 \u2013 when the Roman Empire still ruled over Europe and the Mayan Civilization dominated Central America. At the other end of the scale, last summer was nearly 4 degrees Celsius warmer than the coldest summer the study identified, the year 536 \u2013 when a volcanic eruption pumped out vast amounts of planet-cooling gases. Using this 2,000-year data set, they calculated that the summer of 2023 was 2.2 degrees Celsius hotter than the long-term pre-industrial average, before robust networks of instruments could measure the weather. The study follows a report published in November, which found humanity lived through the hottest 12-month period in at least 125,000 years. The study, and others like it, rely on data extracted from other proxies, such as ice cores and coral reefs, which don\u2019t give the same detailed yearly evidence as tree rings. This makes it hard to compare individual days or even years with those in the past, said Jan Esper, lead author of the study and professor of climate geography at Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany. It is possible \u2013 even likely \u2013 last year was the hottest in at least 125,000 years, he added, but \u201cwe don\u2019t have the data\u201d to say for certain. The deep dive into the year-by-year temperatures of Northern Hemisphere summers is a \u201cworthwhile endeavor,\u201d said Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Brown University who was not involved in the study. What\u2019s impressive, she told CNN, is \u201cwe have enough temperature reconstructions from enough places around the world to document the exceptional nature of a single year of large-scale temperature extremes.\u201d This \u201ctreasure chest of data\u201d can be used to \u201csharpen our projections of future climate extremes,\u201d she added. While the study can place the extraordinary Northern Hemisphere heat\u00a0into historical context, it cannot be applied on a global scale, Esper said. There simply isn\u2019t enough tree ring data from the Southern Hemisphere and the Tropics, he said. The study\u2019s findings are deeply worrying, Esper said. \u201cThere are potential irreversible processes in the system, and I am afraid not of myself. I\u2019m old,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m concerned for the kids.\u201d CNN\u2019s Laura Paddison contributed to this report.

Rasoulof condemned the Iranian government in an Instagram post on Monday, calling it a tyrannical and oppressive regime, and posting a video that showed him crossing the country\u2019s mountainous border. \u201cIf geographical Iran suffers beneath the boots of your religious tyranny, cultural Iran is alive in the common minds of millions of Iranians who were forced to leave Iran due to your brutality and no power can impose its will on it. From today, I am a resident of cultural Iran,\u201d he said. In a separate statement dated May 12, Rasoulof said he had decided to escape Iran after his lawyers told him his prison sentence would be implemented on short notice. \u201cI had to choose between prison and leaving Iran. With a heavy heart, I chose exile,\u201d he said in that statement, which was provided by a spokesperson. CNN has reached out to Iranian authorities for comment. His lawyer Babak Paknia said last week that an Iranian court had sentenced Rasoulof to eight years in prison and flogging after it found his films and documentaries to be \u201cexamples of collusion with the intention of committing a crime against the security of the country.\u201d Rasoulof is among several high-profile artists to have been caught up in a widening crackdown on dissent by Iranian authorities since nationwide protests broke out over the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly. Rasoulof, whose recent films have been critical of the Iranian government, was among a group of artists and filmmakers who signed a letter criticizing the violent response of security forces to quell a 2022 protest over a building collapse in the southwestern city of Abadan that killed more than 40 people. Rasoulof\u00a0won a Golden Bear\u00a0for best film at the Berlinale festival in 2020 for \u201cThere Is No Evil\u201d and his film\u00a0\u201cA Man of Integrity\u201d\u00a0was recognized for a \u201cCertain Regard\u201d honor at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2017. The filmmaker\u2019s latest work, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig,\u201d is set to premiere at Cannes next week, but it\u2019s unclear if he will be able to attend. \u201cWe are very happy and much relieved that Mohammad has safely arrived in Europe after a dangerous journey,\u201d said Jean-Christophe Simon, the distributor for Rasoulof\u2019s latest film. The Films Boutique and Parallel45 executive added that he hopes that Rasoulof will be able to attend the Cannes premiere for his film \u201cin spite of all attempts to prevent him from being there in person.\u201d Rasoulof said on Instagram that he will now work to quickly finish the last technical steps of his film\u2019s post-production. \u201cMany people helped to make this film. My thoughts are with all of them, and I fear for their safety and well-being,\u201d he said, accusing the Iranian government of pressuring members of his production team with interrogations, court filings and travel restrictions. Rasoulof didn\u2019t specify how he escaped Iran, saying only that he did it secretly with the help of friends and acquaintances. In 2022, an Iranian court sentenced Rasoulof to one year in prison and banned him from making films for two years on the charge of \u201cpropaganda against the system,\u201d according to Human Rights Watch.

{"id": "2024_05_14_style_alice-munro-dies-92-author-obituary", "text": "Alice Munro, the Nobel Literature Prize winner best known for her mastery of short stories and depictions of womanhood in rural settings, has died in Ontario, Canada, at the age of 92. The news was confirmed to CNN \u201cwith great sadness\u201d by a spokesperson at her publisher, Penguin Random House. Born in 1931 in Wingham, Ontario, Munro grew up on what she described as the \u201ccollapsing enterprise of a fox and mink farm, just beyond the most disreputable part of town\u201d in a 1994 interview with \u201cThe Paris Review.\u201d Amid familial struggles, Munro found an escape in reading as a child. Her early enthusiasm for renowned writers such as Emily Bront\u00eb, Charles Dickens, and Lucy Maud Montgomery, among others, reflected an appreciation for literature beyond her age. \u201cBooks seem to me to be magic, and I wanted to be part of the magic.\u201d she told The Guardian of her childhood reading habits. \u201cBooks were so important to me. They were far more important than life.\u201d As the valedictorian of her high school\u2019s graduating class of 1949, Munro received a two-year scholarship to attend the University of Western Ontario, where she majored in journalism before switching to English. Despite the scholarship initially being a lifeline for Munro, perpetual financial struggles forced her to work as a tobacco picker, a library clerk and even to sell her own blood while studying. After the conclusion of her scholarship, and before her graduation, she married fellow student James Munro and moved with him to Vancouver, where the couple had three children in relatively quick succession (their middle child, Catherine, died shortly after her birth due to kidney complications), and then to Victoria in 1963, where they opened a bookstore. There, Munro wholly immersed herself in literature, namely writers such as Eudora Welty, Flannery O\u2019Connor, and Carson McCullers, whose work Munro told \u201cThe Paris Review\u201d validated her desire to write about rural people in small towns. In addition, she was able to overcome a crippling writer\u2019s block that had plagued her in her twenties \u2014\u202fand had resulted in more abandoned work than finished writing. But it was maternity that led to Munro\u2019s mastery of short stories, not only because familial relationships and domestic lives served as a focal point in many of her works, but also because in her attempt to reconcile her maternal responsibilities with her desire to write, Munro could only set aside short periods of time during her day to craft stories, to the point where she would jot down ideas and drafts during her children\u2019s naps. Munro\u2019s mainstream breakthrough came in 1968 with the publication of her debut short story collection, \u201cDance of the Happy Shades.\u201d A collection of 15 of her earliest stories, the book received critical acclaim and won Canada\u2019s prestigious Governor General\u2019s Award for Fiction in the same year. It largely sets the tone for Munro\u2019s prose; semi-autobiographical in nature and exploring the universality of the human urge for self-discovery, love, and independence, through the mundanity of everyday life in small, rural communities. \u201cWhat you\u2019re getting in a small town is social attitude sort of distilled so you could look at them,\u201d Munro told Canadian broadcaster CBC in 1990. \u201cThe small town is like a stage for human lives.\u201d Throughout her writing career, Munro published 14 short story collections, and was a regular contributor in literary magazines such as \u201cThe New Yorker\u201d and \u201cTamarack Review.\u201d In several of her later collections, such as \u201cThe Moons of Jupiter\u201d and \u201cThe Progress of Love,\u201d Munro experimented with the traditional architecture of short stories and incorporated nonlinear narrative structures. She was also known for constantly editing and revising her stories, even after publication. Several of her short stories were adapted to film, including the 1983 Oscar-winning short \u201cBoys and Girls\u201d and the 2006 Oscar-nominated film \u201cAway from Her.\u201d In 2009, Munro revealed she had been treated for cancer and had undergone coronary bypass surgery. Three years later, she published her final collection of short stories, \u201cDear Life,\u201d which, although a drearier portrayal of small-town lives, served as a literary closure to her semi-autobiographical depictions of womanhood in rural towns. Munro\u2019s mastery of short stories and literature has been lauded by many of her contemporaries. Literary critic James Wood hailed Munro as \u201cour Chekhov,\u201d drawing similarities to the renowned Russian short story writer, while her compatriot and fellow writer Margaret Atwood elevated her to \u201cinternational literary sainthood.\u201d In 2013, Munro was selected as Nobel Laureate in Literature for her body of work spanning seven decades. The Nobel Committee described Munro as a \u201cmaster of the contemporary short story,\u201d whose writing captured \u201cthe feeling of just being a human being.\u201d \u201cI want my stories to move people,\u201d Munro said in her Nobel Lecture in absentia, \u201ceverything the story tells moves the (reader) in such a way that you feel you are a different person when you finish.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/style/alice-munro-dies-92-author-obituary/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Blinken and Zelensky \u201cdiscussed recent battlefield updates and the importance of newly-arrived U.S. security assistance to helping repel Russian attacks,\u201d US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a read-out following the meeting. In a Monday evening address, hours before he met Blinken, Zelensky said: \u201cWe understand how the enemy is acting and we see the plan to draw our forces back.\u201d US President Joe Biden\u00a0signed a\u00a0$95 billion foreign aid package\u00a0last month that includes\u00a0nearly $61 billion for Ukraine,\u00a0following a\u00a0successful six-month campaign by the White House\u00a0to build support\u00a0in a House GOP conference increasingly resistant to sending more money overseas. Blinken previously admitted that there was a \u201ccost\u201d to the delayed funding for Ukraine. But he focused his speech on what he said was support for Ukraine from\u00a0\u201ca significant majority of Americans.\u201d \u201cAfter the delay in approving the latest US assistance package to Ukraine, a delay that left you more vulnerable to Russia\u2019s attacks, some Ukrainians may be wondering whether you can count on America to sustain its commitment,\u201d Blinken said in his speech. \u201cThe $60 billion aid package that was approved by our Congress, with overwhelming support across both political parties in both houses of Congress, I think demonstrates that you can.\u201d Before he met Zelensky, Blinken said that US weapons\u00a0from that recent assistance package\u00a0had started arriving in Ukraine,\u00a0and more were on the way to help it succeed on the battlefield with Russia. \u201cWe know this is a challenging time,\u201d Blinken said. \u201cBut we also know that in the near term, the assistance is now on the way. Some of it already arrived, and more of it will be arriving, and that\u2019s going to make a real difference against the Russian aggression on the battlefield.\u201d He also praised the \u201cextraordinary courage of the Ukrainian people\u201d and said that \u201cwe are equally determined that Ukraine stands strongly on its own feet, militarily, economically, democratically, a strong, successful, thriving, free Ukraine is the best possible rebuke to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\u201d US will help build a \u2018force of the future\u2019 Amid Ukrainian\u00a0setbacks on the battlefield,\u00a0Blinken praised the country\u2019s resiliance. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing that Putin has always underestimated, but that Ukrainians understand to their core, and that\u2019s the fierceness with which free people will defend their right to shape their own destiny,\u201d Blinken said in his speech. Blinken committed to helping Ukraine build its \u201cforce of the future\u201d and\u00a0reiterated that\u00a0the US intends to\u00a0make use of seized\u00a0Russian assets to\u00a0provide funding to Ukraine for their reconstruction. \u201cOur Congress has given us the power to seize Russian assets in the United States. We intend to use it,\u201d said Blinken during the speech.\u00a0\u201cWhat Putin destroyed, Russia should and must pay to rebuild.\u201d Blinken said the US is working with other G7 countries to do the same with \u201cRussia\u2019s immobilized sovereign assets.\u201d \u201cThe G7 can unlock billions of dollars and send a powerful message to Putin that time is not on his side,\u201d said Blinken without giving a timeline for when these efforts might be realized. Western leaders have reacted with concern to Russia\u2019s new and unexpected assault in Kharkiv. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron acknowledged it was an \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d moment in the war, telling Sky News that Russia had effectively \u201cinvaded [Ukraine] again.\u201d During his fourth visit to Ukraine since the 2022 Russian invasion, Blinken also met Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba as well as with civil society and private sector partners. Blinken also used his visit to highlight the need for Ukraine to continue making democratic reforms to maintain its global coalition of support. \u201cWinning on the battlefield will prevent Ukraine from becoming part of Russia; winning the war against corruption will keep Ukraine from becoming like Russia,\u201d he said. It is \u201cimportant that Ukraine keeps taking the difficult steps to strengthen and consolidate your democracy. Because the choices that you make, the kind of democracy that you build, will determine the strength and the staying power of the coalition by Ukraine\u2019s side,\u201d Blinken said. He called on Ukraine to \u201croot out the scourge of corruption once and for all\u201d and said the US will continue supporting Kyiv\u2019s efforts. \u201cUkraine\u2019s security is eroded if the resources for its military are siphoned off by individuals looking to enrich themselves. Ukraine\u2019s economic potential is undercut if investors and innovators cannot count on a level playing field. Ukraine\u2019s democracy is weakened if citizens stop believing that they can hold their government accountable and fix the flaws in their system from within,\u201d Blinken said. \u2018Tough fight\u2019 Just days before Blinken\u2019s arrival, Ukraine\u2019s top general said the situation in the northeastern\u00a0Kharkiv region\u00a0has \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d after Russia claimed to have captured four more villages as it expanded its surprise cross-border offensive. US officials acknowledge that the slowdown in US support, due to congressional infighting, has exacerbated a challenging situation for Ukraine. \u201cThere is no doubt there has been a cost,\u201d Blinken said over the weekend on CBS. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to rush this assistance out there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a challenging moment.\u201d Some of the supplemental support is already on the front lines,\u00a0Blinken said.\u00a0Specifically the US has started to flow in\u00a0ATACMS missile systems \u201cparticularly with an eye towards Russia\u2019s activities right now in Kharkiv,\u201d\u00a0a senior US\u00a0official added. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough fight. There is no question. But we have a lot of confidence that the Ukrainians will increasingly be effective in pushing the Russians back as our assistance flows in both from the United States and other allies and partners,\u201d the official said. Russian forces have made advances south into Ukrainian villages in the Kharkiv region, after launching their surprise cross-border assault four days ago. One of the main Russian efforts appears targeted on Lyptsi, described by one Ukrainian military blogger as \u201ca very important village\u201d due to its position on\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s second defensive line. The intention behind Russia\u2019s new push, which began in the early hours of Friday morning, is unclear; it may be to create a buffer zone designed to reduce Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, or possibly even a renewed assault on the city of Kharkiv, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south. Equally, it could be an attempt to draw Ukrainian forces away from other key Russian objectives further south \u2013 a rationale Zelensky offered in a Sunday evening address. Officials have told CNN\u00a0there will be a lag time between the approval of the billions earmarked for Ukraine in the aid bill and\u00a0the\u00a0arrival\u00a0of the majority of the assistance that will make a significant difference on\u00a0the\u00a0front lines. Those officials said Western intelligence believes\u00a0Russia is seeking to exploit that gap in delivery time to further\u00a0step-up air and ground attacks on Ukraine in what it sees as a \u201cwindow of opportunity.\u201d State Department\u00a0deputy\u00a0spokesperson Vedant Patel told a news briefing Monday the US anticipates Russia will \u201cpress forward\u201d in Kharkiv, and that while Russia may \u201cmake further advances in the coming weeks,\u201d the US does not \u201canticipate any major breakthroughs.\u201d \u201cOver time, the additional influx of US assistance and continued support from partners will enable Ukraine to continue to withstand this kind of aggression,\u201d Patel said. US officials have looked to find ways to quickly provide vital military supplies to Ukraine from the\u00a0aid package,\u00a0utilizing the presidential drawdown authority (PDA), which pulls equipment from existing US stocks. Just moments after Biden signed the aid bill last month,\u00a0the US announced a $1 billion PDA package, with the president\u00a0saying at the time\u00a0that shipments of the equipment to Ukraine would begin \u201cin the next few hours.\u201d And on Friday, the US announced another\u00a0PDA package worth $400 million\u00a0and a\u00a0$30 million sale of HIMARS,\u00a0a rocket launcher that Kyiv\u2019s military has used to great effect against Russian forces. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Monday that the administration\u00a0would announce a third PDA package\u00a0in the coming days, \u201cto really accelerate the tempo of the deliveries.\u201d \u201cThe delay put Ukraine in a hole and we\u2019re trying to help them to get out of that hole as rapidly as possible,\u201d Sullivan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/europe/blinken-kyiv-ukraine-us-support-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_tech_us-export-licenses-china-huawei-hnk-intl", "text": "The United States has revoked licenses that allowed companies including Intel\u00a0and Qualcomm to ship chips used for laptops and handsets to sanctioned Chinese telecoms equipment maker\u00a0Huawei\u00a0Technologies, three people familiar with the matter said. A fourth person said some of the companies were notified on Tuesday that their licenses were revoked effective immediately. The U.S. Commerce Department earlier in the day confirmed it had revoked some licenses but stopped short of naming the companies. A spokesperson for Intel (INTC) declined to comment. Qualcomm (QCOM) did not respond to a request for comment, and\u00a0Huawei\u00a0did not immediately respond. The move comes after the release last month of\u00a0Huawei\u2019s first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro powered by Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra 9 processor. The laptop launch drew fire from Republican lawmakers, who said it suggested to them that the Commerce Department had given the green light to Intel to sell the chip to\u00a0Huawei. \u201cWe have revoked certain licenses for exports to\u00a0Huawei,\u201d the Commerce Department said in a statement, declining to specify which ones it had withdrawn. The Commerce Department\u2019s move, first reported by Reuters, comes after concerted pressure by Republican China hawks in Congress who have been urging the Biden administration to take tougher action to thwart\u00a0Huawei. \u201cThis action will bolster US national security, protect American ingenuity, and diminish Communist China\u2019s ability to advance its technology,\u201d Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik said in a statement. The move could hurt\u00a0Huawei,\u00a0which still relies on Intel chips to power its laptops, and could hurt US suppliers that do business with the company. Intel has also been facing weak demand for its traditional data center and PC chips. Last month, it lost $11 billion in stock market value after forecasting second-quarter revenue and profit\u00a0below market estimates. Licenses needed Huawei\u00a0was placed on a US trade restriction list in 2019 amid fears it could spy on Americans, part of a broader effort to handicap China\u2019s ability to bolster its military. Being added to the list means the company\u2019s suppliers have to seek a special, difficult-to-obtain license before shipping. Even so, suppliers to\u00a0Huawei\u00a0have received licenses\u00a0worth billions of dollars to sell goods and technology to the company, including one\u00a0particularly controversial authorization issued by the Trump administration, which has allowed Intel to ship central processors to\u00a0Huawei\u00a0for use in its laptops since 2020. Qualcomm has sold older 4G chips to handset makers since receiving a license from US officials in 2020. In a regulatory filing earlier this month, Qualcomm said it did not expect to receive more chip revenue from\u00a0Huawei\u00a0beyond this year. However, Qualcomm still licenses its portfolio of 5G technologies to\u00a0Huawei, which last year began using a 5G chip designed by its HiSilicon unit that most analysts believe is manufactured in violation of US sanctions. Qualcomm said in the filing this month that its patent deal with\u00a0Huawei\u00a0expires early in Qualcomm\u2019s fiscal 2025 and that it has started negotiations to renew the deal. Critics argue such licenses have contributed to the company\u2019s resurgence. Huawei shocked the industry last August with a new phone powered by a sophisticated chip manufactured by Chinese chipmaker SMIC, despite US export restrictions on both companies. The phone helped\u00a0Huawei\u00a0smartphone sales spike 64% year on year in the first six weeks of 2024, according to research firm Counterpoint. Its smart car component business has also contributed to\u00a0Huawei\u2019s resurgence, with the company notching its fastest revenue growth in four years in 2023.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/tech/us-export-licenses-china-huawei-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_europe_putin-red-square-victory-day-intl", "text": "Russia\u2019s President Vladimir\u00a0Putin said his forces were \u201calways ready\u201d to combat external threats, as he addressed crowds gathered at Moscow\u2019s Red Square on Thursday to celebrate the Soviet Union\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Russia\u2019s annual May 9 Victory Day procession has long been a key event in Putin\u2019s calendar as a chance for him to rally public support and show off his country\u2019s military power. While there were even fewer soldiers and military gear on display than last year\u2019s already subdued event, Victory Day this year comes with Russia making advances on the frontlines in Ukraine. Putin\u00a0gave his speech after inspecting the traditional display of tanks and columns of troops parading through the capital. \u201cRussia will do everything in order to not let a global confrontation begin,\u201d\u00a0Putin said, adding: \u201cBut we will not let anyone threaten us, our strategic forces are always ready.\u201d \u201cDear friends, Russia is going through a difficult period,\u201d\u00a0the Russian leader\u00a0continued, saying the \u201cfight of our motherland depends on every one of us.\u201d \u201cToday, on the Victory Day, we realize this even more so,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0concluded, ending his speech with a minute of silence. Around 27 million people in the Soviet Union died in World War II, more than in any other country. Russia\u2019s defense minister, Army General Sergei Shoigu, said in a statement on Telegram that 9,000 people and 70 pieces of military equipment would participate in the main military parade on Red Square. This was less than last year, when Shoigu said more than 10,000 people and 125 items of military hardware would be involved. Several world leaders, mostly from ex-Soviet countries, were invited. Those scheduled to be there were Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev of Kazakhstan, Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan, Serdar Berdimuhamedow of Turkmenistan, Miguel Diaz-Canel of Cuba, Thongloun Sisoulith of Laos, and Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 of Guinea-Bissau. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova\u00a0told TASS in an interview that \u201cunfriendly countries\u201d were not invited for a third Victory Day since the war in Ukraine began. \u201cThey are pursuing an aggressive policy toward our country. They formulate it as inflicting strategic defeat,\u201d\u00a0Zakharova\u00a0said. Putin has portrayed his invasion of Ukraine in patriotic terms \u2014 as a response to a threat posed by the West, something flatly rejected by Kyiv and its allies. His Victory Day address comes just days after the Russian leader was inaugurated for a fifth term in office, in a carefully choreographed ceremony. The inauguration, held Tuesday in the Kremlin, was attended by Russia\u2019s top military and political brass, but the United States and many European nations declined to send a representative after dismissing Russia\u2019s elections as a sham. It further cemented Putin\u2019s grip on power in Russia, where he has served as either president or prime minister since his first inauguration in 2000, and tinkered with Russia\u2019s constitution to remove term limits and extend each term\u2019s length from four years to six.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/europe/putin-red-square-victory-day-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_europe_russia-victory-day-parade-putin-intl", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin presided over a\u00a0pared-back Victory Day parade\u00a0Thursday, showcasing his country\u2019s unity and resolve to continue the war on Ukraine. But the martial celebrations also obscured simmering tensions inside the Kremlin and within Russian society. At first glance, this year\u2019s parade in Red Square was the usual well-choreographed display of military might: Over 9,000 military personnel took part, including a thousand currently serving in what Russia still calls the \u201cspecial military operation\u201d \u2014 the official euphemism for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The mechanized column was led by a World War II-era T-34 tank, a symbol of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. May 9 is more than a day for commemorating the over 25 million Soviet soldiers and civilians who died during World War II. Under Putin, the Russian state has elevated collective remembrance of the war to something resembling a secular religion. It\u2019s a day of high solemnity: in recent years, Russians have taken part in \u201cImmortal Regiment\u201d marches, carrying pictures of family members who served in the war. Putin \u2014 who has made \u201cpatriotic education\u201d a priority \u2014 traditionally lays flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. But since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the massive military parade has been somewhat downsized. Last year, the usual fly-by of military aircraft over Red Square was cancelled, and this year\u2019s parade only featured one tank, the T-34 museum piece. Front-line priorities appear to take precedence over ceremony. And as in years past, Putin cast the war in Ukraine today as a continuation of what Russians call the Great Patriotic War, making the mendacious claim that Russia is battling \u201cneo-Nazism\u201d in Ukraine.\u00a0And while the war in Ukraine seems to be going better for Russia than one year ago, Putin still called for Russians to make more wartime sacrifice. \u201cRussia is now going through a difficult, transitional period,\u201d he said in a speech before the parade. \u201cThe fate of the motherland, its future depends on each of us \u2026 We celebrate Victory Day in the context of the special military operation. All its participants \u2014 those who are on the front line, on the line of combat contact \u2014 are our heroes. We bow to your perseverance and self-sacrifice, dedication. All of Russia is with you!\u201d But this year\u2019s Victory Day is also happening against the background of a bribery scandal roiling Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense. Last month, Russian Deputy Defence Minister Timur Ivanov was caught in a corruption probe,\u00a0arrested on suspicion of accepting a bribe\u00a0of \u201can especially large size.\u201d The scandal widened with the arrest of two Russian businessmen on suspicion of involvement in the bribe. Ivanov has denied involvement in bribery and is willing to give detailed testimony to prove his innocence, according to Russian state news agency TASS. And Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Ivanov\u2019s boss before his ouster from his ministerial post, played his usual role in this year\u2019s Victory Day parade, reviewing the troops and reporting to Putin before the president\u2019s speech. Kremlinologists can draw few conclusions from Shoigu\u2019s performance on May 9. But the arrest of Shoigu\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 has led to speculation about\u00a0infighting at the highest echelons of power\u00a0and cast an uncomfortable spotlight on what observers see as a culture of rampant graft inside the Russian military. As the Russian defense ministry\u2019s construction boss, Ivanov was responsible for overseeing projects such as the rebuilding of the shattered Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, which was obliterated by Russian forces in 2022. The reconstruction of showcase apartment blocks in Mariupol has been a fixture of Russian government propaganda: Putin famously\u00a0paid a visit\u00a0to the occupied city last spring as part of a PR campaign. But a visual investigation by\u00a0the Financial Times\u00a0pointed to shoddy workmanship in Mariupol, underscoring speculation that the reconstruction funds were being siphoned off by Russian companies that had won government construction contracts. Ivanov is under US and EU sanction for his role in the war on Ukraine. But the lavish lifestyle of his ex-partner \u2014 who has an upscale Parisian address and enjoys the slopes at Courchevel\u00a0\u2014\u00a0has been extensively scrutinized\u00a0by the\u00a0Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF), the investigative outfit founded by Russian opposition leader\u00a0Alexey Navalny, who died in a Russian prison north of the Arctic Circle earlier this year. Russia\u2019s political opposition \u2013\u2014\u00a0which under Putin has largely been sidelined, marginalized or chased into exile \u2014 is still reeling from the death of Navalny. But Navalny\u2019s investigative foundation has pressed ahead with its relentless focus on corruption in Putin\u2019s Russia. In recent weeks, ACF chief investigator Maria Pevchikh has managed to dominate much of the Russia conversation online with the release of\u00a0a documentary series\u00a0called \u201cThe Traitors,\u201d which traces the origins of Putin against the background of the political and economic free-for-all in the Russia of the 1990s. Corruption, goes the argument, is the original sin of modern-day Russia. But that\u2019s not the message Putin is projecting on Victory Day. Despite the heavy losses of men and equipment on the battlefield in Ukraine,\u00a0defense spending\u00a0has buoyed the Russian economy. Putin\u2019s technocrats have deftly managed the economy amid international sanctions, returning the country to GDP growth. But Russia\u2019s economy\u00a0remains\u00a0famously inefficient and corrupt. Prestige projects \u2014 such as the\u00a02014 Sochi Olympics\u00a0\u2014 have long been marred by allegations of corruption and favoritism, especially when it comes to the award of contracts. And the living standards of ordinary Russians are\u00a0a secondary consideration\u00a0in Putin\u2019s wartime economy. Viewed through that lens, this year\u2019s Victory Day in Moscow was more of a feel-good exercise, presenting contemporary Russia as the opposite of the \u201990s: proud, militarily strong, pressing inexorably forward. And Putin, after a quarter century in power, presided over the whole affair with the same rhetoric of patriotism, sacrifice and love of Motherland. In Russia, continuity has a quality of its own.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/europe/russia-victory-day-parade-putin-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_europe_russian-attack-ukraine-energy-infrastructure-intl", "text": "Russia carried out a \u201cmassive\u201d missile attack on Ukrainian energy\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0overnight into Wednesday, according to local authorities, in the biggest aerial onslaught by Russian forces for weeks. Russia used 76 air attack weapons in the assault, including 55 missiles and 21 drones launched from Russia and Russian controlled areas, according to Ukrainian Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk. At least 59 weapons were destroyed overnight, he added. The attacks targeted power generation and transmission facilities in Ukraine\u2019s Poltava, Kirovohrad, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Vinnytsia regions, the country\u2019s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko posted on Telegram. \u201cThe enemy wants to deprive us of the ability to generate and transmit electricity in sufficient quantities. Saving electricity is a contribution of each of us to the victory,\u201d Halushchenko said. At least three people were injured, including a woman and a man with multiple limb injuries and shrapnel wounds taken to the hospital in the Kyiv region, and an 8-year-old child in the Kirovohrad region, local authorities said. Moscow has stepped up efforts to paralyze Ukraine\u2019s energy system in the past month, as Kyiv\u2019s troops struggle to hold positions on key frontlines particularly in the east. The five-month\u00a0wait before US Congress approved $61 billion in military aid to Kyiv may have caused lasting damage that will be felt on the frontlines for months to come. Russian forces have used the \u201cartillery drought\u201d hampering Ukraine\u2019s defenses since December to push forward\u00a0on the\u00a0eastern front near Avdiivka,\u00a0making the largest advance since the early months of the war, and ahead of an anticipated\u00a0Russian offensive in late May. The latest Russian attack hit three thermal power plants run by Ukraine\u2019s biggest power company, DTEK. It was the fifth time its\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0was targeted in a month and a half. Ukraine\u2019s state-owned grid operator, Ukrenergo, also reported \u201cdamage to generation facilities.\u201d Two critical energy\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0facilities in the Lviv region were attacked, one in the Chervonohrad district and another in the Stryi district, regional military official, Maksym Kozytskyi, said.

{"id": "2024_05_13_americas_haiti-mss-unodc-guns-drugs-intl-latam", "text": "On the rare days that the hills surrounding Port-au-Prince fall silent, people notice. \u201cIf you can\u2019t hear shooting somewhere, the gangs are probably running low on ammunition,\u201d a police source in the\u00a0Haitian capital told CNN. \u201cBut when there\u2019s a lot of shooting, they\u2019ve definitely received a fresh shipment.\u201d For over two months, Port-au-Prince has been cut off from the world, its international seaport and airport shuttered following an explosion of gang attacks in late February. All major roads are blocked by gang checkpoints. For most people living here, there is no way out \u2013 and no way to bring in desperately needed food and medicine. Encircling the Caribbean nation is another closed perimeter, this one created by\u00a0Haiti\u2019s neighbors. The Dominican Republic has sealed the island\u2019s shared border and airspace. The Bahamas has launched\u00a0a naval blockade\u00a0to keep\u00a0Haitians from fleeing the crisis by boat; the UK has\u00a0sent a warship\u00a0to ward off anyone seeking refuge in Turks and Caicos, a British overseas territory; and the US state of Florida has\u00a0increased marine and aviation patrols. And yet guns, bullets and drugs keep pouring in, crossing international waters and airspace to reach the embattled country \u2013 most of the firepower originating from the US. \u201cHaiti\u00a0doesn\u2019t produce guns and ammunition, yet the gang members don\u2019t seem to have any trouble accessing those things,\u201d says Pierre Esperance, executive director of\u00a0Haiti\u2019s National Human Rights Defense Network. Since the start of the year, thousands of people have been killed in gang-related violence and hundreds kidnapped, including at least 21 children, UN figures show. Stopping the flow of guns to\u00a0Haiti\u00a0would likely have an immediate impact on the bloodshed, according to police and human rights experts. \u201cWe have to cut the gangs\u2019 weapons supply lines. This is absolutely the most important thing now,\u201d the police source told CNN. \u201cBecause when they don\u2019t have bullets, their machine guns become nothing more than clubs.\u201d And as a Kenyan-led multinational security support force (MSS) prepares to deploy to\u00a0Haiti, starving the gangs of ammunition should be a top priority for the US, says William O\u2019Neill, the UN Designated Expert of the High Commissioner on the situation of Human Rights in Haiti. \u201cAll of these countries that are contributing their young men and women (to the MSS), how can we make it safer for them to do their job? One way the US could help immediately and directly would be to really seriously crack down on the flow of illegal weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gangs have literally nothing else; their only currency is intimidation and fear.\u201d Defying a global arms embargo Eighteen months ago, the UN Security Council imposed\u00a0an arms embargo on\u00a0Haiti, which bans the export of weapons to anyone in the country other than the government. The US has also taken independent steps to crack down on illicit exports, appointing a regional coordinator for firearms prosecution in the Caribbean and a\u00a0special unit\u00a0to investigate transnational crimes in\u00a0Haiti. Yet the guns keep coming. In January, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) warned that\u00a0Haiti-bound firearms and ammunition were being \u201croutinely incorporated into outbound shipments at warehouses near seaports and airports\u201d in Florida, citing interviews with US customs officials. The following month,\u00a0Haiti\u2019s gangs put their weapons to devastating use, taking the country hostage in an explosion of coordinated violence that forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign, and led to the creation of a transitional governing council that has so far been mired in disagreement. \u201cThe planes have not stopped flying. There continue to be exchanges of both ammunition and arms across the border,\u201d Sylvie Bertrand, the UNODC regional representative, told CNN recently, urging the global community to enforce the arms embargo. But amid today\u2019s chaos, experts say it is likely becoming easier than ever for the gangs to resupply, as they now control major routes and infrastructure to bypass official controls. \u201cThere are always weapons coming in. There are always bullets,\u201d Vitel\u2019homme Innocent, leader of the Kraze Bary\u00e9 gang, told CNN in April, his masked entourage bristling with a globally manufactured assortment of firepower. Weapons experts who later analyzed some of CNN\u2019s images from the encounter said they could spot weapons and accessory parts originating from Israel, Turkey, the Czech Republic, probably Brazil \u2013 and, overwhelmingly, from the United States. An \u2018iron river\u2019 from the United States The guns\u00a0Haiti\u2019s gangs wield are a mix of stolen and smuggled, and the United States is by far the main source of the latter, according to UN experts. From 2020 to 2022, over 80% of the weapons seized in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0and submitted to US authorities for tracing were manufactured in or imported from the United States,\u00a0UNODC\u00a0reported in January,\u00a0citing the most-recent available tracing data. \u00a0They are typically purchased in the US from federally licensed retail outlets, gun shows or pawn shops through \u201cstraw man\u201d intermediaries, the agency also found. It\u2019s all part of a phenomenon that experts in Latin America and the Caribbean call the \u201ciron river\u201d \u2013 a flood of guns bought in US states with lax gun laws, and then shipped across the region to criminal groups. The Mexican government, which has been outspoken about the issue, currently has a $10 billion lawsuit pending against several US gun manufacturers whose products, it says, arm powerful cartels. A senior agent at the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which investigates the diversion of lawfully purchased guns to illegal ends, told CNN that Miami is a significant source of weapons sent to\u00a0Haiti, which have historically been trafficked in small freighters by family networks. \u201cThose are difficult to enforce because they\u2019re not your typical commercial freighter\u2026 it\u2019s relatively easy to conceal a small number of firearms in those shipments,\u201d he said. Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia are also sources of weapons trafficked to the Caribbean, where the ATF has a specialized gun intelligence unit to track and stop such flows, he added. Asked whether the US was doing enough, he emphasized that combatting gun trafficking was a top priority. \u201cIt is a very high priority of the United States government and ATF\u2019s role in that, to stem the flow of illegal firearms, whether domestic or international, and particularly places like\u00a0Haiti\u00a0where the rule of law is under extreme threat.\u201d In January, Joly Germine \u2013 leader of the gang 400 Mawozo \u2013 pleaded guilty to\u00a0US charges over a gunrunning scheme\u00a0that saw dozens of rifles, handguns and a shotgun purchased legally in Florida under false pretenses, and smuggled into\u00a0Haiti. Land of mountains From above, traces of Haiti\u2019s extensive smuggling networks come into focus: the scars of a clandestine airstrip in its sun-bleached Central Plateau, a dock jutting from gang-held territory into the still waters of the Gulf of Gonave. Sea and air are the main means of transport for the guns and the drugs trans-shipments that fund more weapons purchases, experts say. And while\u00a0Haitian authorities have seen some successes in seizing illicit cargo over the years, the dramatic peaks and plains of this \u201cland of mountains\u201d add difficulty for an already understaffed police force and customs agency. Haiti\u2019s secluded and sparsely populated rural areas are ideal for landings and take-offs by small planes aiming to avoid observation. There are at least 11 known informal or clandestine airstrips in the country, according to UNODC, many originally built for humanitarian purposes following the country\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake. \u201cHere, you don\u2019t have anything around you. So, you just go, probably in the middle of the night, with a couple vehicles parked on each side of the improvised runway so the pilot can identify the area. They land, drop off or pick up stuff, and take off again all outside of\u00a0Haitian jurisdiction,\u201d a\u00a0security expert in Port-au-Prince told CNN. The sea is the preferred option for arms smugglers given the weight of their cargo.\u00a0Haiti\u2019s roughly horseshoe shape offers\u00a0over 1,100 miles of coastline, a challenging distance to comprehensively patrol for\u00a0Haiti\u2019s coast guard. Haiti\u2019s south in particular has emerged as a strategic location for smugglers, the UNODC reported in April, offering entry points for cocaine from South America, cannabis from Jamaica and firearms from across the region. \u201cOne popular method of moving illegal products involves \u201cbanana boats,\u201d go-fast vessels that arrive at night, beach on coastal banana plantations, and are subsequently destroyed after unloading their cargo,\u201d the UNODC report details. Guns and ammunition that arrive in the south are frequently sent onward to Port-au-Prince via the gang-controlled Route National 3, it also said, identifying the Mariani gang, Grand Ravine gang, and 5 Segond gang as \u201cmajor players in the organization and distribution of arms, munitions and drugs.\u201d In 2022, 5 Segond group attacked\u00a0Haiti\u2019s largest flour mill. It would have been an incongruous target if not for its location, positioned right next to Port-au-Prince Bay with a large jetty to accept deliveries. Just about a mile inland lies a major highway, and in between the two is a massive warehouse; a perfect distribution set-up for any import entrepreneur. Today, the entire area is controlled by 5 Segond, with security sources telling CNN that they believe the mill has been taken over and no longer functions. \u201cIzo has the jetty, so he has access to the sea. And boats keep coming in and out of that area, which again is completely controlled by his gang\u2026 and is kept under tight control, with barricades in the surroundings,\u201d the same security expert said, referring to 5 Segond\u2019s rapper frontman\u00a0Andre Johnson, who often posts videos of gang members flashing guns and paramilitary gear set to music on social media. Containers and corruption Contraband arriving via secretive small boats and planes is just part of the picture. Last month,\u00a0Haitian National Police and Customs agents seized\u00a0more than two dozen firearms, including 12 assault rifles, and nearly a thousand cartridges\u00a0from a shipping container that had arrived\u00a0in Haiti\u2019s northern city of Cap\u00a0Haitien. Drugs and arms smuggling has a long history in\u00a0Haiti, much of it facilitated through official channels by government agents and even, in one 2022 case, by a rogue Episcopal church staffer who allegedly hid guns and thousands of rounds in a shipping container reportedly labeled as church donations, before it was seized by customs agents in Port-au-Prince. Customs officials\u00a0trying to do their job\u00a0on the front lines in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0can face threats to their lives. In 2018, local press reported that several customs agents at the Malpasse border crossing between the Dominican Republic and\u00a0Haiti\u00a0were burned alive after an argument erupted in the course of a cargo inspection. Allegations of smuggling and gang affiliations have also been made at the highest levels of\u00a0Haiti\u2019s government. Four former\u00a0Haitian senators\u00a0have been sanctioned by the US for alleged drug trafficking, as have multiple past presidents and prime ministers of\u00a0Haiti\u00a0for allegedly financing the country\u2019s gangs. They\u2019re part of what gang leader Innocent refers to as the country\u2019s \u201coligarchs,\u201d who historically created and armed local gangs to become their enforcers-for-hire as they profited from white-collar crime schemes. \u201cAs a\u00a0Haitian human rights defender, I can\u2019t say that all the responsibility for these guns is on the US \u2013 I think it\u2019s the\u00a0Haitian government too. They need to regain control of the port, they need to control customs. The problem is corruption,\u201d says Esperance, the human rights advocate. That\u2019s why, he says, the planned deployment of an international police force to restore calm to\u00a0Haiti\u00a0is destined to fail unless the US and global community also commit to fighting corruption, building frameworks for good governance, and closing legal loopholes abused by the country\u2019s elite. \u201cNow, of course, the government is completely destabilized, it\u2019s easy for the gangs to smuggle weapons themselves. But how did they begin? Just two years ago, smuggling was going through official channels, and it happened that way because everyone was corrupt,\u201d Esperance said. Bertrand, the UNODC representative, also emphasized the importance of building up\u00a0Haiti\u2019s institutions as its new government takes shape. Her agency is working to strengthen the country\u2019s customs authority and coast guard, for example, including providing much-needed equipment from protective gear to cargo scanners. \u201cIt\u2019s time for people in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0to live peacefully \u2013 for their kids to go back to school, for them to be able to eat every day.\u201d And that means, she says, ensuring that \u201cnational authorities are well-trained, well-equipped, and ready to face and curb down the level of violence.\u201d CNN reached out to Homeland Security Investigations, part of the US Department of Homeland Security; the US Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement, Haiti\u2019s National Police and Haiti\u2019s General Customs Administration for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/americas/haiti-mss-unodc-guns-drugs-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Gallant\u2019s remarks come as serious questions about Israel\u2019s long-term strategy in Gaza are being raised both inside and outside of Israel after the Israeli military sent troops back into areas of northern Gaza it had withdrawn from months ago to battle Hamas militants who had returned amid a power vacuum. Israeli military officials have quietly warned that the lack of a long-term strategy for post-war governance will result in this pattern repeating throughout Gaza. And top US officials are doing so publicly, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken warning Wednesday that Israel must \u201cfocus on what the future can and must be\u201d to avoid \u201canarchy and a vacuum that\u2019s likely to be filled by chaos.\u201d Gallant has previously said he opposes Israeli control over post-war Gaza, but his remarks Wednesday were his most direct on the topic as he warned of the consequences of a long-term Israeli military presence in Gaza and called out Netanyahu directly. \u201cI will not agree to the establishment of Israeli military rule in Gaza. Israel must not establish civilian rule in Gaza,\u201d he said, warning that a military occupation of the Palestinian territory would take a heavy toll in \u201cbloodshed and victims, as well as a heavy economic price,\u201d he warned. Netanyahu appeared to respond to Gallant\u2019s remarks later on Wednesday, saying in a video statement posted to social media that neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority would be acceptable entities to govern Gaza. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to replace Hamastan with Fatahstan,\u201d he said, referring to Fatah, the Palestinian political party that dominates the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu also said that a complete routing of Hamas would be his prerequisite for a new civilian government in Gaza.\u00a0\u201cAs long as Hamas remains in place, no other entity would enter Gaza to administer the civilian aspects, especially not the Palestinian Authority,\u201d he said. Gallant\u2019s remarks set off a political firestorm in Israel, with a number of right-wing lawmakers condemning\u00a0Gallant\u2019s statement and some even urging Netanyahu to remove him from his position. War cabinet member Minister Benny Gantz meanwhile has endorsed Gallant\u2019s stance, saying he was \u201cspeaking the truth\u201d. The public clash between Gallant and Netanyahu follows repeated calls by the US for Israel to produce a clear plan for post-war Gaza. \u201cWe do not support and will not support an Israeli occupation. We also of course, do not support Hamas governance in Gaza,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony\u00a0Blinken\u00a0told journalists at press conference\u00a0in\u00a0Kyiv, Ukraine, on Wednesday, adding, \u201cWe also can\u2019t have anarchy and a vacuum that\u2019s likely to be filled by chaos.\u201d \u201cThere needs to be a clear and concrete plan, and we look to Israel to come forward with\u00a0its\u00a0ideas,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/middleeast/israel-gaza-yoav-gallant-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_14_world_giant-hummingbirds-new-species-backpacks-scn", "text": "The world\u2019s largest hummingbird has been hiding in plain sight for centuries \u2014 and scientists only discovered the species is distinct from another giant species after attaching tiny backpacks to hummingbirds to understand migration patterns. Along the way, researchers also identified the longest hummingbird migration journey, which spans a 5,200-mile (8,368-kilometer) round trip, or about the distance between New York City and Buenos Aires. Questions around the giant hummingbird of South America have persisted since naturalist Charles Darwin first observed them in 1834 during his expedition aboard the HMS Beagle. Darwin observed the birds, which are about eight times the size of typical hummingbirds, breeding along the Pacific coast of Chile, but then they seemed to completely vanish after breeding. He speculated that the giant hummingbirds migrated to the Atacama Desert region, located in northern Chile. Now, new research has revealed that there are two distinct species of giant hummingbird in South America \u2014 the northern giant hummingbird that lives year-round in the Andes, and the migratory southern giant hummingbird \u2014 and they have been evolving separately for millions of years. A new study describing the birds appeared Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many animal migrations of large, charismatic species that are still totally unknown, but that was the case for southern giant hummingbirds,\u201d said lead study author Jessie Williamson, a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow and Rose Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York. \u201cWe wanted to finally solve this mystery.\u201d Designing backpacks for hummingbirds Giant hummingbirds differ from hundreds of other hummingbird species in many other ways. \u201cEverything about the giants is anomalous \u2014 they are not only far larger (two times or more) than the second largest hummingbird \u2014 but their wingbeats and heartbeats are far slower,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cAnd their wings are proportionately longer, so they have a completely unique appearance in flight \u2014 almost like a hovering swift.\u201d Swifts are medium-size fast-flying birds included in the family Apodidae, which also includes hummingbirds. But studying hummingbirds, no matter their size, is an arduous task. The team worked with local landowners and residents of villages across Peru and Chile during fieldwork. \u201cCapturing Giant Hummingbirds is very challenging,\u201d said study coauthor Emil Bautista, researcher at the Centro de Ornitolog\u00eda y Biodiversidad in Lima, in a statement.\u00a0\u201cThey watch everything, and they know their territories well. We had to be strategic in choosing sites for our nets. If Giant Hummingbirds see something unusual, they won\u2019t visit that spot. They are more observant than other birds.\u201d The research team spent nine months camping in rural parts of Chile and Peru, working from sea level to the steep, cactus-strewn slopes of the Andes and going without electricity or running water for weeks at a time, Williamson said. Williamson designed a backpack harness, using a type of jewelry cord to attach a microtracking device to 57 hummingbirds in Chile. \u201cDesigning appropriate backpack harnesses for giant hummingbirds took two field seasons of trial and error, including practicing the harness design on a stuffed hummingbird finger puppet \u2026 with a paper mach\u00e9 mock-up geolocator device, plus lots of consultation with colleagues who have experience tracking small migratory birds,\u201d Williamson said. The geolocator backpacks weighed 0.3 grams and were designed to be small and light enough so they didn\u2019t interfere with the birds\u2019 style of flight. Williamson published a paper describing her design and how to safely attach it to hummingbirds in the Journal of Avian Biology in June 2021. \u201cHummingbirds are challenging to work with because they are lightweight with long wings and short legs. They\u2019re nature\u2019s tiny acrobats,\u201d she said. But it wasn\u2019t enough to catch the birds, attach the backpacks and release them \u2014 the birds had to be recaptured for the team to collect the data. The researchers were able to retrieve data from eight of the geolocators by recapturing the birds using fine mesh nets called \u201cmist nets,\u201d commonly used by ornithologists, Williamson said. What the team discovered was that migratory southern giant hummingbirds are like human mountaineers. High-altitude bird flights The geolocator data revealed that migratory giant hummingbirds can ascend from sea level to more than 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) in elevation, and their travels brought them as far north as the Peruvian Andes. But the birds don\u2019t just fly directly to these towering altitudes. Instead, like mountaineers, they pause during their ascent for days at a time to allow their blood and lungs to acclimate to lower oxygen levels. By tracking the birds\u2019 migration with geolocators and satellite transmitters, the scientists discovered what they believe to be the longest known hummingbird migration, spanning 5,200 miles (8,368 kilometers) from the Chilean coast up to the Andes in Peru and back. As the researchers studied the birds and compared them with genetic data from museum specimens, they realized there were two types of giant hummingbirds. \u201cNobody had figured out where migratory giant hummingbirds go because they were hiding among the non-migratory giant hummingbirds,\u201d said senior study author Christopher Witt, professor of biology and director of the Museum of Southwestern Biology at the University of New Mexico, in a statement. \u201cThe two forms of giant hummingbird look almost identical \u2014 for centuries, ornithologists and birders never noticed that they were different. We couldn\u2019t have figured this out without the miniaturized trackers.\u201d A shift in migratory behavior likely drove the difference between the two species. By studying museum species, including a 154-year-old specimen, the researchers realized that the two types of giant hummingbird had been evolving separately for about 3 million years. \u201cThey are as different from each other as chimpanzees are from bonobos,\u201d Witt said. \u201cThe two species do overlap on their high elevation wintering grounds. It\u2019s mind-boggling that until now nobody figured out the Giant Hummingbird mystery, yet these two species have been separate for millions of years.\u201d The northern giant hummingbird, which lives in the high Andes year-round, has a different lung and blood capacity compared with the southern giant hummingbird. After realizing the two birds were entirely different species, the study team named the northern giant hummingbird Patagona chaski, a nod to chaskis, the Quecha word for messengers, of the Inca Empire. Quecha is a group of indigenous languages used across Peru and neighboring countries. \u201cChaski runners were surefooted sprinters, capable of speed and endurance on steep slopes, in part due to high-capacity lungs and rigorous aerobic training at high elevations,\u201d the authors wrote in the study. New bird mysteries emerge The researchers reported that both populations of giant hummingbirds are stable, and some can even be seen enjoying nectar from backyard feeders. Now that the two distinct species have been confirmed, the team wants to better understand how the populations interact, especially when they live in the same parts of the Andes during the winter. \u201cWe have to figure out where these two forms come together and how they interact,\u201d Witt said. \u201cDo they compete, is one dominant over the other, how might they partition resources, and do they mix or spatially segregate within the winter range? Lots of interesting questions to pursue!\u201d Williamson also wants to work with botanists to understand how the birds\u2019 migration patterns may have coevolved with the flowering plants the birds use for sustenance on their journeys. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in how Southern Giant Hummingbirds make such dramatic shifts in elevation during migration,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThey\u2019re like miniature mountain climbers. How do they change their physiology to facilitate these movements?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/world/giant-hummingbirds-new-species-backpacks-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

At the time, the airline released a statement saying the crew member was enjoying \u201ca brief moment of fun,\u201d before confirming \u201cthis is not our normal procedure.\u201d A Southwest representative told CNN Travel the airline was also \u201caware\u201d of last week\u2019s locker incident and is currently \u201clooking into it.\u201d Not a \u2018certifiable place for passengers\u2019 Given passengers are advised to stay in their seats for the duration of a plane journey \u2013 usually with their seatbelt fastened \u2013 it should go without saying that climbing into the overhead locker is a bad idea. As British flight attendant Kris Major tells CNN Travel, the overhead bin is \u201cnot a certifiable place to be as a passenger.\u201d \u201cIf we encountered turbulence they could get hurt \u2013 if they got blown out they could really get hurt and they could also hurt someone underneath them,\u201d says Major, adding that a passenger in an overhead bin also wouldn\u2019t have access to an oxygen mask in the event of an emergency. His words are echoed by Guido van Geenen, vice president of corporate communications for overhead bin supplier Diehl Aviation. Van Geenen tells CNN Travel that while the lockers are designed to accommodate \u201cquite a lot of weight\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a safe place for passengers. \u201cClimbing in and out of an overhead bin may also be dangerous,\u201d adds van Geenen. In order to get into a locker, a person would have to clamber onto the back of the airplane seat, which could buckle under the weight. Van Geenen also makes the important point that \u201cbins do not have a way to open them from the inside\u201d \u2013 meaning if you\u2019re inside a locker and someone closes it from the outside \u201cyou have a problem.\u201d \u201cAll in all, we definitely do not recommend using the overhead bins for a nap,\u201d says van Geenen. \u201cThey are designed to safely hold the passengers\u2019 bags, but not made for a casual nap.\u201d Flight attendant\u2019s perspective Flight attendant Major\u2019s witnessed a lot in his 25 years of flying, but he\u2019s never actually seen a traveler inside the luggage bin. \u201cIf I saw a passenger trying to climb into an overhead locker, it would take me a few seconds to believe that was what was happening in front of me,\u201d he says. That said, Major admits he has \u201cseen photographs of crew in lockers\u201d and suggests it\u2019s the kind of thing that, while \u201cpretty frowned upon\u201d does happen from time to time when crew have the aircraft to themselves before boarding. While there\u2019s been a recent uptick in unruly passenger behavior on airplanes, Major says that if he encountered a passenger inside the locker, he wouldn\u2019t automatically assume they were being deliberately disruptive. His goal, first and foremost, would be to \u201cjust get them out\u201d and ensure they were safe. \u201cIt would depend on why they were up there as to my reaction,\u201d says Major. \u201cI would get them out, and then ascertain what was going on. I would assume that they were either under the influence of something, or mentally unwell.\u201d If a passenger spots another passenger inside an overhead locker, Major advises they notify a crew member, rather than intervene themselves \u2013 this same advice applies if passengers witness any untoward or unusual behavior on board. \u201cA passenger could inadvertently create a passenger disruption incident, because they could create conflict \u2013 whereas the crew are trained to de-escalate,\u201d Major says. Major also discourages passengers from filming and posting about an incident like this one. What might seem like a funny viral moment could have negative consequences, says Major, especially if the person in the video is already vulnerable. Future of overhead lockers While the airplane overhead locker is currently out of bounds for passengers, some as-yet-to-be-realized airplane cabin concepts reimagine this area as a space for travelers to stretch out and relax mid-flight. Take Toyota Boshoku\u2019s CLOUD CAPSULE concept, which envisages the area above the economy seat as an additional space for passengers to retreat to once the airplane reaches cruising altitude. In 2021, this design was nominated for a Crystal Cabin Award, a prestigious aviation design prize. While this concept might seem futuristic, the idea of passengers making use of the overhead locker space has some precedent. Way back in the 1950s, travelers who flew with Pan American Airways across the Atlantic on the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser were able to sleep in overhead compartments mid-flight. Major says flight attendants \u201calways look out for future developments,\u201d but he suggests crew are more focused on overhead lockers becoming bigger to accommodate more bags, rather than being adapted to accommodate passengers. \u201cHand luggage is one of the biggest issues facing flight attendants,\u201d says Major. \u201cIt causes problems if we can\u2019t get all those bags away or if we can\u2019t get passengers to put their bags away or if they\u2019re bringing too much on\u2026\u201d On most flights, overhead locker space is \u201cat a premium\u201d as Major puts it. Bins are so packed with travelers\u2019 bags and belongings that the idea of a person squeezing in there too is laughable. But Major is keen to stress that while the idea of someone climbing into the overhead locker might \u201cseem funny,\u201d it\u2019s important to remember an airplane cabin is a very specific environment and safety restrictions are there for a reason. \u201cYou\u2019re barrelling through the sky at 35,000 feet \u2013 500, 600 miles per hour,\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to create an issue on board the aircraft, it\u2019s not the place to do it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/airplane-passenger-overhead-bin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_inappropriate-behavior-shuts-down-dublin-new-york-portal", "text": "That didn\u2019t take long. Less than a week after two public sculptures featuring a livestream between Dublin, Ireland, and New York City debuted, \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d in real-time interactions between people in the two cities has prompted a temporary shutdown. The two sculptures, \u201cThe Portals,\u201d are round, lens-like installations with a 24/7 video link to allow residents and visitors in the two cities to interact with each other. Social media videos have shown people flashing body parts to people on the other side. The installation does not include audio. The creators of the sculptures are now \u201cinvestigating possible technical solutions to inappropriate behaviour by a small minority of people in front of the Portal,\u201d according to a statement from the Dublin City Council. \u201cDublin City Council had hoped to have a solution in place today, but unfortunately the preferred solution, which would have involved blurring, was not satisfactory,\u201d the City Council said late Tuesday. The team behind the sculptures, Portals.org, is looking at other options. The City Council planned to switch off the live stream at 10 p.m. local time Tuesday and said that Portals.org expected to be able to turn it on again later this week. \u201cWe are delighted by how many people have been enjoying the Portal since it was launched last week,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt has become a global phenomenon and it is important to note that the overwhelming majority of people interacting with the Dublin Portal have behaved appropriately.\u201d Organizers in New York also underlined that the inappropriate behavior has come from \u201ca very small minority\u201d of visitors. \u201cIn New York, we have had a set of protocols in place since the Portal\u2019s launch, including 24/7 on-site security and barriers to prevent people from stepping onto the Portal,\u201d said a statement from Flatiron NoMad Partnership, one of the project\u2019s organizers in New York. While the creators and their partners in both cities work on \u201cadditional solutions to limit such behavior appearing on the livestream,\u201d the New York Portal will be turned off for a few days starting at 5 p.m. local time Tuesday, according to Flatiron NoMad Partnership. On the Dublin side, the portal is installed facing the capital city\u2019s main street, O\u2019Connell Street. In New York, the portal sculpture is located on the Flatiron South Public Plaza at Broadway, Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street. The Portals are the brainchild of Lithuanian artist Benediktas Gylys. The project\u2019s intention, according to Daith\u00ed de R\u00f3iste, Dublin\u2019s Lord Mayor, was to expand global connections. \u201cOne of my key aims as Lord Mayor is to make the City more inclusive. The Portals project embodies this, bringing together technology, engineering and art to bring communities from across the world closer together and to allow people to meet and connect outside of their social circles and cultures,\u201d de R\u00f3iste said in a news release on May 8 announcing the project\u2019s debut. The Lord Mayor noted the \u201cdeep historical and cultural bond\u201d between the two cities. In July, Dublin expects to connect to destinations in Poland, Brazil and Lithuania, according to de R\u00f3iste\u2019s statement. \u201cI would encourage Dubliners and visitors to the City to come and interact with the sculpture and extend an Irish welcome and kindness to cities all over the world,\u201d de R\u00f3iste\u2019s May 8 statement said. De R\u00f3iste said the portals project is part of events lined up to coincide with Dublin\u2019s 2024 EU Capital of Smart Tourism Designation. The Dublin-New York city pairing isn\u2019t the first real-time bridge between cities through these sculptures. The first Portals, according to the organization\u2019s website, linked Vilnius, Lithuania, with Lublin, Poland, in 2021.

{"id": "2024_05_07_europe_eden-golan-euroviison-israel-malmo-intl-cmd", "text": "In the seven-decade history of Eurovision, it\u2019s unlikely that a three-word slogan has been repeated so readily by the song contest\u2019s extravagant contestants, tireless organizers or cagey media managers: The world, they insist, can be \u201cUnited by Music.\u201d But Malmo, the Swedish city hosting the kitsch cultural phenomenon this year, is increasingly divided by Eurovision \u2013 and as the contest\u2019s grand final approaches on Saturday, organizers are struggling to keep the controversy over Israel\u2019s participation from taking over the event. Israeli contestant Eden Golan was booed by sections of the crowd during her semi-final and during public dress rehearsals this week, but progressed to Saturday\u2019s showpiece event. Some of her fellow contestants have also expressed concerns about the country\u2019s involvement, while large pro-Palestinian protests have taken place in Malmo to coincide with the first Eurovision live shows. On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Golan in a video message for performing in the face of what he called \u201can ugly wave of antisemitism\u201d while still \u201crepresenting the state of Israel with great honor.\u201d The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the contest, has tried desperately to keep the focus of the event on the performers, but critics have called for a boycott of the event over their refusal to exclude Israel, while it conducts its war against Hamas in Gaza. And on Thursday, after Golan was announced as a finalist, the very real prospect of Israel winning the competition emerged \u2013 an outcome that would cause huge headaches for the EBU and give Israel the right to host next year\u2019s event. Israel soars among bookmakers Saturday\u2019s Eurovision final will be watched by more than 150 million people around the world on TV and around 15,000 fans gathered inside the Malmo Arena. But the concert may be only the second-best attended event in the city that evening; a pro-Palestinian protest, calling for Israel\u2019s removal from the contest, is expecting at least 20,000 attendees, and possibly far more. The competition \u2013 which tries desperately to retain its \u201capolitical\u201d tag \u2013 has become the largest cultural event so far to be rocked by the repercussions of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Israel\u2019s military assault has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza since it was launched in response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks on Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Those protesting or boycotting the song contest claim it is \u201cartwashing\u201d the conflict; others defend Israel\u2019s inclusion, insisting the contest should not be dragged into geopolitics. \u201cPolitics does influence the event from time to time,\u201d Paul Jordan, a fan and researcher of the contest who worked in its communications team from 2015 to 2018, told CNN. But this year, \u201cthe presence of Israel has become such a big issue (that) I think it\u2019s going to overshadow the event,\u201d he said. Weeks of simmering tension over the question came to the fore in Malmo this week, ahead of the contest\u2019s semi-finals on Tuesday and Thursday. And they are leading perhaps the tensest three minutes in the contest\u2019s history, when Golan performs live. Thursday\u2019s second semi-final saw Israel secure a place in the final, with the song \u201cHurricane.\u201d And minutes later, she soared to second-place among some bookmakers\u2019 odds for the grand final, after a moment from the Italian broadcast circulated on social media. Italy\u2019s broadcaster, RAI, seemingly revealed the results of its public\u2019s televote during their live show, which national networks are not meant to do. The results showed that Israel had picked up 39% of the Italian public vote in the 16-strong semi-final, winning among Italian voters in a landslide. RAI told CNN the results were published in error due to a \u201ctechnical issue,\u201d and the broadcaster apologized to the EBU, which in turn said it had asked RAI to \u201creview their procedures.\u201d If Israel wins on Saturday, it would have the right to host next year\u2019s contest. The EBU\u2019s director general, Noel Curran, told CNN that in that event, the EBU \u201cwill do what we always do,\u201d sitting down with Israeli broadcaster KAN to plan the logistics. But such an outcome would cause major headaches for the EBU, ensuring that the contest is mired in geopolitics and controversy for another year, and make it difficult to keep fellow broadcasters onside. Ukraine did not host the event after winning in 2022 due to Russia\u2019s invasion, so second-placed finishers the United Kingdom hosted a celebratory edition of the contest on Kyiv\u2019s behalf. The EBU may seek to find such a compromise if Israel\u2019s war with Hamas is ongoing when it plans the event; but it could find it more difficult to find a country willing to host on Israel\u2019s behalf, given the likely backlash from sections of the Eurovision community. An increasingly political song contest It is difficult to pierce the celebratory bubble that surrounds the competition each year. But even among Eurovision\u2019s media-managed contestants, there are some rumblings of discontent this time. \u201cIt is frustrating. I don\u2019t agree with it at all. It doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Bambie Thug, Ireland\u2019s participant, told CNN of extensive rules restricting any form of pro-Palestinian statement during the event. The singer previously released a statement resisting calls to boycott the event, saying they intended instead to provide a \u201cpro-Palestinian voice\u201d in Malmo. They told CNN that Israel\u2019s involvement in the competition was the \u201cwrong decision.\u201d Founded by the EBU in 1956 as a unity-fostering project between national broadcasters, Eurovision has been rocked and buffeted for decades by the continent\u2019s geopolitical currents. It offers an unrivaled soft power-building platform to member states with poor human rights records, like Azerbaijan and, until two years ago, Russia. But this year is the most difficult yet for the EBU, which decided against excluding Israel over the country\u2019s war in Gaza, whereas Russia was barred after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago \u2013 contrasting stances that led to calls of double standards. \u201cThe two are not comparative at all,\u201d Curran, the EBU\u2019s director general, told CNN, insisting that Israel\u2019s national broadcaster KAN did not breach the contest\u2019s rules as Russia\u2019s did, which is the ultimate test of eligibility for the contest. \u201cIf we start across the board just deciding that we\u2019re going to exclude people, on the basis of geopolitical situations or terrible things that might be happening in the world, then every year we\u2019re just going to have groups of people calling for someone to be excluded \u2013 be it Azerbaijan, be it somebody else,\u201d Curran said. \u201cWe want to try and keep the contest as non-political as we can,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s hard.\u201d He may be understating matters. Publicists representing a swathe of Europe\u2019s most eccentric musical artists in Malmo have been especially cautious with their talent, seeking to protect them from questions relating to the protests taking place just a few yards from their hotels. CNN asked to interview Golan, Israel\u2019s performer, for this story, but was told it would only be arranged if CNN provided the questions beforehand, which goes against standard journalistic practices. The EBU was already forced to intervene when Golan\u2019s initial song submission, \u201cOctober Rain,\u201d was deemed to too closely reference Hamas\u2019s October 7 attacks on Israel. And the EBU has worked hard to keep dissent from seeping into Malmo Arena. Long-standing rules preventing flags of non-competing countries and territories mean that Palestinian flags are banned from the crowd, which Bambie Thug told CNN they \u201c100%\u201d disagreed with. Artists are not allowed to make statements either, though some may risk the punishment \u2013 a fine for their broadcaster \u2013 to do so, as Iceland\u2019s act did in 2019, when they held up Palestinian flags during the contest, which was held in Israel. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want them to do that, quite obviously,\u201d Curran said. \u201cThat is not something that we want artists to do, and it\u2019s in the rules that they shouldn\u2019t do that, and can\u2019t do that.\u201d When asked by CNN, the EBU did not rule out adjusting sound levels on the broadcast to obscure booing, if it occurs during the Israeli performance. But, for all their efforts, Eurovision bosses will hold their breaths while Golan sings in Saturday\u2019s grand final. \u201cThe real worry would be any threat of violence, particularly towards the singers,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cThe worst nightmare could be a stage invasion.\u201d The latter occurred during the United Kingdom\u2019s performance in 2018, when a man snatched the microphone from singer SuRie and screamed a message before being removed. \u2018It has divided the city\u2019 As Malmo sought to stage a week\u2019s worth of events and performances to celebrate Eurovision, it encountered a problem: artists kept dropping out, following pressure from pro-Palestinian groups urging a boycott of the contest. \u201cIt has divided the city, in a way,\u201d admitted Karin Karlsson, who is in charge of staging the events in Malmo. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will solve any questions when it comes to the war in Gaza by boycotting,\u201d she said. In total, she said 20 artists had dropped out of performing in the city. But Karlsson is undeterred. \u201cI sleep well,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to show everybody a vibrant, super diverse city, where we can live side by side but still think differently.\u201d She hopes that Malmo is on track to fulfilling that goal. \u201cBut you never know. It\u2019s uncertain at the moment.\u201d Her efforts may have been complicated by the choice of host. \u201c(Malmo) has this history of resistance and solidarity, and it\u2019s a working class city, but at the same time the municipality has tried to rebrand Malmo as a more global city,\u201d Elina Pahnke, a Malmo-based journalist covering culture for the Aftonbladet newspaper, told CNN. That has caused tensions with some residents, she said, who want resources and time spent on public services, rather than international spectacles. The city is also home to large Muslim and Palestinian populations. Weekly pro-Palestinian protests have been held since Israel\u2019s war in Gaza began in October, and the protest during Saturday\u2019s live final could be the biggest since those early weeks. \u201cWe hope to show the EBU that the people of Malmo reject their attempt at artwashing,\u201d said Mohammad Ghannam, who has led the movement to boycott Eurovision as part of Sweden\u2019s Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) group. A massive security operation is in place; a Swedish police spokesperson told CNN it was one of the largest Malmo has ever seen, and involves officers from Denmark and Norway as well as Sweden. And last week, Israel\u2019s National Security Council raised its travel warning to Malmo, urging Israelis planning to attend Eurovision to reconsider whether they need to do so. It cited \u201ctangible concern that terrorists will exploit the protest and the anti-Israel atmosphere to carry out an attack on Israelis,\u201d and described Malmo as a hub for \u201canti-Israel protests.\u201d Lara Yosef, a 30-year-old Syrian migrant to Malmo who will be attending Saturday\u2019s demonstration, said that when she walks past Eurovision advertising in her city, \u201cI see blood.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hoping that some artists will surprise us and (make) some statements on stage,\u201d Yosef said. Amid those tensions, some artists have complained of online harassment and abuse, while others have praised the pro-Palestinian demonstrators. \u201cPower to them for protesting,\u201d Bambie Thug said, before their media manager quickly asked CNN to return to questions centered on their music. But many more are working to block out what is becoming a near-deafening distraction, joining Eurovision\u2019s organizers in offering delicate comments. \u201c(Our) sympathy is (with) all people who say that war is sh*t,\u201d said Ukrainian contestant Alyona Alyona. \u201cBecause who, if not we, can say what is war, and how sh*t it is?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/europe/eden-golan-euroviison-israel-malmo-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

The agreement will see each side contribute $625 million to the project, which will see the Jaguars current home - EverBank Stadium \u2013 undergo wholesale renovations, per the city. The city will then spend another $150 million to get the stadium ready for construction in 2026. The proposal, announced last year, still has to go through two key stages before it is officially given the go-ahead. Firstly, city council members will vote on the project in June, with a majority of 19 members needed for it to pass. If that goes through, it would then be voted on at the annual NFL owners meeting in October, where 24 of the 32 owners would need to give the proposal the green light. \u201cIt\u2019s with great pride and excitement that we present this historic deal,\u201d Jacksonville mayor Donna Deegan posted on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s a crucial step in the development of a thriving downtown which generates the commercial revenue that will fund so much of what we want to do in neighborhoods across the city.\u201d \u201cJacksonville has the privilege of being an NFL town and this deal will ensure our citizens can enjoy the benefits of that privilege for decades to come.\u201d The proposal would keep the Jaguars in Jacksonville for another 30 years and would come with a non-relocation agreement. Construction would begin after the 2025 season, with the Jaguars playing in front of a reduced capacity in 2026, per the city. The team\u2019s home games would then take place away from Jacksonville the following season while the stadium is renovated. The Jaguars say that their plans \u201ccall for a reimagined stadium with an environmentally friendly and cost-effective structure that showcases state-of-the-art innovation.\u201d Among these innovations is a transparent protective canopy that provide sun, wind and rain protection and reduce heat retention by 70%, as well as a 360-degree concourse, \u201cimmersive\u201d in-bowl digital and lighting technology and a subtropical nature park open year-round to visitors. The agreement will still see the Jaguars play one game a year in London. EverBank Stadium\u2019s regular capacity of 67,814 will be reduced to around 63,000, though it can expand to 71,500 for special events such as concerts or college football games.

Standing by, her mother cried, \u201cAhed is dead!\u201d But 18-year-old Bseso was very much alive, and she has survived to tell her story, from a hospital in Greenville, South Carolina. Bseso said that on December 19 last year, she went to the top floor of her house in Gaza to get a cellphone signal when an Israeli tank outside fired at her building. It destroyed part of her home\u2019s wall, which came crashing down on her leg, along with heavy debris. With her neighborhood under siege and no possibility of medical attention, her uncle, who used to work as an orthopedic surgeon, used kitchen supplies to amputate her leg below the knee and dress it with unsterilized gauze. The days that followed were horrifically painful. \u201cFor four days, I couldn\u2019t leave the house because the Israelis wouldn\u2019t let me,\u201d she told CNN through a translator, at the Shriners Children\u2019s hospital. \u201cThere was no medication I could take to inhibit the pain or to help me with my condition. So, I just sat in agony for four days.\u201d The video of her amputation\u202fwent viral\u202fand caught the attention of the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund (PCRF), a US organization that provides free health care to thousands of injured and ill Palestinian children in the Middle East. The organization worked for weeks to evacuate her from northern Gaza and bring her to the United States for medical care, according to Tareq Hailat, head of the Treatment Abroad program at PCRF. She is one of three Palestinians who received PCRF\u2019s help to come to the US for leg injury treatment. At least 1,000 children in Gaza have had one or both legs amputated, UNICEF reported\u202fin December. Though he couldn\u2019t give an exact figure, UNICEF spokesperson Joe English told CNN that the number has since grown. Nearly 26,000 children \u2014 or just over 2% of Gaza\u2019s child population \u2014 were  killed or injured in the Gaza Strip in the first six months of the Israel-Hamas war, according to international nongovernmental organization\u202fSave the Children. From October 7, 2023 \u2014 the date of the Hamas attack on Israel \u2014 to early April, more than 13,800 children were killed and at least 12,009 were injured, the organization said. Avoiding amputations Two-year-old Jood Damo\u2019s\u202fhouse was struck by a tank shell on December 26 last year, killing his mother and fracturing his right leg. His father, Ahmed Damo, who accompanied him to the US, told CNN that the toddler witnessed his mother dying. \u201cTo this day, he still has episodes where he asks about his mom,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, he wakes up in the middle of the night, just crying and screaming, and asking about his mother.\u201d Now, doctors at another hospital in Chicago are assessing whether his injured leg will respond to treatment and grow at the same rate as his left leg. If not, it could significantly delay his path to recovery and treatment plan, PCRF said. Ayham Musalm, 13, said his left leg was fractured and had glass shrapnel lodged in his knee when debris from a strike on a neighbors\u2019 house came straight into his home on December 10. He went months, however, without anyone identifying what was wrong. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to see any physician for a long time,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThen one physician just sewed my wound, and said it wasn\u2019t serious and sent me home.\u201d In the care of Shriners Children\u2019s hospital in Greenville, Musalm has had access to imaging and MRI processes, which helped American experts find the shards of glass inside his knee. That led to surgery and further treatment, and he avoided amputation. He is now in physical therapy. It took PCRF weeks and sometimes months to get children out of Gaza. Besides the time needed to secure their US visas, evacuating the children \u2014\u00a0or even moving them from one part of the strip to the other \u2014\u00a0required Israeli approval, which can be a complicated process, according to Hailat, who works on the evacuations. This delay in treatment for such injuries can result in grave repercussions, said Dr. Amber Alayyan from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders), an international aid NGO. \u201cThe longer they wait without care, the worse it\u2019s going to be,\u201d she said. Alayyan, who has traveled in and out of Gaza several times, said the enclave could have handled the care for such injuries before its\u202fhealthcare system was devastated\u202fby the war. \u201cWe see people who, despite their burns, walk into the clinic without a jaw because the healthcare system has completely collapsed and there are no spaces to take care of these people in the hospitals,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were 3,500 beds in the hospitals in Gaza before the war. But there are so many displaced people living, squatting, seeking shelter in hospitals, that there\u2019s not even space for the patients.\u201d \u201cAs a result, the wounds that these patients are suffering from are beginning to literally rot,\u201d she added. \u201cThey smell now.\u201d In these overwhelming conditions, doctors are struggling to identify infections and types of injuries, and the focus is entirely on saving lives. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to carry out these life-saving amputations because you would have had a system that functioned. You would have had reconstructive surgery. Possibly, you would have had immediate lifesaving surgery possible, and they would have been able to save these limbs,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now we are doing everything we can just to save lives in the moment.\u201d PCRF\u2019s Hailat said he doesn\u2019t know if Bseso\u2019s injury required an amputation either. But with Gaza under siege, and no immediate medical attention, hospital care, and sterilized equipment available, amputation was the only choice. When she arrived in the United States, the bone in her other leg was also deeply infected. Doctors feared that she may have needed both legs amputated, but with adequate care and treatment, she has avoided that outcome. An anxious wait to return home Evacuating to the United States is not the obvious answer for all injured children, Hailat said. The country has accepted 20 children from Gaza for treatment, but Hailat said he has rerouted 17 of them to other nations. Some injuries are so severe that Hailat said he has to choose medical care as quickly as possible \u2014 which means staying in the region \u2014 over expertise and the advanced level of care in the United States. He also said he wants to ensure that the children who are evacuated to the US need treatment that\u2019s specifically available in the country. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to limit how many people we bring to the United States. We would much rather bring people to local areas and local countries around Gaza,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, if specific treatment of that particular child is needed to be done in the United States, then we will go out of our way to ensure that happens. Culture is also important for care and recovery, Hailat said. \u201cCulturally, you don\u2019t want to separate them so far away from their homeland that it\u2019s difficult for them to adapt,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want them to be close to Gaza. This is a very sensitive time, and I don\u2019t want them to feel as though we are separating them from their country.\u201d Back home, Bseso said her mother fell sick as\u202fmalnourishment has plagued northern Gaza. She worriedly waits for more news and updates from home, and she knows that her family would be trying to make their way to the top of their residential building, to find a cell signal to contact her \u2014 the same ritual that put her in the Israeli line of attack. Her hope is to reunite with them in a safe place. \u201cWe really need our family to be with us together,\u201d she said. Musalm, too, wants his treatment to finish so he can return to Gaza and see his family. But there is no knowing when that may be. After their treatments, which Hailat said will most likely take a year, PCRF will ensure it is safe in Gaza before returning the children there. \u201cWe will not do that if it puts them in danger,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we will have to wait to ensure that Gaza is able to be a safe location for them to return.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/middleeast/palestinian-young-amputees-us-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

More storms in the coming days will raise the risk once again of flash flooding, damaging winds and hail over the hard-hit region. Powerful hurricane-force wind gusts and a possible tornado ripped through Louisiana, killing at least three people there.  A woman who was nine months pregnant and her unborn child were killed in West Baton Rouge Parish when a tree fell onto the woman\u2019s mobile home Monday night, according to the state\u2019s department of health. About 45 miles west, a woman was killed in St. Martin Parish after a camper was toppled due to high winds, the state\u2019s department of health confirmed. Storms were also responsible for killing one person and injuring another in Mississippi, according to the state\u2019s emergency management agency. The person has not been identified and emergency management officials did not release any information about the circumstances of the death in southwestern Mississippi\u2019s Wilkinson County. More than 100,000 homes and businesses were without power Tuesday from Texas to Florida, according to PowerOutage.us. Louisiana bore the brunt of the outages, with more than 58,000. The South has been battered by several rounds of rain and severe thunderstorms over the past week. Severe storms moved through Texas and into Louisiana on Sunday, bringing tennis ball-sized hail and damaging winds. On Monday, powerful winds, hail and tornadoes occurred from eastern Texas to Florida. On Tuesday, the most significant threat for severe thunderstorms and heavy rainfall is expected across northern Florida. Communities there could see damaging wind gusts, hail, rainfall between 3 to 5 inches and even a tornado. In Tallahassee, officials warned residents to \u201cstay weather aware in the coming days.\u201d The city, Florida\u2019s capital, is still recovering from Friday\u2019s deadly EF2 tornadoes and 100 mph winds which toppled hundreds of power poles and caused widespread damage. The storms also brought heavy rain to areas that don\u2019t need it. Between 3 and 6 inches of rain fell along the Gulf Coast in a stripe from East Texas to Mississippi and more heavy rain is expected as the storm tracks through the Gulf Coast. River gauges across eastern Texas and Louisiana are still running high from the rainfall over a week ago, including the Trinity River, which is\u00a0still in major flood stage northeast of Houston. Several other rivers across both states are at moderate flood stage. Another significant bout of heavy rain is expected over the same areas Thursday, raising the alarm for forecasters at the Weather Prediction Center who warned \u201cconsiderable and significant flash flooding\u201d was likely in an area stretching from East Texas across much of Louisiana and into Mississippi.

The brothers, Jake and Callum Robinson, and American friend Jack Carter Rhoad, were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana, when they went missing on April 29. Earlier this week, three bodies were found dumped in a well with gunshot wounds to the head. On Sunday, Mexican authorities confirmed their identities as the three missing friends with the help of relatives who flew out help investigators. \u201cOur hearts are broken and the world has become a darker place for us,\u201d said Debra Robinson, speaking from San Diego, where she and her husband had since flown to, according to Seven Network Australia. \u201cWe also mourn the loss of Carter Rhoad, a close friend. They were young men, enjoying their passion of surfing together,\u201d she said. She thanked the friends, family and supporters who have reached out, saying: \u201cWe know that they were truly loved and impacted many people\u2019s lives.\u201d Standing beside her husband Martin on the beach, the sound the Pacific waves crashing in the background, the Perth-based couple then paid tribute to the brothers: Callum, 33, who was based in San Diego and played for Australia\u2019s national lacrosse team, and Jake, a 30-year-old doctor who flew from Australia two weeks ago to join his brother in their travels, his parents previously told CNN affiliate Seven News. \u201cCallum was a lovable, larger-than-life character and considered the United States his second home. Known as the Big Koala, he played professional lacrosse in the PLL and represented Australia in the World Championships and always found time to coach the junior teams,\u201d said Debra. \u201cHis brother Jake was a happy, gentle and compassionate soul who\u00a0was pursuing a career in medicine. Jake\u2019s passion was surfing and it was no coincidence that many of his hospitals that he worked in were close to surfing beaches,\u201d she added \u2013 listing Jake\u2019s other hobbies and passions, including running, swimming, cricket and live music. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to bring them home to family and friends and the ocean waves in Australia,\u201d she said, speaking through tears. \u201cPlease live bigger, shine brighter and love harder in their memory.\u201d Jake and Callum\u2019s father, Martin, also spoke to extend his thanks to the Australian agencies that had helped in the search for their sons \u2013 including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Federal Police, and the Australian Embassy in Mexico. He also thanked Australia\u2019s Foreign Minister Penny Wong, saying she had\u00a0called\u00a0to express her support on Monday. Mexican authorities have vowed to investigate the murders, saying the surfers may have been attacked in an attempted vehicle robbery.\u00a0Baja California\u00a0has been plagued by cartel violence in recent years, though it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada. Dozens of people held a protest last week in Ensenada calling on authorities to do more to tackle violence facing tourists and locals alike. Many held up surfboards with slogans written on them in tribute to the three slain tourists. Drug cartels have terrorized Mexico with ever-increasing levels of violence, fueled in part by huge demand for drugs from US consumers and armed with an arsenal of weaponry from north of the border. While parts of Mexico are established tourist destinations, violent crime including kidnapping and human trafficking plague parts of the country, particularly in border areas. Mexico\u2019s\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is among the highest in the world, and\u00a0more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country. Studies show only around seven percent of murders in Mexico are ever solved. Three Mexican citizens previously questioned in relation to the disappearance of the three murdered surfers have been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping, the attorney general\u2019s office said.

{"id": "2024_05_10_africa_prince-harry-meghan-nigerian-visit-intl-scli", "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex landed in Nigeria on Friday, launching a three-day private visit to the West African nation, where they will meet with wounded soldiers and visit local charities, officials said. The Sussexes are visiting the country as it\u2019s now a \u201cpart of the Invictus community,\u201d Air Vice-Marshal Abidemi Marquis, director of sports for the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, said during a media briefing Thursday. Their first engagement was an event hosted at a school in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, where Meghan told students: \u201cI see myself in all of you.\u201d Outside the Lightway Academy, students lined up patiently to welcome the royal couple, alongside a troupe of dancers. They were there to kick off a two-day mental health summit run by the GEANCO Foundation, which supports girls and young women across the country with menstrual health products and education. \u201cWe\u2019re so honored to be with you. We have got to acknowledge those amazing dance moves! My husband was excited to jump up!\u201d Meghan told cheering students in the school\u2019s hall. Harry then jumped into the conversation, asking the children about their knowledge of mental health and reminding them to look after themselves and each other. \u201cWill you promise to us that after today, no more being scared, no more being unsure of mental health. If you are unsure, then ask. Ask your teachers. Ask your friends. Be there for one another,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see your friend in your class not smiling, what are you gonna do? You gonna check in with them? Are you gonna ask him if they\u2019re okay? \u2018cause it\u2019s okay not to be okay.\u201d As they were leaving, the couple were given a traditional wooden mask and a set of books about Nigerian heritage. \u201cI need to read these now,\u201d the duchess added. Prince Harry and Meghan were invited to Nigeria by the chief of defense staff, Christopher Musa, the country\u2019s highest-ranking military official. He formally welcomed them to Nigeria at a meeting Friday lunchtime at the defense headquarters in the heart of Abuja. The duke expressed gratitude to their hosts, commending Nigeria for recognizing the power of sport in the rehabilitation process for the injured or wounded. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first country to notice that it not only transforms lives but saves lives. I\u2019m eternally grateful to you all of you for joining the Invictus movement for Nigeria and for every single soul who\u2019s been injured protecting the freedoms of Nigeria,\u201d he said. Marquis said the duchess was keen to accompany her husband on the visit \u201cas part of her lineage and heritage.\u201d Meghan revealed in 2022 that she discovered she was 43% Nigerian from a genealogy test. The trip to Nigeria sparked a wave of excitement among the public when it was announced two weeks ago. Oyeyemi Aderibigbe, 38, a Lagos-based lawyer, told CNN, \u201cI have watched Harry\u2019s evolution and quest for personal expression\u2026 and I love how bold he is about living authentically. Meghan was my favorite character in the \u2018Suits\u2019 series. I love how she has spent so much time using her voice for good, openly sharing her experiences.\u201d \u201cTogether, they are using their influence to democratize opportunity and push causes for the advantage of underrepresented groups. I would love to see them at an event with young people in politics in Nigeria,\u201d she added. Entrepreneur Ife Durosinmi-Etti spoke of her joy that Meghan was \u201ccoming to a place that she\u2019s absolutely loved and welcomed.\u201d \u201cIt got me all giddy when I found out about her Nigerian heritage because Nigerian women are smart, resilient, multitalented, they go after what they want and that\u2019s exactly how I see her, so when I heard; I was like, \u2018Yup, that\u2019s it, it\u2019s the Nigerian Spirit in her,\u2019\u201d the 35-year-old said. A packed itinerary This is the Sussexes\u2019 first trip as a couple to Nigeria, where they will be heavily promoting Invictus as well as the themes of mental health and female empowerment.  Harry flew to Abuja after a quick visit to London, where he attended events marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games, a Paralympics-style event for wounded, injured and sick military personnel and veterans. Meghan flew in from Los Angeles, and together, they are following a busy schedule, which includes visiting a military rehabilitation center and local organizations dedicated to supporting veterans\u2019 welfare. On Saturday, the duke is also scheduled to join wounded veterans during a sitting volleyball game and later, his wife is expected to co-host a women\u2019s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director-general of the World Trade Organization. As it has been described as a private visit, the royal couple will not be meeting with Nigeria\u2019s president, Bola Tinubu. However, they will meet with the governors of Lagos and Kaduna State. The UK\u2019s high commissioner to Nigeria, Richard Montgomery, told local media that there wouldn\u2019t be a meeting with the Nigerian leader because \u201cthey are visiting in a private capacity, not an official one.\u201d Profound challenges Nigeria\u2019s military personnel face profound challenges, particularly as the country has been combating the Boko Haram insurgency since 2009. On Friday, Musa told the couple more about some of the issues \u2013 like terrorism and criminality \u2013 that the armed forces contend with, adding that IEDs present \u201cthe greatest challenge\u201d for them. In response, the duke shared that he was looking forward to visiting a hospital supporting military personnel in Kaduna, a city in the north of the country. The couple\u2019s hosts, the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, are eager to be involved further in the Invictus Games and to be part of the wider Invictus community. Recalling how the most recent games, which were held in Germany last year, saw Nigeria become the first African country to participate, Harry reminisced: \u201cThe team that turned up in D\u00fcsseldorf was small but mighty. They danced their way into the stage. They won medals and danced off the stage. They were the life and soul of those games. Our goal now is to help you grow that team and provide as much opportunity and resource here in Nigeria and for the games that are coming at the beginning of next year.\u201d Marquis said taking part in the Invictus Games recovery program has boosted the morale of Nigerian soldiers and Nigeria has expressed interest in hosting the games, which take place every two years. He added: \u201cEighty percent of our soldiers involved in these recovery programs have a better outlook in life and say it has given them the opportunity to improve their self-esteem and mental health.\u201d Cpl. Effiom Antigha, captain of Team Nigeria, told CNN last year that the games gave him a new lease on life. \u201cBefore now, I didn\u2019t think I could engage myself in any of these sporting activities. The Invictus Foundation has helped develop me physically and mentally.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/africa/prince-harry-meghan-nigerian-visit-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Drone footage published by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Tuesday, and geolocated by CNN, shows the armed men near UN-marked vehicles at an UNRWA logistics facility in Rafah, which served as a key aid distribution point. The Israeli military said the footage was filmed on May 11, three days before the IDF released it. CNN cannot independently verify the date the video was filmed. UNRWA, the main UN agency operating in Gaza, said it is \u201cunable to verify the authenticity or the content\u201d of the video, but said it is \u201clikely\u201d that the video shows an UNRWA warehouse that was evacuated last week. \u201cUNRWA condemns the use of UN facilities by any party to the conflict for military/fighting purposes. We have repeatedly called for independent investigations & accountability for the blatant disregard of UN staff lives, premises and operations,\u201d UNRWA spokeswoman Juliette Touma said in statement. \u201cWe reiterate our call on all parties to the conflict to respect the sanctity and neutrality of UN installations. Under no circumstances should anyone have or use weapons in a UN facility.\u201d Touma said that UNRWA staff were ordered to evacuate the facility last week \u201cfor their safety\u201d following Israeli military evacuation orders for parts of eastern Rafah.

It\u2019s unclear if the armed men in the IDF drone footage are part of Hamas or other militant groups in Gaza. The Israeli military released the video one day after a United Nations worker was killed and another injured when the UN-marked vehicle they were driving in was struck in Rafah.

{"id": "2024_05_14_weather_canada-wildfire-smoke-air-quality-climate", "text": "Dangerous wildfires have scorched tens of thousands of acres and are closing in on multiple Canadian towns, forcing thousands of evacuations and degrading air quality. The country\u2019s wildfire season is off to a troubling pace as new fires ignite each day and dormant so-called \u201czombie\u201d fires reanimate. The 2024 fire season isn\u2019t yet on par with last year\u2019s record-shattering season but with wildfire behavior worsening in a warming world it\u2019s no wonder Canadian fire officials are warning of an \u201cexplosive\u201d season that may rival last year. Extremely dry and windy conditions have caused multiple fires to grow thousands of acres since the weekend. Despite wet weather on the horizon, firefighting will remain a challenge in several provinces through midweek due to gusty winds. Gusty winds caused the Parker Lake Fire in northeastern British Columbia to surge in size from 13,000 acres Monday to nearly 21,000 acres Tuesday. The blaze was just over a mile west of the town of Fort Nelson early Tuesday morning. At least 4,700 people are under evacuation orders, including in Fort Nelson and Fort Nelson First Nation, Bowinn Ma, British Columbia\u2019s minister of emergency management and climate readiness, confirmed Monday. All but 50 people have heeded the evacuation orders, Northern Rockies Regional Municipality Mayor, Rob Fraser, told CNN Tuesday morning. No deaths or injuries have been reported. Large wildfires have also prompted evacuation orders in Manitoba province and alerts in Alberta province. Evacuation alerts mean people should be ready to evacuate in case an evacuation order is issued. Manitoba is home to one of the largest active wildfires in the country, which had charred more than 86,000 acres as of Monday. More than 500 residents in the community of Cranberry Portage \u2013 less than a mile away from the fire \u2013 were evacuated as of Monday, according to Manitoba officials. A large fire about 10 miles southwest of Fort McMurray, in northeast Alberta \u2013 an area that was devastated by a wildfire in 2016 \u2013 had consumed over 23,000 acres as of Tuesday after growing significantly overnight. An\u00a0evacuation alert\u00a0was issued for residents in Fort McMurray, Saprae Creek, Gregoire Lake Estates, Fort McMurray 468 First Nation and Anzac, according to Alberta officials. Alberta Wildfire Information Officer Josee St-Onge said Tuesday the wildfire \u201cis still out of control\u201d and it \u201cgrew significantly to the northeast yesterday and continues to grow in that direction today,\u201d adding the wind was pushing the blaze toward the town of Fort McMurray. With difficult weather and fire conditions, firefighters were pulled from the fire line, St-Onge said, but crews were working to battle the flames with aerial support. An evacuation order was also issued Tuesday by the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, with officials telling residents in Abasand, Beacon Hill, Prairie Creek and Grayling Terrace to prepare to evacuate by 4 p.m. local time. \u201cThese neighbourhoods directly interface with where the fire could potentially spread. Regional Emergency Services will better be able to defend these neighbourhoods from wildfire if they are uninhabited and clear,\u201d Wood Buffalo officials said in a news release. The municipality has declared a state of local emergency. \u201cOur main priority is the protection of life and property.\u201d Jody Butz, Regional Fire Chief and Director of Emergency Management, said in a news release. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that fire activity is very different than the 2016 Horse River wildfire and we are well positioned to respond to this situation.\u201d All the fire activity is sending plumes of hazardous smoke across Canada and into the US. The threat of smoke will only continue as long as the fires burn. Hazy conditions and degraded air quality levels were in place Tuesday morning from the Dakotas through Kansas. The central US will remain the focal point for Canadian smoke through at least midweek. Warming climate is worsening wildfire behavior Gusty winds are driving ongoing fires Tuesday, but the seeds of fire activity were sown over the winter and in past years as the world continues to warm because of human-driven climate change. \u201cThis region has experienced multiple years of drought, with a below normal snowpack this past winter,\u201d said Ben Boghean, fire behavior specialist for the BC Wildfire Service. \u201cAs a result of this, our forests in the Fort Nelson zone are very receptive\u00a0to new fire ignitions and rapid rates of spread.\u201d Declining snow, increasing temperatures and worsening droughts are all hallmarks of climate change and are projected to keep driving larger and more intense fires across Canada,\u00a0according to Environment Canada. Last year was Canada\u2019s most devastating fire season on record, including in British Columbia, where fires burned through hundreds of homes and an area the size of Maryland, according to the\u00a0BC Wildfire Service. There are more than 130 fires burning across Canada, 40 of which are considered out of control,\u00a0according to the Canadian Interagency Fire Centre. Some of the blazes are so-called \u201choldover fires\u201d also known colloquially as \u201czombie fires,\u201d the smoldering remains of last season\u2019s epic blazes, burning deep in the ground throughout the winter and reigniting when exposed to warmer temperatures in the spring. \u201cIn the past, the winter conditions are what put out a lot of holdover fires,\u201d Ma said. \u201cIn this case, what we\u2019ve seen is that due to higher temperatures and persistent drought through the last year, many of these holdover fires were not put out like they normally are.\u201d Two \u201czombie\u201d fires, the Patry Creek Fire and the Nogah Creek Wildfire, are growing rapidly to the north and east of Fort Nelson and contributing to the evacuation orders.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/weather/canada-wildfire-smoke-air-quality-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_asia_new-caledonia-violence-france-vote-intl-hnk", "text": "The French government has declared a state of emergency in its South Pacific island territory of New Caledonia after deadly violence erupted for a third day Wednesday, with armed clashes between protesters, militias and police, and buildings and cars set on fire in the capital. At least four people have died in the unrest, which is considered the worst since the 1980s. In the capital Noumea, authorities have imposed a curfew and closed the main airport \u2014 usually a busy tourist hub \u2014 to commercial traffic. They have also banned public gatherings, carrying weapons and selling alcohol. The violence is the latest outburst of political tensions that have simmered for years and pitted the island\u2019s largely pro-independence indigenous Kanak communities \u2014 who have long chafed against rule by Paris \u2013 against French inhabitants opposed to breaking ties with their motherland. Protests began Monday involving mostly young people, in response to the tabling of a vote 10,000 miles (17,000 kilometers) away in the French parliament proposing changes to New Caledonia\u2019s constitution that would give greater voting rights to French residents living on the islands. On Tuesday, legislators voted\u00a0overwhelmingly\u00a0in favor of the change. \u201cThe last two days we\u2019ve seen violence of a scale we haven\u2019t seen for 30 years in New Caledonia,\u201d Denise Fisher, a former\u00a0Australian Consul-General in New Caledonia, told CNN. \u201cIt is kind of marking the end of 30 years of peace.\u201d \u201cThe Kanak people are objecting to [the vote in France] not just because it\u2019s been decided in Paris without them but also they feel that they want it to be part of a negotiation \u2026 which would include another self determination vote and a range of other things.\u201d The proposed changes to the constitution would add thousands of extra voters to New Caledonia\u2019s electoral rolls, which have not been updated since the late 1990s. Pro-independence groups say the changes are an attempt by France to consolidate its rule over the archipelago. France\u2019s interior ministry told CNN that 1,800 police officers and gendarmes are already present in New Caledonia and 500 additional police will arrive in the coming hours. The state of emergency will allow authorities to impose restrictions on movement and carry out house arrests and searches. A spokesperson for the French government said the measures were needed to \u201cdeal with the serious breaches of public order which are occurring.\u201d Lying in the South Pacific with Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu for neighbors, New Caledonia is a semiautonomous French territory \u2014 one of a dozen scattered throughout the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm, issuing a letter Wednesday to New Caledonian political leaders urging them to \u201cunambiguously condemn all this violence\u201d and inviting both pro- and anti-independence leaders to meet him \u201cface to face\u201d in Paris. Macron\u2019s administration has pushed for a pivot to the Indo-Pacific, stressing that France is a Pacific power, as China and the United States beef up their presence amid a battle for influence in the strategically important region. New Caledonia is at the center of that plan. \u201cThe stakes are high for France,\u201d Fisher added. \u201cFrance has identified an entire Indo-Pacific vision for itself.\u201d \u201cThe legitimacy of France\u2019s participation this way, having an influence in this way, is in question when you have scenes like this.\u201d The violence Three people - two men and a woman, all indigenous Kanaks - have been shot dead in the violent protests and looting, according to Charles Wea, spokesperson for\u00a0Louis Mapou, President of the Government of New Caledonia. A French police officer who was injured by gunfire in the riots also died, French interior minister\u00a0G\u00e9rald Darmanin said. Demonstrators have also set fire to buildings and cars in Noumea, defying a curfew that has been extended to Thursday. Thick plumes of black smoke covered the capital on Wednesday morning, social media video showed. Images showed burned-out cars, fires in the street, and shops vandalized and looted. \u201cSome are equipped with hunting rifles with buckshot as ammunition. Others were equipped with larger rifles, firing bullets,\u201d the French High commissioner to New Caledonia Louis Le Franc said. More than 140 people have been arrested, while at least 60 security personnel have been injured in the clashes between local nationalist groups and the French authorities, according to Le Franc. One Noumea resident told CNN affiliate Radio New Zealand of panic buying reminiscent of Covid-19. \u201cA lot of fire, violence\u2026but it\u2019s better I stay safe at home. There are a lot of police and army. I want the government to put the action for the peace,\u201d the person told RNZ, asking to remain anonymous. The vote Colonial France took control of New Caledonia in 1853. White settlement followed and the indigenous Kanak people were longtime victims of harsh segregation policies. Many indigenous inhabitants continue to live with high rates of poverty and high unemployment to this day. Deadly violence exploded in the 1980s eventually paving the way towards the Noumea Accord in 1998, a promise by France to give greater political autonomy to the Kanak community. Multiple referendums were held in recent years - in 2018, 2020 and 2021 - as part of the agreement offering voters in New Caledonia the option to secede from France. Each referendum was voted down, but the process was marred by boycotts from pro-independence groups and by Covid-19. Voter roles have been frozen since the Noumea Accord, the issue that France\u2019s parliament was seeking to address in the vote that sparked this week\u2019s violence. French lawmakers in Paris voted 351 \u2013 153 in favor of changing the constitution to \u201cunfreeze\u201d the territory\u2019s electoral rolls, enfranchising French residents who have been in New Caledonia for 10 years. The lists were frozen by the French government to appease pro-independence Kanak nationalists who believe new arrivals to the former colony, including from France, dilute popular support for independence. Both houses of France\u2019s parliament need to approve the constitutional change passed by the National Assembly. On Tuesday, French Prime Minister Gabriel\u00a0Attal said the government would not call a meeting of the parliament to vote on the motion before talks with Kanak leaders, including major independence alliance the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS). \u201cI invite New Caledonia\u2019s political leaders to seize this opportunity and come to Paris for talks in the coming weeks. The important thing is conciliation. Dialogue is important. It is about finding a common, political and global solution,\u201d\u00a0Attal said on the floor of the National Assembly. FLNKS issued its own statement Wednesday both condemning the vote at the National Assembly and calling for an end to the violence. \u201cFLNKS appeals to the youth involved in these demonstrations for appeasement and to ensure the safety of the population and property,\u201d the statement read.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/asia/new-caledonia-violence-france-vote-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

The visit \u2014 Putin\u2019s symbolic first overseas foray since entering a\u00a0new term as Russia\u2019s president\u00a0last week \u2013 is the latest sign of the deepening relations as the two bind their countries closer in the face of heavy frictions with the West. Putin landed in the Chinese capital hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday announced via his office that he would\u00a0halt all upcoming international visits, as his troops defend against Russia\u2019s advances in his country\u2019s northeastern Kharkiv region. The war, as well as the conflict in Gaza, is expected to feature in Xi and Putin\u2019s meetings, alongside discussions on their expanding trade, security and energy ties. Ahead of the trip, Putin hailed the \u201cunprecedented level of strategic partnership\u201d between the countries in an interview with Chinese state media Xinhua. He said the leaders aimed to \u201cstrengthen foreign policy coordination\u201d and deepen cooperation in \u201cindustry and high-tech, outer space and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, renewable energy and other innovative sectors.\u201d He also praised China\u2019s \u201capproaches to resolving the crisis in Ukraine.\u201d Beijing has never condemned Russia\u2019s invasion, rather it claims neutrality in the conflict and has called for peace talks that take both sides\u2019 positions into account. The two leaders \u2013 who declared a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership weeks before the February 2022\u00a0invasion \u2013 have continued to strengthen their countries\u2019 diplomatic, trade and security ties since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Both see each other as key partners in their converging vision to reshape a world order they see as led by the United States. Trade between the two economies has surged in the wake of the war, hitting record levels last year, as other countries introduced sanctions aimed at draining Russia\u2019s war coffers and limiting its access to goods that could be used on the battlefield. Xi hosts Putin in Beijing as the Chinese leader comes under under mounting pressure from the US and Europe to ensure exports from China aren\u2019t propping up Russia\u2019s war effort. White House officials in recent weeks have confronted China on what they believe is Beijing\u2019s substantial support \u2013 in the form of goods like machine tools, drone and turbojet engines and microelectronics \u2013 for Russia\u2019s defense industrial base. This is the fourth in-person meeting between Xi and Putin \u2013 known for their personal chemistry \u2013 since the invasion and Putin\u2019s second visit to Beijing in that time. Xi also visited Moscow in 2023 after entering his new term as China\u2019s president. The two leaders are expected to sign a number of bilateral agreements, the Kremlin said Tuesday. They are also expected to celebrate 75 years of their diplomatic relations at what Chinese state media has described as a \u201cgala event.\u201d Besides meeting with Xi in Beijing, Putin is also expected to visit Harbin, the capital of China\u2019s northeastern Heilongjiang province bordering Russia\u2019s Far East, where he will attend trade and cooperation forums.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/china/putin-xi-meeting-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_americas_venezuela-essequibo-guyana-csis-intl-latam", "text": "Venezuela continues to build up military infrastructure and hardware close to the border with Guyana as President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters scale up their threats to annex an\u00a0oil-rich piece of Guyanese land. In a report shared with CNN, the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that while the Venezuelan government \u201chas little to gain and much to lose from a full-blown conflict\u201d it continues to play \u201ca dangerous game\u201d over its claim over the densely forested Essequibo region. \u201cThe constant drumbeat asserting \u2018the Essequibo is ours,\u2019 alongside the creation of new military commands and legal structures to oversee the defense of the region, is helping to institutionalize a sense of perpetual prewar footing,\u201d it wrote. Tension over the region, which amounts to about two-thirds of Guyanese national territory, mounted last year after a Venezuelan referendum in which voters assented to creating\u00a0a Venezuelan state within the disputed region. Guyana had called the move a step towards annexation and an \u201cexistential\u201d threat as the specter of armed conflict loomed over the region. CNN previously reported in February about an expansion of operations at Venezuela\u2019s Anacoco Island military base despite both countries agreeing in December to pursue a diplomatic avenue to resolve the conflict. Using satellite imagery and social media, CSIS found that the expansion of Anacoco Island\u2019s military base has continued. A bridge is seen being built across the Cuyuni River to connect the Venezuelan riverbank to the island, which has been a point of contention between the countries after it was awarded to Guyana in an 1899 ruling by an international tribunal. Venezuela annexed it in the 1960s. The island\u2019s airfield has expanded and now includes a small control tower, CSIS writes. Satellite imagery from March showed an area next to the airfield with more than 75 field tents, \u201cenough for a battalion-sized unit of several hundred personnel.\u201d The field tents have since been relocated to the southern side of the airfield \u201cdemonstrating the base\u2019s continued ability to provide logistics and resupply for a sizeable military force continuously for over a month,\u201d it wrote. Meanwhile, by the coast, at least two Iranian-built\u00a0Peykaap III (Zolfaghar) fast missile boats are seen at Venezuela\u2019s small coast guard station at Punta Barima, \u201cplacing Venezuelan missiles and naval forces within arm\u2019s reach of the Guyana-administered Essequibo\u201d as it just 40 miles (64 kilometers) from the Guyanese border. Maduro could \u2018fall victim to own rhetoric\u2019 The threats to Guyana have concerned its partners. Last week, two US Navy F/A-18 fighter jets flew over the capital Georgetown, demonstrating \u201cour routine security cooperation and expanding bilateral defense partnership with Guyana,\u201d the US Embassy in Guyana wrote. While smaller than Idaho, Guyana is home to vast oil reserves and is on track to become the world\u2019s highest per capita oil producer. It, however, has an army estimated to be less than 5,000 soldiers, and lacks the hardware or manpower to face possible Venezuelan aggression. All things considered, \u201cif you\u2019re if you\u2019re Guyana, and your army is 5,000 people, it doesn\u2019t seem like the Venezuelans are taking their foot off the gas,\u201d Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program\u00a0at CSIS and lead author of the report, told CNN. There has been speculation that the upcoming Venezuelan elections at the end of July have given Maduro the motivation to escalate against Guyana, using it as a way to distract from his record: Millions of people have fled the country due to poor economic conditions, food shortages and limited access to health care. CSIS argues that instead of tamping down the aggression after the vote, \u201cMaduro may be tempted to ramp up both rhetoric and action related to the Essequibo in a true gambit to manufacture a regional crisis in the aftermath of a stolen election.\u201d It may not be in Maduro\u2019s interest to \u201cinitiate a full-blown conflict with neighbor Guyana, but his escalatory rhetoric tethers his political reputation and legitimacy to his willingness to back his words with force\u201d especially with his key internal ally, the armed forces, CSIS writes. \u201cThus, one of the most concerning possibilities is that Maduro will fall victim to his own rhetoric. He has whipped up nationalist passions without providing an escape valve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/americas/venezuela-essequibo-guyana-csis-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

The letter sent to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), and seen by CNN, said that: \u201cHer Majesty will not procure any new fur garments.\u201d It is unclear, however, what the Queen\u2019s position is with regard to fur items in her existing wardrobe. The move follows a similar stand taken by her late mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, who ruled out buying new fur products back in 2019. The palace\u2019s correspondence was in response to a letter sent by PETA to the Queen in April. In it, Elisa Allen, vice president of the organization\u2019s UK programs and operations, detailed the cruel practices which, it says, are employed in the fur industry, as well its impact on the environment. The charity\u2019s founder, Ingrid Newkirk, welcomed the news.

{"id": "2024_02_08_sport_yaroslava-mahuchikh-ukraine-paris-olympics-spt-intl", "text": "At some point last year, Yaroslava Mahuchikh vowed to stop reading the news before competitions, so distressing did she find the stories and images of bloodshed in her native Ukraine. One of the world\u2019s top high jumpers, Mahuchikh knew that absolute concentration was required to perfectly execute her run-up, take-off and back-arching leap, but still her mind would gravitate towards the difficult situation thousands of miles away back home. Perhaps that\u2019s only natural when your country is at war and fresh missile attacks are being launched on a regular basis \u2013 some even directed at blocks in your hometown. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging for me to compete after reading the news of rockets sent to civilians,\u201d Mahuchikh tells CNN Sport. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about how many people died, how many peoples\u2019 houses were destroyed. It\u2019s difficult.\u201d That strategy \u2013 of trying to shut out Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine before she competes \u2013 proved effective last year. Mahuchikh won her first world championship title in August, then successfully defended her Diamond League Final victory in September. Understandably, her confidence is now high for the months ahead. That includes the Millrose Games in New York this weekend, the world indoor championships in Glasgow in March and then the Paris Olympics in July and August. She\u2019s unsure if she will return to Ukraine in that time having moved between various training bases around Europe for most of the past two years. Because of the war, itinerancy has become a common theme in her life. \u201cI live in a suitcase, really,\u201d says Mahuchikh, \u201cbecause with traveling, we don\u2019t have a hometown.\u201d Her family \u2013 her mother and sister \u2013 have sometimes joined the 22-year-old while she is on the road, but her father, like many Ukrainians, has stayed at home in Dnipro. That\u2019s often a source of anxiety for Mahuchikh, especially when Russian attacks target the eastern city. \u201cMy father, he said that, unfortunately, for a lot of people, it\u2019s life right now, we live in this way,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd they continue their life. My father sometimes says, \u2018Oh, you know, if the rockets come, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s my life, maybe it\u2019s God saying that it\u2019s finished.\u2019 And I say, \u2018Oh my gosh, father, please \u2013 go to the basement.\u2019\u201d Dnipro has absorbed several deadly missile attacks throughout the invasion, with the Russian military targeting apartment blocks and medical facilities in the city. In August last year, Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0War Crimes Department in the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office said that approximately 10,749 civilians had been killed during the war and 15,599 wounded. Yet even as fighting rages on, Mahuchikh still longs for the familiarity of being back home with her family and friends. \u201cIf I was not an athlete at international level, I think I would be in Ukraine,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I have some goals and I\u2019m competing for my country. I represent Ukraine at competitions; it\u2019s my goal and it\u2019s my mission, I think.\u201d Russia\u2019s invasion has invigorated Mahuchikh\u2019s sense of national pride. She wore blue and yellow eye shadow \u2013 the colors of the Ukrainian flag \u2013 at last year\u2019s world championships and is supporting fundraising efforts to send wheelchairs to disabled orphans in Ukraine. She also hopes that competing at high-profile events and winning gold medals will provide her with a platform from which to highlight her country\u2019s plight. \u201cI feel that I am an ambassador of Ukraine and I have this possibility to involve a lot of people in this problem that Ukrainian people now have,\u201d says Mahuchikh. \u201cA lot of families are under rocket attack; a lot of children, unfortunately, lost their parents or parents lost their children. It\u2019s so sad, and it\u2019s so sad that a lot of athletes and coaches died in this war. But I want to help my country. It\u2019s the main goal.\u201d According to Vadim Guttsait, Ukraine\u2019s sports minister and president of its National Olympic Committee (NOC), more than 400 Ukrainian athletes have been killed since the start of the war. This year\u2019s Olympics, Mahuchikh believes, will enable Ukrainian athletes to promote a message of peace, though perhaps inevitably, the Games have also become entwined in geopolitics. In particular, the question of whether athletes from Russia and Belarus, a key military launchpad during the war in Ukraine, will be able to compete has become a flashpoint. In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that athletes from those two countries will be able to take part as neutrals in Paris, so long as they meet certain eligibility criteria. For example, only individual athletes, rather than teams, will be included in the Games, and athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to their country\u2019s military services will be ineligible. However, international federations have the first say on whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can qualify for the Olympics. World Athletics, the governing body of track and field, has excluded Russian and Belarusians from events \u201cfor the foreseeable future,\u201d meaning they will be unable to compete in track and field events in Paris as things stand. It\u2019s a contentious topic: some, like the IOC\u2019s executive board, believe that individual athletes shouldn\u2019t be stopped from competing on the basis of their passport, while others, namely a campaign group representing Ukrainian athletes, argue that Russian participation of any kind only strengthens the country\u2019s \u201cpropaganda machine.\u201d Mahuchikh welcomes World Athletics\u2019 stance, believing that neutral flags are an ineffective way of concealing an athlete\u2019s national identity. \u201cWhen I see Russian athletes \u2026 I see every city destroyed, every life that was destroyed by Russian people, by the Russian Federation,\u201d she says, adding that she would find it \u201cdifficult\u201d to compete against athletes from Russia and Belarus. Last month, more than 200 sportspeople from Ukraine wrote a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron, urging Russians and Belarusians to be banned from competing at the Games. However, neither local organizers nor the French government have jurisdiction over who qualifies for the Olympics, and Paris 2024 organizers have underlined that this responsibility lies with the IOC and international federations. Guttsait has previously suggested that Ukraine could boycott the Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete, though a final decision is yet to be made. Mahuchikh is against such a move, instead believing that the Olympics should represent \u201cpeace in all the world.\u201d A bronze medalist in Tokyo three years ago, she is also one of Ukraine\u2019s biggest stars in Paris, aiming to win what would be her country\u2019s first gold medal in the high jump. \u201cEvery athlete wants to compete, every athlete wants to win the gold medal,\u201d says Mahuchikh. \u201cOf course, I have goals for winning, and I want to have this medal in my sports career.\u201d She has tweaked her technique ahead of the upcoming indoor season, shortening her run-up to compensate for her increased speed as she approaches the bar. Having made her season debut in Cottbus, Germany, last weekend \u2013 finishing first after clearing a world-leading height of two meters and four centimeters (about 6.69 feet) \u2013 the new technique will be put to the test again at the Millrose Games. This is where Mahuchikh\u2019s immediate focus lies, but in the long term, she has loftier ambitions for her career \u2013 namely Stefka Kostadinova\u2019s world record of two meters and nine centimeters (about 6.86 feet). The Bulgarian\u2019s mark has stood since 1987, making it one of the longest-standing world records in track and field. Mahuchikh has watched the likes of Karsten Warholm and Mondo Duplantis \u2013 both, like her, sponsored by Puma \u2013 set records in the 400-meter hurdles and the pole vault respectively, and now she hopes to join the club. \u201cI believe that one day I will jump 2.10,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to be part of this family of world record holders.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/02/08/sport/yaroslava-mahuchikh-ukraine-paris-olympics-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

Desperate family members surround the piles of rubble, waiting to see if anyone is rescued alive, the footage showed. But the workers at the scene clearly lack equipment to remove the concrete. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the two strikes. Some of those killed had recently arrived from Rafah, according to people at the scene. One witness, Ashraf Al Jalees, told CNN at the site: \u201cI swear these are innocent civilians \u2026They are all buried under the ground, including children. There are seven girls here. What fault did they have?\u201d He said he had set up a tent for a friend \u2013 Hassan Obeid \u2013 whom he said had \u201cno affiliation with Hamas or anyone else.\u201d Calling out Obeid\u2019s name, Al Jalees added: \u201cHe stayed to sleep here tonight, and the house collapsed on all of them \u2026 Over 50 people are under this, I swear to God they are all innocent civilians. God will question me one day if I am lying.\u201d Another man, Hamdan Karaja, told CNN: \u201cMy children, both girls and boys, are under the rubble. My wife as well.\u201d Karaja said he had seven children. He said the body of his father had been retrieved. \u201cWe have over 100 displaced individuals, with some comprising 20 family members. They are all trapped under the rubble. We were targeted while we were asleep, without any prior warning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also have displaced people\u2019s tents in the yard. We have 10 martyrs here and 20 over there.\u201d Rami Al Aida, a Civil Defense spokesperson in Central Gaza, said crews were \u201coperating in extremely challenging conditions due to a lack of fuel and equipment. We hope to find people alive. We appeal to all international organizations to provide the Civil Defense with the necessary tools, bulldozers, and fuel.\u201d Al Aida agreed with the assessment of others at the site that dozens were still under the rubble. \u201cThere are over four families trapped under the rubble, in addition to the displaced families seeking shelter in and around the building. There are more than 100 people.\u201d A girl who gave her name as Sama Alousha said they had heard a detonation at about 1 a.m. \u201cWe all panicked and came to see what happened. I saw my friend\u2019s house completely destroyed. We are unable to rescue anyone. I have five friends trapped under this place.\u201d One unnamed man said he and his family had been displaced several times. \u201cWe were displaced from Shajaiya. We moved to Khan Younis and then to Rafah, and from Rafah, we came here. My brother rented a place here and stayed there with his family. \u201cSuddenly, I received a call informing me that the place where my brother was staying was hit. There are no tools to retrieve them. They are a family of six, all innocent civilians. My brother, his wife, and four children.\u201d He then called out the names of his brother\u2019s family, but there was no response. One tearful woman at the scene, Um Mahmoud, told CNN: \u201cMy brother arrived from Rafah three days ago after being forcibly displaced, and now we do not know his whereabouts. He, along with his wife and five children, has no connections with anyone. He is simply a displaced person who came from Rafah and was still searching for a place to stay in Deir el Balah. \u201cHis name was on the list of those supposed to leave Gaza through the Rafah border, but fate intervened,\u201d she added. A man called Salah Abu Jarada said his brother had also come from the Rafah area. \u00a0\u201cThey were hit, with three floors collapsing on top of them. They have not been rescued yet.\u201d A second strike occurred at the UNRWA school in Nuseirat about two hours after the first, according to witnesses. Ismail Abu Ghosheh said: \u201cEverything is burnt, and seven people were killed.\u201d Another man at the school, Najah Abu Daher, said: \u201cThere is no safe place to go. They follow us wherever we go. My son was killed, along with three of my relatives. They struck us in the dead of night, causing children to run everywhere and glass to shatter.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/middleeast/israel-airstrikes-gaza-hospitals-tuesday-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_europe_georgia-foreign-agents-bill-passed-intl", "text": "Georgia\u2019s parliament has passed a controversial \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill despite widespread domestic opposition and warnings from the European Union that its enactment would imperil the country\u2019s chances of joining the bloc. The new law will require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d or face crippling fines. Opponents say that the legislation was modeled after similar laws in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society. The law was approved on Tuesday by 84 lawmakers voting in favor to 30 against. After the vote, riot police moved on protesters in Tbilisi after some individuals smashed down the barriers and broke into the grounds of the parliament. Many Georgians fear their foreign agents bill will be used the same way in their country. Georgia\u2019s parliament now has 10 days to send the bill to President Salome Zourabichvili, who has already vowed to veto it. Zourabichvili has two weeks to do so, but parliament can override her objection with a simple majority. The bill has become a cultural flashpoint in a country which, like Ukraine, finds itself caught between Russia and Europe. Polls show that an estimated 80% of Georgians want to join the EU, but Moscow\u2019s geopolitical orbit has proven tough to exit. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Zourabichvili said the upcoming elections in October will give the population a chance to \u201creverse\u201d the bill. \u201cWe have to use this mobilization of the society and this consolidation of the political parties to go and win those elections because that\u2019s the European way,\u201d she said. Georgia applied for membership of the bloc in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, a move seen as an effort to reverse the former Soviet republic\u2019s drift toward Russia. However, EU leaders have made it clear that the foreign agents bill\u2019s passage would jeopardize Georgia\u2019s chances of accession. The United States also voiced concerns about the bill and \u201cdemocratic backsliding\u201d in the country, which is nestled in the Caucasus Mountains, bordered by Russia to the north and Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan to the south. Georgian Dream, the ruling party that pushed through the legislation, has hit back at criticism, saying the move will promote transparency and national sovereignty. But the party has long been suspected of harboring pro-Russian sympathies, especially given that its founder, the billionaire former Prime Minister Bidzina\u00a0Ivanishvili, made his fortune in the Soviet Union. President Zourabichvili called the legislation a \u201cRussian law,\u201d adding that Georgians are \u201cvery well aware of these old Russian Soviet propaganda tricks, so it doesn\u2019t work. They see what\u2019s happening and they\u2019re going to stop it from happening.\u201d The movement of the bill has ignited a feverish response, including in parliament, where scuffles and shouting matches broke out during the hours-long debate that preceded the law\u2019s passage on Tuesday. Masked officers engaged with the crowds shortly afterwards, as riot police appear to be preparing to disperse the protesters. Similar scenes played out last month when an opposition lawmaker punched a key Georgian Dream member in the face,\u00a0sparking a wider brawl. Many anti-Russian, pro-European Georgians remain angry over Russia\u2019s invasion in 2008 and the fact that the Kremlin still occupies about 20% of Georgia\u2019s internationally recognized territory \u2013 about the same proportion that Russia occupies in Ukraine. Nightly protests have been shutting down the capital, Tbilisi, for about a month. About 50,000 people\u00a0came out Sunday evening in the city of 1 million people to speak out against what they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cthe Russian law.\u201d \u201cIt is a Russian law. It is an exact duplicate of the Putin law that was adopted a few years ago and then complemented in order to crush civil society,\u201d Zourabichvili, the Georgian president and a longstanding opponent of Georgian Dream, told CNN in an interview. Zourabichvili told CNN she would veto the law, but the country\u2019s parliament can override that with a simple majority. Levan\u00a0Khabeishvili, a protester who was seriously hurt after being beaten by police, told CNN that the law is yet another example of Moscow trying to assert its authority in the region. CNN has reached out to authorities for more information on why police used excessive force against him. \u201cWe know that this law is dangerous for our future. It threatens our partnership with the West,\u201d Khabeishvili said. The Kremlin has claimed that the law was being used to \u201cprovoke anti-Russian sentiments.\u201d Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman, said on Tuesday that criticism of the bill was tantamount to \u201cundisguised interference in Georgia\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d Current Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze\u2019s office declined an interview request from CNN.

Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_tech_roblox-earnings-2024", "text": "Roblox shares slid more than 20% in early trading, as the gaming giant dialed back its forecasts for growth and first-quarter earnings showed player spending is slowing. Average daily active users (DAUs) were 77.7 million, up 17% year-over-year. But analysts said Roblox needs to prove to Wall Street there\u2019s new sources of revenue growth, up ahead. Its devoted fan base is mostly teens, so the company is taking aggressive steps to attract both younger and older players. \u201cOur teams have been hard at work identifying opportunities to drive DAUs, hours, and bookings growth rates back to 20% year-over-year, said\u00a0David Baszucki, founder and CEO of\u00a0Roblox, in a statement. \u201cBased on results since the middle of April, we believe that these steps are yielding positive results.\u201d In mid-morning trading shares stand at about $23. The stock had shuffled between $25 and $45 for many months after hitting a peak, just above $130 in 2021, the year the company went public. \u201cThe company has faced high operational costs and it needs to sustain rapid growth at the same time,\u201d said Matilda Beinat, an AR/VR analyst at tech intelligence firm ABI Research. \u201cInvestors have wondered if that can be feasible.\u201d Still, some analysts and investors remain moderately optimistic. Here are three reasons why. New revenue streams Roblox has evolved since its 2006 launch and so has its growth strategy. The platform allows users to both play user-created games and create their own games and it also blends elements of a social media network, so people can make friends and talk to developers as they explore virtual worlds. Last year, its Baszucki shared visions of Roblox becoming a place where people can date and form \u201creal-life relationships\u201d within the next five years. In February, the company said 19.7 million new \u201cfriendships\u201d are formed every day on the site. The company\u2019s vision has long been for Roblox to be everywhere, and in many ways, it\u2019s succeeding. The platform\u2019s active daily users are using the platform for an average of 2.5 hours a day \u2013 and those numbers continue to grow. About half of US youth, ages 12 to 17, use Roblox in the US monthly; and it continues to experience growth overseas, especially in Asia. Its biggest hits include Adopt me! (a pet simulator), Brookhaven RP (a functioning virtual town) and Tower of Hell. Although many of the games are geared toward teens, the company seeks to grow and monetize the number of older players. Just last week, the company announced it will show immersive video ads to players over the age of 13. Roblox\u2019s stock price has moved up a bit since that announcement. A new developer subscription offer allows developers to create monetary subscriptions to unlock certain experiences, a feature some analysts expect could help the platform grow even more among other generations. Brand interest and risks Brands have growing interest in Roblox, too. The company said it experienced the strongest brand engagements on its platforms during the fourth quarter of 2023, with more than 300 brand activations on the site including those from Ralph Lauren, Nike, Crocs and Lego. Walmart has even joined the Roblox metaverse, adding an experience that allows users to buy physical items and receive them in the mail. Although more brand involvement will likely continue this year, the company will need to ensure users don\u2019t suffer from ad fatigue, according to Mike Proulx, a research director at market research firm Forrester. \u201cAs the company doubles down on advertising as a way to lure in more brands, it needs to balance what might be seen as \u2018easy revenue\u2019 with user experience,\u201d he said. \u201cToo many ads risk user backlash. Brands that want to effectively reach Roblox\u2019s young user base should prioritize creating a value exchange. Programmatic ads alone won\u2019t cut it,\u201d Proulx said. Good timing Roblox\u2019s user growth and emergence as a public company possibly aligns with budding interest in two buzzy industries: artificial intelligence and extended reality (XR), a term that covers virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality. In February, Roblox introduced an AI chatbot that allows users to communicate with each other in real time, regardless of what language they speak. The tool works in 16 languages. The company also previously shared its vision for the expansion of AI on the platform with tools that will \u201cenable every user to become a creator.\u201d At the same time, major tech companies continue to invest in XR, with increased interest due in part to the launch of Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset. The metaverse is attracting renewed interest. \u201cWe can already start to see the performance of the company going up with these new strategy implementations, and I do believe that with the right advertising and the right timings, Roblox will soon be the communication and collaboration platform it is striving to be,\u201d Beinat said. Facing rivals But Roblox also faces challenges from its chief competitor, Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite, and that platform\u2019s Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), a tool that enables creators to build experiences and publish them directly into Fortnite. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely pushing hard to eat Roblox\u2019s lunch, even though the Fortnite player base tends to be older,\u201d said Lewis Ward, director of gaming at market research firm IDC. Epic has also been taking steps to creep in on Roblox\u2019s core user base. In February, the publisher announced it is teaming up with Disney to create open games and entertainment connected to Fortnite, offering users the ability to play, watch, shop and engage with content and characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar and other franchises. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that [Fortnite] intends to go after younger gamers in 2024 and 2025,\u201d Ward said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/tech/roblox-earnings-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_world_solar-flares-storms-cme-auroras-scn", "text": "A series of solar flares and coronal mass ejections from the sun have the potential to create dazzling auroras that may be seen as far south as Alabama and Northern California but also disrupt communications on Earth tonight and over the weekend, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center. The center, which is a division of the National Weather Service, observed conditions of an extreme geomagnetic storm at 6:54 p.m. ET on Friday evening, reaching a level 5 out of 5 severity. The last time a solar storm of this magnitude reached Earth was in October 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, according to the center. Signs of a severe geomagnetic storm, or level 4, were first observed by scientists at the center at 12:37 p.m. ET, when a major disturbance was detected in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Previously, the center issued a geomagnetic storm watch on Thursday evening, the first such watch issued since January 2005. But the forecast was upgraded after scientists observed G5, or extreme geomagnetic storm, conditions Friday evening. As the sun nears the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle, known as solar maximum, later this year, researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb. Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth\u2019s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky. The Space Weather Prediction Center tracked multiple strong flares emitting from a large cluster of sunspots on the solar surface since Wednesday. The cluster is 17 times the diameter of Earth. Scientists also observed at least seven coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, releasing from the sun in the direction of Earth. These significant outbursts are expected to continue through Sunday. The center\u2019s space weather scale covers three categories: solar flares that cause high-frequency radio blackouts, geomagnetic storms and solar radiation storms. The current solar activity is capable of producing a solar radiation storm, according to Shawn Dahl, the service coordinator for the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201cThat\u2019s the very low end of our scale,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cIt does mean things to some rocket launch operations and satellite operators. But at this point in time, it\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be handled as far as we understand it. The potential for stronger events of course does exist and we\u2019ll see if any materialize.\u201d The peak of the geomagnetic storm activity for Earth could occur between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. ET on Saturday, the center has forecasted. The center referred to this as \u201can unusual event.\u201d There have been three geomagnetic storms since December 2019, but all of them have been considered weak, according to the center. Geomagnetic storms driven by the sun in recent months have caused auroras to be visible in places where they are rarely seen, including as far south as New Mexico, Missouri, North Carolina and California in the United States, and the southeast of England and other parts of the United Kingdom. The solar storm caused a dazzling aurora australis to light up the sky over New Zealand around 6:20 a.m. local time. Depending on the location, the auroras may not always be visible overhead, but keep an eye on the horizon, experts say, because they may create a colorful display there as well. Even if auroras aren\u2019t visible in the sky, experts at the center recommend taking images of the sky with your phone because the images may capture what you can\u2019t see with the naked eye. \u201cA severe storm would mean that the aurora will likely be visible in southern Michigan,\u201d said Michael Liemohn, a professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, in a statement. \u201cGet away from city lights to a place with clear skies and you should be able to see the green or red glow of aurora across the sky.\u201d The effects of geomagnetic storms When coronal mass ejections are directed at Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of Earth\u2019s magnetic field. \u201cGeomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth\u2019s surface, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operations,\u201d according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201c(The center) has notified the operators of these systems so they can take protective action.\u201d The center has notified operators in these areas to take action to mitigate the potential for any impacts, which include the possibility of increased and more frequent voltage control problems. Other aspects operators will monitor include a chance of anomalies or impacts to satellite operations and frequent or longer periods of GPS degradation. In turn, the operators also make sure power lines are performing as expected, ensure that alternate equipment is available and functioning, and any maintenance is suspended, Dahl said. \u201cBut the key element here is that they know what\u2019s causing anything if the situation unfolds that will allow us to be able to take the proper steps to help mitigate and control any developing problems,\u201d Dahl said. When coronal mass ejections arrive, they carry their own magnetic field, which can overwhelm power lines and induce electrical currents, so operators will monitor for any signs of such activity, said Rob Steenburgh, space scientist at the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about impacts to the power grid, we\u2019re talking about the high voltage transmission lines. That\u2019s where these currents can develop. It\u2019s not on any line going from a small transformer to their home,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cIt\u2019s only really developing on the high voltage transmission lines, which creates problems for the major transformers that control distribution.\u201d Solar storms generated by the sun can also cause radio blackouts and even pose risks for crewed space missions. NASA\u2019s Space Radiation Analysis Group is dedicated to monitoring conditions for astronauts aboard the International Space Station. If there appears to be an increased radiation risk, the astronauts can move to parts of the station that are more well-shielded. \u201cDuring the recent solar weather activity that measured higher than originally predicted aboard the International Space Station on May 11, the Expedition 71 crew was told to avoid lower shielded areas of the space station out of an abundance of caution,\u201d according to a May 14 update released by the federal agency. The center warned that additional solar activity could cause geomagnetic storm conditions to be ongoing through the weekend. So far, researchers have obseverd only three severe geomagnetic storms during the current solar cycle, which began in December 2019, according to the center. Experts at the center say they are a \u201clittle concerned,\u201d but mainly because such events are rare. The team likened it to being prepared for a summer storm: Keep batteries and a weather radio on hand in the event of a power outage, but said that people don\u2019t need to \u201cdo anything out of the ordinary\u201d to prepare for space weather. No disruption to internet or cellphone service is expected. And any disruption to GPS is not expected to be prolonged, as long as providers can quickly lock back on to satellite signals, according to experts at the center. Tracking space weather Every 11 years or so, the sun experiences periods of low and high solar activity, which is associated with the amount of sunspots on its surface. The sun\u2019s strong and constantly shifting magnetic fields drive these dark regions, some of which can reach the size of Earth or larger. Over the course of a solar cycle, the sun will transition from a calm to an intense and active period. During the peak of activity, called solar maximum, the sun\u2019s magnetic poles flip. Then, the sun will grow quiet again during a solar minimum. Solar maximum is expected to peak through mid- to late 2024, but the sun will remain active for a couple of years afterward. Teams at the Space Weather Prediction Center use data from ground and space-based observatories, magnetic maps of the solar surface, and ultraviolet observations of the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere to determine when the sun is most likely to send out solar flares, coronal mass ejections and other space weather that could affect Earth. Solar flares can affect communications and GPS almost immediately because they disrupt Earth\u2019s ionosphere, or part of the upper atmosphere. Energetic particles released by the sun can also disrupt electronics on spacecraft and affect astronauts without proper protection within 20 minutes to several hours. The material sent speeding away from the sun during coronal mass ejections can arrive at Earth between 30 and 72 hours afterward, causing geomagnetic storms that affect satellites and create electrical currents in the upper atmosphere that travel through the ground and can have an impact on electric power grids. The storms also affect flight patterns of commercial airlines, which are instructed to stay away from Earth\u2019s poles during geomagnetic storms due to loss of communication or navigation capabilities. Extreme storms have occurred before, such as one that knocked out the power grid in Quebec in 1989 and the Carrington Event of 1859.The latter remains the most intense geomagnetic storm ever recorded, causing telegraph stations to spark and catch fire. If such an event were to occur today, it could cause trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage and bring down some power grids for a substantial amount of time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/world/solar-flares-storms-cme-auroras-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_asia_thailand-lese-majeste-activist-death-netiporn-intl-hnk", "text": "A young activist jailed for insulting\u00a0Thailand\u2019s monarchy\u00a0died on Tuesday following a prolonged hunger strike, officials said, prompting an outpouring of grief and renewed calls for justice reform in the Southeast Asian kingdom Netiporn \u201cBung\u201d Sanesangkhom, 28, died after suffering a \u201csudden cardiac arrest,\u201d Thailand\u2019s Corrections Department said in a statement. A medical team tried to resuscitate her before transferring her to Bangkok\u2019s Thammasat University Hospital but she \u201cdid not respond to treatment,\u201d the department said. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death, the department added. Netiporn was a member of protest group Thalu Wang, which has pushed\u00a0for reform of Thailand\u2019s powerful monarchy and amendment of the country\u2019s draconian lese majeste law, in which criticizing the king, queen, or heir apparent can lead to a maximum 15-year prison sentence. The group\u2019s name\u00a0loosely translates to \u201cpiercing through the palace,\u201d in reference to its drive to hold the monarchy accountable; it campaigns by holding public opinion polls questioning the monarchy\u2019s power. Netiporn had been part of the nationwide 2020 youth-led protests that saw millions of young Thais take to the streets of major cities calling for constitutional, democratic and military reforms, and, for the first time, openly criticizing the monarchy and publicly questioning its power and wealth. She had been in jail since January 26 and was awaiting trial, according to legal advocacy group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. While in detention, Netiporn went on a 65-day hunger strike until April to protest the jailing of political dissidents without bail, the group said. During this time, she had been moved back and forth to the prison hospital due to her deteriorating health. After Netiporn was sent back to jail on April\u00a04, the Thai Corrections Department said she was able to eat and drink normally, but she was weak and suffered from swollen limbs and anemia. She had refused to take \u201cminerals and anti-anemia supplements,\u201d the department said. The activist faced seven criminal cases, including two lese majeste charges. She previously spent 94 days in jail in 2022 and conducted a hunger strike before being released on bail, which was later revoked. One lese majeste case against her was filed in relation to a 2022 protest where she held up a banner at a busy shopping mall in Bangkok that read: \u201cDid the royal procession cause an inconvenience?\u201d The other lese majeste charge is from a similar 2022 protest where she held a sign asking the public: \u201cDo you agree that the government allows the king to use power as he pleases?\u201d In an open letter Netiporn wrote from jail in March, she said growing up as a judge\u2019s daughter made her realize \u201cthis country doesn\u2019t exist to serve small people\u2019s justice.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a judge\u2019s daughter to understand the scale of the failure in the justice system. Their existence is not for the people, they exist shamelessly for the powers and a few groups of people in this country,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBy simply asking question and honking a car, you go to jail.\u201d Calls for reform Netiporn\u2019s death has shocked many in the country and sparked renewed calls for reforms to the judicial system, which allows activists to be denied bail and held in detention for extended periods of time before trial. \u201cThis is a shocking reminder that Thai authorities are harshly denying pro-democracy activists their freedom in an apparent bid to silence the peaceful expression of dissent. Many are currently detained, with their right to temporary release on bail denied,\u201d said Amnesty International in a statement. \u201cThis tragic incident should serve as a wake-up call to Thai authorities to drop charges against and release all human rights defenders and other people who are unjustly detained.\u201d On Tuesday night, supporters held a candlelight vigil outside the Southern\u00a0Bangkok Criminal Court. Those attending included Panusaya \u201cRung\u201d Sithijirawattanakul, a fellow activist who also faces lese majeste charges for her involvement in the 2020 protests. \u201cI feel so shocked. I question myself, did she really die?\u201d Panusaya told CNN Wednesday. \u201cShe didn\u2019t receive any justice for her cases.\u201d Calling on the government of Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin to respond to her death, Panusaya demanded the release of all political prisoners in Thailand. \u201cDo we have to have more people die before you will care?\u201d she asked. On Wednesday, Srettha called Netiporn\u2019s death a \u201ctragic incident,\u201d adding he had ordered Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Justice to investigate the circumstances surrounding it. \u201cI would like to convey my condolences to her family. I am confident that we will give justice,\u201d he said. Responding to the calls for the release of all political prisoners, Strettha said, \u201cI believe that the justice minister has heard about the call, and he\u2019s working on looking into the whole legal system. We have to give justice to everyone.\u201d Thailand\u00a0has some of the world\u2019s strictest lese majeste laws and sentences for those convicted under Section 112 of the country\u2019s criminal code,\u00a0can be decades long. Hundreds of people have been\u00a0prosecuted in recent years, including Mongkol Thirakhot, who was sentenced to a record 50 years in prison in January for social media posts deemed damaging to the king. For years,\u00a0human rights organizations\u00a0and free speech campaigners have said lese majeste has been used as a\u00a0political tool\u00a0to silence critics of the Thai government. Rights groups say the right to freedom of expression in Thailand has come under increased attack since the 2020 protests. Despite the change from a military-backed government to civilian leadership last year, surveillance and intimidation against activists and students continues, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. The legal advocacy group said that since the start of those protests in July 2020 and up until March 2024, at least 1,954 people have been prosecuted or charged for their participation in political assemblies and for speaking out, with 286 of those cases involving children. At least 270 people have been charged with lese majeste during that time, the group added. \u201cThe death of Ms. Netiporn is evidence that the problems of political prosecution and detention of pro-democracy activists, especially in l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 cases, are still very much alive under the Pheu Thai government,\u201d the group\u2019s advocacy lead, Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate told CNN. Netiporn\u2019s death comes as Thailand is running for a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council and while the Thai government is negotiating a free trade agreement with the European Union, Akarachai added. \u201cThe right to bail must be granted to political detainees who have not been found guilty of any crimes by a final judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe price of fundamental freedoms should not be their lives.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/asia/thailand-lese-majeste-activist-death-netiporn-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_americas_new-york-city-chinese-migrants-flushing-intl-latam", "text": " A simple act of walking into a mosque with his wife and two children in New York City is what made the past six months of struggle worth it for Ye Chengxiang \u2013 even if not everyone is celebrating his arrival. \u201cIt\u2019s only been over two months here, but we can feel the spirit of freedom, inclusiveness, and equality,\u201d he said over a bowl of noodles. It was his only day off from working 12-hour shifts at a Chinese restaurant in New York City. The slim former restaurant owner left China last October. The ruling Communist Party\u2019s crackdown on his Hui Muslim ethnic group and growing restrictions on personal life gave his family no choice, he says. \u201cWhen I was in China, I had a pent-up feeling in my heart,\u201d he said of living as a Muslim in China, where his children were banned from entering a mosque. Ye and his wife drained $40,000 of their life savings and illegally crossed the United States\u2019 southern border in December after an exhausting weeks-long journey that saw the family take a hazardous boat journey from Colombia to the edge of the Darien Gap, a mountainous rainforest region that connects South and Central America. His anxieties melted away as Ye crossed into the US, which he described as entering a warm embrace. \u201cI felt like I was home, and that feeling was very real,\u201d he said. Their destination was New York City\u2019s Flushing neighborhood, home to a Chinese community going back generations. The city has integrated\u202fmillions\u202fof migrants over the decades, and it continues to inspire newcomers like Ye \u2013 even as the arrival of such migrants has turned into a flashpoint in US politics ahead of the November elections. After arriving in New York, Ye spent a week in a Manhattan shelter. Then, with the help of a group of other Chinese Muslim\u202fasylum\u202fseekers, he found a place to live and a job making noodles as his family proceeded through the religious\u202fasylum claim process.\u202f Their first court date is in October He is exhausted, barely having time to learn English or explore the new city. But he is happy. The first time that he walked to a mosque in Flushing with his wife and daughters, \u201cI immediately felt that rock, that lump in my heart, dissolve away,\u201d he told CNN. On downtown Flushing\u2019s Main Street, people hand out fliers offering help, for a fee, for the undocumented to secure drivers\u2019 licenses. Alongside the street vendors hawking vegetables, undocumented migrants walk into buildings with employment agencies offering restaurant and sales jobs. This is what draws Chinese migrants toward enclaves like Flushing and Sunset Park, where immigrant networks, legal service centers, job markets and nonprofits form a vital support system. For Chinese\u202fasylum\u202fseekers like Ye, there is a well-trodden route to residency in the US. Chinese nationals have the\u202fhighest\u202fnumber of asylum claims granted\u202f\u00a0in the US compared to other nationalities, because their \u201cpathway to claiming political\u202fasylum\u202f[for Chinese nationals] is more codified,\u201d said Amy Hsin, a sociology professor at Queens College in New York, who specializes in immigration and social inequality.\u00a0 The US expanded\u202fasylum\u202fpathways\u202ffor Chinese citizens in the past due to geopolitical events and policies, like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and the one-child policy, she explained. Recently, growing restrictions on freedoms in China and its stuttering economy have led to this new influx of disillusioned Chinese citizens. More than 37,000 Chinese citizens were picked up by law enforcement crossing illegally from Mexico in 2023, US government data shows. That\u2019s up from around 3,800 people the year before, and many of them were headed to New York City, according to experts. \u2018America is better\u2019 On the fourth floor of an old mall, migrant workers walk into a legal service center. They say they have lost their passports, or had them confiscated, in the melee of voluntarily turning themselves in for\u202fasylum\u202fwith the Customs and Border Protection. The office, which helps them in their\u202fasylum\u202fapplications, also connects them with the Chinese Embassy to apply for new travel documents. In the waiting room, migrants told CNN how videos on social media, providing detailed instructions on how to cross Central America to the US, inspired them to make the journey. They spoke of the socio-economic pressures back in China, made worse by pandemic restrictions and its lack of economic rebound, forcing them to leave the country. The center\u2019s owner, who declined to be named in this story because he does not have a license to practice law in the US, has helped more than 100 Chinese nationals since opening the office two years ago. The burden of proof for\u202fasylum\u202fclaims in the US is high and the owner said many of his clients have struggled to provide concrete evidence of political and religious repression they faced in China. Many go on to protest against the Chinese government once in the US, freed from Chinese authorities and its censors, he said. Dressed simply in jeans and a black jacket, Jiang Zhen said the\u202fsweeping crackdown\u202fon free speech, civil society and religion was suffocating him in China. He believes he was blacklisted for criticizing China\u2019s government on social media sites, his accounts banned or suspended. Poverty in rural China, like in his hometown in Hunan province, had become unbearable, with relatives and parents of friends \u201cdrinking pesticides, drowning themselves in rivers, or hanging themselves \u2026 especially when they are suffering from diseases like cancer and have no money for treatment,\u201d he said, adding that the Chinese government ignores \u201cthe living conditions of the lower classes.\u201d CNN has reached to Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment about claims of political and religious repression, but they have yet to respond. As he waits for his work permit, which can take up to 18 months to approve, the 33-year-old now works illegally cleaning dishes at a Cantonese restaurant in Queens. He earns $4,000 a month, slightly more than what he earned as a business owner in the coastal Chinese province of Guangdong. Next to him, a woman in a pearl-colored puffer jacket, who asked to remain anonymous because she works illegally in the country, said the US was not what she had imagined. She joked that China\u2019s infrastructure bests what she has seen in New York. \u201cFrom movies I watched when I was younger, I remembered Chinatowns being bustling and beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after coming here, I found that Chinatown is in a state of\u202f\u200b\u200bdisrepair. It\u2019s broken and dirty. I was so surprised,\u201d she said as the room burst out in laughter. When asked why she has chosen to remain in the US, she replied: \u201cBecause the US is actually more powerful, despite sometimes the broken appearance,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not starving in China, but everyone wants a better life. Obviously, America is better.\u201d Anti-China measures Both China and US authorities have been concerned with the uptick in migration to the southern border \u2013 but for entirely different reasons. A Chinese government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to comment publicly, told CNN that they believed some new Chinese migrants are participating in violent anti-China demonstrations in the US to help with their asylum cases.\u00a0The official pointed to clashes between anti-China protesters and pro-China supporters in San Francisco in November, when Chinese leader Xi Jinping was attending a forum in the city. In the US, a\u202frecord number\u202fof migrants at the southern border has been seized upon by Republicans who claim it as proof of the Biden administration\u2019s impotence, pushing immigration control to a top election issue. While most migrants at the southern border hail from Latin American countries, some politicians have focused on Chinese migration as a security concern; Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, claimed last May that some Chinese migrants at the border had military experience,\u202faccording to his blog, though he did not offer evidence. Wan Yanhai, a human rights activist based in New York, said the implication that the Chinese\u202fasylum\u202fseekers could be soldiers or spies was \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d There would be little reason for the Chinese government to embed spies among southern border arrivals, he pointed out, considering migrants are not the demographic that would gain access to state secrets in the US. \u201cThese migrants in the US are doing low-level jobs and don\u2019t speak the language, so they can\u2019t do this kind of work. \u2026 It\u2019s impossible for them to be spies.\u201d But the rhetoric around the rise of undocumented Chinese migrants highlights growing tensions between the US and Chinese governments. Geopolitical and security concerns\u202fhave led an increasingly hawkish Biden administration\u202fto unravel years of technological and economic integration with its chief rival in the Pacific. But Jiang, the\u202fasylum\u202fseeker who believes he was blacklisted by Beijing, is unfazed by the growing intergovernmental tensions. \u201cIt\u2019s not really anti-China, it\u2019s anti-Communist Party. I\u2019m also against the Communist Party, I don\u2019t have a good impression of them either, right?\u201d \u2018Deportation can\u2019t stop me from embracing freedom\u2019 Wan, a prominent former\u202fHIV activist in China, had to leave the country in 2010 due to harassment by Chinese authorities, he says. He received permanent US residence a year later and has gone on to help Chinese migrants in Flushing. Many of the new arrivals head to the enclave\u2019s unlicensed hostels, he said. He worries that rising hostel prices \u2013 upwards of $20 per night \u2013 could lead to a rise in homelessness, especially for the low-income elderly population in Flushing. Li Jiada lives in one of those hostels, sharing a cramped room with five other men, sparsely decorated except for a calendar hanging above his single bed. Life has not been easy for the 26-year-old, soft-spoken former fashion photographer since he arrived in the US in January. He had spent three months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center after failing an initial screening for\u202fasylum\u202fwhen he crossed the southern border. He was released this year pending deportation proceedings expected within the next year. He initially struggled to find a job in New York. When he found one, he says, he was sexually harassed by a client and has since found a new role as a manicurist, earning $2,000 a month. His costs are higher than what he earns, but he says, \u201cThere\u2019s no regret because coming here has given me more options.\u201d He is desperate to stay in the US and thinks Christianity, which he discovered while in detention, will save him from deportation. The Communist Party\u202fsees any large\u202fgroup outside its dominion as a threat, has banned the online sale of Bibles, and has arrested Christians for \u201cinciting subversion of state power.\u201d \u201cMaybe my only way forward is through Jesus,\u201d he said. Li plans on filing a new\u202fasylum\u202fapplication based on his new-found religion. Sitting in a Baptist church in Flushing, Li spoke about the stress of the looming deportation and thinks back about the first thing he did when he arrived in New York: seeing the Statue of Liberty, a sculpture that has become a symbol of hope for millions of immigrants before him. \u201cAfter the treacherous journey to get here, I needed to see the embodiment of my beliefs: democracy, freedom, equality, and rule of law,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US has yet to accept me, but deportation can\u2019t stop me from embracing freedom.\u201d The ethnic enclave has largely shielded the migrants CNN spoke to from a recent\u202frise\u202fin anti-Asian crimes in the city. Still, Li thinks he may have been targeted for being Chinese: Someone threw a full can of soda at him as he waited for a train back to Flushing from Manhattan, he said. And like a true New Yorker, he gave the assailant a piece of his mind. \u201cAt that moment, I felt like I could suddenly speak English fluently,\u201d he joked. \u201cMy talent was unleashed, and I said: \u201cWhat the f**k?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/americas/new-york-city-chinese-migrants-flushing-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_climate_heat-wave-asia-gaza-climate-intl", "text": "A deadly heat wave in Gaza in April, which saw punishing temperatures worsen an already dire humanitarian crisis, was made hotter and more likely by the human-caused climate crisis, according to an analysis published Tuesday. Gaza was not alone. Several heat waves spanning a vast area of the Asian continent last month during the\u00a0world\u2019s hottest April on record\u00a0were made more intense and likely by the climate crisis, the analysis from the World Weather Attribution initiative (WWA) found. The WWA report divided the heat waves into three areas: West Asia, the Philippines and a region spanning South and Southeast Asia. In West Asia, the analysis focused on the Palestinian territories, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan, where temperatures spiked above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) last month. It found climate change made the heat in this region around five times more likely and 1.7 degrees Celsius hotter than it would have been before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels. Soaring temperatures had a particularly stark impact on the 1.7 million displaced people in Gaza, already struggling with insufficient water access and inadequate healthcare. There was little respite from the relentless heat for those crammed into makeshift tents and shelters, often covered with plastic sheets. At least three people, including two children, reportedly died from the heat, the analysis notes. In the Philippines, the extreme heat last month \u2014 which forced hundreds of schools to close as temperatures reached more than 42 degrees Celsius \u2014 had such a strong link to human-caused global warming the report concluded it would have been impossible without it. To calculate the influence of climate change on the extreme heat, WWA researchers used weather data and computer models to compare the world\u2019s current climate \u2014 which is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels \u2014 with the climate of the past. \u201cFrom Gaza to Delhi to Manila, people suffered and died when April temperatures soared in Asia,\u201d Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment and a report author, said in a statement. \u201cHeat waves have always happened. But the additional heat, driven by emissions from oil, gas and coal, is resulting in death for many people.\u201d The scientists also examined the role of El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate pattern that influences global weather. While they found it had no influence in West Asia\u2019s April heat, it did affect the intensity of heat in the Philippines, pushing up temperatures by 0.2 degrees Celsius. However, the impact of climate change there was greater, increasing temperatures by about 1.2 degrees. In today\u2019s warmer world, the kind of extreme heat waves experienced in Gaza and West Asia, as well as the Philippines, are not rare and can be expected around once every 10 years, the report found. But it warns worse could be in store. If the planet\u2019s average temperature rises to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is predicted to happen in the 2040s or 2050s if the world does not decarbonize fast enough, similar extreme heat waves could be expected once every five years in West Asia and every two to three years in the Philippines. Heat wave made 45 times more likely The WWA analysis also looked at parts of South and Southeast Asia, many of which also experienced unprecedented heat last month. Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam all broke records for their hottest April day, while temperatures spiked to 46 degrees Celsius (115 Fahrenheit) \ufeffin India. Bangladesh and Thailand also experienced scorching April temperatures and were included in the study. Climate change also played a pronounced role in this region, according to the analysis, making the heat 45 times more likely and 0.85 degrees Celsius hotter. The scientists took a simpler approach than usual for this part of Asia, looking only at weather data and not computer models, because the region overlapped with two previous analyses of extreme heat events in 2022 and 2023, which also found climate change played a strong role. The numbers in the report are important, Otto said, \u201cbecause they show us that everywhere climate change is an absolute game changer when it comes to extreme heat.\u201d But numbers alone don\u2019t necessarily show how bad the impacts are \u2014 these depend on people\u2019s vulnerability and exposure. Days of temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) were \u201cparticularly difficult for people working outdoors, people living in informal housing (and) people living in refugee camps,\u201d Otto said. Asia is also home to some of the planet\u2019s fastest growing cities, said Carolina Pereira Marghidan, climate risk consultant at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, on a call with reporters. This has led to rapid, unplanned development. \u201cMany cities have seen extreme losses of green space,\u201d Pereira said, increasing the impacts of extreme heat on residents. The world must take \u201cmassive, unprecedented steps to reduce emissions,\u201d said Mariam Zachariah, a researcher at the Grantham Institute, in a statement. If not, she added, \u201cextreme heat will lead to even greater suffering in Asia.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/climate/heat-wave-asia-gaza-climate-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_middleeast_injured-palestinian-mothers-children-qatar-intl-cmd", "text": "Raneem Hijazi remembers how tightly she held her one-year-old son Azzouz before the Israeli airstrike hit. The drone flying over their building in Gaza was getting louder and she had a feeling that something bad was about to happen. \u201cWhatever happens to me, happens to him,\u201d she says of her reasoning in holding him so close to her baby bump. She does not remember the moment of impact, but the memory of the aftermath is imprinted in her brain. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel the strike itself, you just open your eyes and you are under the rubble,\u201d she says. She immediately started feeling around, searching for Azzouz, until her mother-in-law screamed. \u201cShe found him over my belly. She picked him up. His body was in her hands and his head dropped on my belly,\u201d she recalls. Since that moment on October 24, she has been questioning her will to live. She initially asked her family to leave her to die, but they instead went looking for help to dig her out of the destroyed house in Khan Younis. \u201cMy leg wasn\u2019t visible. My arm was only hanging to my body by a small piece of flesh. I tried to rip it apart but I couldn\u2019t, so I rested it over my belly,\u201d she says. By the time she reached the hospital she was presumed dead, she says. Her eight-month pregnancy made doctors look again and they delivered her daughter Mariam by cesarian. \u201cAs she took her first breath, I came back to life. The doctors told me it was a miracle,\u201d she says. Hijazi tells her story in a faint voice lying in a hospital bed in Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital. Her left arm was amputated, and both legs sustained extensive damage, requiring bone grafts to repair them. Critical delay Despite the occasional groans of pain, the relatively quiet hallways of the Gaza ward at Hamad Hospital in Doha are starkly different from the overwhelmed medical facilities in Gaza. Behind every door is a story of a miraculous survival tainted by inconsolable loss. Mothers being treated for life-altering injuries can finally begin to process the loss of a child and struggle with their diminished ability to care for their surviving children. \u201cMy daughter is the one that saved me. When I was first injured, I was saying, \u2018I don\u2019t want her. I want my son back,\u2019\u201d Hijazi says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even lift my head. I couldn\u2019t see her, much less take care of her.\u201d\u00a0She hopes that one day her daughter will give her the energy to carry on. Hijazi was evacuated from Gaza for medical treatment a month after her injury. Mariam, almost as old as the war and with the same chubby cheeks as her late brother, is with her grandparents in Egypt. Hijazi has watched Mariam grow up on video calls. She hasn\u2019t held her for over six months. In Doha, she leaves the hospital between surgeries and doctors assure her she will be able to walk again. \u201cI have been working in orthopedics for around 21 years. The kind of injuries, the severity of the injuries, the types of bone loss, and the kind of infections we faced with the Gaza patients are beyond (anything) I\u2019ve seen before,\u201d says Dr. Hasan Abuhejleh, consultant orthopedic surgeon at Hamad Hospital. He has had to tell many patients that their amputations, while necessary to save their lives, could have been avoided if there were more resources available to them in Gaza. More than 4,800 people have been evacuated from Gaza for medical treatment since Israel launched its military offensive in response to the Hamas attacks of October 7, and thousands more in a serious condition are waiting to leave. Israel has denied 42% of the medical evacuation requests made, the United Nations and aid agencies said in an update on May 10. In recent days, they added, \u201cthe closure of Rafah Crossing has abruptly halted all medical evacuations of critically ill and injured patients outside Gaza.\u201d CNN has not yet received a response from Israel\u2019s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to its request for comment on the rejected medical evacuation requests. Delays to medical evacuations have had a huge impact on the cases that come to Abuhejleh\u2019s hospital. Haunting photo The pain reverberates in different frequencies through the hospital rooms. Shaimaa Al-Ghoul messages the CNN team from an isolation room. Like many patients coming out of Gaza, she has a drug-resistant infection picked up in the territory\u2019s struggling hospitals. Al-Ghoul lost her husband and two of her four children in an airstrike in Rafah in February. The family was sleeping in one room when, suddenly, \u201cthe bed was split in half and I fell onto the ground floor,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI heard Hothaifa (her 11-year-old son) pleading for rescuers not to leave him behind. I didn\u2019t hear my husband or Jenan or Mohamed, so I knew they were martyrs,\u201d she says. She was nine months pregnant and believes the shrapnel that hit her belly also killed her unborn son. Abdullah was delivered\u00a0stillborn the following day. Al-Ghoul shares cheerful pictures of her children before the war, followed by a widely -circulated photo of her daughter Jenan\u2019s\u00a0body, lower limbs severed and\u00a0propelled by the blast to dangle from a window by the scarf she wore to bed. She wants to show the horrors of the war and the memories she and others in this ward are haunted by. Her son Hothaifa roams the hospital hallways on crutches. His injured leg is too swollen to bear weight. The laughs that come easily to his 6-year-old sister, Mariam, who wasn\u2019t with the family that night and was evacuated uninjured, seem to be foreign to the muscles of his face. Mariam enters a room which other patients had warned us housed patients with horrific stories of pain and loss. She plays on the beds left empty when some patients go out in their wheelchairs for a breath of fresh air at sunset. Life after loss Inside that room, Shahed Alqutati, 23, has just finished physiotherapy. Her left leg was amputated and the other is encased in an external fixator \u2013 a metal frame holding her smashed bones together. The strike that hit her third-floor apartment in northern Gaza on October 11 threw her and her husband Ali, a 26-year-old university professor, onto the street. Shellshocked, she opened her eyes to find her leg torn and blood everywhere. \u201cMy husband was in front of me. He was also injured. He lost both his legs and his hand. I shouted to him \u2018Ali, Ali.\u2019 He heard me and he also shouted \u2018Shahed.\u2019 He looked at his severed arm and asked me \u2018where is my arm.\u2019\u201d These were the last words they shared. Both were taken to hospital but Ali did not survive. She lost the love of her life and the baby they were about to have. \u201cA week before the war we bought everything for the baby, every clothes, every t-shirt. (sic) Pink, pink, pink. We were very excited,\u201d she recalls. Her daughter Sham was stillborn two days after the strike, two months before she was due. Her suffering didn\u2019t end there. Alqutati was taken to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City for treatment \u2013 and in November endured an Israeli siege that left patients and medical staff without food or water and with dwindling medical supplies. After two weeks, the Israeli military forced her and others out of the hospital. Her father pushed her in a wheelchair along damaged roads. At a checkpoint, she says, Israeli \u201csoldiers shot in the air and told people to go back. Go back where? There is no place to go. We walked and walked for too many hours,\u201d she says. That obstacle added another day to their arduous journey on the streets. By the time they reached Rafah, her wounds were bleeding and infected, Alqutati says, but she was still afraid of entering hospitals struggling to cope with a daily influx of people injured in the conflict. \u201cIf I went to the hospital, I\u2019ll die, not recover or heal,\u201d she says. Her father dressed her wounds away from the hospitals. Treatment came after she was medically evacuated out of Gaza, and with it the time to process the loss. In one of the many videos she shares on social media, her late husband Ali is seen sheepishly smiling when he realizes she\u2019s filming him again, at a university function, from the backseat of a car, as he paces in a shop. \u201cNo one will feel (my) pain. With the people (I am) strong, happy, laughing. But when I am alone, I feel something painful here,\u201d she says pointing to her heart. \u201cI cannot be healed from that,\u201d she says. \u201cThis will stay with me for all my life. Amputation, fractures, burns, nerve problems \u2026 There is no new leg for me. This is something that will not be forgotten. And how can I forget? I lost my beloved one and my baby,\u201d she adds. Despite the different outcome of their pregnancies, Alqutati and Hijazi describe a similar despair that shackles them to the horrors of the war in Gaza. Like many medical evacuees, they are uncertain about their future and where they might end up, and worried about the family members stuck in Gaza. \u201cLife has ended. There is no more joy,\u201d Hijazi says. \u201cI close my eyes and all the memories overwhelm me. I went to the mall and saw the baby formula I used for my son, and I felt I was dying. And it was just baby formula. You can only imagine what happens when I see his picture or videos or his toys or his clothes,\u201d she says. Tears stream down her face when she watches a video she filmed of Azzouz giggling. \u201cThe pain will never go away. It\u2019s things that can\u2019t be forgotten,\u201d she says. \u201cWe give birth only to lose them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/middleeast/injured-palestinian-mothers-children-qatar-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_europe_prison-ambush-france-intl", "text": "French authorities launched a manhunt on Tuesday after gunmen ambushed a prison convoy in Normandy to break out an inmate, killing two guards and wounding three others. The violent incident, extremely rare for that part of northern France, took place as the vehicle was transporting a prisoner from court to a nearby prison, French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said. Video from the scene showed a black SUV in flames that appeared to have crashed into a prison van near a motorway toll booth, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.\u00a0Two hooded individuals could be seen carrying what appeared to be long rifles. Dupond-Moretti told reporters that the incident was the first time a French prison employee had died while working since 1992. He added that one of the guards leaves behind a wife and two children, and the other a spouse who was five months\u2019 pregnant. Dupond-Moretti added that two of those hurt sustained life-threatening injuries. The gunmen are still at large, national police said on X. \u201cEverything, and I mean everything, will be done to find the perpetrators of this heinous crime. These are people for whom life means nothing. They will be arrested. They will be tried. And they will be punished for the crime they committed,\u201d Dupond-Moretti said. A manhunt is underway to find suspects who carried out the prison break and the inmate, a 30-year-old who had been convicted of burglary and is being investigated for a kidnapping related to death, according to the French national prosecutor in charge of organized crime, which has already opened an investigation into the incident. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on X he has mobilized the national gendarmerie and \u201cseveral hundred\u201d police officers for the manhunt.\u00a0Authorities on the scene are setting up roadblocks and establishing a perimeter, BFMTV reported. Vehicles found On Tuesday evening local time, French police said they had discovered two burnt out vehicles used by the attackers. Paris state prosecutor Laure Beccuau told a press conference that the two vehicles were found in Houtteville and in Gauville-le-Campagne, two towns in the d\u00e9partement of Eure where the attack took place near the Incarville tollbooth shortly before 11am local time (5aET). One of the vehicles, a Peugeot, had been used to ram the police van during the attack, Becuau said. The other vehicle, an Audi, had been following the van and carried the two gunmen. Forensic experts have been carrying out \u201cmeticulous tests\u201d at the scene of the crime, and police had been studying video of the attack filmed by eyewitnesses and posted on social media, Beccuau told the press conference. The prosecutor also revealed more details about the escaped inmate, identifying him as Mohamed Amra, and saying he is \u201cvery well known to the justice system,\u201d having sustained a total 13 convictions. Most of those convictions related to incidences of theft with aggravated offences, Beccuau said, adding that Amra had been incarcerated in various facilities since January 2022. A minimum of three police officers had been decided as the security level for the escort several weeks ago, Beccuau told journalists. In the end, five officers were involved in the escort. A 52-year-old officer and 34-year-old officer were both killed during the attack whilst their colleagues, a 48-year-old, a 52-year-old and a 55-year-old were all injured, she said. On May 10, Amra was found guilty on the charge of burglary by a court in \u00c9vreux and was also under investigation in Marseille for a kidnap which led to a death, Beccuau said. The prosecutor said the authorities\u2019 priority now is getting to the bottom of this \u201coutburst of violence.\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron said on X that \u201cevery effort is being made to find the perpetrators of this crime so that justice can be done in the name of the French people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/europe/prison-ambush-france-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_china_xi-putin-china-summit-intl-hnk", "text": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping will welcome Vladimir Putin to China on Thursday for the Russian president\u2019s second visit in less than a year \u2013 the latest sign of their growing alignment amid hardening global fault lines as conflict devastates Gaza and Russia makes advances in Ukraine. Putin will arrive in China just over a week since entering a new term in office, extending his autocratic rule until 2030 \u2013 the result of an election without any true opposition. His visit, set to take place May 16-17, according to Chinese state media, mirrors Xi\u2019s own state visit to Moscow just over a year ago, where he marked the norm-shattering start of a new term as president \u2013 like Putin, after rewriting rules around how long leaders can serve. Their meeting comes months ahead of the American presidential elections and as Washington faces mounting international backlash over its support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. It\u2019s set to provide a platform for the leaders to discuss how all this can advance their shared ambition to degrade and offer an alternative to American power. The visit also comes as the two leaders operate within what observers say is a loose but growing coordination of interests between avowedly anti-American countries Iran and North Korea. Pyongyang \u2013 which has an economy almost entirely dependent of China \u2013 is believed by Western governments to be\u00a0aiding Russia\u00a0with war supplies.\u00a0So too, the US says,\u00a0is Tehran, which is being bolstered economically by Russia and China and is a powerful player in the conflict in the Middle East. Putin will arrive for the two-day state visit emboldened by the survival of his wartime economy and amid a major new offensive along key points of the front line in Ukraine. For Xi, freshly returned from a European tour, the visit is an opportunity to showcase that his allegiance to Putin has not broken his ability to engage with the West. In an interview with Chinese state news agency Xinhua published Wednesday ahead of his travel, Putin hailed the \u201cgreat prospects\u201d of the countries\u2019 partnership and their joint efforts to \u201cstrengthen the sovereignty, protect the territorial integrity and security of our countries.\u201d The leaders aimed to deepen cooperation in \u201cindustry and high-tech, outer space and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, renewable energy and other innovative sectors,\u201d Putin added. But the optics of the strident allegiance belie a more challenging picture. Pressure is mounting on Beijing from Washington over its alleged support for Russia\u2019s defense industry. In Europe, Xi had to navigate sharp tensions in France \u2013 only welcomed with fanfare in Serbia and Hungary, while China\u2019s key partner, Russia, remains isolated on the world stage. Xi has ramped up his calls for Europe and other countries to help the world avoid a \u201cCold War,\u201d suggesting they resist what Beijing sees as US efforts to contain China. But the leader himself \u2013 including as he hosts Putin this week \u2013 is seen to be tightening relationships to underscore a growing global split that could deepen divisions with the West, whose technology and investment, experts say, China needs. \u201cWe live in a more dangerous world, authoritarian powers are increasingly aligned. Russia is receiving support for its war of aggression from China, Iran and North Korea,\u201d NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned last month. \u201cThis reminds us that security is not regional, security is global. And we must work with our like-minded partners around the world to preserve and protect transatlantic security.\u201d \u2018Grand strategy\u2019 Looming over Xi\u2019s meeting with Putin this week are Western threats of more sweeping actions against his country if it continues sending certain goods to Russia. The US government says dual-use exports are enabling Russia to build up its defense industry. \u201cThe pressures are arguably bigger than they were in the past two years,\u201d said Li Mingjiang, an associate professor of international relations at Singapore\u2019s Nanyang Technological University, pointing to a new raft of sanctions from the US earlier this month targeting Chinese firms \u2013 and the potential for more, including from the EU. China has said it closely monitors exports of dual-use goods and denies its trade with Russia is anything outside of normal bilateral exchange. Bilateral trade between the two countries reached a record $240 billion last year. Even close observers of Xi\u2019s opaque decision-making are divided on whether all this means the Chinese leader will seek to use his time with Putin this week to advocate for a settlement in the conflict soon. But China\u2019s official trade data from March and April both show declines in exports to Russia compared with the same periods the previous year \u2013 indicating Beijing may be taking steps to protect against Western sanctions hitting deeper into its commercial and financial sectors. Any recalibration there, however, is unlikely to stem deepening of cooperation across a range of areas between the two countries, who hold regular military drills and diplomatic exchanges. It\u2019s also unlikely to change Beijing\u2019s bottom line when it comes to Russia\u2019s war, analysts say. \u201cRussia is fundamental to China\u2019s grand strategy,\u201d said Manoj Kewalramani, who heads Indo-Pacific studies at the Takshashila Institution research center in Bangalore. While Beijing doesn\u2019t want escalation, \u201cthere is a deep interest in making sure that Russia doesn\u2019t lose the war,\u201d he said. \u2018Force multipliers\u2019 The war in Gaza \u2014 also expected to be a touchpoint in Xi and Putin\u2019s discussions \u2014 has opened opportunity for the two countries\u2019 shared goals, analysts say. Those goals, broadly speaking, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov put it during a joint presser with his counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing last month, include establishing a \u201cfair multipolar world order\u201d free from American \u201chegemony and neo-colonial\u201d practices, as well as working together to \u201cconsolidate the nations of the Global South.\u201d When it comes to Gaza, both powers have declined to condemn Hamas for its October 7 terror attack on Israel. They have also criticized Israel and the United States \u2013 converging with mounting global backlash, especially across the Global South against Israel\u2019s war. More than 35,000 have died in Gaza during the war, according to the health ministry there, and a mass humanitarian worsens with every week. China has limited hard influence in the region, while Russia has had some level of presence, but \u201cthey see each other as force multipliers,\u201d said Kewalramani in Bangalore, referring to the overlap in their response to this conflict. The conflict has also impacted how China and Russia view their relations with countries there, he added. That includes with Iran, which in the past year joined two Beijing and Moscow-founded international groups, BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. \u201cThey see Iran as part of the new order (they are working to create), whereas they see Israel as a proxy for the United States \u2026 that has become much sharper since October 7,\u201d he said. \u2018Privately and quietly\u2019 But as Xi continues to strengthen his relationship with Putin and Russia in an increasingly fractured world, this also raises questions \u2013 including from within China\u2019s policy circles and the public sphere \u2013 about where that leads the world\u2019s second largest economy. Unlike internationally isolated Russia or Iran, China is still viewed throughout the West as an important player and potential partner on global issues like climate change, despite concerns about its human rights record and aggression in the South China Sea and around Taiwan. \u201cChinese like me feel shameful to receive Vladimir Putin, because his country defies the UN charter \u2026 (and is viewed by) 141 countries as an aggressor,\u201d said Shanghai-based international scholar Shen Dingli. China \u201cwants to use Russia\u201d for its aims, but Russia is making China weak, he said. Popular suspicions and concerns about Russia were on show in China earlier this month, when an account on Chinese social media platform Weibo was set up in the name of prominent Russian ultranationalist thinker Alexander Dugin. Social media users flocked to the unverified page, where some voices called for Ukrainian victory and others pointed to the two countries\u2019 historical frictions, with one user comment that received hundreds of likes calling for Moscow to return lands in the Russian Far East ceded to the Russian empire in the 19th century. CNN was unable to confirm if the account, which garnered more than 100,000 followers, was authentic. Some observers argue that historical mistrust \u2013 linked to border tensions only formally resolved in the early 2000s and China\u2019s Cold War realignment with the US \u2013 mean even Xi and Putin\u2019s close relations are transactional in the face of shared tensions with the West \u2013 or at least lacking trust within their broader government ranks. All this comes into great focus ahead of the upcoming US elections, where the outcome could have a sweeping impact on the future of the war in Ukraine and US engagement with China \u2013 with the re-election of former president Donald Trump perhaps playing to Russia\u2019s benefit. \u201cWe know some Chinese policy analysts would quietly, privately make the argument that is despite American pressures on China and geopolitical contestations in the past few years \u2026 China could have maintained slightly better relations with the US and the West, at the same time, could have avoided developing relationship with Russia to the extent that is so close today,\u201d said Li in Singapore. But in Xi\u2019s China there appears to be little space for such questions. Instead, the summit this week is poised to underline the strength of the partnership \u2013 and an opportunity for both to check in on an aspiration Xi voiced to Putin during his state visit to Moscow just over a year ago. There, he proclaimed that \u201cchanges that have not happened for 100 years\u201d were afoot. \u201cTogether, we should push (these changes) forward,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_05_15_weather_south-gulf-coast-flooding-texas-climate", "text": "Rounds of fierce storms and gushing rainfall are raising the risk of dangerous flooding late this week for millions in the already-waterlogged South. Double-digit rainfall totals between 20 and 30 inches over the region in recent weeks  have soaked the ground and left rivers swollen, priming the flood threat to extreme levels. More widespread heavy rain Thursday and Friday is only going to make matters worse. The forecast calling for extreme rainfall rates and repeated rounds of storms is creating a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d for the Gulf Coast, according to the Weather Prediction Center. \u201cSignificant and considerable flash flooding is likely\u00a0as a result, as multiple inches of rain fall in a matter of a few hours.\u201d A Level 3 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall that could trigger flash flooding is in place from eastern Texas, through Louisiana and into western Mississippi Thursday, according to the WPC. An upgrade to a rare Level 4 of 4 high risk of flooding rainfall is possible by early Thursday as which areas are most at risk becomes clearer. High risk days are exceedingly rare but account for more than 80% of all flood damage and more than a third of all flood deaths in the US. Timing out the significant flood threat Storms, some of which may become severe, are likely to rumble to life Thursday afternoon in parts of Texas and push south and east to reach Louisiana and Mississippi late in the day. Rainfall rates up to 3 inches per hour are possible in the heaviest storms. The greatest flooding danger Thursday will come as storms begin to train. Training storms track through and deluge the same areas over and over, like a train pulling its cars over the same stretch of track. Serious flash flooding is likely in any areas caught under multiple storms unloading 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour. Roadways may quickly become rivers and small streams could easily overflow their banks. Soaking storms will shift east on Friday and target more of the Gulf Coast. Much of southern Mississippi and southern Alabama are under a Level 3 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall on Friday. A larger area from the Texas/Louisiana border to Florida and Georgia is under a Level 2 of 4 risk. Drenching storms from Thursday night will likely last into Friday morning for parts of the Gulf Coast. An initial round of flash flooding is likely in the first half of Friday before rain starts to taper off in the afternoon. Another bout of heavy rain will develop Friday night and work over the same areas hit earlier in the day. These storms could also produce rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour, and quickly restart or \u201cgreatly worsen\u201d any ongoing flooding, according to the WPC. Widespread rainfall totals of 2 to 6 inches are expected from Texas into Georgia through Friday night. A few spots caught under multiple torrential storms may pick up more than half a foot of rain. One of the wettest years to date The upcoming rain will only add to already impressive rainfall totals in what\u2019s been one of the wettest years to date on record across the Gulf Coast. Some Southeast cities have recorded more than half a foot of rain above what\u2019s typical for the first several months of the year. Several dozen cities from Texas to western Georgia are pacing at a top 5 wettest year to date and at least two cities in eastern Texas are experiencing their wettest year, according to the Southeast Regional Climate Center. Dallas is experiencing its third-wettest year to date, while Shreveport, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi, are amid their second wettest. Excessive rainfall has largely eliminated dryness and drought conditions along the Gulf Coast, but is hasn\u2019t come without a cost. Earlier this month, nearly 2 feet of rain fell in just five days and sent parts of eastern Texas underwater. Hundreds of people and animals were rescued from flooding as some area rivers rose to levels not reached since Hurricane Harvey in 2017.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/weather/south-gulf-coast-flooding-texas-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_middleeast_death-toll-gaza-fatalities-un-intl-latam", "text": "The United Nations on Monday clarified that the overall number of fatalities in Gaza tallied by the Ministry of Health in Gaza remains unchanged, at more than 35,000, since the war broke out between Israel and Hamas on October 7. The clarification comes after the UN humanitarian agency OCHA (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) published a report on May 8 with revised data regarding the number of Palestinian casualties in the war. The UN agency in its report reduced the number of women and children believed to have been killed in the war by nearly half. The number was reduced because the UN says it is now relying on the number of deceased women and children whose names and other identifying details have been fully documented, rather than the total number of women and children killed. The ministry says bodies that arrive at hospitals get counted in the overall death count. UN spokesperson Farhan Haq told a daily briefing at the UN that the health ministry in Gaza recently published two separate death tolls \u2013 an overall death toll and a total number of identified fatalities. In the UN report, only the total number of fatalities whose identities (such as name and date of birth) have been documented was published, leading to confusion. According to Haq, the ministry published a breakdown for 24,686 fully identified deaths out of the total 34,622 fatalities recorded in Gaza as of April 30. The fully identified death toll comprises of 7,797 children, 4,959 women, 1,924 elderly, and 10,006 men, the UN spokesperson said, citing the Gaza health ministry. The health authority in Gaza noted that the documentation process of casualties\u2019 full identification details is still ongoing, Haq added. Two officials from the Palestinian Ministry of Health have told CNN that although the ministry keeps a separate death toll for identified and unidentified individuals, the total number of people killed remains unchanged. The total number of dead also does not include the approximately 10,000 people who are still missing and trapped under the rubble, the officials added. Israel launched its military assault on Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people in Israel and abducted more than 250 others. Israel\u2019s months-long siege of the Palestinian enclave has since pulverized large parts of Gaza and drastically diminished critical supplies, exposing the entire population of more than 2.2 million people to the risk\u00a0of famine. CNN has seen a daily report from the Palestinian health ministry which matches the number OCHA published in the revised version. A total of 15,103 children and 9,961 women have been killed in Gaza since October 7, the Gaza ministry of health said in its latest report. Both the UN and US officials have previously appraised the figures from the Ministry of Health in Gaza as credible.  CNN cannot independently verify the ministry\u2019s numbers. The ministry does not distinguish between casualties among fighters and civilians.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/middleeast/death-toll-gaza-fatalities-un-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_style_king-charles-first-portrait-since-coronation-unveiled", "text": " Buckingham Palace revealed the first official portrait of King Charles III since his coronation on Tuesday, and it\u2019s proving to be divisive with its lurid red brushstrokes. The 8.5 by 6.5-foot painting is by British artist Jonathan Yeo, who has painted high-profile subjects throughout his career including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, actor Nicole Kidman and education activist Malala Yousafzai. Yeo, who began the project while Charles was still Prince of Wales, depicts the monarch wearing the uniform of the Welsh Guards, sword in hand, against a fiery red background that appears to almost swallow him whole, as a butterfly looks like it\u2019s about to land on his shoulder. \u201cMuch like the butterfly I\u2019ve painted hovering over his shoulder, this portrait has evolved as the subject\u2019s role in our public life has transformed,\u201d said Yeo in a statement released by Buckingham Palace. \u201cI do my best to capture the life experiences etched into any individual sitter\u2019s face. In this case, my aim was also to make reference to the traditions of royal portraiture but in a way that reflects a 21st century monarchy and, above all else, to communicate the subject\u2019s deep humanity.\u201d Yeo had four sittings with the King, and also worked from drawings and photographs according to the palace. The work was commissioned to celebrate the 50th\u00a0anniversary of Charles\u2019 membership in The Drapers\u2019 Company, which funds education initiatives among other philanthropic efforts, and will be exhibited to the public from\u00a0May 16 to June 14 at the Philip Mould Gallery in London. It will later hang at Drapers\u2019 Hall from the end of August alongside other royal portraits. The King and Queen are reportedly happy with the portrait \u2014 Yeo\u00a0told\u00a0the BBC Camilla said: \u201cYes you\u2019ve got him,\u201d after seeing the result, while the monarch was \u201cmildly surprised by the strong color, but otherwise he seemed to be smiling approvingly\u201d \u2014 and there was no shortage of commentary on social media. Commenting under a post of the portrait on the royal family\u2019s Instagram account, one user wrote: \u201cwith the uniform and that color it looks like (the) visual representation of the massacre cause by colonizers,\u201d and one said: \u201cI would have loved this if this was any other color than red. He really captured the essence of him in the face, but the harshness of the red doesn\u2019t match the softness of his expression.\u201d Another post read: \u201cLooks like he\u2019s going straight to hell.\u201d Art historian\u00a0Richard Morris\u00a0said on X, \u201cI really like the portrait\u2026 before photography, to have a great painter capture your real appearance you accepted the revelation of your flaws and your mortality. It\u2019s what Yeo captures here.\u201d While the celebrated artist works mainly in oils, he has dabbled in another medium: collage. In 2007, after a commission to paint former US President George W. Bush fell through, he decided to make an \u201cironic homage,\u201d according to his website, by collaging cutouts from hardcore pornographic magazines to create a portrait of the then US president, a satire on \u201cthe assumed moral superiority of the extreme right in American politics.\u201d It was the first in a wider series depicting public figures \u201cunderstood to have traded on their sexual morality,\u201d including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sarah Palin, Silvio Berlusconi and British conservative activist Mary Whitehouse. As for the portrait of the K\ufeffing, Yeo said\u00a0on his website\u00a0that the vivid colors of the glazes are \u201cnot only resonating with the royal heritage found in many historical portraits but also injecting a dynamic, contemporary jolt into the genre with its uniformly powerful hue \u2014\u00a0\u00a0providing a modern contrast to more traditional depictions.\u201d He added the butterfly symbolized beauty and nature while highlighting the king\u2019s passion for the environment. Yeo\u2019s paintings are included in the permanent collection of London\u2019s National Portrait Gallery. The King is an artist himself, and a collection of his watercolors went on show in London in 2022. He has previously described painting as \u201cone of the most relaxing and therapeutic exercises I know,\u201d adding that it \u201crefreshes parts of the soul which other activities can\u2019t reach.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/style/king-charles-first-portrait-since-coronation-unveiled/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_africa_meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam", "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on what was officially dubbed a 3-day private visit to Nigeria, yet it unfolded with all the grandeur and attention typically reserved for royal tours. Their first day saw them receive a red-carpet welcome complete with cultural dancers following their arrival in the Nigerian capital\u00a0of\u00a0Abuja, where they kicked off a multi-day mental health summit at Lightway Academy. There, they also unveiled a partnership between their Archewell Foundation and the\u00a0GEANCO Foundation to provide students with school supplies and menstrual products. The pair had been invited to the West African nation by the country\u2019s highest-ranking military official, Christopher Musa. After meeting him at the\u00a0Nigerian Defence Headquarters, Meghan signed a guest book thanking officials for \u201cwelcoming me home.\u201d Despite the private nature of their visit, the couple\u2019s itinerary resembled previous official tours they carried out before stepping back as senior working royals in 2020. They were warmly received everywhere they went, with Nigerians showcasing their famed hospitality. The couple were showered with gifts, including\u00a0a touching portrait of a young Harry with his mum. For both Nigeria and the Sussexes, this visit held significant weight. It was an opportunity for Nigeria to demonstrate its capability to host such high-profile guests and dispel any doubts raised by skeptics, especially considering the country\u2019s standing in the eyes of the UK\u2019s Foreign Office as one of the most dangerous countries to visit in the world. Nigeria has security issues with a terrorist insurgency in the northeast and northwest.\u00a0However, it is a huge country \u2014\u00a0 larger than the US state of Texas\u00a0 \u2014 and the other areas\u00a0visited by the royal couple over the past several days are relatively safe. Meanwhile, for Prince Harry and Meghan, this marked their first major trip to Africa since relinquishing\u00a0their official royal duties. It was a chance for them to engage in a hearts-and-minds charm offensive, which they executed with aplomb. Meghan, in particular, embraced exploring her Nigerian ancestry\u00a0after discovering several years ago\u00a0that she is 43% Nigerian\u00a0through a genealogy test. On Saturday, she co-hosted a women\u2019s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, for about 50 leading women from across Nigerian society and politics, business, media, and culture. During a panel discussion, moderated by Nigerian media mogul Mo Abudu, the duchess\u00a0spoke passionately about uncovering\u00a0her Nigerian roots and its significance to her own identity. She described Nigeria as \u201cmy country,\u201d adding\u00a0that \u201cbeing African American, part of it is not knowing so much about your lineage or background, where you come from specifically. And it was exciting \u2026 to discover more and understand what that really means.\u201d It was here that Meghan\u2019s natural ability to connect really shone through. She chatted\u00a0effortlessly with attendees, posed\u00a0for selfies and engaged\u00a0in heartfelt conversations. At another event on Sunday at the prestigious Delborough Hotel in Lagos\u00a0- where the great and good of Nigerian society had gathered to welcome the couple\u00a0-\u00a0she appeared visibly moved when three powerful traditional rulers honored her with royal titles. The Obi of Onitsha, His Majesty Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe christened Meghan \u201cAda Mazi,\u201d which means \u201cthe daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace.\u201d While, the Oluwo of Iwoland, southwest, Nigeria,\u00a0Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi christened her with the Yoruba name of \u201cAdetokunbo\u201d which means \u201croyalty from across the seas.\u201d Their engagements during the three-day visit were centered around their core passions:\u00a0sports rehabilitation,\u00a0mental health, and women\u2019s empowerment. For Harry\u2019s part, the duke\u00a0demonstrated his compassion and connection to his late mother, Princess Diana, as he visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kaduna, 150 miles from Abuja. His first stop was to drop in on the governor of Kaduna state, Senator Uba Sani, where he was again welcomed by a troupe of dancers and a red carpet.\u00a0Governor Sani sat opposite him and praised Harry as a \u201csymbol of courage,\u201d and \u201cpraised his service to his country.\u201d He added, \u201cPlease give our regards to the Duchess of Sussex, Princess Meghan.\u201d Harry toured about six wards at the Nigerian Army Reference\u00a0Hospital and met young men recuperating from their injuries. Many had been shot, ambushed by Boko Haram, or lost limbs due to blasts. One moment captured by photographer Misan Harriman, showing Harry holding a wounded soldier lying on the hospital bed resonated deeply and went viral on social media. Corporal Yusef, 23, who had been shot through the knee, spoke with the duke, who\u00a0asked him about his rehab. \u201cAre you going to try for the Invictus Games team? Are you preparing for that?\u2026 We will see you there,\u201d Harry said. Their visit also extended to cultural experiences, such as witnessing a vibrant dance performance and a polo match at the historic Lagos Polo Club. Polo holds special significance for Harry and the event provided a platform to showcase his longstanding commitment to the sport and its charitable endeavors. Amid the festivities, the couple expressed gratitude for Nigeria\u2019s warm reception.\u00a0As they bid farewell to Nigeria, Meghan declared: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to come back!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/africa/meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_driverless-car-race-abu-dhabi-spc", "text": "Hype over autonomous vehicles has sometimes outpaced reality. For years, forecasters have predicted that driverless cars, which would allow the average commuter to snooze or watch Netflix on their way into the office, were just around the corner. Many experts have tempered their expectations. Widespread implementation of autonomous technology won\u2019t be realized within the next decade, according to an\u202fanalysis\u202freleased in late 2023 by S&P Global Mobility, which provides insights into the automotive industry. But Lakmal Seneviratne, the founding director of the Khalifa University Center for Autonomous Robotic Systems (KUCARS) in Abu Dhabi, believes that autonomous mobility still has a bright future. He\u2019s been working on robotics since the 1980s, and he\u2019s surprised by how quickly autonomous technology has advanced. He sees this in his day-to-day work at KUCARS, where researchers are working on everything from autonomous cars and drones to marine, agricultural, and manufacturing robotics. Last month, the point was driven home when Khalifa University participated in the inaugural Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League event, or the A2RL, which pitted technologists from across the world against each other in a series of challenges. There have been other autonomous car races before, but A2RL\u2019s was the first to include a race between four driverless cars, according to organizers. \u201cIf you asked me even 10 or 15 years ago if I would ever see an autonomous car race, I would have said: \u2018No, not in my lifetime\u2019,\u201d Seneviratne told CNN via video call after the event. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see how that technology has developed.\u201d \u2018Real world robotics is very, very hard\u2019 Khalifa University, which partnered with the Beijing\u202fInstitute of Technology to form team Fly Eagle, didn\u2019t end up racing in the final. Its car crashed a few days before the race, and they couldn\u2019t get things back on track. It wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing for the four teams that did compete on Abu Dhabi\u2019s Yas Marina Circuit, where in November Formula One\u2019s Max Verstappen ended a record-breaking season with an Abu Dhabi Grand Prix win. Technical University of Munich (TUM)\u2019s car stopped on the track, before restarting. Team Polimove\u2019s vehicle spun around after its tires locked up. Soon after, another car came to a halt \u2013 leaving just TUM moving. Then its car stopped too. Three cars were able to get going again, but towards the end of the race, the leader came to an abrupt halt, and TUM overtook it to cruise to victory. Seneviratne wasn\u2019t exactly surprised by the difficulties. He said that some of the challenges were beyond the scope of today\u2019s technology. \u201cReal world robotics is very, very hard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was good to push the community.\u201d Simon Hoffman, TUM\u2019s team principal, told CNN that past autonomous events\u00a0have only raced with two cars on the track at a time, and that any multiple-vehicle races have been on oval tracks. By contrast, Yas Marina Circuit has tight turns, chicanes and hairpins.\u00a0The track is a permanent fixture on Yas Island, but it has elements of a street circuit built in. \u201cI think it\u2019s more challenging to do it on road courses because you have sharper turns, need to brake into turns, you see higher delta speeds between cars, which makes it more difficult,\u201d Hoffman added. Pushing the technology to the edge Efforts to set driverless cars loose on public roads have faced setbacks, especially as the result of collisions with unforeseen obstacles. In 2018, for example, a self-driving Uber SUV killed a woman pushing her bicycle across a street, outside of a crosswalk, because it didn\u2019t recognize a jaywalking pedestrian. The\u202fability to master so-called \u201cedge cases\u201d \u2013 situations which push technology to the limits of its ability, perhaps as the result of unexpected and improbable events \u2013 will be crucial before driverless vehicles can be widely adopted. Some observers, organizers and participants say that endeavors like AR2L \u2013 where the technology can be tested at its limits \u2013 may provide a productive training ground for driverless cars. \u201cIf you have other cars, how do you react with them? How do you overtake them at speed, in edge conditions?\u201d says Seneviratne. Hoffman agrees. \u201cIf we can develop robust software that \u2026 works in these conditions here, with very high speeds with other cars \u2026 we can make the software for autonomous driving more robust and more reliable, and in the end safer for everyone,\u201d he says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/driverless-car-race-abu-dhabi-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}

The two attended an event Saturday held by Nigeria\u2019s Defence Staff and \u2018Nigeria: Unconquered\u2019 \u2013 a local charity supporting wounded servicemembers inspired by the Duke of Sussex\u2019s Invictus Games Foundation. After arriving at an officer\u2019s mess late morning local time they were immediately taken to watch a sitting volleyball game. They were given scarves in the green and white colors of Nigeria as they took their seats\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0arena.

{"id": "2024_05_15_sport_ye-yang-pga-championship-tiger-woods-spt-intl", "text": "After tossing and turning all through the night, Y.E. Yang awoke in uncharted waters. To complicate matters further, the golfing equivalent of the kraken circled around him. On Sunday morning at the 2009 PGA Championship, the then-37-year-old South Korean \u2013 ranked 110th in the world \u2013 stood just 18 holes away from becoming the first Asian-born player to win a major golf championship. Yet for one piece of history to be penned, another would have to be erased. Tiger Woods, world No. 1 for four years and counting, had never before surrendered a major after starting the final round atop the leaderboard \u2013 14 leads, 14 wins. Two shots clear, few tuning in to the finale at Hazeltine National in Chaska, Minnesota, expected that run to be snuffed out. Little did they know, \u201cThe Tiger Killer\u201d was on the hunt. Average Joe In 1978, a two-year-old Woods doddered onto the set of the \u201cThe Mike Douglas Show\u201d to showcase his already-impressive swing to the American public. By contrast, Yang \u2013 seven years his senior \u2013 had not even heard of a sport called golf until he was 19. By that age, Woods had already made his debut at The Masters. Just two years later in 1997, he would finish 12 shots ahead of his nearest rival at Augusta National to become the major\u2019s youngest ever winner and strengthen his claim to household name status. Well, perhaps not every household. Some 7,400 miles away in the island province of Jeju, Yang was unaware of professional golf tournaments \u2013 let alone the PGA Tour \u2013 until his early twenties. An aspiring bodybuilder, the teenager and self-confessed \u201caverage Joe\u201d had dreamed of running his own gym. Yet when his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) was torn in a fall down a flight of stairs, so too were those hopes. Needing to make ends meet, a 19-year-old Yang took up a job at his local driving range on the suggestion of a friend. The pay was a world away from the riches Woods was accumulating at the same age, but the job allowed him to eat and sleep on site and \u2013 fatefully for his American counterpart \u2013 put a club in his hands. Hooked from the first swing, Yang would break par for the first time three years later \u2013 his early progress entirely self-taught from pouring over tournament footage and instructional videos. It was a rate of improvement made even more impressive by the fact that he spent two years doing mandatory military service after his 21st birthday. Yang had never intended to take it any further than that, but that changed when he learned of the professional circuits in Korea and beyond. He turned semi-professional aged 23 in 1995 before making the jump to pro the following August. A maiden title would arrive six years later, but by 2007, he was still fighting to gain PGA Tour membership for the first time and was yet to win outside Asia. However, his seventh and latest victory in Shanghai, China was a standout, and not just because it marked his first on the European Tour. A star-studded field could not keep pace with Yang at the 2006 HSBC Champions \u2013 even Woods. The world No. 1 finished as runner-up, three shots adrift of the South Korean. It would not be the last time. \u2018Who the heck is Y.E. Yang?\u2019 Despite his giant-slaying efforts, Yang was still relatively unknown when he pitched up to PGA Tour qualifying school the following season. \u201cWho the heck is Y.E. Yang?\u201d AJ Montecinos replied when a fellow caddie texted him to say that a talented South Korean was in need of a bagman for the second stage. The Texas-based Montecinos would find out soon enough, as Yang won on the duo\u2019s first team-up. \u201cI\u2019d never been around a stronger golf mind, ever,\u201d Montecinos told CNN. \u201cHis mind was so simple, yet so strong. It blew me away how he never overthought, he never got in his own way \u2013 he just played golf and it was very impressive to watch.\u201d Yet as Yang clinched his first PGA Tour card and jetted across the US in 2008, Montecinos was forced to wait for his first taste of the circuit. The golfer had a different caddie setup for the final stage of qualifying and for his debut PGA Tour season, leaving Montecinos \u2013 without a bag to carry \u2013 \u201cstruggling\u201d to sell mortgage loans in San Antonio. Fate and faltering form would reunite the pair. Yang finished 157th on the money list for the season, forcing him back to qualifying school in 2009. Montecinos returned on Yang\u2019s request, and the duo edged through in nail-biting fashion to preserve the golfer\u2019s PGA Tour status. It was enough to convince Yang to bring Montecinos along this time round, and the decision reaped instant reward. Yang clinched his first PGA Tour title on his fourth start of the season at the Honda Classic to join K.J. Choi as the only South Koreans to win on the premier circuit. Into the Tiger\u2019s den Even so, Yang arrived at the PGA Championship that August as a rank outsider to lift the Wanamaker Trophy. Seven prior major appearances had resulted in just two made cuts, but Yang started with the confidence of a seasoned contender at Hazeltine to cruise into the weekend in tied-ninth, six shots behind runaway leader Woods. The chasing pack made up ground on moving day, and none more so than Yang, who shot a brilliant five-under 67. Not only did it rocket the underdog to within two shots of the American, but it also secured a final round pairing with him. Yang had bested Woods once before, though this was an entirely different stage. \u201cAt first when I saw the tee time, I was just really happy to be in the last group on the final day of a major,\u201d he later told reporters. \u201cFor a split second that was the first thought. And then second, my heart nearly pounded and exploded [from] being so nervous.\u201d Having failed in his bid to get to sleep early and woken several times in the night, Yang rose Sunday morning bleary-eyed and \u2013 as his agent relayed to Montecinos \u2013 still a little anxious. The caddie was on hand with some soothing words, but any concerns Montecinos had evaporated when the South Korean raced out of the blocks to head to the fifth tee level at the top with Woods. \u201cFrom those first few holes, I didn\u2019t know if he was going to win, but I knew he wasn\u2019t going to back down \u2013 and that\u2019s all I cared about,\u201d Montecinos said. \u201cI think being nervous is a good thing. But knowing how to harness that nervous energy and knowing how to utilize that for your good instead of for your harm, I think that\u2019s what makes Yang so special. \u201cI love staring down the best in the world, that\u2019s what really gets me going. I was a little nervous as well, but I just knew that neither of us were going to beat ourselves.\u201d Of course, that still left the small problem of defeating \u2013 as far as Montecinos is concerned \u2013 the greatest ever to play the game. It\u2019s not only Woods the golfer you\u2019re taking on, the caddie recalled \u2013 it\u2019s also the 50-person-deep crowds roaring his every shot, as well as an incommunicable \u201caura\u201d that even the game\u2019s greatest have buckled under. \u201cOh you definitely feel it. He had that kind of intimidation factor ever since he came on Tour,\u201d Montecinos, who played against Woods in high school, said. \u201cPlaying golf with Tiger in a major is like playing golf on the inside of a radio with every station going at the same time.\u201d Yet Yang refused to buckle, the conquering of his prior nerves perfectly summed up at the sixth hole when he was approached by a rules official ordering him to speed up his pace of play. \u201cNot me,\u201d a deadpan Yang replied, raising his finger to point at Woods. \u201cHim.\u201d Pandemonium As Woods wilted under a series of uncharacteristically sloppy putts, a remarkable chip-in eagle rewarded Yang with his first ever major lead at the 14th hole. The South Korean roared in delight, and would repeat the celebration four holes later \u2013 this time with his golf bag raised triumphantly above his head \u2013 after a stunning 18th approach was converted by a birdie putt for the championship. With Woods only able to bogey, compounding a disappointing three-over 75 final round, Yang was crowned a major champion and \u201cThe Tiger Killer\u201d nickname was born. \u201cI wasn\u2019t that nervous because it\u2019s a game of golf,\u201d Yang told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not like \u2026 you\u2019re fighting against Tiger and he\u2019s going to bite you or swing at you with his nine-iron. \u201cI knew the odds were against me. I tried to be the least nervous I have ever been and went for broke. \u201cThe worst I could do was just lose to Tiger and go a few ranks down in the final scoreboard. Nobody is going to be really disappointed that I lose. So I really had nothing much at stake and that\u2019s how I played it,\u201d he added. Woods, having been denied a record-equaling fifth PGA Championship title, was magnanimous in defeat. \u201cI don\u2019t think he really missed a shot all day \u2026 I think he played beautifully,\u201d Woods said. \u201cIt was just a matter of time before an Asian-born player was going to win.\u201d That inevitability did little to quell the intensity of celebrations when Yang returned home. \u201cJust pandemonium,\u201d Montecinos said, picturing the hordes that flocked to the airport in the twilight hours to greet Yang in Korea soon after. When he touched down for the Hong Kong Open, Asia\u2019s first major champion was greeted by the sight of himself plastered on the side of a 10-storey building. \u201cIt was just unbelievable, very surreal,\u201d Montecinos added. \u201cTo be a part of history, I\u2019m very grateful.\u201d Japanese golfer Hideki Matsuyama\u2019s triumph at the 2021 Masters saw him join Yang in the exclusive winner\u2019s circle for Asian players at majors. It is a far less exclusive club on the women\u2019s side, with 35 LPGA major trophies handed out to South Korean champions alone. Cast of 2009 Yang and Montecinos parted ways a few years later but recently caught up at an event on the PGA Tour Champions, the senior circuit where Yang \u2013 now 52 \u2013 is currently chasing a first victory. \u201cIt was cool to see him,\u201d said Montecinos. \u201cIt was the relationship I miss with Yang \u2026 We had a lot of fun together.\u201d Yang\u2019s PGA Championship triumph remains his most recent at a Tour event, but his status as a former champion has ensured his near-permanent presence at the major. Bar 2020, Yang has competed at every edition since and is set to tee off for the 17th time at Valhalla in Kentucky on Thursday, 15 years after his famous victory. He will be joined by Montecinos\u2019 latest assignment, Chris Gotterup. The 24-year-old American stamped a last-minute ticket to Valhalla with his first PGA Tour victory at the inaugural Myrtle Beach Classic on Sunday. Completing the cast of 2009 is Woods, still chasing a fifth Wanamaker. After a record-breaking 24th consecutive cut at The Masters last month, the 48-year-old remains adamant that \u2013 despite his well-documented injury woes \u2013 he is capable of adding to his 15-major haul. Montecinos certainly isn\u2019t ruling it out. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should ever doubt that man, because he has done things in golf \u2013 and with a golf club \u2013 that nobody else has ever done,\u201d Montecinos said. \u201cYou cannot quantify the intestinal fortitude of a Tiger Woods. So in my mind, I believe that he will win again. I don\u2019t know where that will be, or if it will be a major, but I would not put it past him. \u201cI would not doubt him, because he is the reason that we play for as much money as we play for. Period. There is no other player out there that moves the needle like he does.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_15_europe_slovakia-prime-minister-fico-shooting-intl", "text": "Slovakia\u2019s Prime Minister Robert Fico was hospitalized on Wednesday after he was shot five times in an assassination attempt that shocked the country. The attack took place after an off-site government meeting in the central Slovak town of Handlova. The suspected gunman was among a small crowd of people waiting to greet the prime minister on the street outside the cultural center, where the meeting took place, local media reported. Footage from the scene shows the injured prime minister being bundled into a vehicle by his staff, before it speeds away with him inside. Fico was taken to a local hospital and then transferred by helicopter to a major trauma center about 20 miles (30 kilometers) away in Banska Bystrica. No one else was injured in the attack, officials said. Both the country\u2019s Defense Minister Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k and Interior Minister Mat\u00fa\u0161 \u0160utaj E\u0161tok called the shooting \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d with \u0160utaj E\u0161tok saying that \u201cthe suspect made the decision to do it shortly after the presidential election.\u201d Slovakian deputy Prime Minister Tom\u00e1\u0161 Taraba said he believed the prime minister would survive following surgery that \u201cwent well\u201d and was \u201cnot in a life-threatening situation at this moment.\u201d \u201cI was very shocked and tried to contact people to figure out how serious his condition was,\u201d Taraba said in an interview with BBC\u2019s Newshour program on Wednesday, recalling the moment he heard about Fico\u2019s shooting. \u201cFortunately, as far as I know the operation went well and I guess in the end he will survive,\u201d he said. Taraba told the BBC that Fico \u201cwas heavily injured\u201d and a bullet \u201cwent through the stomach and the second one hit the joints.\u201d Fico is the most powerful lawmaker in Slovakia. Unlike the president, whose role has limited scope, the prime minister holds rank as the decision-making head of government. The official statement posted on Fico\u2019s official Facebook said the PM was taken to Banska Bystrica instead of the capital city of Bratislava because \u201can acute intervention\u201d was necessary. Handlova is about two hours\u2019 drive from the capital Bratislava. Slovak President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 said the suspected gunman was detained by the police. She said law enforcement agencies will release more information when they can and asked the public not to spread unconfirmed rumors. \u010caputov\u00e1 condemned what she called a \u201cbrutal and reckless\u201d attack on the 59-year-old politician. Speaking at a news conference later in the afternoon, she said the shooting was \u201can attack on democracy as well.\u201d Slovakia\u2019s defense and interior ministers blamed rising hate speech and division for the political atmosphere in the country, which they said led to the assassination attempt. Speaking to reporters in front of the hospital where Fico is being treated, Defense Minister Kali\u0148\u00e1k\u00a0said: \u201cHate is not an answer to hate.\u201d Visibly shaken and struggling for words at multiple moments during the news conference, Kali\u0148\u00e1k\u00a0said it was \u201ctime for some people to have a hard look into the mirror.\u201d \u201cThere is no question that this was politically motivated. The inability to accept the choice of people, which some may not like \u2026 it leads to this,\u201d he said. Interior Minister \u0160utaj-E\u0161tok called for calm, saying \u201cthose who are endorsing this attack as well as those who are calling for some sort of a revenge. And I am asking you, the media too, please, use your power, your influence. Because until now, it was some of you who sow the hate,\u201d he said. Following the shooting, \u0160utaj-E\u0161tok said the country is \u201cexperiencing the worst day of its democracy.\u201d \u201cFor the first time in the 31 years of our democratic sovereign republic, someone has decided to express a political opinion not in an election but with a gun on the street,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. Slovaks have been deeply divided over the country\u2019s direction and position in the world since Fico\u2019s return to power last year. Supporters see Fico as a caring leader who has their interests at heart; critics say he is a populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks for the country. The country has seen weeks of largely peaceful protests over his coalition government\u2019s controversial domestic reforms. The government is also trying to shut down public service broadcaster RTVS and plans to replace it with a new national broadcaster, which would be under tighter control of the government. Felt like a \u2018nightmare\u2019 Social media footage appeared to show the moment Fico was attacked. As he approaches a crowd of people, a man is seen lunging towards Fico with what appears to be a gun pointed at him.  Five shots are heard and Fico falls to the ground. An eyewitness who was at the scene where Fico was shot said the attack felt like a \u201cnightmare\u201d after hearing three \u201cquick\u201d shots, fired one after the other as if you were to \u201cthrow a firecracker on the ground.\u201d \u201cI heard three shots, it was quick one by one like if you throw a firecracker on the ground,\u201d eyewitness\u00a0Lubica Valkova told Reuters, adding that \u201che (Fico) fell next to the barrier.\u201d \u201cI think it is a nightmare, I\u2019ll tell you I think I will not wake up from this,\u201d the 66-year-old said. \u201cThat this is not possible to happen in\u00a0Slovakia.\u201d Valkova said she had been waiting a long time to shake Fico\u2019s hand and was taking pictures of him when he walked out of the building in Handlova. \u201cAt this moment we heard something like a bang, we thought someone made a joke and threw a firecracker on the ground, that was my first reaction,\u201d Valkova recalled. The Slovak resident told Reuters she had been waiting from 10 a.m. local time. She claimed police did not search people who were waiting at the event, adding that \u201cwe could have shown our empty hands.\u201d Ally of Moscow In what was a stunning comeback for the controversial politician, Fico won a third term as Slovakian prime minister last October after running a campaign that criticized western support for Ukraine. As prime minister, he made a major U-turn in Slovakia\u2019s foreign policy and its previously staunch support for Ukraine: Fico had pledged an immediate end to Slovak military support for Ukraine and promised to block Ukraine\u2019s NATO ambitions. Ahead of the election, Fico made no secret of his sympathies towards the Kremlin and blamed \u201cUkrainian Nazis and fascists\u201d for provoking Vladimir Putin into launching the invasion, repeating the\u00a0false narrative Russia\u2019s president\u00a0has used to justify his invasion. While in opposition, Fico became a close ally of Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, especially when it came to criticism of the European Union. Domestically, his coalition government is also pushing controversial reforms that have prompted weeks of large-scale peaceful protests. Attempts to overhaul the criminal justice system have been particularly controversial, as the government seeks to reduce penalties for corruption and has already abolished Slovakia\u2019s special prosecutor\u2019s office, which was tasked with investigating serious and politically sensitive corruption cases, including some that involved people connected to Fico and his party SMER (\u201cDirection \u2013 Social Democracy\u201d). Fico previously served as Slovakia\u2019s prime minister for more than a decade, first between 2006 and 2010 and then again from 2012 to 2018. He was forced to resign in March 2018 after weeks of mass protests over the murder of investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fianc\u00e9e, Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1. Kuciak reported on corruption among the country\u2019s elite, including people directly connected to Fico and his party SMER. World leaders immediately condemned the attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a telegram to Slovakia\u2019s president that \u201cthere can be no justification for this monstrous crime\u201d and wished Fico a speedy and complete recovery. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, tweeted: \u201cI strongly condemn the vile attack on Prime Minister Robert Fico. Such acts of violence have no place in our society and undermine democracy, our most precious common good.\u201d And Hungarian Prime Minister Orban added: \u201cI was deeply shocked by the heinous attack against my friend, Prime Minister Robert Fico. We pray for his health and quick recovery!\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed \u201csolidarity with the people of Slovakia\u201d following the \u201cappalling\u201d assault on Fico. US President Joe Biden said he was \u201calarmed\u201d by the attempted assassination of Fico, calling it a \u201chorrific act of violence.\u201d \u201cJill and I are praying for a swift recovery, and our thoughts are with his family and the people of Slovakia,\u201d he said in a statement. United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he \u201cstrongly condemns the shocking attack.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

{"id": "2024_05_15_weather_canada-wildfires-fort-mcmurray-climate-wednesday", "text": "Improving winds and a storm moving into western Canada are providing a temporary boost to firefighters battling massive wildfires, but the danger remains heightened as they burn close to three communities. Drought-starved vegetation and days of gusty winds have fueled more than 100 wildfires tearing across Canada that have choked the air with smoke and forced thousands to evacuate since the weekend. But weather conditions took a turn midweek and are providing some help for firefighters working to gain the upper hand on the flames. Winds have died down in some areas and shifted in others, pushing flames away from Alberta\u2019s Fort McMurray, a city still haunted by a catastrophic 2016 fire dubbed \u201cThe Beast.\u201d A large, slow-moving storm will also track through western and central Canada from midweek into the weekend. Cooler air from the storm will flow across fire-torn provinces while relative humidity levels rise and chances for rain increase. While the assist from Mother Nature will not last indefinitely, any potential containment is welcome news for the thousands of people whose homes and businesses are at risk. Roads out of Fort McMurray were crammed with evacuating cars Tuesday as an out-of-control 51,000-acre wildfire\u00a0crept toward the city\u2019s edge. The approaching flames conjured up terrifying memories for residents who lived through the 2016 fires, which forced 90,000 people to evacuate and wrought billions of dollars in damage to homes and businesses. Evacuation orders were issued for the city\u2019s neighborhoods of Prairie Creek, Beacon Hill, Abasand and Grayling Terrace on Tuesday. The rest of the city and several surrounding suburbs are on alert to evacuate at a moment\u2019s notice. Roughly 6,600 people in Alberta had evacuated as of Wednesday,\u00a0local officials said during a Wednesday news conference. Residents can expect to be away from their homes until at least May 21, the regional municipality said in a news release. A veil of thick smoke made it difficult for firefighters to see as they battled \u201cextreme fire behavior,\u201d Tuesday Alberta Wildfire Information Officer Josee St-Onge said. Safety concerns have prompted some firefighters to be removed from the front lines. Officials sought to assuage the concerns of residents who vividly recall the 2016 fires, which tore through more than 1.4 million acres and destroyed about 2,400 homes and businesses \u2013 the most expensive natural disaster in Canada\u2019s history. \u201cI want to recognize the anxiety that this brings, certainly to those residents that were here in 2016, and to those where this is their first experience and have heard the stories,\u201d said Regional Fire Chief Jody Butz. \u201cWe are confident that we have the resources to defend these areas, but we need people out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d St-Onge said Wednesday less than 1 millimeter of rain fell on the fire overnight. \u201cActive fire behavior is expected today but should be less than yesterday, thanks to cooler temperatures and weaker winds,\u201d she said, adding firefighters would begin establishing a containment line. Currently, 117 firefighters and 21 helicopters have been assigned to the firefight, according to St-Onge. But despite the weather improvements, St-Onge warned there was \u201ca lot of work to be done to contain this fire and we are still expecting high fire activity today.\u201d The country\u2019s wildfire season is off to a troubling pace as new fires ignite each day and dormant so-called \u201czombie\u201d fires reanimate. The 2024 fire season isn\u2019t yet on par with last year\u2019s record-shattering season but with wildfire behavior worsening in a warming world it\u2019s no wonder Canadian fire officials are warning of an \u201cexplosive\u201d season that may rival last year. Hazardous smoke from the blazes has also been wafting into the US and reducing air quality. Degraded air quality levels were in place Wednesday from the Dakotas into Oklahoma. The central US will remain the focal point for Canadian smoke through at least midweek, before it is pushed from the area by an incoming storm system. \u2018It\u2019s a war zone\u2019 Multiple blazes exploded in size across several provinces early this week, forcing thousands of Canadians to flee their homes with children, pets and bags stuffed with essentials and cherished possessions in tow. \u201cThis is a very difficult time for people who have been asked to leave behind their home, their belongings and their community without the certainty of what will remain when they return,\u201d Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said in a Tuesday statement. Manitoba first responders are tackling one of the largest wildfires in Canada, which has consumed at least 78,000 acres and was within a mile of the Cranberry Portage community as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the province\u2019s media release. More than 500 residents had been evacuated from the area as several neighborhoods were ordered to leave. In British Columbia, more favorable weather conditions helped slow the advance of the northeastern Parker Lake Fire toward the town of Fort Nelson. At least 4,800 people in the area are under evacuation orders, including the Fort Nelson First Nation. Rick Seidel, the owner of a local construction and trucking company,\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Canadian news partner CBC he stayed back to help fight the flames. \u201cWe\u2019ve had all our equipment ready and all our water trucks were loaded. When the call came we jumped into action,\u201d Seidel told CBC on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad. It\u2019s a war zone right now,\u201d Seidel said. Climate change fuels worsening wildfires Gusty winds are driving ongoing fires in Canada, but the seeds of fire activity were sown over the winter and in past years as the world continues to warm because of human-driven climate change. \u201cThis region has experienced multiple years of drought, with a below normal snowpack this past winter,\u201d said Ben Boghean, fire behavior specialist for the BC Wildfire Service. \u201cAs a result of this, our forests in the Fort Nelson zone are very receptive\u00a0to new fire ignitions and rapid rates of spread.\u201d Declining snow, increasing temperatures and worsening droughts are all hallmarks of climate change and are projected to keep driving larger and more intense fires across Canada,\u00a0according to Environment Canada. Last year was Canada\u2019s most devastating fire season on record, including in British Columbia, where fires burned through hundreds of homes and an area the size of Maryland, according to the\u00a0BC Wildfire Service. There are more than 130 fires burning across Canada, 42 of which are considered out of control,\u00a0according to the Canadian Interagency Fire Centre. Some of the blazes are so-called \u201choldover fires\u201d also known colloquially as \u201czombie fires,\u201d the smoldering remains of last season\u2019s epic blazes, burning deep in the ground throughout the winter and reigniting when exposed to warmer temperatures in the spring. \u201cIn the past, the winter conditions are what put out a lot of holdover fires,\u201d said Bowinn Ma, British Columbia\u2019s minister of emergency management and climate readiness. \u201cIn this case, what we\u2019ve seen is that due to higher temperatures and persistent drought through the last year, many of these holdover fires were not put out like they normally are.\u201d CNN meteorologist Robert Shackelford contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/15/weather/canada-wildfires-fort-mcmurray-climate-wednesday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_americas_guyana-nigel-dharamlall-sexual-assault-allegations-intl-latam", "text": "A powerful politician in Guyana has been accused of sexual assault for the second time in less than a year, following his resignation last July over separate allegations. The accuser, economist Sarah Aneesah Hakh, told an online press conference held in the capital Georgetown that former Minister Nigel Dharamlall sexually assaulted her in 2020 and 2021. Hakh said the first alleged incident occurred during a business meeting when Dharamlall was Guyana\u2019s senior minister of regional development. \u201cThe fact that he is still in that party is mind boggling to me,\u201d Hakh said. Dharamlall, a Guyanese politician seen as a power broker in the country, was recently appointed to the executive committee of Guyana\u2019s ruling People\u2019s Progressive Party. He has been photographed recently with Guyanese President Irfaan Ali and Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo. Dharamlall rejected the allegations in a statement posted on his Facebook page, saying \u201cI wish to categorically and most vehemently deny each and every one of the allegations made.\u201d He accused Hakh of being on a \u201ccampaign to tarnish my reputation,\u201d claiming that \u201cher demeanor towards me changed fundamentally after I rebuffed her advances and spurned her attempts to engage in an intimate relationship.\u201d CNN has reached out to Dharamlall for comment and has contacted the office of Guyana President Irfaan Ali. Dharamlall resigned from Guyana\u2019s cabinet and parliament last year after an indigenous teenage girl accused him of rape in an unrelated incident, which he has denied. The girl later withdrew the claim according to officials and no charges were filed, President Ali said\u202fin a video statement\u202flast July. He emphasized at the time that his government had \u201callowed the system to work. We have not intervened; from day one,\u201d apparently referencing public criticism over how the girl\u2019s case was handled by authorities. Her withdrawal however was seen by some as a sign of government corruption, with the public speculating her family had been paid off. In a March statement, Guyanese women\u2019s rights group Red Thread criticized officials for failing the accuser. \u201cIt is of great concern that the public nature of this complaint, the powerful political status of the suspect, the discontinuance of the matter at this early stage and the haste with which this investigation was ended, will reinforce the perception of impunity, and inevitably discourage other victims of sexual violence from coming forward,\u201d it wrote. \u2018Violated against my will\u2019 Hakh, who was seen as a rising star in Guyana, said she was first assaulted by Dharamlall during what was supposed to be a meeting about her taking a role as a regional executive officer in September 2020. She alleged that Dharamlall took the then-25-year-old into his bedroom, disrobed and forcibly performed oral sex on her without her consent in the Anna Regina State House, a town on the country\u2019s coast. Hakh told reporters on Friday that she told Dharamlall to stop several times, saying she is a lesbian and \u201cthis is not something I came here expecting to do and can\u2019t offer anything.\u201d \u201cI was violated against my will by a man who exploited my situation and tried to entrap me in a compromising situation due to my future contract with the ministry,\u201d she said. Hakh also alleged that a second incident took place in 2021, in the Cummings Lodge neighborhood on the outskirts of Georgetown, when she says she met Dharamlall to discuss several grievances she had with the ministry of local government. During their meeting, Hakh alleges Dharamlall tried to remove her clothes. Hakh told CNN she didn\u2019t file a police report in 2020 or 2021 due to fears of police corruption and that she would be shunned publicly and within her family, which she says did business with Dharamlall. \u201cI knew I was going up against something that was dangerous and my whole strategy was that if I made a report that was preemptive, and it didn\u2019t go anywhere, I automatically had no credibility,\u201d she told the press conference on Friday, adding that she finally filed a police report on May 9. Hakh said she also filed cyberbullying charges against Dharamlall on May 8.\u202f CNN has contacted Guyanese police for comment. Hakh said she decided to go public with her allegation because \u201cI need to give victims the strength to know that they\u2019re not alone, and that there is no shame in what happened to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/americas/guyana-nigel-dharamlall-sexual-assault-allegations-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/16/2024", "section": "world"}}
