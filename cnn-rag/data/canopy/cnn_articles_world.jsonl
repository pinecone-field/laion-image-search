The internet has chosen its new favorite national uniform at the forthcoming Paris 2024 Olympics: Mongolia\u2019s. Featuring intricately embroidered vests, pleated robes and accessories inspired by traditional attire, the country\u2019s opening and closing ceremony outfits have taken social media by storm since being unveiled last week. The designs are the work of Michel&Amazonka, an Ulaanbaatar-based label producing couture and ready-to-wear garments that \u201cexpress the essence of Mongolian tradition and culture\u201d in what the brand calls a \u201ccontemporary light.\u201d The label revealed its designs via a series of glossy photos and a video shoot reminiscent of a luxury fashion campaign.\u00a0Female athletes\u2019 outfits come with\u00a0ceremonial earrings and embroidered bags, while male flag-bearers will wear an archery hat, belt and traditional Mongolian boots. Designs incorporate the national colors of blue, red, and white, as well as various traditional patterns and motifs, including the \u201cSoyombo\u201d symbol that appears in the country\u2019s flag. Motifs associated with Paris and the Games, namely the Eiffel Tower and the Olympic flame also feature. The outfits took an average of 20 hours each to craft, according to the Mongolian National Olympic Committee. The uniforms have attracted attention on\u00a0social media \u2014\u00a0especially TikTok, where fashion and sport commentators applauded the designs. \u201cThey just won the Olympics before it even started,\u201d said style writer Ryan Yip in a video viewed over 2 million times. In another TikTok video, viewed almost 300,000 times, Australian user Bee Jamieson said: \u201cThe detailing is really beautiful\u2026 it looks like everything\u2019s been really well thought out.\u201d Popular sports creator geoff0w_ meanwhile said: \u201cThese go ridiculously hard.\u201d On the\u00a0brand\u2019s\u00a0Instagram page, users heaped further praise on the outfits. \u201cThe most beautiful uniform so far,\u201d read one comment. \u201cSuch intricate, and beautiful designs!\u201d wrote another user. Founded by sisters Michel Choigaalaa and Amazonka Choigaalaa, Michel&Amazonka previously designed the Mongolian team\u2019s outfits for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, where the country netted one silver and three bronze medals. Mongolia has participated in all but one summer Olympics since 1964. The landlocked nation won its first \u2014 and, to date, only \u2014 gold medals (in judo and boxing) at the Beijing 2008 games. This year, the country is sending more than 30 athletes to the Paris Olympics, which kick off on July 26. Mongolian athletes will compete in nine different sports, including cycling, shooting and wrestling. Elsewhere at the Games, Berluti have designed France\u2019s opening and closing ceremony unforms and Ralph Lauren will again dress Team USA, having done so at every Olympics since 2008. Great Britain, meanwhile, has turned to menswear label Ben Sherman.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/style/mongolia-olympic-uniform-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_asia_israel-invitation-to-hiroshima-japan-sparked-controversy-intl-hnk", "text": "Hiroshima, the Japanese city devastated by a US atomic bomb in 1945, is at the center of a growing controversy after local officials dismissed calls to disinvite Israel from its annual ceremony promoting world peace as war rages in Gaza. Every year on August 6, Hiroshima gathers foreign officials, along with locals, in a minute of silence at 8:15 a.m. to mark the exact moment the bomb dropped, killing tens of thousands of people and leading to the end of World War II. Some activists and atomic bomb survivors\u2019 groups say the ceremony is no place for Israel, which is pounding Gaza with strikes as it seeks to eradicate\u00a0Hamas in response to the Palestinian militant group\u2019s devastating attack on October 7 last year. They say the Hiroshima city government should exclude Israel from this year\u2019s ceremony, as it has Russia and Belarus for the past two years over Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. But Hiroshima authorities say they have no intention of excluding Israel. \u201cIt is not a double standard. Our policy is to invite all countries. However, Russia and Belarus are exceptions due to the invasion of Ukraine,\u201d a Hiroshima city government spokesperson told CNN. \u201cRussia and Belarus are not invited in order to ensure the ceremony goes smoothly.\u201d Authorities in Nagasaki, the\u00a0Japanese city hit by an atomic bomb just days after Hiroshima, told CNN they haven\u2019t decided whether to invite Israel to their peace ceremony on August 9. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza may \u201cprevent the smooth execution of the ceremony,\u201d they said, stressing the move was not a gesture of protest but a practical consideration. Calls for Israel\u2019s exclusion Of the two ceremonies, Hiroshima\u2019s is the largest with representatives from\u00a0115 countries and the European Union set to attend this year. Envoys from Russia and Belarus haven\u2019t attended since Hiroshima excluded them in 2022 following Moscow\u2019s invasion of\u00a0Ukraine in February that year. Russia used Belarus as one of the launch pads for its assault and later moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons there. This year\u2019s Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony takes place against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel\u2019s bombardment has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and displaced nearly the entire enclave\u2019s more than 2 million people, who now face severe shortages of food, shelter, water and medical supplies. \u201cWhy invite Israel if they are committing genocide-like crimes, just like Russia and Belarus?\u201d said Tetsuji Kumada, executive director of Hiroshima\u2019s Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organization, one of the groups opposing Israel\u2019s presence. \u201cIt is very disappointing that our request wasn\u2019t taken into account,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the organization wrote to the Hiroshima government in June to ask for Israel to be disinvited. Another group, Hiroshima-Palestine Vigil Community, launched an online petition in May, calling for Israel\u2019s representatives to be excluded, saying that \u201ccurrent global protests against Israel clearly outnumber those against Russia in both scale and frequency.\u201d The petition has since amassed more than 30,000 signatures. Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations from critics as well as rights groups and experts that it has broken international humanitarian law with the breadth of its response to Hamas\u2019 attacks. It argues its war is against Hamas, not Palestinians, although anger over the extent of the destruction and civilian deaths in Gaza has swelled globally. CNN has reached out to the Israeli embassy in Japan for comment. Japan has taken a strong stance in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, pledging to stand with Kyiv, offering billions of dollars in humanitarian aid and military vehicles and equipment for mine-clearing operations. It has also imposed sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, Tokyo has offered humanitarian aid to Gaza, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d for the critical situation in the strip and supports a two-state solution to the conflict. According to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, the Hiroshima government referred to the war in Gaza in its invitation to Israel, urging the country to cease its offensive. The invitation said it was \u201cdeeply regrettable that the lives and everyday existences of many people are being taken away,\u201d Kyodo reported. Palestinians not invited The bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and Nagasaki three days later led to Japan\u2019s unconditional surrender and brought an end to World War II. But it also killed tens of thousands of people, both instantly and in the months and years to come due to radiation sickness. Every year, diplomats in Japan are invited to Hiroshima to join the commemoration that highlights the importance of peace and cautions against the use of nuclear weapons. But while some advocacy\u00a0groups urged Hiroshima to shun Israel, others supported its presence. \u201cAs a city of international peace, Hiroshima city needs to invite all nations, regardless of whether they are at war or not,\u201d said Kunihiko Sakuma, president of Hiroshima Hidankyo, an atomic bomb survivors\u2019 advocacy group. However,\u00a0the Permanent General Mission of Palestine in Tokyo complained on social platform X that it had not been invited to the ceremony. \u201cThis decision is a double standard,\u201d it said. Its envoy was never invited to the ceremony, the office told CNN. Hiroshima authorities said they only send invitations to countries with embassies in Japan and have never invited Palestinian representatives to the ceremony. At a news conference last week, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa reiterated Japan\u2019s support for a two-state solution. \u201cWe continue to comprehensively consider the recognition of Palestinian statehood, taking into account how to advance the peace process,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_07_19_middleeast_israel-tel-aviv-explosion-us-embassy-intl-hnk", "text": "Israel authorities are investigating the circumstances and potential security lapses around a deadly drone blast in Tel Aviv that killed one man and injured at least 10 others on Friday. The attack was claimed by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, in what the Iranian proxy group said was a response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Houthi spokesperson Yahya Sare\u2019e said the\u00a0operation was performed by a new drone capable of \u201cbypassing the enemy\u2019s interception systems.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy\u2019s massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Sare\u2019e said. \u201cOur operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.\u201d The attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis. In a televised briefing on Friday, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range.  A second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli territory to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders. An Israeli military official said the drone was detected by an Israeli aerial defense system, but not intercepted due to \u201chuman error.\u201d It was armed with a warhead\u00a0and crashed into an apartment building, the official added, without providing further details of the device\u2019s payload. The official didn\u2019t provide details about what the human error was but noted that Israel\u2019s aerial defense systems don\u2019t always operate autonomously. The Iron Dome defense system, for example, can operate in manual mode, where its radar detects and tracks incoming threats but needs input from an operator before launching an interceptor missile. According to an initial inquiry \u201cno sirens were activated\u201d during the incident,\u00a0the IDF said earlier. Jack Lew, the US Ambassador to Israel, said Friday he was \u201cshocked by the brazen Houthi drone attack\u201d and sent his condolences to the victims\u2019 families. \u201cWe are thankful our US Embassy Branch Office personnel are safe,\u201d he added. Deadly explosion The explosion occurred in a central district home to a number of diplomatic missions, and hit about 100 meters (330 feet) from a US Embassy branch office, according to CNN analysis and information from local authorities. There was no damage to the US diplomatic mission\u00a0and\u00a0no reports of injuries of US personnel or \u201clocally engaged staff,\u201d the US State Department said. \u201cWe are in close contact with Israeli authorities to fully investigate the source of the explosion and its intended target,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding the embassy in Jerusalem and the branch in Tel Aviv are ready to provide consular assistance to US citizens. Emergency crews responded to \u201can object\u201d that had exploded on Shalom Aleichem Street, Israel\u2019s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said. \u201cThe dead man had suffered penetrating injuries,\u201d MDA paramedic Roi Klein said. At least four of the injured sustained shrapnel wounds, the MDA said. Israeli far-right\u00a0National Security\u00a0Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the Israeli government for being unable to protect the country, saying on social media that the attack showed the government \u201ccannot give security to the citizens of Israel.\u201d \u201cThere are no policies, no plans, all public relations and discussions are about themselves,\u201d he said. Ben Gvir said the attack on Tel Aviv and other areas of Israel are \u201cprecisely why I insist on being around the table in determining Israel\u2019s\u00a0policy.\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June disbanded the country\u2019s war cabinet after former war cabinet member Benny Gantz announced his withdrawal from the body, and Ben Gvir asked to join. Houthi attacks The Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted Israel with drones and missiles since the start of the country\u2019s war with Hamas, most of which have been intercepted by Israel\u2019s defenses. The Houthis have also been attacking US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas\u2019 October 7\u00a0attack, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others kidnapped. Israel\u2019s air and ground offensive\u00a0on Gaza has killed more than 38,000 people in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. The war has displaced almost all of the strip\u2019s population of more than 2 million people, turned swaths of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis. The war has raised fears of a wider regional conflict, with the potential consequences of further human suffering and shocks to the global economy. The Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, for instance, have forced some of the world\u2019s biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through one of the most important maritime trade routes. Sare\u2019e, the Houthi spokesperson, said the operation targeting Tel Aviv was carried out with a new drone called \u201cYafa\u201d that can \u201cbypass the enemy\u2019s interception system and (is) undetectable by radars.\u201d Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, wrote on X that Houthi claims shouldn\u2019t be taken at face value. \u201cIn general, Houthi claims are a mixed bag. Sometimes they are accurate, sometimes they are exaggerated, sometimes they are just straight-up fabrications,\u201d he wrote, adding that \u201ctheir factual claims have to be taken with a much bigger grain of salt than Iran\u2019s or Lebanese Hezbollah\u2019s.\u201d He said however that the drone used in the Tel Aviv attack is likely to be a Sammad, \u201cthe Houthi\u2019s standard long-range strike drone\u201d that has already been used in attacks against Israel, but with a more powerful engine. For the Houthis, he wrote, an extended drone range would be attractive \u201cas it would allow them to strike targets further away, fly routes evading enemy defenses, and attack from unexpected angles.\u201d Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, told CNN that the Houthis are likely to capitalize on the attack, especially as Israel\u2019s defenses failed to intercept it. \u201cThey will capitalize on it, not just inside Yemen but also outside Yemen,\u201d Nagi said, adding that the attack took place ahead of the rebel group\u2019s weekly rallies, which take place every Friday in support of Gaza in Houthi-controlled Yemeni cities. The attack \u201cgives momentum\u201d to these rallies, he said. The drone attack Friday in Tel Aviv comes after the Houthis claimed earlier this month that they had targeted ships in the Israeli port of Haifa with a number of drones in joint military operations with Iran-backed militias based in Iraq. The IDF told CNN at the time that it was not aware of such an incident.

The South African Police Service (SAPS) and the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, commonly known as Hawks, raided the property in the town of Groblersdal after receiving information suspicious activity was taking place there, SAPS said in a statement. After searching four structures on the property, police found large quantities of chemicals used to make illicit drugs including acetone and crystal meth, with an estimated street value of 2 billion South African rand ($109.4 million). The four suspects detained on Friday include the farm owner and two Mexican nationals, the police service said, adding that the Hawks are not ruling out the possibility of further arrests. \u201cWhat makes this different from other [seizures] is the involvement of Mexican citizens,\u201d Katlego Mogale, national spokesperson for the Hawks told Reuters, adding: \u201cIt means that our task has just become very difficult.\u201d It is not clear if the drugs seized were intended for South African market or overseas.

Only a win for his party would ensure \u201cpeace\u201d in the country, Maduro said, adding that he expects \u201cirreversible results\u201d in his favor. CNN has reached out to Maduro\u2019s office for further comment on his statements. Maduro\u2019s remarks come as his government attempts to cling on to power for another six years while facing a credible challenge from opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia. Many experts believe the opposition has a real chance of pushing Maduro out of office. In the run up to the vote, Venezuela has \u201cunjustly detained\u201d democratic opposition figures, civil society members and journalists, according to the US State Department, which called for their release in a statement Wednesday. Strongman Maduro has been in power in for more than a decade, having assumed the presidency following the death of predecessor Hugo Chavez in 2013, during which time his government has often been accused of rigging votes and silencing the opposition. The 2018 election that returned Maduro to office was largely boycotted by the opposition. The poll was described as illegitimate by an alliance of 14 Latin American nations, Canada and the United States and as a \u201cfarce\u201d by the Organization of American States. There were hopes the 2024 election might be different after Maduro promised Washington last year in a historic agreement that he would hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief. However, more recently the opposition has accused him of reneging on that pledge. Two opposition candidates \u2013 Maria Corina Machado and Corina Yoris \u2013 have been barred from running while a report this week by a human rights group suggested there had been a spate of \u201carbitrary detentions\u201d since the beginning of the campaign season on July 4. Human rights NGO Laboratorio de Paz reported Monday there had been 71 arbitrary detentions in the first 10 days of campaigning, the majority of them involving people who had provided some type of service to the campaign command of the opposition candidate Gonz\u00e1lez, of the Democratic Unitary Platform. Two days after Laboratorio\u2019s report came out, the barred opposition leader Machado said in a post on X that her security chief had also been arrested. Machado said her security chief Milciades \u00c1vila was \u201ckidnapped\u201d on Wednesday \u201cby the Maduro regime and accused of gender violence against some women.\u201d The opposition leader said the women who accuse \u00c1vila of gender violence tried to \u201cattack\u201d her and Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia in a restaurant last Saturday. \u201cThere are dozens of witnesses and videos that demonstrate that this was a planned provocation to leave us without protection 11 days before July 28,\u201d Machado wrote. CNN has reached out to Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office for comment on \u00c1vila\u2019s arrest and to determine whether he has legal representation. The US was concerned about \u00c1vila\u2019s arrest and called for his immediate release, a State Department spokesperson said Wednesday. The US also urged Venezuela to release all those who were \u201cunjustly detained\u201d during the presidential election campaign. Costa Rica, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Panama meanwhile called on Venezuelan authorities to guarantee that elections are \u201cfree, fair, and transparent,\u201d in a joint statement released Wednesday by the Alliance for Development in Democracy.

{"id": "2024_07_21_middleeast_israel-strikes-houthi-rebels-explainer-intl", "text": "For the first time, Israel has struck inside Yemen, following a deadly drone attack launched by Houthi rebels on Tel Aviv. Since the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel, the Houthis have been targeting shipping in the Red Sea in solidarity - they say - with Gaza. After Israel struck back on Saturday, the Houthis said they launched a fresh barrage of missiles towards Israel, promising a response that will be \u201chuge and great.\u201d Direct attacks on each other\u2019s soil between the Israeli military and the Iran-backed rebel group now risk creating a new front in a conflict that already threatened to spill over into the region, with Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam on Sunday describing the situation as \u201copen war.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know. Who are the Houthis and what is their role in the Gaza conflict? The Houthis are an Iran-backed Islamist group based in Yemen. The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah (Supporters of God), is one side in a civil war that has raged in Yemen for nearly a decade. It emerged in the 1990s, when its leader, Hussein al-Houthi, launched \u201cBelieving Youth,\u201d a religious revival movement for a centuries-old subsect of Shia Islam called Zaidism. Since a ceasefire, the Houthis have consolidated their control over most of northern Yemen. They have also sought an agreement\u00a0with Saudi Arabia,\u00a0a major rival of Iran, that would bring the war to a permanent end and cement their role as the country\u2019s rulers. The Houthis are believed to have been armed and trained by Iran. Since Hamas\u2019s attacks on October 7 attacks and Israel\u2019s subsequent ground and air offenses in Gaza, the Houthis say they have been seeking revenge against Israel for its military campaign by targeting Red Sea shipping. The US and UK have responded to those attacks by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses. In addition, Israel\u2019s army spokesman says the militant group has targeted \u201cIsraeli civilians and civilian infrastructure\u201d about 200 times in the same period. Most of those launches were intercepted by US Central Command, the spokesman said, but Israel\u2019s air defenses have also intercepted Houthi drones and missiles inside and outside Israel\u2019s airspace. What happened in Tel Aviv? A tipping point for Israel appears to have come on Friday, when a drone attack was launched on Tel Aviv, killing one\u00a0Israeli citizen and injuring several others. The attack was claimed by the Houthis, with spokesperson Yahya Sare\u2019e saying the\u00a0operation was performed by a new drone capable of \u201cbypassing the enemy\u2019s interception systems.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy\u2019s massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Sare\u2019e said. \u201cOur operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.\u201d The attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis. Israel authorities are investigating the circumstances and potential security failures around the deadly drone blast. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range. A second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli airspace to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders. How did Israel respond? Israel\u2019s response came a day later, when Israeli aircraft hit the Yemeni port of Hodeidah. The attack, which marked the first time Israel has struck Yemen, killed at least six people and injured scores more, Yemeni officials said. The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said the strikes targeted oil facilities in the port on Yemen\u2019s west coast. Houthi\u00a0spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was \u201cbrutal Israeli aggression\u201d aimed at increasing the \u201csuffering of the people of Yemen\u201d and pressuring the group to stop its support of Gaza. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the port was used by Iran to bring arms into Yemen. \u201cThe port we attacked\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0an innocent port. It was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis\u00a0by Iran,\u201d he said in a statement on Saturday. Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from\u00a0Israel\u2019s borders, showed\u00a0Israel\u00a0was\u00a0serious about responding to threats. \u201cIt makes it clear to our enemies that there\u00a0is\u00a0no place that the long arm of the State of\u00a0Israel will\u00a0not\u00a0reach,\u201d Netanyahu said. How big an escalation is this? Neither side have suggested they are ready to back down. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the Houthi \u2018DNA\u2019 to de-escalate with Israel,\u201d Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute wrote on X. Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree said the\u00a0Houthis\u00a0have\u00a0\u201cprepared\u00a0for a long war\u201d with Israel and that Tel Aviv is still not safe. Israel\u2019s Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, warned that the \u201cblood of Israeli citizens has a price,\u201d and that if Israelis are attacked,\u00a0the\u00a0\u201cresult will be identical\u201d to that which has been seen in Lebanon and Gaza. On Sunday, Israeli military said it had intercepted a missile approaching Israeli territory from Yemen while the Houthis said they launched a \u201cnumber of ballistic missiles.\u201d The war in Gaza has already been accompanied by significantly heightened tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The two sides have been trading cross-border fire since October 8, when Hezbollah fired at three Israeli border posts \u201cin solidarity\u201d with Palestinians. Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said on Sunday in a televised address on Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV that the group intended to continue \u201cthe fifth stage of escalation in support of Gaza.\u201d Friday\u2019s drone attack on Tel Aviv signaled the beginning of that stage, he also said. But while rising tensions with the Houthis undoubtedly creates fresh challenges for Israel, Hezbollah remains the bigger threat given its extensive arsenal and proximity to Israel. Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) who has served on Israel\u2019s National Security Council, told CNN he believes Israel has until now been restrained in its response. He believes Israel was trying to send a signal to the US and the international community that \u201cenough is enough,\u201d and deliberately chose a target with high visibility. \u201cYou have to signal to a rogue actor that is attacking you that there is a price to pay, and I think this is what Israel tried to do.\u201d Like the Houthis, Hezbollah is also heavily backed by Iran, which makes no secret of its animosity towards Israel. Any increase in hostilities between Israel and Iran\u2019s proxies is seen as deeply destabilizing in the region because it could push the two countries closer towards open warfare. Israel and Iran have already traded one direct exchange since October 7.

{"id": "2024_07_18_europe_putin-summer-residence-fortification", "text": "As Ukraine grows bolder in striking targets deep inside Russia, Moscow has quietly upped the security measures around President Vladmir Putin\u2019s country residence north of Moscow. Satellite images have revealed that several Pantsir-S1 air defense systems have been installed in the vicinity of the presidential residence on Lake Valdai in Novgorod region. The Valdai residence could be a high-profile target, as Putin is known to be spending time there during the summer. The palatial property sits inside a large government vacation resort in the Valdai national park, on a peninsula wedged between two lakes. Access to the whole complex is severely restricted \u2013 the 40 hectares of grounds are surrounded by water on three sides and fenced off from the rest of the park. First reported by Radio Liberty, satellite images show the Russian-made Pantsir-S1s have been moved into the area at some point between last September and this May, just as Ukraine became better at developing and using drones capable of striking deeper inside Russia. Satellite images provided by Maxar Technologies show air defenses strategically positioned in the area, including on a tower located deep in a forest just a few kilometers away from the compound. The Pantsir-S1 systems are designed to combat short-range cruise missiles and drones, suggesting the move to station them near the residence may be a response to Ukraine\u2019s increasingly audacious drone attacks. CNN has reached out to the Russian Defense Ministry for comment but has not received a response. Kyiv has recently been given permission to use Western weapons to strike across the border into Russia, but this is limited to military targets that are near the border with the Ukrainian Kharkiv region\u00a0and are supporting Russia\u2019s offensive in Ukraine. For any strikes deeper into Russia than that, Ukraine must rely on its own weapons. Drones are a big part of the strategy. Ukraine\u2019s drone program has grown significantly since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. What began with efforts to modify cheap, off-the-shelf drones that could be used for surveillance has turned into the development of long-range attack drones that are capable of striking hundreds of miles beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders. So far this year, Kyiv has claimed that Ukrainian drones sank or severely damaged several Russian warships in the Black Sea and caused damage to the Kerch Strait bridge between Russia and Ukraine\u2019s Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014. The Ukrainian military has also managed to destroy fuel depots, military targets and energy infrastructure much further afield. In April, it said its drones hit the Niznekamsk oil refinery \u2013 one of the five largest in Russia \u2013 in Tatarstan region, more than 1,100 km (700 miles) from the border. And last month, the Ukrainian military said it had destroyed one of Russia\u2019s newest and most advanced fighter jets, the Sukhoi Su-57 fighter, with a drone strike almost 600 kilometers (372 miles) behind the front lines. \u201cUkrainian drone strikes deep within Russia continue to pressure Russia\u2019s air defense umbrella and force the Russian military command to prioritize allocating limited air defense assets to cover what it deems to be high-value targets,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based group, said in a battlefield update on Wednesday, pointing to the decision by Russia to move the Pantsir-S1 systems there. The presidential residence is well protected from would-be invaders. Access to the complex is severely restricted \u2013 the 40 hectares of grounds are surrounded by water on three sides and fenced off from the rest of the park. A special permit is required to access the wider park and the resort is completely off-limits \u2013 according to its official website, it has been closed indefinitely since last November. The retreat\u2019s history as a vacation destination for Russia\u2019s top officials dates back to the time of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who had a dacha \u2013 or summer house \u2013 built in the area, according to the Russian Presidential Property Management Department, the body that manages the holiday complex. Nikita Khrushchev and Boris Yeltsin both enjoyed time at the residence, according to Russian state news agency Ria Novosti.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/europe/putin-summer-residence-fortification/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_sport_xander-schauffele-open-championship-2024-win-spt-intl", "text": "Little over two months ago, Xander Schauffele was regarded as one of the most talented golfers to never win one of the sport\u2019s biggest prizes. On Sunday, the American clinched the Open Championship to claim the second major of his career. The world No. 3 tore away from a bunched field with a ruthless showing at Royal Troon in Scotland, powering to victory to swiftly add a Claret Jug to the PGA Championship trophy he lifted in May. Having begun the final round among a group of six at one shot off the lead, a brilliant bogey-free six-under 65 saw Schauffele finish two strokes ahead of compatriot Billy Horschel and England\u2019s Justin Rose at nine-under par overall. It makes the Californian the first player to win two majors in a single season since Brooks Koepka in 2018, and seals an American clean sweep of the four men\u2019s flagship events for the first time since 1982 following Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau\u2019s triumphs at the Masters and US Open respectively. \u201cI feel very honored. Hearing your name called with \u2018Open Champion\u2019 right after is something I\u2019ve dreamt of for a very long time,\u201d the 30-year-old said as he was presented with the Claret Jug. Eight-time PGA Tour winner Horschel had led heading into the final round but his closing 68 was not enough to clinch a first major title, Rose shooting one better to join the 37-year-old in second and match his own personal best major showing since lifting the US Open in 2013. South Africa\u2019s Thriston Lawrence finished one shot behind Rose and Horschel in tied-fourth, with American Russell Henley a further stroke back. World No. 1 Scheffler finished in a share of seventh at one-under par overall. A frantic start Pummeling winds and driving rain had swept half of the world\u2019s top-10 ranked players out of South Ayrshire before the weekend had even begun, and those brutal conditions continued Saturday to whip up a grandstand finish. Horschel donned short sleeves as he defied the elements to shoot 69 and leapfrog Ireland\u2019s Shane Lowry, whose third round unraveled to a six-over 77 after a disastrous saga in the sand at the notorious 11th hole \u201ccoffin\u201d bunker. The 37-year-old Floridian was in entirely unfamiliar territory, spearheading a major championship with 18 holes to go for the first time in his 15-year professional career \u2013 though even that cushion was wafer-thin. Just four shots separated the top 12 players, six of them just one stroke shy of Horschel. All signs pointed towards an unmissable final day shootout, and a frantic start delivered on that promise immediately, former world No. 1 Rose racing out of the blocks with a birdie to immediately grab a share of the lead. Having only stamped a last-minute ticket for his 21st Open start in a final qualifying event, 43-year-old Rose looked on a mission to turn back the clock and was roared on by patrons throughout. Horschel would not go quietly, rallying from a bogey at the third with two quick birdies to reclaim his one stroke advantage at the sixth. Yet the attacks were coming from all angles now, the most ferocious of all from playing partner Lawrence and Schauffele, two holes ahead. The duo had both torn through the back nine without carding a bogey, Lawrence tapping in his fourth birdie of the day after a mesmerising 141-yard approach to make the turn one stroke clear of Rose. It was the latest brilliant shot in a week littered with them for the world No. 98, whose tied-42nd finish at the 2022 tournament was his best of only five prior major appearances since turning professional in 2013. To say the South African was a surprise contender was an understatement \u2013 he had missed the cut in all but one of his five PGA Tour outings this season \u2013 but the 27-year-old looked totally at ease fighting at the top. A ruthless finish The issue for Lawrence was that he was up against a man with the pedigree of major consistency to rival the very best and \u2013 as of two months ago \u2013 the silverware to back it up. Schauffele\u2019s PGA Championship triumph was the ultimate reward for 12 prior top-10 finishes at the game\u2019s four flagship tournaments, the world No. 3 immediately following it up with another courtesy of a tied-7th finish at last month\u2019s US Open. Watching the Californian surge around Royal Troon on Sunday made it difficult to comprehend the notion he was ever a poor closer on the biggest stage. Even as he lasered in his fourth birdie of the day from just over 16 feet at the 13th, barely a flicker of emotion passed over his face. The steely-eyed barrage continued with two more birdies across the next three holes to open up a three shot lead. Rose and Lawrence had barely erred, each bogeying just once, but such was the relentless pace set by Schauffele. It had been a nerve-shredding fight to the wire for Schauffele to finally claim his first major, a closing birdie just enough to pip DeChambeau in Kentucky, but it was a wildly less stressful homecoming second time around. His name already being engraved on the famous Claret Jug trophy while the final groups finished their rounds, Schauffele soaked up the congratulations of family, friends, and rivals before stepping back into the winner\u2019s circle once again.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/sport/xander-schauffele-open-championship-2024-win-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_17_style_rajesh-vora-punjab-architecture-snap", "text": "Looking down a street in Daulatpur, a rural village in Punjab, India with a mishmash of eclectic, colorful architecture, photographer Rajesh Vora felt he had struck lucky. In front of him, was a large facsimile of an Air-India plane on top of a pale green\u00a0building. Facing it from across the street, a replica of an army tank atop a yellow residence pointed its gun, the painted figure of a soldier rising from its hatch. Though the designs could have been plucked from an amusement park, they were actually elaborate rooftop water tanks of private homes. Vora\u2019s images of this phenomenon \u2014 a vernacular tradition of architectural icons that sprung up across the\u00a0across the northwestern state some five decades ago \u2014 became a multiyear project that the Mumbai-based photographer is\u00a0now exhibiting at Les Rencontres d\u2019Arles\u00a0in France this summer.\u00a0He visited 150 villages and photographed hundreds of these designs. The ostentatious d\u00e9cor is \u201ca brilliant idea combining form and function,\u201d Vora said in a phone call with CNN. The first time he noticed the water tanks while on assignment in the region in 2014, he was \u201camused, like anybody would be seeing this kind of sculpture,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut then I realized, as an architecture photographer, what amazed me was the integration of the sculptures on the houses, built by local artisans.\u201d Crowning the tops of these homes, the unusual status symbols are often commissioned by Indian emigrants\u00a0who return home during the year, or by their families who still live in the region. Some are functional water tanks while others sit on top more traditional plumbing designs. Each tell a specific story, he explained. \u201cIf somebody plays sports, they\u2019ll put up a football there, if they are a chef they will put a pressure cooker\u2026 if somebody likes a nice drink, they\u2019ll put a bottle of whiskey,\u201d he explained. Planes, tanks and cars became popular motifs, too. \u201cAll their personal aspirations are embodied in their houses.\u201d Last year, Vora published a book, \u201cEveryday Monuments\u201d that features images from some the villages he visited and brings together texts from architectural, scholarly and curatorial experts to explore the unique tradition. Through their research, they approximate that there are around 30 artisans in the region who work with homeowners and their families via word of mouth to create these lively sculptures. Diasporic icons Vora came across the buildings by chance, as he visited a gurdwara\u00a0\u2014 a Sikh temple \u2014 in the village of Talhan while working on a commissioned photo story about global migration. Known as Hawaijahaj, or \u201cAirplane,\u201d gurdwara, visitors bring offerings of model aircraft in hopes that they will be blessed with swift visa approval to leave India. He heard that many who were successful eventually returned to their villages to add planes to the exteriors of newly built homes, he explained. Over the course of six trips from 2014 to 2019, Vora began to better understand the full scope of the trend. It had begun sometime in the 1970s, as Punjabi diasporic communities flourished in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, among other countries.\u00a0As the popularity of custom-designed water tanks grew, local builders became specialized in their craft. The favored icons tend to shift in popularity over the years \u2014 when the country began manufacturing its popular Maruti van, for example, in the 1980s, it began appearing on homes, too. He also observed how architectural styles from different countries began to mix into the villages as owners brought back ideas from abroad to unique effect. But documenting the water tanks proved difficult when he first began. The remote areas of Punjab weren\u2019t yet mapped by Google, he explained, so he visited villages and hoped for the best. \u201cSome days are lucky \u2014 you might get three or four kinds of water tanks; others, you might not get anything,\u201d Vora said. Daulatpur Village, where multiple designs could be seen in one frame, was a rarity. Vora doesn\u2019t know how the tradition will grow or change as the region continues to see major shifts \u2014 especially as Indians from marginalized backgrounds gain more economic mobility and second- or third- generation immigrants amass wealth overseas. \u201cWill they come back to India? Will they build their own houses? Will they take care of these houses?\u201d We don\u2019t know,\u201d Vora said of younger generations. \u201cThese houses are perishable if you don\u2019t maintain them after 30 or 40 years\u2026 maybe they will disappear.\u201d The photographer hopes to continue to create an archive of Punjab\u2019s distinctive architectural legacy \u2014 and he\u2019ll keep looking out for a home that bears the icon of what he would choose if he were commissioning a design. \u201cIt would have to be a camera,\u201d he said with a laugh.

Before a trilateral meeting with US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. CQ Brown and South Korean Adm. Kim Myung-soo, Japanese Gen. Yoshihide Yoshida said China was trying to \u201cchange the status quo by force\u201d in the East China and South China seas, while North Korea was carrying out \u201crepeated ballistic missile launches and continuous arms transfers\u201d to Russia. Yoshida called on Japan, South Korea and the United States to \u201cdemonstrate our strong unity domestically and globally to ensure regional peace and stability.\u201d But bilateral cooperation between Japan and South Korea is the most noteworthy result of this week\u2019s meeting in Tokyo. On Wednesday, Yoshida met South Korea\u2019s Kim for the first such meeting between the East Asian defense chiefs in six years - a moment a US defense official stressed was significant. Kim said he and Yoshida \u201cshare a lot of the same thoughts,\u201d an acknowledgment of the mutual perspective on the regional threat posed by China and North Korea. \u201cWe developed strong trust between us,\u201d said Yoshida, adding the meeting sets the stage for the Japan-South Korea bilateral \u201cdefense cooperation to achieve a new height.\u201d Regional analyst James Brown said the Japan-South Korea meeting showed just how far the bilateral relationship has come under South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who succeeded Moon Jae-in in 2022. \u201cThe political mood has improved significantly, and now we\u2019re having the defense side of things aligning with that,\u201d said Brown, a professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo. \u201cThe Japanese government\u2019s feeling about this is that this is the relationship they\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d Japan felt the previous administration in Seoul was \u201cfixated on historical issues\u201d as it \u201cdemonized Japan\u201d and tried to improve relations with North Korea, Brown said. Last month, Japan and South Korea joined the US in the inaugural Freedom Edge in the Pacific, a military exercise that focused on ballistic missile and air defense, anti-submarine warfare and more. The goal of the exercise, which is set to expand in future years, was to allow the militaries to better work together against a common adversary. For years, historical acrimony between the two East Asian countries prevented high-level meetings and cooperation, with decades of deep mistrust dating back to Japan\u2019s colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula a century ago. But as the countries faced an increasingly assertive China and threats from North Korea, efforts to cooperate quickly supplanted past animosity, driven in large part by the efforts of US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. In March 2023, the two countries promised to resume ties at a fence-mending summit in Tokyo. Four months later, Biden hosted the leaders of Japan and South Korea at Camp David, where they pledged to \u201cinaugurate a new era of trilateral partnership.\u201d Then last month, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met his Japanese and South Korean counterparts on the sidelines of a security conference in Singapore, where they announced joint military exercises - nearly unthinkable just a few years ago. The trilateral meeting of the chiefs of defense at the Japanese Defense Ministry on Thursday, held for the first time in Tokyo, underscored the rapidly developing cooperation. \u201cI expect that the three of us sitting here in Tokyo today will send a message to the regional threats but also more globally on the strength of our relationship, our alliances, and the work that we need to continue to do,\u201d said Gen. Brown, sitting alongside his counterparts at the beginning of the meeting. The meeting comes on the heels of the NATO summit held last week in Washington, on the 75th anniversary of the alliance. The NATO communique specifically mentioned the importance of the Indo-Pacific, \u201cgiven that developments in that region directly affect Euro-Atlantic security.\u201d In their opening remarks Thursday, the Japanese and South Korean defense chiefs both mentioned their concern over Russia\u2019s expanding relations with North Korea. Earlier this week, Brown told CNN: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is NATO nations increasing interest in what happens in the Indo-Pacific, and Indo-Pacific nations having an interest in what goes on in Europe as well.\u201d Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said there was some sense of urgency behind the rapidly developing cooperation. The East Asian nations, he said, want to triangulate a coordinated response to common adversaries before potential changes in Seoul or Washington could put the relationship in jeopardy. \u201cDomestic politics remain complicated in Seoul and Tokyo, but policymakers and military professionals want to lock in coordinated responses to North Korea, Russia, and China before any major political changes occur in Washington,\u201d Easley said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/asia/japan-south-korea-military-ties-china-north-korea-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

In an earlier pitch to the European parliament in Strasbourg, France, von der Leyen on Thursday pledged to invest in infrastructure and industry, create a new \u201cEuropean Defense Union\u201d and stay the course on the continent\u2019s green transition. After a secret ballot, von der Leyen was reelected with 401 votes in favor and 284 against. She needed more than 360 ballots to secure a majority in the 720-seat parliament. Von der Leyen, who led the commission through the Covid-19 pandemic and the beginning of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, will now preside over a bloc that shifted rightward after last month\u2019s European elections, when far-right parties won a record number of seats. Addressing the parliament before the lunchtime vote, von der Leyen said the next five years of her term \u201cwill define Europe\u2019s place in the world for the next five decades. It will decide whether we shape our own future or let it be shaped by events or by others.\u201d Von der Leyen, a 65-year-old German national, was parachuted into the presidential candidacy process as a compromise candidate in 2019, but has since become one of Europe\u2019s most solid pillars. Several of the continent\u2019s other leaders \u2013 from Germany\u2019s former Chancellor Angela Merkel to French President Emmanuel Macron \u2013 have retired or been weakened by domestic politics. Von der Leyen\u2019s own position was somewhat diminished by last month\u2019s election, which saw a surge in support for the far right and saw Brussels\u2019 center ground shrink. Her reelection was not certain but widely expected, after she was proposed by EU leaders and could rely on the support of her center-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP), as well as the center-left Socialist and Democrats (S&D) and liberal Renew blocs. Shortly before Thursday\u2019s vote, the Green bloc also announced it would support her. After the vote, von der Leyen said her reelection was \u201ca very emotional and special moment\u201d and that she was grateful for the trust the parliament had placed in her. \u201cWe have spared no effort. We have navigated the most troubled waters that our union has ever faced. And we have kept the course on our long-term European goals,\u201d she said, praising the work done under her first term. Earlier Thursday, von der Leyen published a 31-page policy proposal, setting out her priorities if she won a second term. Echoing remarks she made after last month\u2019s vote, she stressed \u201cit is essential that the democratic center in Europe holds\u201d in the face of resurgent extremes, calling on mainstream parties to \u201clive up to the scale of the concerns and the challenges that people face in their lives.\u201d Von der Leyen pledged to \u201cturbo charge investment\u201d needed by cash-strapped EU governments for their \u201cgreen, digital and social transition.\u201d She also vowed to create a European Defense Union and appoint a commissioner for defense, a new role for the bloc that was forged in peacetime but has since had to respond to Russia\u2019s brutal war in Ukraine, and the prospect of a Donald Trump-led United States retreating from the world stage. Under the proposed new defense union, member states will retain responsibility for their own troops, but will work more closely with others to \u201ccoordinate efforts to strengthen the defense industrial base.\u201d She also proposed a Europe-wide air defense system and cyber protection measures. Speaking in Strasbourg before her reelection, von der Leyen said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s recent trip to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin was \u201can appeasement mission,\u201d and pledged to maintain EU support for Ukraine. Von der Leyen\u2019s reelection comes a day after the EU\u2019s second-highest court delivered an unusual rebuke to the commission, ruling it was not transparent enough about the contracts it signed for Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/europe/eu-parliament-von-der-leyen-second-term-commission-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

The journalist, Giulia Cortese, was also given a suspended fine of \u20ac1,200 ($1,300) for a jibe on Twitter, now named X, in October 2021 about Meloni\u2019s height, which was defined as \u201cbody shaming\u201d. In a response to a Reuters story on the verdict, Cortese wrote on X on Thursday: \u201cItaly\u2019s government has a serious problem with freedom of expression and journalistic dissent.\u201d Meloni had launched legal action against the journalist after the two women clashed on social media three years ago. Meloni, whose far-right Brothers of Italy party was in opposition at the time, took exception when Cortese published a mocked-up photo of her with a picture of the late fascist leader Benito Mussolini in the background. Cortese responded with further tweets including one that translates as \u201cyou don\u2019t scare me, Giorgia Meloni. After all, you\u2019re only 1.2 meters (4 feet) tall. I can\u2019t even see you.\u201d Meloni\u2019s height is given as between 1.58 meters (5 feet 2 inches) and 1.63 meters (5 feet 4 inches) on various media websites. Cortese can appeal against the sentence, and Meloni\u2019s lawyer said the prime minister would donate to charity any damages she eventually receives. Writing in English on X on Thursday, Cortese said it was a tough time for independent journalists in Italy. \u201cLet\u2019s hope for better days ahead. We won\u2019t give up!\u201d she added. A high number of lawsuits brought against journalists was cited this year by Reporters Without Borders, which relegated Italy five places to 46th in its 2024\u00a0World Press Freedom Index. Meloni is not new to taking journalists to court.

{"id": "2024_07_15_africa_rwanda-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "Rwandans lined up on Monday to elect their next president, with early results putting incumbent Paul Kagame in the lead in a vote widely expected\u00a0to give him a fourth term and extend his near quarter century in charge of the East African country. The two men standing against him \u2013 Frank Habineza from the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana \u2013 said they were hoping to make some progress, but analysts and rights groups said Kagame\u2019s overwhelming victory was all but certain. Kagame, who got more than 93% of the vote at the last three elections, won praise from Western and regional leaders at the time for helping end\u00a0the 1994 genocide in\u00a0Rwanda. The US State Department and others have also lauded the development of the economy. Rwandans are also voting on Monday for members of the lower house of parliament and provisional results are expected by July 20. Polling stations were open until 3 p.m. (1300 GMT). The overall voter turnout was 98% of the 9 million registered voters, Oda Gasinzigwa, chair of the National Electoral Commission, said in a statement on the national broadcaster later on Monday evening. Of 78.94% of the votes counted at about 2017 GMT, Kagame was ahead with 99.15% of the votes, data from the commission showed. Campaign groups, including Human Rights Watch, have accused authorities of cracking down on journalists, the opposition and civil society groups before the vote. Kagame has dismissed such accusations and described himself as the stability candidate. His reelection could signal a measure of political stability for his corner of a fractured region, but also continued global scrutiny, given the accusations of abuses and of\u00a0supporting rebels\u00a0in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 a charge he has also denied. Earlier on Monday, at the Rwandexco polling center in the capital Kigali, Barimukije Pheneas said he would vote for the 66-year-old incumbent. \u201cWe voted smoothly without any crowding, and we are happy,\u201d Pheneas said. \u201cI voted for Paul Kagame because he has achieved a lot for us; he united us.\u201d Motorcycle taxi driver Karangwa Vedaste said the voting process was calm and peaceful, but declined to say who he had chosen. \u201cI voted for a leader I trust. The one I voted for is a secret in my heart. We will share it when he wins,\u201d Vedaste said. The electoral commission barred eight other candidates, including Kagame\u2019s most vocal critics, from running, citing a range of reasons including missing and incomplete registration documents. Democratic Green Party candidate Habineza, whose deputy was found dead and almost beheaded in the run-up to the 2010 vote, said there had been signs of progress. \u201cWe toured the entire country, and wherever we went, people welcomed us warmly. They gave us gifts and assured us they would vote for us,\u201d Habineza said after voting. \u201cWe have to maintain this momentum and not regress,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are confident, each of us is confident, it\u2019s half and half,\u201d independent presidential candidate Mpayimana told journalists after casting his vote. The US State Department says on its website\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0has made \u201cprogress in developing national and local government institutions, economic development, maintaining security (and) promoting reconciliation.\u201d It also says it backs\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0efforts to \u201cincrease democratic participation (and) enhance respect for civil and political rights.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/africa/rwanda-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Similarly, last week, Monroe arrived at the LA premiere of the 1990s-inspired serial killer thriller dressed in a Courr\u00e8ges leather sarong and matching bra. Both outfits seemed like a bold choice for what is shaping up to be a sweltering summer across many parts of the Northern Hemisphere. But Monroe isn\u2019t alone in choosing this unseasonal material. Despite it being July, Mia Goth \u2014 another veritable scream queen \u2014 opted for a leather corseted midi dress from Versace for her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live earlier this month. And at the premiere of \u201cMaXXXine\u201d in LA, Goth wore an edgy Ludovic de saint Sernin halter-neck dress \u2014 the main event being her peek-a-boo leather bralet. You don\u2019t have to be a horror film starlet to pull off a summer leather look, either. On July 11, Kate Hudson was snapped in Manhattan\u2019s Soho in a sultry pair of lace-up leather pants; while across the pond, British radio and TV presenter Vick Hope arrived at Wimbledon in a full burgundy leather vest, shorts and a collarless leather overcoat (granted, London\u2019s weather has been a little more accommodating to leather this summer). Rita Ora \u2014 who has, it seems, committed to exclusively wearing scarlet in promotion of her new film \u201cDescents: The Rise of Red\u201d \u2014 wore not one, but two entirely leather outfits around New York. At what point did we start to see the off-season potential of leather? Once a firm staple of winter wardrobes, the material is seemingly summer\u2019s hottest trend. It began with Bottega Veneta, the Italian fashion house largely credited with pushing the boundary of the textile \u2014 symbolically and literally. In September 2022, creative director Matthieu Blazy sent a stream of leather optical illusions down the Fall-Winter runway.\u00a0Since then, we\u2019ve had blue jeans, plaid shirts and woven beach bags rendered in meticulous detail, redefining what leather could be. Or could it be a case of a trickle-down effect from our reigning pop stars? Dua Lipa opened her Glastonbury Festival headliner set in a custom Chrome Hearts leather mini-dress; while Rosal\u00eda \u2014 also known to her fleet of fans as Motomami \u2014 wore a pair of high-shine leather pants for her Coachella set in Palm Springs. Charli XCX, creator of the unequivocal album of the summer, \u201cBrat,\u201d has spoken openly about her love for scuffed-up YSL leather coats, and is often spotted off-duty donning a variety of biker jackets. Wherever the trend has come from, one thing is for certain: A leather jacket is no longer just for Christmas, but all year round.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/style/leather-clothes-summer-trend-lotw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_weather_summer-heat-temperatures-us-climate", "text": "Heat is normal during the summer, but this year\u2019s has been anything but, and halfway through the season\u2019s hottest month it\u2019s clear this one is for the record books. Hundreds of cities in nearly every US state \u2013 including parts of Alaska and Hawaii \u2013 are on track for one of their 10-warmest summers on record. About 100 of these cities are enduring their hottest start to summer on record. The deadly heat has not been unexpected. Forecasters have been warning of a searing\u00a0summer for months due to the troubling combination of a budding La Ni\u00f1a and a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Last summer was the warmest on record globally and one of the warmest for several states. But so far, this summer has felt even worse for many in the US. Extreme heat has baked almost all of the\u00a0Lower 48 so far this summer, but the worst of it has concentrated in the East Coast states and West. Average daily temperatures \u2013 calculated by taking the average of each day\u2019s high and low \u2013 have soared several degrees above normal for hundreds of cities since June 1. These temperatures are a more complete indicator of how hot the season has been, as they factor in both hotter days and warmer nights. Summer nights in the US have been warming nearly twice as fast as summer days since records began in the late 1800s, according to data from NOAA. Warmer nights increase the danger of heat by compounding heat stress through a reduction in the amount of time the body has to cool down naturally. Las Vegas is experiencing its hottest summer on record and holds the top spot in the entire country. Many of the cities experiencing the most exceptional summer heat are in the West, notably in or near California\u2019s Central Valley. Searing heat there has been relentless since it started in early June. On the opposite coast, a historic mid-June heat wave has only been spelled by brief bouts of relief. Dozens of cities from New England to the Mid-Atlantic are experiencing their hottest start to the summer on record, including Washington, DC, which just smashed a high temperature record Tuesday when it hit 104 degrees. Some of the most abnormal heat in the region is focused in New England and New York state. The\u00a0South has also sweltered under more than its fair share of historic heat so far this summer.\u00a0Atlanta and Tampa, Florida, are both on pace to record their hottest summer on record.\u00a0For some locations in the region, it\u2019s the second consecutive year summer has had a blistering start. Last summer ended up quite warm for the Lower 48, but the worst heat was confined to the Gulf Coast. By mid-July last summer, the season was pacing as one of the warmest on record for cities nearest the coast, including cities like New Orleans, Houston and Brownsville, Texas. But in other parts of the country, last summer was downright cool compared to this year\u2019s extreme heat. Washington, DC, is currently on track to record its hottest summer on record, but it was only the 44th-warmest summer by this time last year. Sacramento, California, is experiencing its hottest start to summer on record. But this time last year California\u2019s capital city was experiencing is 62nd-warmest summer. Forecasts for the rest of the season aren\u2019t cool, either. Despite some upcoming brief periods of respite, much of the Lower 48 is expected to endure above-average temperatures through August and into September, according to the Climate Prediction Center.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/weather/summer-heat-temperatures-us-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_style_ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian", "text": "India\u2019s most anticipated wedding of the year came to an end on Sunday after a star-studded three-day celebration that even saw the country\u2019s prime minister arrive to bless the young couple. Billionaire heir Anant Ambani married his longtime girlfriend Radhika Merchant in Mumbai in a lavish ceremony attended by Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, two former British prime ministers, Indian sporting legends and some of Bollywood\u2019s most famous faces. The wedding was followed by a blessing ceremony on Saturday, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi bestowed the young couple and their families with well wishes. The weekend\u2019s festivities concluded Sunday with an extravagant reception, or \u201cMangal Utsav\u201d (festival of bliss), as attendees jetted out of Mumbai. No expense was spared by the family that owns India\u2019s largest private corporation, Reliance Industries. Founded by Anant\u2019s grandfather, the conglomerate is now run by his father Mukesh, who is worth over $122 billion, according to Forbes. The Ambani-owned 16,000-capacity Jio World Convention Centre, which hosted wedding events throughout the weekend, was transformed into a miniature version of the holy Indian city of Varanasi, featuring floral installations and extravagant sets embellished with gold and silver. The couple underwent multiple outfit changes across the three-day bash, appearing in a succession of intricate, custom-made pieces celebrating the country\u2019s heritage and culture. Merchant\u2019s bridal ensemble was designed by Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and featured ivory zardozi (an elaborate type of metal embroidery) on silk and a 5-meter (16.4-foot) veil. She completed the look with jewels that aunts and sister wore to their own weddings. She later changed into an opulent red and gold outfit for her \u201cvidai,\u201d the ceremony in which Indian brides symbolically bid farewell to their relatives before joining their groom\u2019s family. Ambani meanwhile arrived on the red carpet in a golden sherwani paired with sneakers. For the marriage ceremony, he wore a custom red sherwani by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, with a large green necklace draped around his neck. For Saturday\u2019s blessings ceremony, Merchant once again donned a custom piece by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla, who collaborated with contemporary artist and sculptor Jayasri Burman to create a one-of-a-kind piece embroidered with real gold. The garment celebrates the couple\u2019s union \u201cthrough deeply meaningful imagery,\u201d Merchant\u2019s stylist Rhea Kapoor wrote on Instagram. \u201cThe human figures representing the happy couple radiate a celestial aura that honors the divinity in their humanity. The fauna depicts Anant\u2019s fondness for animals, particularly elephants that are considered auspicious and beautiful.\u201d For the reception Sunday, guests interpreted the \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code by mixing classic Indian fashion with contemporary styles. Merchant wore a gold metallic corset from Dolce and Gabbana\u2019s Alta Moda couture line, along with a skirt and dupatta in the same shade by Indian designer Anamika Khanna. Months of planning It is not known precisely how much the Ambanis spent on the celebrations, which included months of pre-wedding parties, though industry estimates have placed the total firmly in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Insiders worked for months to bring the couple\u2019s vision to life, collaborating with the family to bring the intricate details \u2014 from the floral arrangements to the set designs \u2014 together. Renowned wedding designer Preston Bailey, who has worked with Serena Williams and LeBron James, was commissioned to create larger-than-life floral art installations for the weekend. Speaking to CNN via email ahead of Friday\u2019s ceremony, Bailey commended Ambani\u2019s mother Nita\u2019s attention to detail. It was \u201cnothing short of pure genius and she is really focused on bringing the vast creative talent of India to the world through these weddings,\u201d he said. The inspiration for Bailey\u2019s designs came from the couple\u2019s love for animals and Ambani\u2019s recently opened animal sanctuary, Vantara, in the western Indian city of Jamnagar. His sculptural creations included a giant display of hot air balloons and more than 60 floral animals, including giraffes, two huge toucans, monkeys perched on trees inside the venue and a giant horse made from red and pink flowers. \u201cI have been in business for over 40 years \u2026 (but) I have never seen anything as intricate as this wedding and I believe it will bring such positive feedback and awareness to the great creative culture of artists of India,\u201d said Bailey, who also worked on the weddings of Ambani\u2019s two older siblings, Akash and Isha. Top Indian couturier and the wedding\u2019s creative director, Manish Malhotra, earlier told CNN that \u201cmaintaining the essence of India\u201d had been his \u201cguiding principle.\u201d \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event, from the vibrant Sangeet (a traditional evening of music and dance that saw a performance from Justin Bieber) to the ceremonial wedding day and the grand reception, is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he said via email. Criticism and sustainability Details of the celebrations dominated local news headlines and set social media abuzz, but many within India \u2014 the world\u2019s most populous nation, with 1.4 billion people \u2014 criticized the opulence on show in a country with a glaring wealth gap and where millions live in poverty. \u201cShame on people celebrating income inequality in a country where we need wealth redistribution,\u201d tweeted comedian and social media critic, Shamita Yadav, who posts on social media as The Ranting Gola. \u201cWe are really a poor country,\u201d Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, Sushant Singh, told Indian news outlet The Wire. \u201cThis is something which is completely unacceptable. But the fact of the matter is half of India\u2019s big media is owned by Mr. Ambani, so it is unlikely that India\u2019s big media is going to say that this is horrible.\u201d Beyond the financial cost of the wedding and festivities is another, less visible cost: the one to the planet. An average Indian wedding of 300 people typically generates between 1.5 tons and 2 tons of waste, and around 30 to 40 tons of carbon emission \u2014 before taking guest travel into consideration \u2014 according to Ashwin Malwade, co-founder of Greenmyna, a Mumbai-based sustainable wedding consultancy. Sources of emissions include large-scale banquets and energy used by extravagant light displays. An event as huge in scale as the Ambani-Merchant celebration would emit far more carbon than even the largest and most lavish Indian wedding, he added. Then there\u2019s the travel, with several high-profile attendees pictured leaving Mumbai via Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport\u2019s private jet terminal. Malwade also pointed to the environmental footprint of the Ambanis\u2019 pre-wedding bash in Jamnagar, attended by public figures from around the world, including Mark Zuckerberg, Ivanka Trump, Bill Gates and Karlie Kloss; the four-day cruise arranged for guests in the Mediterranean; and the emissions required to fly in singers like Rihanna and Justin Bieber to perform at various events.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/style/ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_20_middleeast_yemen-israel-strikes-hodeidah-intl", "text": "At least six people were killed and scores more injured in Israeli airstrikes on a Yemeni port, Houthi rebels have said, a day after the Iran-backed group claimed a deadly attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets struck \u201cmilitary targets of the Houthi terrorist regime\u201d in the area of Yemen\u2019s Hodeidah Port on Saturday, in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was a direct response to the death of a 50-year-old Israeli in a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on Friday. This is the first time Israel has struck Yemen, according to Israeli officials. The Houthis said at least six people were killed, three are missing while a further 83 people were injured in the strikes, which hit oil facilities. Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was \u201cbrutal Israeli aggression\u201d aimed at increasing the \u201csuffering of the people of Yemen\u201d and pressuring the group to stop its support of Gaza. Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree vowed to respond to the strike, saying the Houthis would not hesitate to strike Israel\u2019s \u201cvital targets\u201d and warning that Tel Aviv \u2013 a major city home to scores of diplomatic missions \u2013 was still not safe. \u201cWe have prepared for a long war with this enemy until the aggression stops and the blockade on the Palestinian people is lifted,\u201d Saree said. On Sunday Israel said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. \u201cThe projectile did not cross into Israeli territory. Rocket and missile sirens were sounded following the possibility of falling shrapnel. The incident has concluded,\u201d the IDF said. \u2018Not an innocent port\u2019 Netanyahu said in a statement on Saturday that Hodeidah was \u201cnot an innocent port.\u201d \u201cIt was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding that Hodeidah had also been used to attack international shipping in the Red Sea. Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from Israel\u2019s borders, shows the enemy Israel is serious about responding to threats. \u201cIt makes it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the state of Israel will not reach,\u201d Netanyahu said. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a UN statement he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by reports of the strikes. \u201cThe response to the Israeli aggression against our country is inevitably coming and will be huge and great,\u201d Houthi rebels warned in a statement following the attack, adding that they will continue their operations against Israeli, American, and British ships until Israel stops its \u201csiege\u201d on Gaza. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the strikes were also in response to the roughly 200 missiles and drones the rebel group has launched towards Israel since October, when Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza began. Since the start of the war, the Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted the country with drones and missiles, most of which have been intercepted by Israel\u2019s defenses or those of its allies. However, the Houthis have claimed their drone attack in Tel Aviv Friday \u2013 which also injured 10 people \u2013 was performed by a new drone capable of \u201cbypassing the enemy\u2019s interception systems.\u201d The Houthis have also regularly attacked US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Both the UK and the US have responded to the attacks on shipping by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses. An Israeli defense official told CNN that this was a 100% Israeli strike. The official said Israel had previously let the US and UK take the lead on responding to Houthi attacks but decided to respond itself this time because of the death of the Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv. According to the official, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin before the strike was carried out. The defense official added that Israel was able to strike so quickly because it had been preparing for this scenario for months. A White House official said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on \u201cdevelopments\u201d in the Middle East. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the US had not coordinated with Israel on the airstrikes, but added that the US fully recognizes \u201cIsrael\u2019s right to self-defense.\u201d Who are the Houthis? The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah \u2013 Arabic for \u2018Supporters of God\u2019 \u2013\u00a0is a Shi\u2019ite Islamist political and military organization backed by Iran, that emerged in the 1990s. Similar to chants used by Lebanon-based Iranian proxy Hezbollah, the Houthis\u2019 official slogan reads, \u201cGod is the Greatest. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse the Jews. Victory to Islam.\u201d In 2014, Houthi forces allied with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh took control of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa, from the UN-recognized Yemeni government, sparking a civil war that has afflicted the country ever since. Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have led a coalition in Yemen against Houthi forces. More recently, the group has come to be seen in parts of the largely Sunni Muslim world and beyond as champions of the Palestinian cause, defending the people of Gaza against Israel. Since October 7, Houthi rebels have carried out numerous missile and drone attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, asserting that these vessels are linked to Israel and its allies, which has escalated tensions throughout the Middle East. Regional tensions rise In recent weeks Hezbollah has been ramping up cross-border attacks with Israel after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border. Following the Hodeidah strike, Israel\u2019s Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir congratulated Netanyahu on the operation and said Israel should \u201cadopt the same policy against Hezbollah in Lebanon.\u201d Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defense Minister Gallant echoed Ben Gvir\u2019s sentiment. Smotrich said Israel must continue to attack \u201cwith all its might even in distant places,\u201d while Gallant said \u201cthe blood of Israeli citizens has a price,\u201d and that anywhere Israelis are attacked the \u201cresult will be identical.\u201d \u201cThe fire that is currently burning in Hodeidah, is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear,\u201d Gallant said. Hezbollah in Lebanon condemned the attack on Yemen and said \u201cwe stand firmly with the Yemeni people in defending themselves, their sovereignty, and their heroic and historic stance alongside Palestine.\u201d Hamas also condemned the attack, calling it a \u201cdangerous escalation.\u201d Meanwhile, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz called on the international community to \u201cmaximize sanctions on Iran.\u201d \u201cIran supports, trains, and finances the Houthi terror organization as part of its regional network of terror organizations aimed at attacking Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cIran is the head of the snake \u2013 it must be stopped now,\u201d Katz added.

Preliminary investigations suggest the young man \u201ccould have suffered an accident/fall in the inaccessible area,\u201d it added. Slater, who was 19 and from Lancashire, northern England, went missing almost a month ago after attending the NRG festival on the south of the island.

{"id": "2024_07_21_asia_bangladesh-supreme-court-rolls-back-job-quotas-intl", "text": "Bangladesh\u2019s Supreme Court on Sunday rolled back most of the controversial quotas on government jobs which sparked violent protests. Under the quota system, some 30% of sought-after civil service jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971 - with many of the country\u2019s contemporary political elite related to that generation. Since the roles are linked to\u00a0job security and higher pay, the quota system has angered many in the country, particularly students and young people, as Bangladesh faces high unemployment levels. Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which saw demonstrators gather on streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities. In 2018, the civil service quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case. On Sunday, the country\u2019s top court dismissed the earlier ruling that brought back the quotas, directing that 93% of government jobs will be open to candidates on merit, without quotas. Speaking to local media in Dhaka following the announcement, Shah Monjurul Hoque, a lawyer representing students said that the Supreme Court \u201cgave a final solution to this quota system.\u201d \u201cThat is 93% quota for general people, 5% quota for freedom fighters and their kin, 1% for ethnic minority community, and 1% for third gender and physically disabled,\u201d he said. Bangladesh Attorney General A.M. Amin Uddin told Reuters, \u201cI am hoping normalcy will return after today\u2019s ruling and people with ulterior motives will stop instigating people,\u201d noting that students \u201chave clearly said they are in no way part of the violence and arson that have taken place in Bangladesh since Monday.\u201d \u201cI will ask the government to find out the culprits behind the violence and take strict action against them,\u201d he added. Ahead of the ruling, Bangladesh on Sunday extended a curfew imposed on Friday to try to quell the violence and deployed soldiers to patrol the streets of the capital Dhaka, according to Reuters. According to local media, the curfew was extended until after the Supreme Court hearing and will continue for an \u201cuncertain time\u201d following a two-hour break for people to gather supplies, Reuters reported. CNN has tried to reach the prime minister\u2019s office, home affairs ministry, and police, but mobile and internet services appear to remain mostly down across the country after a government-imposed blackout. As of Saturday, internet monitoring site\u00a0NetBlocks said activity had remained at around 10% for more than 48 hours since services were cut Thursday.

The toll came from two separate strikes in the camp, the officials said. In response to CNN\u2019s question about the latest strikes, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: \u201cOvernight, the IDF struck terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip, including terrorists and terrorist infrastructure sites in the area of Nuseirat. \u201cThe IDF is making significant efforts to mitigate harm to uninvolved civilians and is operating in accordance with international law against the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip that are systematically and cynically operating from within civilian infrastructure.\u201d Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense also said a residential block was hit south of Nuseirat, with hospital officials saying they received three bodies. \u201cA short while ago, one tower [block] was bombed,\u201d Mahdi Abdullah, a man from northern Gaza displaced in Nuseirat, told CNN. \u201cThe situation is difficult here, and I am waiting for things to calm down so that I can return to my place.\u201d The Israeli military has launched numerous deadly strikes on\u00a0Nuseirat, including the targeting of multiple UN-run schools housing displaced people. The Israeli military has said its targets were Hamas compounds operating inside the schools. Nuseirat residents described living in constant fear of being bombed and a deteriorating humanitarian situation. \u201cThe situation is scary,\u201d said Rahma Abu Hajjaj, a 39-year-old mother of five from Nuserirat. \u201cThere are no warnings, there are no alarms when homes are bombed, we are hiding all the time and we do not know why they are targeting these homes.\u201d The Ministry\u00a0of\u00a0Health\u00a0in Gaza\u00a0said that 37 people have been killed and 54 injured\u00a0in the past 24 hours due to ongoing Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip.

{"id": "2024_07_12_style_dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon", "text": "Pristine, crisp and all-white \u2014 tennis whites have been a tradition dating back centuries. The distinctive look has not only made the racquet sport stand out, it has also become a sartorial mainstay off the courts, too. And even though most of the major tournaments have done away with the hueless uniformity, Wimbledon, the very first of them, has remained strict in its policy (as have many private clubs around the world). The prestigious championship even clamped down on the rule a decade ago, prohibiting colorful accents that had become increasingly common \u2014\u00a0 the year after Roger Federer\u2019s now-infamous pair of orange-soled sneakers were banned after his first round in 2013. The rules once called for \u201cpredominantly white\u201d outfits, allowing some competitors to play with color combinations, such as Serena Williams\u2019 tribute to Wimbledon treat strawberries and cream in 2010. But the crackdown changed the wording to \u201calmost entirely white,\u201d per the organizers: no off-white, no panels of color, no varying colorways on sneakers. The only recent loosening of rules was in 2023, to allow women to wear dark-colored shorts on the court following criticisms that the rules weren\u2019t accommodating for menstruation leaks. But why did tennis whites become the standard? The reasons often cited are practical ones, from heat reflection to sweat-masking. But senior curator Kevin Jones of the ASU Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (ASU FIDM) Museum in Los Angeles, who organized the recent traveling exhibition \u201cSporting Fashion: Outdoor Girls 1800 - 1960,\u201d said it really comes down to a long history of clubs enforcing social status, starting when lawn tennis skyrocketed in popularity in Victorian-era England as a leisure sport \u2014 and a rare one that allowed women, too. \u201cIt\u2019s completely elitist because white clothes are difficult to maintain,\u201d he said in a phone call with CNN. \u201cAnd the types of materials that these dresses were made of, which were cottons and linens, creased easily, so to keep them nice and freshly starched was also an aspect of that care.\u201d Challenging the rules Of course, tennis style has drastically changed in a century-and-a-half since it first became a recreational sensation for the upper class, hot off the heels of croquet (and utilizing the same neatly trimmed lawns). Early tennis attire was more akin to 19th-century leisurewear: women wore striped and patterned garments with long skirts, corseting and wide-brimmed hats; men donned wool pants, button-downs or sweaters. Because spectators and players have often adhered to similar styles, fashion and tennis have had a \u201cmutual exchange over time, where various tennis trends have seeped into wider culture as well,\u201d said sports journalist Ben Rothenberg, author of \u201cTennis: The Stylish Life\u201d as well as a recent biography on Naomi Osaka. That\u2019s been more than apparent in the past few months as Zendaya turned out a series of tennis-inspired high-fashion red-carpet looks matching the on- and off-court drama of the film \u201cChallengers,\u201d and recently faced Federer in an \u201cair tennis\u201d match for a campaign by the sportswear brand On. The close alignment with fashion has also led to the success of classic tennis-born labels such as Lacoste and Fred Perry, as well as radical new fashion innovations introduced on the court, like Elsa Schiaparelli dressing Spanish player Lil\u00ed de \u00c1lvarez in culottes, a split skirt, for Wimbledon in 1931, to onlookers\u2019 shock. Like with De \u00c1lvarez, dress codes in tennis have often changed after an initial scandal. The French player Suzanne Lenglen was one of the earliest and most memorable cases, when she did away with layered, long dresses and wore a more airy calf-length skirt and shorter sleeves at Wimbledon in 1919. A muse to the designer Jean Patou, Lenglen became tennis\u2019 first fashion icon with her signature headscarf and then-provocative shorter hems. At the US, French and Australian Open, players have challenged definitions of what tennis clothes can be thanks to looser rules (subject to referee opinion). None have done so more than the Williams sisters, with Serena wearing a denim mini, tutus and cape-like silhouettes and Venus\u2019s lacy black-and-red ensemble that drew comparisons to lingerie. More recently, Serena Williams\u2019 Nike kit became the topic of conversation at the 2018 French Open when she opted for a black compression catsuit that didn\u2019t feature the compulsory tennis skirt. Though she cited its circulation benefits following a severe blood-clot scare with the birth of her child, the French Open said it would bar the style in the future. However, the Women\u2019s Tennis Association formally allowed it, and Williams continued to wear versions of the bodysuit at the 2019 and 2021 Australian Opens, normalizing the agile and simplified cut for the tennis court. \u201cI love wearing skirts,\u201d she told CNN in April while reflecting on the controversy. \u201cBut I wanted to make sure that my blood was always circulating and I had been in a near-death experience.\u201d \u201cSo I think there should have been\u2026 understanding around that whole outfit,\u201d she added. Brand distinctions Most of the Grand Slam tournaments dropped the all-white rules decades ago, likely in a bid to attract more television viewers and advertisers in an age of increased visibility for the sport. \u201cColor is vital to draw the eye and especially for those sports companies to be able to advertise their logos and their colors,\u201d Jones explained. Sports and luxury brands advertise through fashion in multiple ways, from dressing star players in custom statement pieces to promoting merchandised designs on competitors. Wimbledon\u2019s restrictive rules have been \u201cfrustrating\u201d for brands trying to sell their tournament collections, Rothenberg said. When Fila introduced Bjorn Borg throwback shirts in 2001, replicating what the tennis star wore during his five-time-winning Wimbledon streak from 1976 to 1980, Wimbledon officials said they no longer adhered to the rules. The decision sent the sports brand \u201cscrambling\u201d to get new shirts to the players wearing them, Rothenberg explained. And, after Federer\u2019s orange-soled shoes were banned, Nike had to act fast to spin their brief appearance, advertising them as \u201cOne Match Wonders\u201d in a print ad. For players, the smallest infractions have proved controversial, and some players have outright refused to play along, as Andre Agassi did from 1988-90 when he boycotted Wimbledon entirely. In 2017, Jurij Rodionov was told to change blue underwear that was peeking out of his shirts, while Sabine Lisicki recently said that she and women were often required to switch out their skin-colored bras. But Rothenberg doesn\u2019t see more leniency happening anytime soon from Wimbledon\u2019s decision-makers. \u201cI think Wimbledon sees its anachronisms as a big part of its brand and its value,\u201d he explained. \u201cWimbledon has clung on to it as a way to be distinct and different \u2014 and I think it\u2019s largely been successful. It doesn\u2019t look like any other tournament.\u201d There have been criticisms levied against the major tournaments whenever women players seem to be disproportionately affected by their dress codes, and though Rothenberg agrees, he also points out that women\u2019s styles have been more creative. Men\u2019s tenniswear has deviated less from shorts and lightwear polos or shortsleeve athletic shirts since they were introduced. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of men\u2019s short length getting markedly shorter over the last 12 months though, especially players who really have hiked up their shorts a lot,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe someday there will be rules against that if they start showing too much cheek.\u201d Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled a source\u2019s surname and misstated the current name of the ASU FIDM Museum.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/style/dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 26-year-old became the first rider since Marco Pantani in 1998 to achieve the \u201cdouble,\u201d winning both the Tour de France and Giro d\u2019Italia in the same year, an almost impossible feat in modern cycling  that seemed easy for Poga\u010dar who still had the energy to muster a bow over the finish line when he took his fourth stage victory of the race on Friday or joke in post-race interviews. His fifth and sixth stage victories of the race followed on Saturday and Sunday, the biggest haul for any rider since 2009 and an enormous amount for a general classification rider like Poga\u010dar. Not since 1948 has a rider won five mountain stages in a single edition of the race like Pogacar did this year. Eventually, he finished six minutes and 17 seconds ahead of his great rival Jonas Vingegaard in second place overall, having extended the margin by winning the time trial in the race\u2019s final stage on Sunday in Nice. Their rivalry has shaped every edition of the Tour de France since 2021 when Denmark\u2019s Vingegaard emerged as an unlikely challenger to a rampant Poga\u010dar. The Slovenian won that year before Vingegaard took the next two editions, cracking his rival in the high mountains, and he lined up on the start line in Florence three weeks ago as the defending champion. But, this year, Poga\u010dar, reemerged as the dominant rider on almost every terrain, dismantling Vingegaard who arrived at this race diminished, still recovering from a serious crash just three months ago in which he broke his collarbone as well as several ribs and suffered a collapsed lung. Like almost every other great sporting rivalry, theirs is one that pits two contrasting personalities against one another \u2013 the outgoing, flamboyant Poga\u010dar itching to attack at any opportunity versus the more introverted, collected Vingegaard who marshals his efforts more strategically. Only young Remco Evenepoel, making his Tour de France debut, could remain within touching distance of these two, eventually finishing in third place, 9:18 behind Poga\u010dar. He stood on the podium wearing the white jersey of the best young rider in the race, alongside Poga\u010dar in the yellow jersey, Richard Carapaz in the polka-dot jersey worn by the race\u2019s best climber and Biniam Girmay, who made history as the first Black African rider to win the green jersey as the leader of the points classification.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/sport/tadej-pogacar-tour-de-france-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_14_europe_western-weapons-ukraine-russia-intl-cmd", "text": "Bankir and his men have been trying to fight off Russian attacks along the Ukrainian front lines for more than two years. But it\u2019s only now that they are finally able to strike where it hurts: Inside Russia\u2019s own territory. The newly granted permission by the United States and other allies to use Western weapons to strike inside Russia has had a huge impact, Bankir said. \u201cWe have destroyed targets inside Russia, which allowed for several successful counteroffensives. The Russian military can no longer feel impunity and security,\u201d the senior officer in Ukraine\u2019s Security Service (SBU) told CNN. For security reasons, he asked to be identified by his call sign only. After many months on the back foot because of ammunition and manpower shortages, Kyiv is finally able to take full advantage of Western military aid that started to flow into the country last month, after months of delays. Soldiers on the front lines say the deliveries are beginning to make a difference \u2013 especially since they can now use the arsenal to strike across the border at certain military targets supporting Russia\u2019s offensive in Ukraine. \u201cWe can see the impact of the aid every day. Artillery, longer-range multiple launch rocket systems with various types of ammunition and submunitions\u2026 it\u2019s affecting the overall battlefield picture,\u201d Ivan, an officer with the 148th artillery brigade, told CNN. He also asked for his full name not to be published for security reasons. \u201cWe are deploying the most effective weapons systems in the areas where the Russians are trying to break through the defensive lines and there has been a significant slowdown in the Russian advance,\u201d he added. While Kyiv hasn\u2019t managed to reclaim large swathes of territory, it has successfully averted what could have been a disaster: The occupation of Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second city. \u2018Tragic moment\u2019 Part of the northern Kharkiv region, including the cities of Izium, Kupiansk, and Balakliia, fell into Russian hands soon after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The occupation was brutal. When the area was liberated in the fall of 2022, Ukrainian troops found evidence of what they say were war crimes committed by Russian forces, including multiple mass graves and torture chambers. In May this year, Russia launched another cross-border attack on the region, trying to exploit Ukraine\u2019s ammunition shortages before the expected arrival of the first Western weapons. The consequences were deadly. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said that at least 174 civilians were killed and 690 were injured in Ukraine in May, the highest number of civilian casualties in a year. More than half of the civilian casualties were in Kharkiv \u2013 even though the region encompasses a relatively small area compared to the whole country. International security expert Oleksiy Melnyk, a former Ukrainian defense official and the co-director of foreign relations and international security programs at the Razumkov Center in Kyiv, told CNN that the re-occupation of previously liberated areas north of Kharkiv was a \u201ctragic moment\u201d for Ukraine. But it also marked a major turning point. \u201cIt triggered a change in the position of our Western partners, it encouraged them to, at least partially, remove the restrictions on the use of the Western weapons,\u201d he said. Fearing an escalation, the US and other Western allies had long prohibited Kyiv from using their weapons to strike inside Russia, restricting their use to Ukrainian areas under Russian occupation. That has allowed Russia to use the border areas as safe staging grounds for offensives and missile attacks. \u201c(Russia) knew that Ukraine did not have the capacity to strike these targets on the Russian territory,\u201d Melnyk said. \u201cIf the decision (to provide aid) wasn\u2019t made, if we lost American support and military assistance, that would have been a game changer.\u201d But the possibility of Russian re-occupation of parts of Kharkiv region convinced some of Ukraine\u2019s key allies, including the US, to lift the restrictions. This allowed Kyiv to hit and destroy or severely damage key targets inside Russia. According to Ukrainian defense authorities, these included a regiment command post in Belgorod region, an ammunition depot in Voronezh, a drone facility and an airfield in Krasnodar, communication centers in Bryansk and several naval sites in occupied Crimea. The arrival of long-range ATACMS missile systems was a particular game-changer, Melnyk said. While Ukraine was previously able to strike targets inside Russia using Ukraine-made drones, ATACMS make these strikes far more efficient. \u201cSpeed matters,\u201d Melnyk explained. \u201cWith drone strikes, Russians have hours to react, because they can detect Ukrainian drones early. Russian pilots can have a coffee and a cigarette before jumping into the cockpit and taking off to take it down. With the ATACMS, it\u2019s a matter of minutes,\u201d he said. Konrad Muzyka, an independent defense analyst  and the director of\u00a0Rochan\u00a0Consulting who has recently returned from eastern Ukraine, said Russia is also no longer able to target Kharkiv region with S-300 and S-400 missile systems. \u201cUkraine started conducting HIMARS strikes on targets in the Belgorod region and forced the Russians to push their S-300 system with which they were striking Kharkiv much further away, so\u00a0now Kharkiv is beyond their range of Russian S-300 systems,\u201d he said. While Russia switched to aerial glide bombs \u2013 guided munitions with pop-up wings dropped by fighter jets from a distance of some 60-70 kilometers \u2013 out of range of Ukraine\u2019s air defenses, the elimination of the S-300 threat has provided at least some relief to Kharkiv. Weapons without men, men without strategy? But while the new weapons are making some difference, Ukraine is long way off being able to push Russian forces off its territory. Another officer with the 148th separate artillery brigade who goes by call sign Senator told CNN that there is still a lot more that Ukraine needs. \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough to turn the tide at the front. Enough to hold the enemy back, yes, but not enough to change the situation dramatically,\u201d he said. \u201cThe enemy is now exhausted but not destroyed,\u201d he said, pointing to the fact that Russia still has complete air superiority over Ukraine. Kyiv is now pinning its hopes on the deliveries of F-16 fighter jets which should start soon \u2013 the first Ukrainian pilots were set to complete their training in the US this summer. But Muzyka said it is far from certain the jets will bring a massive change to Ukraine\u2019s fortunes. \u201cThe F-16s are combat aircraft from 1980s and 1990s and their capabilities are worse than the most modern Russian combat aircraft,\u201d he said, adding that the newest Russian jets would likely prevail in an air battle with the F-16. However, Ukraine can still use the F-16 to deny Russia control over the skies \u2013 and push away Russian aircraft delivering bombs. Yet the new weapons are just part of the puzzle. \u201cIf it had not been for the supplemental package, Ukrainians would be in a much worse situation right now, but at the same time, the current situation is not only the result of a lack of actions by the US Congress, it\u2019s also the result of the decisions that were made and were not made in Kyiv, especially when it comes to mobilization,\u201d Muzyka said. \u201cThe decision to introduce a wider mobilization was probably as important, if not more important, and it came too late,\u201d he said. The new mobilization law, which requires all men between 18 and 60 to register with Ukraine\u2019s military, came into effect in May. He said that while Ukraine has managed to recruit a significant number of men over the past month and half, it will take time for these new soldiers to be trained up and ready for the front lines. \u201cUkrainians are going to be in a very difficult position until August, September, when the first mobilized guys start to enter the front line. If they can get to that point, then there is a big likelihood that they will manage to stabilize the situation from August onwards, but until this happens, more Russian gains are highly likely.\u201d Muzyka said that with the new weapons arriving and battalions and brigades getting a boost soon from the new recruits, Ukraine will need to decide on its next steps. \u201cIt is unclear what the plans are. What is the strategy for counteroffensives? The problem is that Ukraine is waiting to see what equipment the West can supply them with, and the West is waiting to see what plans Ukraine have for the future,\u201d he said. Time is of the essence here. Experts estimate that the $60 billion US aid package approved earlier this year will last for \u2013 at best \u2013 a year or 18 months. Ukraine\u2019s allies made fresh pledges on arms this week while at a NATO summit in Washington, DC, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for all restrictions on their usage to be lifted. Given the possibility of former US President Donald Trump winning a second term in November \u2013 he has little time to spare. Maria Kostenko and Daria Tarasova-Markina contributed reporting.

In February,\u00a0he told the Munich Security Conference \u201cthe American security blanket has allowed\u00a0European security to atrophy,\u201d arguing that in a world where munitions manufacturing is limited, the only option for Ukraine is a negotiated settlement. Vance was echoing the GOP\u2019s presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has long criticized NATO and accused partners in the security alliance of failing to pay their fair share. The former president has also hinted at paring back military aid to Ukraine and claimed that he could have the war settled through negotiation in 24 hours if reelected. And yet the mood among European leaders arriving in the rolling\u00a0Oxfordshire countryside is one of resignation, and resolve. \u201cI think whoever wins the US race\u2026 it will be more America first,\u201d\u00a0Belgium\u2019s Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told CNN.\u00a0\u201cAnd I think the only answer to that is Europe needs to stand on its own legs\u2026 what we see in the Republican convention confirms that.\u201d Finland\u2019s President Alexander Stubb, the head of one of NATO\u2019s newest members, has read Vance\u2019s book, \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d describing it as \u201cvery good.\u201d On the isolationist leanings of a Trump-Vance ticket,\u00a0he is circumspect. \u201cAm I worried? No. Because the United States wants to remain a superpower,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIs there a rebalancing going on? Yes. Europe needs to take care of its defense more.\u201d Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen argues Europe stepping up its commitment to its own security has nothing to do with the US.\u00a0\u201cWe have to be more capable of defending ourselves, with a more and more aggressive Russia, not only when it comes to Ukraine,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s every day now that we\u2019ve seen hybrid attacks, cyber attacks, disinformation.\u201d UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, just two weeks into the job, was hoping the Thursday summit involving 42 European heads of state or government would be a strong show of unity, \u201ca signal to Russia of our resolve.\u201d And yet one EU leader has signaled something quite different to Russia. Hungarian\u00a0Prime Minister\u00a0Viktor Orban, who has never supported military aid to Ukraine, chose the first week of his rotating EU presidency this month to visit President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, on what he called a \u201cpeace mission.\u201d The visit\u00a0was about fulfilling his \u201cChristian duty\u201d Orban told CNN on Thursday. \u201cI try to do my best to convince everybody that peace is better than a war\u2026 it\u2019s not easy to convince them.\u201d\u00a0European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, reelected Thursday to another five-year term, called the trip \u201can appeasement mission.\u201d Speaking at the meeting at Blenheim Palace, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was blunt.

The EU and NATO can address all their issues without this one individual.\u201d Europe did manage a show of unity, but one that faces mounting tests,\u00a0including\u00a0the prospect of a new US administration that may pull its support for Ukraine, and an increasingly active Ukraine-skeptic in its midst.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/europe/europe-russia-isolationist-us-unity-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_tech_google-wiz-acquisition", "text": "Google owner Alphabet is in advanced discussions to buy fast-growing cybersecurity startup Wiz for roughly $23 billion, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. A takeover of Wiz, which makes cybersecurity software for cloud computing, would represent a major bet by Google on cybersecurity, marking the tech giant\u2019s biggest-ever acquisition. Discussions between Google and Wiz began after the startup raised $1 billion from venture capital investors earlier this year, the source said. Terms of a potential deal have not been finalized and talks could still collapse, according to the source. News of the Google-Wiz talks was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Neither Google nor Wiz returned CNN\u2019s requests for comment. The deal would easily surpass Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola for $12.5 billion about a decade ago, the biggest takeover in company history. Google offloaded Motorola just two years later for a massive loss. A $23 billion price tag on Wiz is nearly double the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. In March 2022, Alphabet bought cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion as part of its efforts to help companies better address cyber threats and bolster its cloud computing business. Google Cloud is central to the company\u2019s efforts to diversity revenue beyond its core search advertising business. Although its cloud sales have grown, it has struggled to compete with similar services from Microsoft\u00a0and Amazon. Buying Wiz would be a \u201cshot across the bow\u201d at Microsoft and Amazon, showing that Google is making a \u201cmajor bet on the cyber security space to complement its flagship offering in the cloud,\u201d Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at\u00a0Wedbush, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Cloud security has become especially important in recent years as companies have spent heavily to move data to cloud platforms. Just last week, AT&T revealed that nearly all of its wireless customers\u2019 call and text records were exposed in a massive breach caused by an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform. The Google-Wiz deal talks come despite intense antitrust scrutiny under the Biden administration of tech giants. However, that antitrust scrutiny could be dialed back somewhat if Trump once again takes hold of the White House, Ives said, making the Federal Trade Commission \u201cmuch weaker\u201d and sparking an \u201caccelerated merger and acquisition environment to take place for Big Tech.\u201d If the acquisition gets finalized and closes, it would mark a massive exit for Wiz and its founders \u2014 Assaf Rappaport, Ami Luttwak, Yinon Costica and Roy Reznik. The four executives met years ago when they were drafted into Unit 8200, the cyber intelligence division of the Israel Defense Forces. Since starting up in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York City-based Wiz has enjoyed explosive growth. Today, the company says 40% of Fortune 100 companies are its clients. Notable customers include BMW, Slack and Salesforce, and it works with major cloud companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Google.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/tech/google-wiz-acquisition/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_asia_bangladesh-job-quota-protests-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Huge protests across Bangladesh escalated into deadly violence this week with clashes\u00a0between students, pro-government supporters\u00a0and armed police fueling\u00a0widespread\u00a0anger over civil service job quotas opponents say are discriminatory. Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which has seen riot police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters and crowds of demonstrators armed with sticks filling the streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities. State broadcaster Bangladesh Television (BTV) was off air on Friday after student demonstrators allegedly set fire to its headquarters, according to local media, and protesters have called for a nationwide shutdown in a major challenge to the government of longstanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Mobile and internet services have been cut, schools and universities ordered to close, and security forces deployed to quell the unrest, with human rights groups accusing authorities of using unlawful force against protesters. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Why are students protesting? Many Bangladeshi students are demanding an end to the government\u2019s quota system, which reserves more than half of\u00a0civil service posts for certain groups. Some 30% of those highly sought-after jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, a seminal moment in the nation\u2019s history as it successfully won freedom from a much larger ruler. Many of the country\u2019s contemporary political elite are related to that generation \u2013 including Prime Minister Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975. The reserved roles are linked to\u00a0job security and higher pay, and protesters say the quota system is discriminatory and favors supporters of Hasina\u2019s ruling Awami League party. They are demanding recruitment based on merit. \u201cA government job is a really good opportunity,\u201d said Maruf Khan, 29, a Bangladeshi studying in Australia, who has joined rallies supporting the protests in Sydney. \u201cAbout 500,000 to 600,000 people are competing for 600 to 700 government jobs and on top of that it includes a 56% quota. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d Driving the anger is high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it has slowed in the post-pandemic era and, as the World Bank notes in its latest overview, inequality has \u201cwidened in urban areas.\u201d\u00a0In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education. In 2018, the quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal was unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case. Critics and protesters say the quota system creates a two-tier Bangladesh where a politically connected elite benefit by their birth. \u201cThe freedom fighters have sacrificed a lot for the nation \u2026 for that reason this quota was a logical thing in the past,\u201d said student protester Tahmeed Hossain. \u201cBut there have been at least two generations after that. Nowadays, the quota \u2026 has rather become a form of discrimination. It has become a cultural propaganda to create a stronghold in the country.\u201d Why did the protests escalate? The protests began at the prestigious Dhaka University on July 1 and later spread to other campuses and cities nationwide in almost daily street gatherings that included rail and road blockades. The demonstrations became violent on July 15 when members of the Bangladesh Chatra League \u2013 the\u00a0student wing of the ruling Awami League party \u2013 reportedly attacked student protesters inside the Dhaka University campus. Since then, clashes between security forces, protesters and government supporters have escalated, with Bangladesh deploying its paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion, which was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 after \u201cwidespread allegations of serious human rights abuses.\u201d The student protester Hossain told CNN he was wounded at a rally at Dhaka University on Wednesday when a projectile was thrown into the crowd. \u201cSomeone threw a small thing at us that blew up and I heard shots. I started running and realized that I had been hurt by some splinters in my hands. The police then attacked us with tear shell in the building,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my friends got hit by a (rubber) bullet in the leg. Some of my friends got their heads smashed and are currently under treatment in the hospital.\u201d Another protester in Dhaka, Hassan Abdullah, said Thursday: \u201cThere are tear (gas) shells just 50 meters away from me as I am talking to you. The police are constantly bursting sound grenades right now.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the accounts but the sounds of protest commotion, including multiple audible cracks, could be heard during the conversation with Abdullah. Reports of the number of people killed has varied widely, with the Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo saying 19 people were killed on Thursday alone and the Agence France-Press news agency reporting\u00a032 deaths, citing its own tally compiled from hospital data. Authorities have also moved to block online communications. Internet monitoring site Netblocks confirmed a \u201cnear-total national internet shutdown\u201d across Bangladesh on Thursday. \u201cThe new measure follows earlier efforts to throttle social media and restrict mobile data services,\u201d it said on X. What has the government said? The demonstrations are the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Hasina since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition party to protest what they said was a widespread crackdown on their ranks. Hasina has announced a judicial investigation into the killings and called on protesters to await the verdict of the Supreme Court. \u201cI especially urge everyone to wait patiently until the Supreme Court verdict comes. I believe our students will get justice from high court, they will not be disappointed,\u201d Hasina said in a news conference Thursday. But she has been accused of enflaming\u00a0protester anger by reportedly calling them \u201crazakar,\u201d\u00a0 an offensive term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 independence war. \u201cWe expected an apology from our prime minister for comparing us to traitors of 1952 and 1972, and a solid solution to quota reform,\u201d said protester Salman Farsi. \u201cWhat did the students do to deserve this tag?\u201d Student protesters CNN spoke to say their demonstrations have gone beyond frustration over the quota system and their anger is now directed at Hasina and her government, which human rights organizations have long warned are headed toward a one-party system. \u201cThis is a people\u2019s movement against the authoritarian government,\u201d Hossain said. \u201cThis is not just about quota protests anymore, this is much bigger than that, in simple quota protests the government wouldn\u2019t go around hurting and shooting students. This shows the current fascist and autocratic nature of the government, who has been upholding the power without any proper voting system.\u201d What has global reaction been? Bangladeshi students have held smaller protests elsewhere,\u00a0including in New York\u2019s Times Square, the Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney and the Danish capital Copenhagen. The US said it was \u201ccontinuing to monitor the reports of violence from the ongoing protests in and around Dhaka,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said in a briefing on Thursday. \u201cFreedom of expression and peaceful assembly are essential building blocks to any thriving democracy, and we condemn the recent acts of violence in Bangladesh.\u201d UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u00a0called for restraint on all sides and urged the government to investigate all acts of violence, according to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. \u201cThe secretary-general encourages the meaningful and constructive participation of youth to address the ongoing challenges in Bangladesh. Violence can never be the solution,\u201d Dujarric  said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/asia/bangladesh-job-quota-protests-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_africa_gambia-upholds-fgm-ban-intl", "text": "Gambia\u2019s parliament has voted to uphold a landmark law that bans female genital mutilation (FGM) in the largely Muslim nation, after religious groups pushed for the legislation to be repealed. If Monday\u2019s bid had been successful, the tiny West African country would have been the first in the world to relegalize FGM after criminalizing it. MP Amadou Camara, who chairs a joint health and gender committee that recommended that FGM should remain outlawed, told CNN that none of the clauses seeking the repeal of the ban in the Women\u2019s (Amendment) Bill 2024 was passed. Parliament Speaker Fabakary Jatta\u00a0ruled that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for the bill, which passed a second reading four months ago, to be read a third time and to pass without those clauses. \u201cI so rule that the bill is rejected, and the legislative process exhausted,\u201d Jatta said at plenary meeting Monday. FGM was prohibited in Gambia in 2015 by former president Yahya Jammeh who authorized the\u00a0imposition of fines and prison sentences\u00a0of up to three years for individuals who engaged in it. The law also punished perpetrators with life sentences in cases where the practice led to death. Pro-Islamic groups and lawmakers pushed back against the criminalization, saying that female circumcision was \u201cone of the virtues of Islam.\u201d Other prominent Gambians, such as opposition leader and former interior minister Mai Ahmad Fatty also defended the practice, arguing that: \u201cThere is no FGM in Gambia. We circumcise, not mutilate.\u201d Human rights organization Amnesty International earlier described efforts to revoke the FGM ban as a \u201cbackward move\u201d for the protection of human rights in the country. In Gambia, 73% of women aged between 15 and 49 years had experienced FGM as of 2020, according to the United Nations. More than 65% of those women were subjected to the practice \u201cbefore the age of five years,\u201d the UN said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Women\u2019s Day in March that he was \u201coutraged\u201d by moves by Gambia\u2019s parliament to legalize FGM, describing the practice as \u201chorrific.\u201d Despite the ban, FGM has still been performed on children in parts of the country. Last year, three women were convicted of performing the practice on eight female minors\u00a0and ordered to pay fines of around 15,000 Gambian Dalasi ($220) each or face a one-year jail sentence. The penalties were\u00a0reported\u00a0to have been paid by an Islamic cleric. In 2016, two women also faced charges\u00a0after a 5-month-old girl died from genital mutilation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/africa/gambia-upholds-fgm-ban-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

The extraordinary move comes after months of speculation that Trong\u2019s health was weakening. The party did not clarify what treatment he is receiving. Lam, a former head of internal security, has been widely seen as a top candidate to replace Trong when his term ends in 2026. The party\u2019s powerful Politburo has tasked him with presiding over \u201cthe work of the Party Central Committee, the Politburo and the Secretariat,\u201d according to a statement from the party\u2019s central office. Though Vietnam officially has no paramount ruler, the party chief holds the most powerful position in the Communist-ruled nation. Trong, 80, has been in the post since 2011. Trong, a Marxist-Leninist ideologue, has since 2017 unleashed what many see as a China-style crackdown on corruption known as \u201cblazing furnace\u201d. But in recent months, he has appeared fragile in public events and missed several top-level meetings. In a surprise move, the Politburo awarded Trong on Thursday with the Gold Star medal, the country\u2019s highest honor for public officials. Lam was elected president in May after several top leaders quit amid accusations of unspecified wrongdoing, part of the sweeping anti-graft campaign launched by Trong. Lam, a key player in the crackdown, promised after his election to \u201cresolutely and persistently continue the fight against corruption\u201d. Vietnam\u2019s main stock market edged up 0.5% after the announcement. A Hanoi-based senior Western diplomat said he saw Lam\u2019s expanded powers as \u201cGood for stability.\u201d But the diplomat, who declined to be identified, added: \u201cWe\u2019ll need to see if this has an impact on economic, foreign and domestic policies and in which direction.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/asia/vietnam-president-lam-takeover-trong-health-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_style_cloudboom-strike-spray-on-running-shoes", "text": "We\u2019ve seen spray-on hair, a spray-on dress and now \u2014 marathon-winning spray-on shoes. Swiss sportswear brand On is the latest company to embrace advanced \u201cspray-on\u201d materials with a \u201crevolutionary\u201d robot-made sneaker it believes can improve performance at this month\u2019s Olympics. The Cloudboom Strike LS is lace-free and weighs less than the latest iPhone. Designed to be more adaptable, dynamic and supportive than your average running sneakers, the $330 shoes already have a convincing track record: Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri, an Olympic silver medalist and the only woman to have won indoor, outdoor and cross-country world titles, triumphed at this year\u2019s Boston Marathon wearing a pair. She will don them again to compete in the Paris 2024 Games this summer. Zurich-based On credits its shoes\u2019 success to a combination of biomechanics, physiology and extreme lightness. (A men\u2019s US size 8.5 weighs just 170g per shoe, over 100g lighter than several popular running shoes of the same size.) \u201cMore than anything, we want (the athletes) to win,\u201d said senior director of innovation, Ilmarin Heitz, in a promotional video published Monday. \u201cThat is our gauge of success.\u201d With no heel-cap, laces or tongue, the translucent, sock-like sneaker looks like a running shoe that has shed its skin. Its inventor, Johannes Voelchert, came up with the idea as a student after seeing a Halloween-themed hot glue gun that shot decorative spider webs. \u201cI saw that there was a quick way of creating a textile onto a complex shape,\u201d Voelchert, now On\u2019s senior lead of innovation concept design, said in the brand\u2019s video. \u201cA shoe seemed to be the right object.\u201d Voelchert brought his idea to the Milan Design Fair, where he caught the Swiss sportswear brand\u2019s attention. According to On, the shoe\u2019s uppers (the material above the sole) are made from a type of thermoplastic and colored and branded in three minutes using just a robotic arm. The upper is sprayed in one go and can be attached to the carbon-fiber and foam rubber sole using heat, not glue. The company claims its technology reduces the carbon emissions of producing a shoe\u2019s upper by 75%, compared to its other sneaker models. The material, which it dubs LightSpray, has \u201cthe potential\u2026 to move us towards a more sustainable, circular future,\u201d said Marc Maurer, On\u2019s co-CEO, in a press release. Sprayed-to-measure The technology will be on display at a pop up in Paris later this month as people flock to the capital for the 2024 Olympic Games. And while it is not yet known if which athletes other than Obiri will wear them at the Games, a number of Olympians have recently raced in the Cloudboom Strike LS, including Australian middle-distance runner Olli Hoare. The brand told CNN via email that it hopes athletes going to Paris who have previously worn the shoes \u2014 such as Irish 1,500-meter runner Luke McCann \u2014 will \u201ccontinue to choose them this summer.\u201d On is not the first company to experiment with spray-on textiles. In October 2022, luxury French fashion house Coperni made headlines when it sprayed a custom-fit dress onto model Bella Hadid at Paris Fashion Week. The label partnered with Manel Torres, whose brand Fabrican has been producing \u201cclothes-in-a-can\u201d for over 20 years. Spray-on fibers have also been used in the beauty industry, with \u201chair in a can\u201d solutions used to conceal bald spots and thinning hair. Having initially been made available to the public in April, the Cloudboom Strike LS will again go on sale to consumers later this year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/style/cloudboom-strike-spray-on-running-shoes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_europe_ukraine-germany-aid-halved-intl", "text": "Germany plans to halve its military aid to Ukraine next year, despite concerns that US support for Kyiv could potentially diminish if Republican candidate Donald Trump returns to the White House. German aid to Ukraine will be cut to \u20ac4 billion ($4.35 billion) in 2025 from around \u20ac8 billion in 2024, according to a draft of the 2025 budget seen by Reuters. Germany hopes Ukraine will be able to meet the bulk of its military needs with the $50 billion in loans from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets approved by the Group of Seven, and that funds earmarked for armaments will not be fully used. \u201cUkraine\u2019s financing is secured for the foreseeable future thanks to European instruments and the G7 loans,\u201d German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on Wednesday at a news conference. Washington pushed to \u201cfront load\u201d the loans to give Ukraine a big lump sum now. Officials say EU leaders agreed to the idea in part because it reduces the chance of Ukraine being short of funds if Trump returns to the White House. Alarm bells rang across Europe this week after Trump picked Senator JD Vance, who opposes military aid for Ukraine and warned Europe will have to rely less on the United States to defend the continent, as his candidate for vice president. Trump sparked fierce criticism from Western officials for suggesting he would not protect countries that failed to meet the transatlantic military alliance\u2019s defense spending targets and would even encourage Russia to attack them. Germany has faced criticism for repeatedly missing a NATO target of spending 2% of its economic output on defense. Depleted military stocks The stocks of Germany\u2019s armed forces, already run down by decades of underinvestment, have been further depleted by arms supplies to Kyiv. So far, Berlin has donated three Patriot air defense units to Kyiv, more than any other country, bringing down the number of Patriot systems in Germany to nine. Germany\u2019s fractious coalition of left-leaning Social Democrats, pro-business liberals and ecologist Greens has struggled to comply with NATO\u2019s spending target due to self-imposed rules that limit the amount of state borrowing they can take on. Although military aid to Ukraine will be cut, Germany will comply with the NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defense in 2025, with a total of \u20ac75.3 billion. Days after Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a \u201cZeitenwende\u201d \u2013 German for historic turning point - with a \u20ac100 billion special fund to bring the military up to speed. From this special fund, there will be \u20ac22.0 billion more for defense, plus \u20ac53.3 billion in the regular budget, still less than that sought by Defense Minister Boris Pistorius. The defense budget is set to receive a meagre \u20ac1.3 billion more than in 2024, far below the \u20ac6.7 billion requested by Pistorius. As ever-increasing annual operating costs outpace this rise, the defense ministry is being forced to cut ammunition orders for 2025 by more than half, reduce procurement by \u20ac260 million and research and development by over \u20ac200 million. The budget for 2025 comes with the mid-term financial planning until 2028, the year when the armed forces\u2019 special fund to meet NATO\u2019s minimum spending goals is due to run out and 80 billion will be needed for defense, as noted in the financial plan. In 2028, there is a gap of \u20ac39 billion in the regular budget, of which \u20ac28 billion are needed to comply with the NATO target without the special fund, sources from the finance ministry said. Decisions on how the hole will be plugged are not likely to be taken until after the 2025 election. \u201cThe 80 billion euros that have been put on display for 2028 simply do not exist,\u201d said Ingo Gaedechens, member of the parliament\u2019s budget committee from the conservative opposition party CDU. \u201cThe coalition is not even trying to cover this up but are openly admitting it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/europe/ukraine-germany-aid-halved-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

He is president and design director of architecture and engineering firm NORR, which is behind some of the city\u2019s best-known landmarks, including the Atlantis and Shangri-La Hotels. Now he is working on one of his most ambitious creations. Due for completion by the end of 2024, the Ciel Dubai Marina, colloquially called Ciel Tower, will have more than 1,000 rooms and suites spread over 82 floors \u2014 and at around 1,200 feet (365 meters) high, it is set to become the world\u2019s tallest hotel. A passion project For the project, Jan was tasked with designing the skyscraper on a triangular plot of land at Dubai Marina with an area of just 2,500 square meters \u2013 small for a building of that height. \u201cIt\u2019s a property that\u2019s very compressed,\u201d he told CNN in 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s like what you would face in Manhattan or London. The constraints were tremendous, and yet we had to make it work.\u201d A glass observation deck will offer 360-degree views of the city, as well as the coastline and iconic landmarks such as the Palm Jumeirah man-made island, according to the developer, The First Group. Visitors will also be able to take in the sights from a rooftop swimming pool and restaurants. As well as appealing to the senses, the project is energy efficient, using 25% less power for air conditioning than is typical for similar buildings, Jan said. \u201cThis project is not just about architecture. It\u2019s about architecture and engineering coming together,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why I love the project so much. It \u2026 is my passion, the convergence of science and art.\u201d Throughout the build, Jan said he has been \u201cextremely involved\u201d in the work. \u201cWhen you design a project as complex as the Ciel, you can never let your guard down, you can never say it\u2019s over,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuous process.\u201d An extended stay When Jan first arrived in Dubai in 1996, he never envisioned he would leave such a legacy, designing some of the city\u2019s most iconic office developments, residential towers and malls. He grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, and moved to the US aged 18 on a scholarship. After studying structural engineering at Princeton, he got a Master\u2019s in architecture. After that, Jan worked in the US for nine years and had no intention of leaving until he received a job offer as a senior designer working on the Emirates Towers office and hotel complex. Now aged 61, he said that he never planned to stay in the UAE for so long, now having spent 28 years in Dubai. \u201cI got carried away with the excitement here,\u201d he said. As for the Ciel Tower \u2014 named for the French word for sky \u2014 Jan hopes that it will come to be seen as timeless, like the Empire State Building or the Chrysler Building in New York City. \u201cThe reason I like the fact that it\u2019s called Ciel is because I believe in our own lives the sky is the limit, and that\u2019s the case certainly in my own life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a chance to grow, to do things that I didn\u2019t think I would get a chance to do.

{"id": "style_dubai-designs-worlds-greenest-highway-spc", "text": "Not content with Dubai having the tallest building, the deepest pool or the highest hotel, urban design firm URB hopes to add one more superlative feather to the city\u2019s cap: the world\u2019s \u201cgreenest\u201d highway. URB has released conceptual designs for a 64-kilometer-long highway that would see Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road, one of the city\u2019s main traffic belts, transformed into a \u201cGreen Spine,\u201d complete with autonomous, solar-powered trams and smart traffic management. Baharash Bagherian, urban planner and founder of URB, believes the \u201cfirst-of-its-kind project\u201d would make the city\u2019s design more \u201chuman-centric.\u201d \u201cDubai is rapidly expanding, with its population expected to nearly double to 8 million by 2040,\u201d Bagherian told CNN in an email. \u201cThis growth necessitates creativity and innovation to address both current and future challenges.\u201d \u201cWe must view mobility as more than just the movement of people,\u201d he added. Smart tech and solar-power The autonomous solar-powered tram is just one aspect of the proposed highway\u2019s transport system: above the tram line, a network of green areas, parks and overpasses would increase connectivity and walkability of the city, which is currently tough to navigate on foot. The highway would also integrate smart technology, such as \u201cinternet of things\u201d (IoT) sensors, to manage traffic and optimize energy use. Bagherian\u2019s designs allow for 300-megawatt solar panels and a storage system to be embedded in the tracks, that would power the tram line, as well as generate clean energy for an estimated 130,000 homes. And the green spaces \u2014 including parks and community gardens \u2014 would provide space for one million trees, which would also help cool the city and improve air quality. \u2018A unique set of challenges\u2019 Creating the world\u2019s \u201cgreenest\u201d highway in a desert city isn\u2019t easy, though. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) already has one of the world\u2019s highest water consumption rates per capita, consuming around 550 liters per person, per day (compared to an average of 310 liters in the US, 150 liters in Hong Kong, and 144 liters in the European Union). Most of this isn\u2019t used as drinking water, but in agriculture and landscaping, and the country\u2019s green spaces use copious amounts of water. For example, Dubai Miracle Garden \u2014 a 72,000-square-meter park displaying 150 million live flowers \u2014\u00a0consumes 757,000 liters (200,000 US gallons) of water every day. \u201cDubai presents a unique set of challenges: its rapid growth, diverse population, urban sprawl, and extreme climate conditions,\u201d Bagherian said. To combat this, Bagherian\u2019s concept includes \u201cwater-sensitive landscape design\u201d that includes native flora and drought-resistant plants suited to the arid climate, and soil mixed with zeolite, an absorbent crystal that aids water retention. These \u201cpassive techniques\u201d are complemented with smart irrigation technology, he added, \u201cwhich use real-time data to adjust watering schedules based on soil moisture levels, weather forecasts, and plant needs.\u201d An urban utopia This isn\u2019t URB\u2019s first foray into utopian future city design. Its proposal for \u201cDubai Mangroves\u201d \u2014 which it claims will be \u201cworld\u2019s largest coastal regeneration project\u201d if it goes ahead \u2014 was revealed earlier this year, and last year, it also proposed a 93-kilometer indoor cycling \u201csuperhighway\u201d called The Loop that could help residents in the emirate go car-free. Like the Green Spine, none of these designs have been confirmed. But Bagherian says that turning these conceptual designs into a reality isn\u2019t as tough as it looks. \u201cWhen you break down the components of the project, you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s nothing new from a technological, structural, or material standpoint,\u201d he said, adding that the innovation lies in how these technologies are \u201ccreatively and seamlessly integrated to address multiple needs.\u201d The next step involves getting public sector entities onboard, to provide \u201cthe necessary support, regulatory framework, and infrastructure integration to bring this ambitious project to life,\u201d Bagherian said. He\u2019s optimistic that this will happen, as the project aligns with the government\u2019s 2040 Urban Master Plan, and creative urban planning is key to fulfilling those goals. \u201cDubai is uniquely positioned to make this project a reality,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/dubai-designs-worlds-greenest-highway-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

They were known as pious and prominent members of the community. While people knew they had connections to Hamas, neighbors say no one could have guessed how deep those links truly went. When Israeli forces stormed the Aljamals\u2019 building on June 8 they found Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv, hostages who had been captured from the Nova music festival on October 7, cowering in a darkened room. The experience of the three men \u2013 alongside that of Noa Argamani who was held in another house nearby, belonging to the Abu Nar family \u2013 echoes testimony from previously released hostages. They describe being confined among the civilian population, rather than in Hamas\u2019 vast tunnel network under Gaza. In the aftermath of last month\u2019s rescue, neighbors in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, told CNN they were shocked to learn that Ahmed Aljamal, a physician, and his family had kept hostages in their midst. \u201cHad we known, had he told us, we would have taken safety precautions, hide or move to somewhere else,\u201d one neighbor, Abu Muhammad El Tahrawi, said. Dr. Aljamal, 74, was a general practitioner and also led the call to prayer at the local mosque, waking early every day to get there before dawn. \u201cHe was a pious man,\u201d neighbor Abdelrahman El Tahrawi said. \u201cHe leads the prayer, then he goes back to his home. He didn\u2019t mix with people, didn\u2019t complain about other people, and no one complained about him. He was a man who minded his own business.\u201d Dr. Aljamal\u2019s son Abdallah, 36, was a freelance journalist who most recently wrote for the US-based Palestine Chronicle, for which he filed regular dispatches on the war in Gaza. Neighbors told CNN it was no secret that the family had links to Hamas. \u201cWe were worried about the Aljamal house. They are with Hamas,\u201d said a neighbor and family acquaintance. Abdallah had served as a spokesman for Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Labor as recently as 2022, a position entrusted only to Hamas members, according to political analysts. He also showed his support for the group on social media. On Facebook, he posted pictures of his young son dressed in the fatigues of Hamas\u2019 armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, and on October 7 openly praised the group\u2019s attack on Israel. In a 2022 video post, Abdallah commended the Hamas operation to kidnap Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was held in Gaza between 2006 and 2011, and proclaimed: \u201cBrothers, all of us are prepared to die for the resistance.\u201d Public support for Hamas as a political movement in Gaza has ranged from 34 to 42% over the past seven months, according to polls by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research.\u00a0Polling in Gaza faces multiple challenges, including population displacement, people\u2019s reluctance to criticize Hamas publicly and the risks to personal safety in war time. The true level of support for Hamas may be lower, according to Dr. Mkhaimar Abusada, associate professor of Political Science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, who is now based in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. A higher proportion of Gazans are more broadly supportive of armed resistance, the polling suggests, despite more than nine months of war that has obliterated the strip. Some people who were not affiliated with Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups took part in the October 7 incursion into southern Israel, streaming through the border fence after it was breached by fighters \u2013 some stealing from Israeli communities and others taking hostages back into Gaza. At least 1,200 people were killed and\u00a0some 250 people in total were taken from Israel into the strip, according to Israeli authorities. A senior Hamas official last month told CNN the group does not know how many hostages are still alive, suggesting it may not have full oversight of their whereabouts. Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz told an Israeli TV channel that Israel knows to a \u201cvery close number\u201d how many hostages remain alive. Despite the level of support in Gaza for Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007, far fewer people would be accepted into the trusted inner circles of the Islamist movement. Hostages being held by civilians under the direction of Hamas is unlikely unless they have very strong ties to and are well trusted by the group, according to Abusada. \u201cHamas only trusts Hamas when it comes to those very sensitive issues such as Israeli hostages,\u201d he said. There may be other reasons why Hamas chose to house hostages in civilian homes, however. Hussein Ibish, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said that approach fits Hamas\u2019 strategy to get Israel \u201cbogged down in the urban centers of Gaza and push them into a counterinsurgency that cannot end, which is the perpetual war Hamas says it wants.\u201d \u2018Creative punishment\u2019 The three hostages who were held in the Aljamal family building were kept there for around six months, according to Andrey Kozlov, who spoke last week to CNN. Kozlov described physical and psychological abuse he received at the hands of his guards. One in particular, he said, \u201cwas a big fan of creative punishment\u201d who on one occasion forced him to spend two days on a mattress without moving or talking as a penalty for standing near an open window, and on another occasion covered him with blankets in the summer heat for washing his hands with drinking water. \u201cI was trying to breathe through the space between the mattress and blankets,\u201d he said. During that time the hostages could hear the family, including children, going about their daily lives on the floor below, according to Aviram Meir, the uncle of Almog Meir Jan. In the weeks before Israel\u2019s hostage raid, the Aljamal family had been continuing as usual, outwardly at least, and Abdallah\u2019s most recent article for the Palestine Chronicle was published just the day before. Then, on the morning of June 8, Israeli forces stormed Nuseirat. Zainab Aljamal, Abdallah\u2019s sister, who was in the family house at the time of the raid, wrote a Facebook post that day describing what happened. The Israeli soldiers entered and shot Abdallah\u2019s wife Fatima first, before killing Ahmed and Abdallah, she wrote. Zainab hid with Abdallah\u2019s children under a bed, according to the now-deleted Facebook post which was shared with CNN by independent open-source researcher Thomas Bordeaux. \ufeffZainab said in the post that the family had been waiting for the moment they would be killed by Israeli forces. \u201cSince the start of the war, we have been waiting for this moment. We did not know how it would come and in what horrific way it would happen, but we were aware that it would inevitably come.\u201d As the three hostages were rescued from the Aljamal house, around 200 meters (650 feet) away Israeli forces carried out a simultaneous raid on a second apartment block \u2013 which was home to the Abu Nar family, according to Israeli officials \u2013 to retrieve Argamani. Argamani had become one of the most recognized Israeli hostages when widely circulated footage showed her being hoisted onto the back of a motorcycle and driven away from the Nova music festival on October 7 as her partner was seized and made to walk with his hands behind his back. Less is known about Argamani\u2019s captors. Her family members told Israeli media she had been held by a relatively well-off family who made Argamani wash dishes for the household, reportedly telling her she was lucky to be held by them as other hostages were experiencing much worse. In a video released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that shows Argamani\u2019s rescue, troops are seen inside an apartment on the upper floor of a building, passing a small kitchen. The Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office told CNN she was held by the Abu Nar family but did not provide further details. According to unofficial lists of those killed circulated on Arabic-language media and social media, Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar died alongside his wife and child in Israel\u2019s\u00a0 Nuseirat operation last month. Three relatives of Abu Nar also posted on social media announcing he had been killed by Israeli forces that day. CNN cannot independently confirm whether Abu Nar was involved in holding Argamani and his relatives have not responded to requests for comment. \u2018A normal man\u2019 Neighbors of the Abu Nar house in Nuseirat told CNN they saw Israeli special forces enter and leave the building without much of a fight. Bilal Mazhar, a 16-year-old student, said his window was opposite the window of the apartment in which Argamani was being held, just half a meter away, but he never saw any sign of her presence until Israeli forces brought her out. \u201cThey pulled her out normally and no one intervened, and there was no shooting at them,\u201d Mazhar said. Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar seemed to share very little online about his life, and local people were reluctant to share many details about the Abu Nar family, but they did express surprise and concern that a hostage had been held in their midst. \u201cHe had young children at home,\u201d said Khalil Al-Kahlot, a civil servant in Gaza. \u201cNo one would expect him to hold a hostage like this, in homes and among people.\u201d Al-Kahlot, who told CNN he\u2019d been in Nuseirat for the past four months, said Mohamed Ahmed was \u201cordinary\u201d and \u201ca normal man,\u201d adding that he had never suspected he was affiliated with Hamas. \u201cThey are people in Hamas, but we did not know that,\u201d said another neighbor of the Abu Nar family. \u201cIf we had known there was something there, no one would have stayed in the area.\u201d After Israeli forces evacuated the hostages, airstrikes hit both of the buildings they were rescued from and now only rubble remains at each site. More than 270 Palestinians were killed in Nuseirat on June 8, according to Gaza health ministry officials, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between militants and civilians, and hundreds more were injured. Israel puts the number of deaths at under 100. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures. Many locals questioned why so many Palestinians had to die for the Israeli forces to rescue just four hostages. Al-Kahlot said: \u201cPeople died because they were freeing her, and no one was looking at us.\u201d CNN is not identifying some interviewees for their own security.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_19_world_school-uniforms-africa-education-cnnheroes", "text": "Sometimes, a book can have a life-changing impact. For Payton McGriff, that turned out to be true. McGriff was a sophomore at the University of Idaho when she read Half the Sky, which examines the oppression of women in developing countries. She was shocked to learn that 129 million girls worldwide are not enrolled in school. \u201cIn much of the world, women and girls are responsible for the lion\u2019s share of household duties and so a woman\u2019s perceived value is what she can contribute to the home,\u201d said McGriff, now 29. \u201cIt\u2019s seen that girls won\u2019t ever be putting (their) education to use.\u201d Additionally, many impoverished families who want to educate their daughters can\u2019t afford tuition fees, school supplies, and the uniform mandated in many countries. \u201cA uniform is typically one of the more expensive pieces,\u201d McGriff said. \u201cThey can be one of the most cost-effective ways to keep girls in school.\u201d Studies have shown that providing free uniforms can reduce dropout rates by 16 percent and absenteeism by more than 35 percent. This simple solution took root in McGriff\u2019s mind and started her journey helping women and girls transform their lives. Today, her nonprofit, Style Her Empowered \u2013 known as SHE \u2013 provides 1,500 girls a year in the African country of Togo with free uniforms, school fees, supplies, tutoring, and much more. More than a college project A marketing major, McGriff was pursuing her dream job in business when she took an entrepreneurship class her senior year. Tasked with creating a business or nonprofit for a class project, she remembered the notion of the school uniform and developed an idea. She sought feedback from Romuald Afatchao, a professor from Togo, and he encouraged her to join a spring break trip to his hometown of N\u00f4tse to do field research. There, McGriff saw the reality of what girls faced. She met Elolo, a young woman who started her chores at 3:30 a.m. so she could attend school and did homework by streetlight at night since her house had no electricity. Her family\u2019s financial struggles meant she eventually had to quit school so her brothers could continue. \u201cIt made all of the stories that you read in the book so real,\u201d McGriff said. \u201cTalent and resilience and resourcefulness is so equally distributed worldwide, but opportunity is not.\u201d McGriff interviewed groups of girls about obstacles that made attending school difficult. They mentioned a lack of money and support, but when she asked about uniforms, the reaction was immediate. \u201cEvery girl stood up and raised her hand so high and, not only that, told a very expressive story about how she had been shamed out of school because she didn\u2019t have her uniform,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized, \u2018Okay, this is a place to start.\u2019\u201d McGriff returned home, pitched her education project at entrepreneurship competitions, won $35,000 in seed money, and eventually turned down her dream job to bring her vision to life. She graduated in May 2017 and returned to Togo. The \u2018uniform that grows\u2019 That first year, the group hired local seamstresses and provided uniforms and school fees to 65 girls. But they soon ran into a problem. \u201cWe realized a problem that probably every parent on the planet would find obvious,\u201d McGriff said. \u201cOur students were outgrowing them very quickly.\u201d Her team wanted to create an adjustable uniform that could last students longer but couldn\u2019t find patterns that worked. Eventually, the seamstresses \u2013 with input from the students, McGriff, and others \u2013 designed their own solution, and the uniform that grows was born. The dress now has adjustable cords running along the side that create a tailored fit for every body type, while extra fabric hemmed underneath enables it to grow up to a foot in length. The uniform can fit a girl for up to three years, adjusting six sizes; when finally outgrown, it can be handed down to younger girls. What\u2019s more, 100% of the fabric scraps are recycled into reusable menstrual pads made by SHE seamstresses and distributed to the students, who previously stayed home from school during their period because they lacked sanitary supplies. Empowering girls and elevating women Today, SHE serves girls in N\u00f4tse as well as 20 rural villages in southern Togo, where 69 percent of households live below the poverty line. Girls in these areas are at a higher risk to drop out of school, so SHE strives to remove all financial barriers by also providing tuition fees and school supplies. Once enrolled, students receive weekly tutoring sessions. As a result, SHE\u2019s students consistently pass their exams at higher rates than the national average. \u201cOur students have increased their proficiency and performance in school dramatically,\u201d McGriff said. \u201cIf given the opportunity, they thrive.\u201d SHE continues to develop new ways of supporting their students. The group recently created a mobile learning lab that brings books and supplies to under-resourced communities, as well as afterschool Girls Clubs where student ambassadors are trained to run workshops for their peers. \u201cIt\u2019s all (done) with this tone of empowering girls and helping girls to understand their rights and their opportunities in society,\u201d she said. \u201cWe see our students really start to blossom.\u201d McGriff also brings opportunities to the women that SHE employs. Twenty seamstresses work full-time at the group\u2019s two factories, and their average salary is 75 percent higher than Togo\u2019s minimum wage. All employees get generous benefits, like unlimited paid sick leave, three-months paid maternity leave, and free childcare. And that\u2019s not all. On average, women in Togo only have around three years of education \u2013 about half that of men \u2013 and 55 percent are illiterate. When McGriff realized that most of the group\u2019s seamstresses had little formal education, she started a \u2018paid to learn\u2019 program to help teach them basic literacy, math, and financial skills. The seamstresses also travel to the villages with other staffers to help distribute uniforms and school supplies. They\u2019re proud of their role in helping girls get opportunities they didn\u2019t have. \u201cWatching them flourish is really just \u2026 incredibly inspiring,\u201d McGriff said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re part of SHE, you\u2019re part of this movement.\u201d Locals taking the lead McGriff supervises the project remotely from Idaho, ensuring that the local women who run the program in Togo take the lead in shaping the organization. Eventually, McGriff hopes SHE can become self-sustaining so her role can be further reduced, which has been her goal from the beginning. \u201cThe vision for starting SHE was always for it to become locally led because local women understand the challenges and the solutions far better than I ever could,\u201d she said. \u201cI may have struck the original match that started SHE. But what I\u2019m so beyond inspired by is watching our team carry the torch.\u201d One important member of that team is Elolo, who McGriff met on her first visit to Togo. Elolo was the first girl enrolled in the program, eventually graduated from high school, and is now the group\u2019s Assistant Director and has recruited hundreds of girls to SHE. What\u2019s more, with her salary, she\u2019s been able to care for her family and install electricity in their home. Her success makes McGriff beam with pride. \u201cElolo is just the epitome of when you educate a girl, you educate a community,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is a role model for every girl in our program who can see themselves in her.\u201d McGriff eventually hopes to replicate SHE worldwide. Although she\u2019s thousands of miles away from the women she works with, she feels a strong sense of connection to them. \u201cWe are so bonded by this incredible work that we get to do together,\u201d McGriff said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching each other explore our full potential. \u2026 It\u2019s so girl power. It\u2019s so fun.\u201d Want to get involved? Check out the Style Her Empowered website and see how to help.

In 2016, two young Russians known for their extreme \u201crooftopping\u201d adventures \u2014 where they attempt to illegally climb vertiginous landmarks like La Sagrada Familia and the Eiffel Tower \u2014 skipped the perfunctory happy hour cocktail and instead ascended China\u2019s tallest incomplete skyscraper, the 1,957-foot-high Goldin Finance 117. At the time, Ivan Beerkus and Angela Nikolau didn\u2019t know they\u2019d end up together. Beerkus had invited Nikolau, a rare female member of the rooftopping community (she was scaling the proverbial glass wall before breaking it), to join him for the climb to produce sponsored social media posts. But it was the beginning of a long romantic and creative partnership, which has led them to travel thousands of miles\u00a0\u2014 and thousands of feet in the air \u2014 together. Eight years later, the documentary film \u201cSkywalkers: A Love Story\u201d takes an intimate look at their unusual romance through hundreds of hours of footage that, of course, includes heart-dropping POV footage from impossible heights and the occasional run-in with law enforcement. Like all couples, Beerkus and Nikolau have their ups and downs, and when they argue the stakes are a just bit higher than most (in one scene, Beerkus\u00a0bravely accuses his girlfriend of being \u201ctoo negative\u201d as she gears up to nail a precarious acrobatic pose literally above the clouds). Through the pair\u2019s unusual lifestyles, \u201cSkywalkers\u201d becomes a meditation on trust and commitment, though their stunts will also get your palms sweaty, if that\u2019s your thing. Directed by Jeff Zimbalist, a filmmaker with rooftopping experience of his own, and co-directed by Maria Bukhonina, \u201dSkywalkers\u201d debuted at Sundance Film Festival in January and is now streaming on Netflix. It follows the couple, who utilize Nikolau\u2019s background as a trained gymnast to create acrobatic stunts on narrow ledges, poles and scaffolding, as they take on increasingly difficult challenges and navigate their own budding relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the fear of falling from heights, but more about the fear of falling in love,\u201d Zimbalist said in a video call with CNN. \u201cAngela first told me that they were\u2026 competitors and rivals. But you could sense under the surface that there was this bubbling flirtation there.\u201d An architectural dare As the documentary progresses, the pair plot out their most difficult climb yet: Kuala Lumpur\u2019s Merdeka 118, the world\u2019s second-tallest building. The gleaming 2,227-foot-tall tower, which opened earlier this year, is crowned with a 527-foot-tall spire whose apex is only accessible via a narrow internal ladder. In 2022, when Beerkus and Nikolau made their plans, the \u201csupertall\u201d skyscraper had topped out but was still under construction. Evading security and reaching its apogee safely required an intense and elaborate scheme \u2014 one conjured while they worked through relationship issues. (At the time of their climb, the tower\u2019s owner said police were investigating the pair for trespassing, although Malaysian authorities did not respond to CNN about whether further legal action was taken.) Rooftopping is a contentious pastime \u2014 both for the danger it poses and participants\u2019 reliance on illegal trespassing.  With the urban \u201csport\u201d emerging as one more of the more extreme ways to get likes on social media, several harrowing deaths have followed. For \u201cSkywalkers\u201d the film crew followed Beerkus and Nikolau to document their stunts, but only to a point. Zimbalist emphasized his team\u2019s safety measures, which were designed to ensure the crew neither endangered themselves nor presented any distractions for the couple. \u201cWe talked a lot with Ivan and Angela, saying, \u2018Please, don\u2019t go do anything additionally crazy beyond what you would usually do,\u2019\u201d Zimbalist said. \u201cBecause to us, this isn\u2019t a movie about whether or not you succeed at Merdeka or any other climb\u2026 the genuine suspense here is if you choose to trust each other.\u201d An \u2018expanded state of mind\u2019 For the couple, rooftopping isn\u2019t just about thrill-seeking. Nikolau, the daughter of circus performers, says in the film that pushing herself to her limits was engrained from childhood and that she is always striving to better herself. For Beerkus, who scaled buildings alone in Moscow for years, rooftopping offers a sense of mental clarity. \u201cThe higher I went, the easier it was to breathe,\u201d he says to camera, recalling his earliest climbs. \u201cThis extreme life, this expanded state of mind, it\u2019s essential for me.\u201d Zimbalist recognizes the dangers of rooftopping and says his film is not\u00a0 about\u00a0\u201cdefending what they do against critics.\u201d Instead, he hope that \u201dSkywalkers,\u201d in addition to its message on love and trust, provides a rare look at the hard work and planning behind the rooftoppers\u2019 \u201cpolished\u201d social media posts. \u201cWith any activity that\u2019s dangerous, social media tends to disguise the difficulty,\u201d he said. \u201cTelling the story behind a stunt helps to give context and just how challenging and how dangerous some of these things are.\u201d Believe it or not, Nikolau maintains that she is afraid of heights, something she has had to confront repeatedly to keep up with her chosen line of work. \u201cThe fear never really went away; I just got better and better at facing it,\u201d she explains in one clip. So while the makers of \u201cSkywalkers\u201d would probably rather you don\u2019t climb your nearest skyscraper, their film encourages us to dare \u2014 and say \u201cyes\u201d to the thing that scares us the most. \u201cSkywalkers: A Love Story\u201d is available to watch on Netflix Add to Queue: Such great heights WATCH: \u201cFree Solo\u201d (2018) If you prefer watching daring feats on rock cliffs instead of skyscrapers, this Academy Award-winning documentary by filmmaker Chai Vasarhelyi and photographer-mountaineer Jimmy Chin follows climber Alex Honnold as he prepares to summit Yosemite\u2019s very vertical 3,000-foot-tall rock formation, El Capitan, without a rope or a harness.

{"id": "2024_07_18_tech_att-cyberattacks-data-privacy-laws", "text": "This week, AT&T notified millions of customers that their data was likely stolen in an April leak that the company disclosed earlier this month. Meanwhile, comprehensive laws that would protect customers from hacks keep struggling to pass, as AT&T and its rivals have fought back against and heavily influenced a patchwork of data laws \u2013 arguing the approach has failed to rein in the problem. AT&T customers\u2019 pilfered information was so valuable to cybercriminals that the FBI asked the company to delay filing a disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission because of potential national security and public safety concerns. The data was breached from \u201cnearly all\u201d of AT&T\u2019s cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that used its network between May 1, 2022, and October 31, 2022. It\u2019s not the first time \u2013 even this year \u2013 that AT&T has been breached. The company was already grappling with an unrelated data leak that took place in March. At that time, AT&T said personal information, such as Social Security numbers on 73 million current and former customers, was released onto the dark web. Consumer advocates and some lawmakers have long argued for more protection of customer data. Though state laws have passed across almost 20 states, \u00a0the patchwork of regulations across states and agencies that regulates data privacy, can lead to inconsistencies, contradictions and lacunae. Complicating things further, lobbies from Big Tech to phone carriers have been heavily influencing many of these state and local regulation efforts. In a statement, AT&T said, \u201cWe have long supported a comprehensive federal privacy policy protecting all Americans that applies across the internet ecosystem. We continue to believe that a federal privacy policy should establish a consistent set of protections, enforced by a single regulator, for all consumers.\u201d Lobbies are at the \u2018crux of the problem\u2019 Keepers of private information like who you texted, what you\u2019re watching \u2013 in addition to your address and Social Security number \u2013 makes telecom companies\u2019 data a high-value target. \u00a0That could be invaluable data for phishing and targeted scam attempts. The data phone carriers hold is \u201cthe gateway into everything else on the internet,\u201d Dominic Sellitto, a cyber security professor at University at Buffalo, said. \u201cEvery communication that we have, everything goes through a telecom provider or internet service provider.\u201d And that wealth of data draws hackers. \u201cThese larger companies, because of their size and the treasure trove of data, certainly have a target on their backs,\u201d Sellitto noted. They\u2019re not alone: In just the past year, large cyberattacks have frozen car dealerships and delayed ambulances. Currently, data privacy laws exist in 19 states covering at least 150 million Americans, though differing in scale and scope. There are federal regulations on specific areas of privacy, like laws covering medical data or information about children, and agencies like the FCC regulate telecommunications. But there is no large, comprehensive data privacy law at the federal level, and many state laws are basically written by industries through their lobbyists, said Alan Butler, executive director and president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \u201cThe crux of the problem in legislating telecoms is the lobbyists and their effectiveness over many, many decades,\u201d said Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath. Cybersecurity and data privacy go hand in hand. The heaviest proposed regulation would impose data minimization rules \u2014 meaning if companies collected less data, there would be less available for hackers to steal in the first place. There would also be stricter data security and notification rules if a hack does happen. It\u2019s unclear whether those rules would have prevented AT&T\u2019s hacks or better protected their customers. But consumer advocates have lambasted the telecom industry for getting in the way of more comprehensive laws. Trade groups stressed that realistic privacy laws have had success passing through many states. \u201cIn the absence of workable federal data privacy legislation, our multi-sector coalition is proud to have been one of many stakeholders that have worked on a comprehensive privacy framework that now covers well over 100 million Americans and has received overwhelming bipartisan support across state legislatures with dramatically different political dynamics,\u201d Andrew Kingman, counsel to the State Privacy and Security Coalition said in a statement. Industry trade groups say that while cyber security and data privacy can be interrelated, there is tension between those concepts that might not be fully covered in a data privacy law. What it\u2019s like trying to pass data privacy laws When Collin Walke, a data privacy and cybersecurity attorney, was in the Oklahoma House, he focused on data privacy legislation. After California passed its landmark data privacy law in 2018, he attempted to get similar legislation passed in his state. \u201cWe had lobbyists from Amazon. We had lobbyists from Google. We had all of that. But the number one impediment to us getting it passed in Oklahoma was AT&T and Verizon,\u201d Walke said to CNN. Verizon declined to comment. In a statement, Amazon said it supports \u201cU.S. federal privacy legislation that requires transparency, access to one\u2019s own personal information, and the ability to delete personal information, and prohibits the sale of personal data without consent. In the absence of congressional action, we support well-crafted state laws that protect consumers\u2019 privacy, while continuing to allow for innovation.\u201d Monica Priestley, a state representative in Vermont, said lobbyists from across industries \u201ccame out in full force at the last minute,\u201d even hosting webinars and calls at the town or city level, against a landmark privacy bill this year. One lobby, the State Privacy & Security Coalition, represents AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Meta, as well as automobile, healthcare and payment card companies. The Vermont governor vetoed the bill in June, which would have been one of the strongest in the country. Industry trade groups said that the ability to sue companies for data violations and strict data minimization requirements would have been too costly for Vermont small businesses to comply to. \u201cThe hardest part about these bills is they are so technical in nature, and the industry tends to hand the state a policy and encourage them to run with that,\u201d Priestley said. \u201cIndustries created this monster that is out of control, and they themselves are at risk. And something\u2019s got to change.\u201d Why doesn\u2019t a national privacy law exist? Advocates say Big Tech lobbies and telecommunications lobbies have shifted their focus from squashing the federal conversation to getting deeply involved at the state level. \u201cA national law puts everyone on a level playing field,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cIt establishes the baseline of what good looks like for these critical infrastructure providers, including telecommunications companies, and then it gives the government a standard to enforce.\u201d Advocates for a sweeping law say the average consumer shouldn\u2019t have to parse dense user agreements to find out what is going on with their data. In a statement, AT&T said, \u201cOur customers can manage how we use and share their information for certain activities including advertising and marketing, and can opt out at any time.\u201d But tighter regulations mean companies must spend more resources beefing up their cybersecurity. Companies also lobby against allowing individuals to sue for damages. A lot of a telecommunication company\u2019s business is rooted in the data brokerage market, multiple privacy experts told CNN. And it\u2019s valuable data. \u201cLike many other industries, the telecommunications industry sees the commercialization of data for advertising uses as an additional revenue source,\u201d Butler said. In April, the FCC fined AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon nearly $200 million for illegally sharing customers\u2019 personal data without their consent. The fines stem from allegations in 2020 by the Federal Communications Commission that for years, the companies had improperly shared users\u2019 geolocation histories to third parties, including to prisons, as part of their commercial programs. In response to the FCC fines, all of the wireless carriers said they expect to appeal the decision. The FCC is also not the only regulator for telecom companies, which can be giant entities. \u201cIt\u2019s a very opaque space that is begging for clarity, and that clarity can only come through regulation,\u201d Noonan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/tech/att-cyberattacks-data-privacy-laws/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_16_middleeast_israel-hamas-hostages-idf-images-released-intl-latam", "text": "The families of five female Israeli soldiers kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 have released photographs from their early days in captivity, urging Israel\u2019s government to reach a deal that would secure the release of those still held in Gaza. The women were Israel Defense Forces (IDF) observers stationed at an Israeli military base at Nahal Oz, which was stormed by Hamas militant groups during their attack on Israel last year. The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said the families of the observers \u2013 Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, Liri Albag, Naama Levy and Karina Ariev \u2013 have decided to allow the publication of photos taken during their first days being held by the militant group. \u201cThe images reveal them bruised and wounded from the horrific abduction that the entire world witnessed,\u201d the forum said. In the pictures, Levy appears to have a badly bruised right eye. Another image shows four of the women sitting on bedding in a bare room; two of them, Gilboa and Ariev, have bandaged heads. \u201cThe courageous decision by the parents to reveal these photos aims to bring them closer to embracing their daughters,\u201d they said. Graphic video showing the capture of the group was previously released in May by their families. Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 250 captured and taken hostage in the enclave. Following the attack,\u00a0Israel\u00a0launched a war in Gaza that has killed\u00a0more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. \u201cThis reunion is just a deal away, a deal that would bring all 120 hostages home \u2013 the living for rehabilitation and the murdered and fallen for proper burial,\u201d the forum said in its Tuesday statement. \u201cWe demand that the Israeli government, and particularly its leader, look these girls in the eyes, try to imagine what they and all the hostages have endured for 284 days, and do everything possible to bring them home.\u201d Albert Ariev, the father of Karina Ariev, told a news conference that accompanied the release: \u201cMy little Karina, only 19 years old, is in Gaza. Today, you see footage of Karina and her friends in their first days of captivity. It\u2019s so vivid \u2013 Karina sitting on a mattress on the floor, with an exhausted and desperate look.\u201d \u201cSwelling in her hands indicates that Karina was bound for a long time. You see one frame, but in the video, you can see facial wounds likely caused by shrapnel when the terrorists invaded the shelter,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we are asking for is to have Karina back. There are also dead people there that need to be buried. The people demand that they all come back.\u201d Ariev urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: \u201cPlease don\u2019t go abroad before this deal goes ahead.\u201d Netanyahu is under intense pressure to secure the release of more than 100 hostages still believed to be held by Hamas. Earlier Tuesday, he met with the families of other observers who were killed at the base, close to the northern Gaza Strip, which was overrun in Hamas\u2019 attack last October, with 16 soldiers killed. The prime minister\u2019s office said the meeting lasted three hours.

{"id": "travel_mediterranean-beach-vacation-microplastics-pollution", "text": "The Mediterranean Sea may evoke images of luxurious beach holidays, scrumptious seafood meals and endless sandy beaches, but this body of water is increasingly toxic. More than 87% of the Mediterranean Sea, which extends from the Atlantic Ocean to Africa, Europe and Asia, is polluted with microplastics and other pollutants including toxic metals and industrial chemicals, according to a July 2024 report by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Globally, water pollution is tied to 1.4 million premature deaths, which spells trouble for the 150 million people who live along the Mediterranean coastline, and the 270 million tourists who are drawn to these waters every single year. The Mediterranean Sea laps up against 46,000 kilometers (nearly 29,000 miles) of coastline in 22 countries, many with different environmental standards and practices. Egypt, which contributes 0.25 million tons of plastic that ends up in the Mediterranean, is the worst offender, the group says, followed by Turkey, which contributes 0.11 million tons and Italy, which contributes 0.04 million tons of plastic to the polluted sea \u2013 all part of the 1.9 million plastic fragments per square meter. Medical experts consulted for the WWF report say that humans can ingest microplastics from aquatic environments through the consumption of marine organisms and through water (both drinking and bottled). \u201cOver 840 microplastics can be ingested per year from the consumption of three main commercial fish species (sea bass and two types of mackerel), [and] up to 11 thousand from the high consumption of bivalves (e.g. mussels, clams etc.),\u201d the report states, noting that less contamination comes from eating shrimp. \u201cIf we also count the exposure from air and food not coming from aquatic environments we can ingest over 100 thousand microplastics every day.\u201d Turning the tide At the seaside town of Ostia near Rome, Pierluigi Capozzi scans the sea from his restaurant, Mediterraneo. \u201cMaybe 50 years ago, people didn\u2019t know what we know now about pollution and plastic,\u201d he tells CNN. \u201cBut I see young people without any problems throw plastic bottles into the sea, throw rubbish on the ground, cigarettes, garbage.\u201d But he does see a bright spot. A decade ago, every morning the sand outside his beachfront restaurant was covered with chemicals from the cargo ships that traverse the shipping lanes visible from the coastline. \u201cThanks to better regulation, that chemical pollution is gone now,\u201d he says. The Mediterranean is one of the world\u2019s major reservoirs of marine and coastal diversity, according to the Med Sea Alliance, which works to advocate for the fishing industry through better practices. They say that the heavy pollution is negatively impacting the sea\u2019s rich flora and fauna. Despite only covering 0.7 percent of the world\u2019s ocean area, the sea has 7.5 percent of the world\u2019s marine fauna, and 18 percent of the world\u2019s marine flora. Fishing is a \u20ac4.6 billion industry in the Mediterranean, and water pollution has greatly impacted the livelihood of the 180,000 people who rely on fishing for their livelihoods, says the WWF. The UN\u2019s Environmental Program says sea catches in the Mediterranean have fallen by 34% in the last 50 years, due to both over-fishing and plastics in the water. \u201cAround 730 tonnes of plastic waste end up daily in the Mediterranean Sea,\u201d the group says. \u201cPlastic waste represents 95 to 100% of marine floating waste and 50% of litter on sea beds. In tonnage, plastic could outweigh fish stocks.\u201d Impact on marine life A 2023 study by the Archipelago Institute of Marine Conservation in Greece examined 25 marine animals including eight dolphins, two monk seals and 15 sea turtles and found microplastic pollutants in all of them. \u201cIn particular, among other types of plastic, a total of 10,639 microplastic fibers were detected in the gastrointestinal tract of the dead marine mammals and turtles.\u201d Raffaele Marfella, a professor of advanced science at the Vanvitelli University in Naples, says plastic pollution is an urgent global problem that goes beyond harm to the environment. Citing a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, he highlights the link between microplastics\u00a0and nanoplastics known as MNPs and certain cardiovascular diseases. \u201cCurrent knowledge suggests that MNPs can enter the bloodstream through ingestion or inhalation, triggering inflammation and oxidative stress. Over time, chronic exposure to MNPs can accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis and increase the likelihood of cardiovascular events.\u201d Plastic pollution is considered a \u201cforever\u201d pollutant, meaning once it becomes invasive, it is there to stay. Beach-goer Francesco Pacelli told CNN that it breaks his heart when he sees people leaving their garbage and bottles on the water\u2019s edge. \u201cIt is so important to keep a beach clean, the water it is more beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cIn my opinion it is very important, especially for fish, animals with all the plastic that floats around.\u201d If humans don\u2019t do their part to stop the scourge of water pollution, the dream Mediterranean vacation could soon turn into a nightmare.

{"id": "2024_07_21_americas_venezuela-presidential-election-explainer-intl-latam", "text": "Millions of Venezuelans are expected to cast their ballots on Sunday, July 28, in what many see as the most consequential election in the country since strongman leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro came to power more than a decade ago. The vote pits the authoritarian Maduro \u2013 who has overseen unprecedented levels of poverty and emigration from the country \u2013\u00a0against Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia \u2013 a quiet, bird-loving grandfather who has built a strong following despite being the opposition\u2019s third choice after its two preferred candidates were barred from running. But experts warn that the result of the vote may well be contested. Maduro has a habit for clinging to power, they point out: his government has long been accused of rigging votes and the 2018 election that returned Maduro to office was described as illegitimate by an alliance of 14 Latin American nations, Canada and the United States. The populist and the former diplomat Maduro, who took the mantle of the populist Chavismo movement after his predecessor Hugo Chavez\u2019s death in 2013, is seeking his third consecutive six-year term in office.\u00a0His last race was largely boycotted by the opposition. The Organization of American States called that vote a \u201cfarce,\u201d noting that it was \u201cheld with a generalized lack of public freedoms, with outlawed candidates and parties and with electoral authorities lacking any credibility, subject to the executive power.\u201d At campaign events this year \u2013\u00a0usually\u00a0rollicking, dance-filled affairs\u00a0\u2013 Maduro has framed his opponents as \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cmanipulable,\u201d claiming that they would privatize the country\u2019s healthcare and oil industry and \u201cgive away our wealth.\u201d Though under his watch,\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0has seen the rapid collapse of its democracy and nearly eight million of its people flee the country.\u00a0Inflation has soared and food shortages spread as the country\u00a0underwent \u201cthe single largest economic collapse for a non-conflict country in almost half a century,\u201d\u00a0as the International Monetary Fund put it. Gonzalez, a former diplomat, is standing for an opposition coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform. His priorities include taming inflation, currently running at 64% year on year, and restoring trust in the country\u2019s institutions of power, like its judiciary, which is currently stacked with Maduro sympathizers. However, he has not given a roadmap on how he would convince an authoritarian government to voluntarily give up control and lead a democratic transition. In recent weeks, his rallies, alongside\u00a0Maria Corina Machado, the charismatic leader of the opposition coalition who was banned from running for president earlier this year (along with her fellow leader Corina Yoris), have drawn staggering crowd sizes, including parts of the population long devoted to Chavismo.\u00a0The pair have promised to build a country that can welcome home the millions of Venezuelans who have left in droves in recent years out of economic desperation. Several other candidates are also running, but they have minimal support and are viewed by the main opposition as government allies. According to Oswaldo Ram\u00edrez, the managing director of ORC Consultores, the opposition has found support in \u201cnearly every corner of the country.\u201d \u201cThe electoral energy is back in the streets of Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cNever in the years since this political era began has the opposition had a voting intention that favored it in such a broad way.\u201d Will the election be fair? Twenty-five years after Ch\u00e1vez brought his socialist vision to the halls of power in Caracas, the election marks a rare opportunity for Venezuelans to remake the country \u2013 if Maduro is willing to relinquish control in a defeat. But analysts point to Maduro\u2019s history of alleged election meddling in suggesting he is unlikely to go down quietly. \u201cThis could be the last best shot for Venezuela for a long time to restore democracy,\u201d said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe level of fraud that (the Maduro government) is going to necessitate is going to be so obvious to all that there\u2019s no way they can move forward credibly with the election. They\u2019re going to be caught with their hand in the cookie jar.\u201d The ruling party has already been interfering with the election for months. In January, Machado was\u00a0barred from holding public office\u00a0for 15 years by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Court.\u00a0The US said the decision\u00a0flew in the face of a\u00a02023\u00a0pledge the Venezuelan government had made\u00a0to hold free and fair elections.\u00a0Gonzalez was made the candidate after Machado\u2019s\u00a0designated replacement Yoris was similarly blocked from running. Maduro\u2019s government has meanwhile claimed to have thwarted a string of dubious opposition-backed plots to\u00a0sabotage public infrastructure\u00a0and interfere with the election.\u00a0Analysts see those as the seeds of a pretext that Maduro could use to postpone or cancel the election at the last minute. Experts\u00a0warn Maduro could\u00a0also\u00a0move to provoke a military crisis with neighboring Guyana after he and his supporters scaled up their threats to annex an oil-rich piece of that country\u2019s land. Some have speculated that Maduro could use the crisis as an excuse to suspend the election. Maduro\u2019s government has also been accused of trying to sow confusion ahead of election day, including by\u00a0renaming some 6,000 schools, places that typically serve as polling stations. The government has also created significant impediments for the Venezuelans who left the country to vote, including widely unattainable passport and residency requirements, election experts said. How will the vote play out? There are more than 21 million registered voters in Venezuela, including about 17 million people currently living in the country. A limited group of election observers,\u00a0including a team from The Carter Center \u2013 a non-profit organization set up by former US President Jimmy Carter \u2013 will be on the ground to monitor the vote after Venezuelan authorities revoked an invitation in May for the European Union to send a delegation, citing the bloc\u2019s sanctions on the country. But the options for the opposition and the international community are limited if Maduro refuses to cede power, Berg, of CSIS, said.\u00a0\u201cThe opposition can get out in the streets, they can mobilize, they can demand certain things, but if the regime gets in and they have the firepower behind them to repress as we\u2019ve seen in other instances under Maduro, it could get very ugly,\u201d he said. If the opposition does clinch victory, a transition period of six months is likely to include an intense negotiation around amnesty for Maduro and members of his government, which analysts say he is certain to require ahead of any potential handover. Maduro currently faces\u00a0drug trafficking and corruption charges\u00a0in the US and is under investigation for\u00a0crimes against humanity\u00a0by the International Criminal Court. Machado has indicated in recent months\u00a0that the opposition has expressed willingness to the Venezuelan government to establish a \u201cserious negotiation with guarantees\u201d for Maduro and his allies \u2013\u00a0should Maduro and his ruling Socialist United Party of Venezuela step aside in the face of defeat. \u201cWe know the responsibility we have with history, and if there are feelings that animate this process, it is about reunification, coexistence, and justice, never about revenge and persecution,\u201d Machado said earlier this month.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/americas/venezuela-presidential-election-explainer-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

A two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been US policy for decades, but absent negotiations between the two sides, and a lack of sustained effort by the US to make it happen, means faith in such an outcome has dwindled. On Wednesday evening, the Israeli parliament made clear its position, voting by 68 to 9 to reject any creation of a Palestinian state. \u201cThe Knesset of Israel firmly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state west of the Jordan (river). The establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of the Land of Israel would pose an existential danger to the State of Israel and its citizens, perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilize the region,\u201d the declaration read. Among those who backed it was Benny Gantz, an opponent of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Gantz\u2019s vote serves as a blow to those in Washington who see him as someone more inclined to seek a negotiated peace with Palestinians if he ever became Israel\u2019s leader. Instead, the resolution was \u201ca signal to the international community that pressure to impose a Palestinian state on Israel is futile,\u201d leader of the right-wing opposition \u2018New Hope\u2019 party, Gideon Saar, said, according to the Haaretz newspaper. The Palestinian Authority foreign ministry condemned the Knesset vote, saying it was time \u201cthe international consensus on the two-state solution (was) translated into practical steps to resolve the conflict \u2026 before it is too late.\u201d The Biden administration, while standing strong in its support for Israel and Netanyahu throughout the war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, has tried to stick to its long-held line that a two-state solution is in the interests of both Israelis and Palestinians. Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the idea. A day after speaking with Biden in a phone conversation in January, the Israeli leader posted on X, \u201cI will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of Jordan. And this is contrary to (the creation of) a Palestinian state.\u201d The Knesset declaration \u2013 which follows a similar vote in February opposing international recognition of a Palestinian state \u2013 is not legally binding, but pollster and analyst Dahlia Scheindlin says its symbolic importance should not be dismissed. \u201cIt is Israel trying to create a fact on the ground \u2013 which does not exist \u2013 that Israel has the power to determine whether Palestinians exist, or exist as a state,\u201d she says, referring also to remarks from finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, last year that there\u2019s \u201cno such thing as a Palestinian people.\u201d \u201cWe need to stop accepting the Israeli rhetoric that there is such a thing as unilateral Palestinian statehood. What we have is multilateral recognition of Palestinian statehood and unilateral Israeli rejection,\u201d Scheindlin says. While international leaders have repeatedly condemned the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, which killed 1,200 people and saw 250 more taken hostage, some countries have also made significant foreign policy shifts in recent months to recognize a Palestinian state. Making such an announcement in May, in a co-ordinated move with Spain and Ireland, Norway\u2019s foreign minister framed the move in part as a response to Israeli intransigence on peace talks. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,\u201d Espen Barth Eide said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/middleeast/israel-us-biden-knesset-vote-palestinian-state-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_21_europe_europe-conscription-war-russia-intl", "text": "Before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many, including Kyiv, were skeptical that a major war could\u202freturn to Europe. More than two years on, another shift once unthinkable is underway on conscription. Several European nations have reintroduced or expanded compulsory military service amid Moscow\u2019s mounting threat, part of a range of policies aimed at boosting defenses that are likely to be scaled up even further. \u201cWe are coming to the realization that we may have to adjust the way we mobilize for war and adjust the way we produce military equipment and we recruit and train personnel,\u201d said Robert Hamilton, head of Eurasia research at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, who served as a US Army officer for 30 years. \u201cIt is tragically true that here we are, in\u202f2024, and we are grappling with the questions of how to mobilize millions of people to be thrown into a meatgrinder of a war potentially, but this is where Russia has put us,\u201d he said. The risks for a larger war in Europe have been rising after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u202f\u201cfinally resorted to open conflict\u201d in Ukraine, pursuing his aim to \u201crecreate the Soviet empire,\u201d\u202fsaid Gen. Wesley Clark (Ret.), who served as NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander Europe. \u201cSo we\u2019ve now got a war in Europe that we never thought we would see again,\u201d said Clark, who led NATO forces during the Kosovo War. \u201cWhether this is a new Cold War or an emerging hot war is unclear,\u201d he continued, but \u201cit\u2019s a very imminent warning to NATO that we\u2019ve got to rebuild our defenses.\u201d Those efforts include conscription, he says. Return of conscription underscores new reality A number of European countries halted mandatory conscription after the end of the Cold War, but several nations \u2013 particularly in Scandinavia and the Baltics \u2013 have reintroduced it in recent years, largely because of the Russian threat. Failure to enlist can result in fines or even jail time in some countries. Latvia is the latest to implement conscription. Compulsory military service \u202fwas reintroduced on January 1 this year, after being abolished in 2006. Male citizens will be put up for the draft within 12 months of reaching the age of 18, or graduation for those still in the education system. \u201cAt first there was a lot of pushback,\u201d said Arturs P\u012bl\u0101cis, a 20-year-old student. He\u2019s yet to go up for the draft but voluntarily went on a month-long military course. But ultimately, \u201cthe need for a state defence service was clear,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really an option where we can stand by and think things will go on as they were before because of the unprovoked aggression in Ukraine.\u201d In April, Norway presented an ambitious long-term plan that will nearly double the country\u2019s defense budget and add more than 20,000 conscripted soldiers, employees, and reservists to the armed forces. \u201cWe need a defense that is fit for purpose in the emerging security environment,\u201d Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said. Conscription in Norway is mandatory and in 2015 it became the first member of the NATO defensive alliance to conscript both men and women on equal terms. Economics student Jens Bartnes, 26,\u202fcompleted his military training at the age of 19. \u201cI am happy I did it, I learned a lot from that year that I wouldn\u2019t learn otherwise \u2013 about myself, about my physical and mental limits and abilities I suppose, but also about teamwork. It\u2019s a whole different way of life,\u201d he said. \u201cI am willing to fight for my country if need be, because I believe in the values that the Norwegian society is built on and I believe those values of inclusion and equality and democracy are worth fighting for,\u201d Bartnes added. Max Henrik Arvidson,\u202f25, was conscripted into the Norwegian military for one year between 2019 and 2020. Like Bartnes, he sees military service as an essential duty. \u201cI know the only way we can stand against more Russian aggression is by keep supplying Ukraine with weapons and aid, while standing strong together with NATO as a whole and the European Union.\u201d \u2018Big mental shift\u2019 Debates about conscription have also been taking place in other European countries that currently don\u2019t require it. In the UK, the Conservatives floated the idea of military service in their ill-fated election campaign. But perhaps the most surprising transformation is underway in Germany, which since the end of World War II has had an aversion to militarization. In another first since the Cold War, Germany this year updated its plan should conflict erupt in Europe, and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius presented a proposal in June for a new voluntary military service. \u201cWe must be ready for war by 2029,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeing the debate now raging. And that\u2019s the first step,\u201d said Sean Monaghan, a visiting fellow in the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen overnight, it\u2019s a big mental shift.\u201d Not everyone is ready to answer the call. In Lithuania, for instance, opinions about military service among students vary, said Paulius Vaitiekus, president of Lithuania\u2019s National Students\u2019 Union. Since the country reintroduced compulsory military service in 2015 due to a \u201cchanged geopolitical situation,\u201d about 3,500 to 4,000 Lithuanians between the ages of 18 and 26 are enlisted each year for a period of nine months. Vaitiekus\u202fsaid students have launched initiatives to send supplies to the Ukrainian frontlines. There was \u201ca shift in the mindset of the youth towards being more active, although not necessarily through conscripting,\u201d he added. With conscription remaining an unpopular topic in some countries, NATO is struggling to meet its new goal of having 300,000 personnel ready to be activated within one month and another half a million available within six months, Monaghan said. \u201cWhile NATO has stated it has already met that goal, the EU has said its members would struggle. NATO relies on American forces to meet its target. European allies need to find new ways to generate personnel. Something has to give here,\u201d he said. Another problem is that that target would only allow NATO to fight a relatively short conflict of up to six months, Monaghan added. Large strategic reserve force models A possible solution is a more nimble, modern military. One of NATO\u2019s newest members, Finland,\u202fhas the capacity to activate more than 900,000 reservists, with 280,000 military personnel being ready to respond immediately if needed. However, during peacetime, the Finnish Defence Forces employs only about 13,000 people, including civilian staff. \u201cFinland is a good example\u201d as its reserve force can be integrated into a very small active force, said Hamilton, of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Historically, he explained, Finland was \u201cwedged\u201d between NATO and the Soviet Union, aligned with neither, so needed to be able to defend itself alone. Norway and Sweden, NATO\u2019s newest member, have similar models, both maintaining significant numbers of reservists, though not as many as Finland. Sweden, where conscription is now also gender-neutral, called up around 7,000 individuals in 2024. The number will rise to 8,000 in 2025, according to the Swedish Armed Forces. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, \u201cwhat we see is that both knowledge and the attitude have changed,\u201d she said. \u201cSweden has had conscription since 1901 so it\u2019s really part of our culture in a way,\u201d said Marinette Nyh Radebo, communications manager at the agency that helps test recruits and reports to the Ministry of Defense. \u201cWhen the conscription was activated again, in the beginning, we said that conscription is good for your CV, for applying for a new job for example,\u201d Radebo said. \u201cBut today our communication is more like, this is a duty that you have to do for Sweden.\u201d Is NATO ready for war? The NATO alliance has been revising its strategy and boosting capabilities over the past decade in response to the growing threat from Moscow. Russia\u2019s full-scale assault on Ukraine in 2022, which followed its support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, inevitably prompted allies to reassess whether they were ready for war and strengthen their defenses. \u201cSince 2014, NATO has undergone the most significant transformation in our collective defense in a generation,\u201d NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah told CNN. \u201cWe have put in place the most comprehensive defense plans since the Cold War, with currently more than 500,000 troops at high readiness.\u201d But there are calls for allies to increase their capabilities further and faster. While NATO allies \u201care definitely ready to fight tonight,\u201d there is still a question of whether they are ready for a protracted war such as that in Ukraine, Monaghan said, pointing out there is still work to be done in a number of areas. Those include industrial capacity, defense spending and societal resilience \u2013 where the question of conscription would come in. The way military personnel are recruited and trained is a decision for individual nations, Dakhlallah said, adding: \u201cAround a third of NATO members have some form of compulsory military service.\u201d \u201cSome allies are weighing up conscription. However as an alliance we do not prescribe mandatory military service,\u201d Dakhlallah said. \u201cThe important thing is that allies continue to have capable armed forces to protect our territory and our populations.\u201d In addition to the fighting in Ukraine, Russia has also launched a hybrid war across Europe, experts say, involving attacks on infrastructure, cyberattacks, disinformation, sabotage, election interference and the weaponization of migration. \u201cThat has only become more aggressive,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cAll of which is to say NATO allies face a very different geopolitical situation than they did over the last couple of decades.\u201d The situation could be further complicated by the US presidential election in November. Things will look very different if former President Donald Trump \u2013 who has said he would encourage Russia to do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to any NATO country that doesn\u2019t meet the bloc\u2019s defense spending guidelines \u2013 returns to the White House. \u201cI think there is a very good understanding among the military leaders of NATO that they must cooperate, and there is a desire to do that,\u201d Clark said. This year saw World War II veterans gather for D-Day commemorations, some possibly for the last time. Their descendants may now have to take on the kind of responsibility that it was hoped would not be needed again. \u201cI think young people in Europe and the US will come to realize that this generation, like the generation that fought WWII, it didn\u2019t ask to be the \u2018Greatest Generation,\u2019 but the circumstances thrust that burden on them,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIn democracies, we don\u2019t like to prepare for war, we don\u2019t want to think about these things,\u201d\u202fhe said. However, \u201cI think people will respond to the circumstances that they see.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/europe/europe-conscription-war-russia-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a 236-page report titled \u201c\u2018I Can\u2019t Erase All the Blood from My Mind\u2019: Palestinian Armed Groups\u2019 October 7 Assault on Israel,\u201d the rights watchdog said that the October 7 attack was \u201cdirected against a civilian population,\u201d and that \u201ckilling civilians and taking hostages were central aims of the planned attack, not an afterthought, a plan gone awry, or isolated acts.\u201d \u201cThe Hamas-led assault on October 7 was designed to kill civilians and take as many people as possible hostage,\u201d said Ida Sawyer, crisis and conflict director at HRW. The assault was led by Hamas\u2019 military wing \u2013 the Qassam Brigades \u2013 but included at least four other Palestinian armed groups, the report said. The report details several dozen cases of serious violations of international humanitarian law by Palestinian armed groups at most civilian attack sites on October 7, when militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. The rights group said it interviewed 144 people, including 94 Israeli and other nationals, who witnessed the October 7 assault, which targeted at least 19 kibbutzim (agricultural communes) and five moshavim (cooperative communities). The cities of Sderot and Ofakim, two music festivals, and a beach party were also targeted, HRW added. \u201cThe armed groups committed numerous violations of the laws of war that amount to war crimes,\u201d the report said. These include \u201cattacks targeting civilians and civilian objects, willful killing of people in custody, cruel and other inhumane treatment.\u201d Palestinian fighters committed summary killings and hostage-taking along with murder and wrongful imprisonment, HRW added. Sexual and gender-based violence The report also highlighted \u201ccrimes involving sexual and gender-based violence, hostage-taking, mutilation and despoiling bodies, use of human shields, and pillage and looting.\u201d Israel and the United Nations have also accused Hamas-led militants of committing sexual violence on October 7. In March, the UN special envoy on sexual violence in conflict, Pramila Patten, said her team found \u201creasonable grounds to believe that conflict related sexual violence, including rape and gang rape occurred\u201d that day. It was the UN\u2019s most definitive finding on allegations of sexual assault in the aftermath of the attack. Several first responders who attended the scenes of the October 7 attack told CNN in December that the attacks were overwhelmingly gruesome and that some female victims were found undressed. HRW said that Hamas responded to its questions, stating that its forces were instructed not to target civilians and to abide by international human rights and humanitarian law. \u201cIn many cases, Human Rights Watch investigations found evidence to the contrary,\u201d the watchdog said. Hamas rejected the findings of the report and called for it to be retracted, according to a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe reject the lies and blatant bias towards the occupation and the lack of professionalism and credibility in the Human Rights Watch report. We demand its withdrawal and an apology,\u201d the Palestinian group said. \u2018Atrocities do not justify atrocities\u2019 In response to the October 7 attack, Israel launched an air and ground offensive on Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 people in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. The war has displaced almost all of Gaza\u2019s population of 2 million, turned swathes of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis. Previous HRW reports have addressed several alleged serious violations by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 7. In its Wednesday report, HRW called on all parties involved in the conflict to abide by international humanitarian law. \u201cThe Palestinian armed groups in Gaza should immediately and unconditionally release civilians held hostage,\u201d the report said, adding that both parties \u201cshould surrender for prosecution anyone facing an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant.\u201d In May, the ICC said it was seeking arrest warrants for Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, among other Israeli and Hamas officials, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks and the subsequent war in Gaza. \u00a0A case is also being heard by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over an accusation by South Africa that Israel is committing genocide in its war in Gaza. \u201cAtrocities do not justify atrocities,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cTo stop the endless cycle of abuses in Israel and Palestine, it\u2019s critical to address root causes and hold violators of grave crimes to account. That\u2019s in the interests of both Palestinians and Israelis.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/middleeast/hamas-israel-october-7-attack-human-rights-watch-report-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Instagram account of Sheikha Mahra bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the daughter of UAE Prime Minister and Dubai ruler Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, announced her intention to leave her husband, a fellow royal. \u201cI hereby declare our divorce,\u201d 30-year-old Sheikha Mahra\u2019s account posted on Instagram on Wednesday. \u201cI divorce you, I divorce you, and I Divorce You. Take care. Your ex-wife.\u201d The princess appeared to be invoking the controversial practice of triple divorce that is used in some Muslim countries where a man instantly divorces his wife by declaring it three times. The method is banned in some countries and isn\u2019t customarily invoked by women against their husbands. Mahra married Sheikh Mana Bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, also a member of the Dubai ruling family, last year in a glamorous ceremony that was featured in magazines such as Harper\u2019s Bazaar Arabia and Grazia. They had a daughter shortly after. Pictures of her with her husband have now been removed from her account. There are no pictures of her on Sheikh Mana\u2019s Instagram account either. The princess has a visible public and social media presence, often attending red carpet events in Dubai and adorning the cover of regional magazines, an unusual practice for female royals.

Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) both said they had carried out tests and found samples of the virus in sewage water. \u201cPoliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) had been identified at six locations in sewage samples collected on 23 June from Khan Younis and Deir al Balah,\u201d WHO said Friday. WHO said the findings are linked to the \u201cdisastrous sanitation situation\u201d created by Israel\u2019s brutal military assault in Gaza since the Hamas attacks of October 7. \u201cIt is important to note the virus has been isolated from the environment only at this time; no associated paralytic cases have been detected,\u201d WHO added. It said no one has yet been treated in Gaza for paralysis or other symptoms of polio, but that residents must now \u201ccontend with the threat\u201d posed by the disease. Various United Nations agencies \u2013 including UNICEF, the children\u2019s fund, and UNRWA, the agency for Palestinian refugees \u2013 are working with local health authorities to determine how far the virus has spread. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said polio vaccination rates prior to the conflict were \u201coptimal,\u201d but that Israel\u2019s war against Hamas had created \u201cthe perfect environment for diseases like polio to spread.\u201d \u201cThe decimation of the health system, lack of security, access obstruction, constant population displacement, shortages of medical supplies, poor quality of water and weakened sanitation are increasing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio,\u201d Tedros warned. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza called for practices to improve hygiene and safety. \u201cDetecting the virus that causes polio in sewage portends a real health disaster and exposes thousands of residents to the risk of contracting polio,\u201d it said in a statement, demanding \u201can immediate halt to the Israeli aggression.\u201d Wild polio was eradicated from Gaza more than 25 years ago, with pre-war vaccination coverage reaching 95% in 2022, according to WHO. Poliovirus can emerge when poor vaccination\u00a0coverage allows the weakened\u00a0form of the orally administered vaccine virus\u00a0strain\u00a0to mutate into a stronger version\u00a0capable of causing paralysis, a spokesman from WHO\u2019s global Polio Eradication program said. Meanwhile, hospitals in central Gaza said more than 20 people were killed after two Israeli air strikes on houses in the Nuseirat area. A CNN stringer on the ground said the majority of the casualties were women and children. CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) about the reported strikes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-gaza-polio-detected-water-sewage-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_travel_global-tech-outage-what-to-know-if-youre-traveling-this-weekend", "text": "Unexpected tech outages have been impacting airlines and airports across the world. Major hotel brands have also reported outages. Here\u2019s what to know if you\u2019re planning to travel this weekend. What\u2019s going on? Widespread IT problems are impacting global travel. It\u2019s believed the issue stems, at least in part, from a software update issued by software company CrowdStrike on Microsoft Windows operating systems. The CEO of CrowdStrike said in a statement obtained by CNN early Friday that the IT issue causing a global outage had been identified and a fix had been deployed. Meanwhile, Microsoft said the \u201cunderlying cause\u201d that led to the global outage \u201chas been fixed,\u201d but added that residual impact is still affecting some services. Airports, airlines and travelers across the globe continue to navigate the fall-out. Which airlines and airports are impacted? US-based carriers American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Allegiant Airlines, SunCountry and Frontier Airlines all reported issues on Friday. American Airlines has since said it has \u201csafely reestablished\u201d operations, while United resumed \u201csome flights\u201d Friday morning. Delta Air Lines resumed some flight departures but additional delays and cancellations were expected Friday. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement early Friday that was \u201cclosely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,\u201d adding that \u201cseveral airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.\u201d The agency provided an update later in the day: \u201cCurrently FAA operations are not impacted by the global IT issue. We continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d The\u00a0agency also said\u00a0the IT issue \u201ccould continue to affect flights this weekend.\u201d Ryanair, Air France and Turkish Airlines also reported issues, while KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said the outages are \u201cmaking flight handling impossible.\u201d AirAsia said its \u201ccore reservation and check-in system\u201d have been impacted by the tech issues. Cirium, an aviation analytics company, said there were around 110,000 scheduled commercial flights Friday. By 3 p.m. ET, Cirium said there were more than 5,000 flights canceled globally. Many airports across the globe also logged tech-related issues. Dubai Airport reported issues on Friday morning, but the airport said in a post on X that normal operations had resumed. Passenger William Sikora III told CNN Friday morning that the situation at Philadelphia International Airport is \u201cabsolutely insane right now\u201d in the wake of the disruption. Airports across the US cautioned travelers to expect delays and to check their flight status before going to the airport. In Europe, London\u2019s Gatwick Airport said it is \u201caffected by the global Microsoft issues\u201d and that passengers may experience delays checking in and going through security. London\u2019s Heathrow Airport said it was working with \u201cairport colleagues to minimize the impact\u201d and advised passengers to check with their airlines for the latest flight information. Berlin Airport said it is experiencing delays to check-in, while Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol Airport stated the impact on its airport is \u201cbeing mapped.\u201d Scotland\u2019s Edinburgh Airport said the outages mean \u201cwait times are longer than usual at the airport.\u201d Spain\u2019s airport authority, AENA, which supervises airports in Madrid, Barcelona and others across the country, said the tech issues \u201ccould cause delays\u201d and that its staff are working to solve the problems. Airports and airlines in Asia and Latin America were also reporting disruptions caused by the IT outage. This is not an exhaustive list, so it\u2019s best to check the status of any airports you\u2019ll be transiting through this weekend before you travel. This is also a fast-moving situation heading into Friday night and the weekend, so if you\u2019re planning on flying, it\u2019s best to keep tabs on your chosen airline\u2019s social media channels, apps and website for up-to-date information. Check your flight status before you head to the airport, if you can. How long will it take for things to get back to normal? Travel will likely take a while to get back on track, even once the outage is sorted. The stoppage of flights means that thousands of aircraft have been grounded around the world and could be stuck in the wrong airports. Crews have limits on their working hours, so staffing challenges cascade along with flight delays. Getting schedules back on track is a complicated process that can take several days to fully iron out. The best course of action is to monitor your airline for announcements and to know your rights as a consumer. What do I do if my flight is canceled? First off, if you can, check the status of your flight before you leave for the airport. It\u2019s better to find out your flight is canceled from the comfort of home or a hotel room and make new arrangements from there, if at all possible. If you\u2019re already at the airport, head to the airline help desk. While you\u2019re standing in line, it\u2019s worth phoning the airline help number and trying to contact the company via social media or email. If you are a member of an airline executive club and have access to a special phone number, now is the time to use it. If it looks like the airline won\u2019t be able to put you on a flight until the following day, ask for a hotel room or hotel voucher. There are fewer consumer protections for situations outside of airlines\u2019 control, but it\u2019s worth requesting. And if your airline seems to be impacted, but another airline is still operable \u2013 ask about flying with other carriers. \u201cWhen flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier\u2019s flight because they have interline agreements,\u201d Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel in our guide to flight cancellations, which you can read here. \u201cThis means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.\u201d If you can plausibly take a train rather than fly \u2013 for instance, if you\u2019re in the UK heading to mainland Europe \u2013 it could be worth checking last-minute ticket availability. What are my rights as an air traveler? That depends on where you\u2019re flying to and from \u2013 in the US, for example, passengers have the right to a refund for canceled flights, but additional compensation or accommodation for delays or cancellations outside of carriers\u2019 control is up to each airline. On flights to and from EU countries, the laws are different. If your airport of origin is within the EU or if you\u2019re arriving to the EU on an EU airline, you\u2019re entitled to a refund for delays longer than five hours and additional compensation for some shorter delays. Wherever you\u2019re traveling, it\u2019s worth familiarizing yourself with the airline terms and conditions associated with your booking. And if you have travel insurance, look up your rights there too. Can I cancel my flight if I no longer want to travel? That all depends on the type of ticket you have, the airline you\u2019re flying with and whether you have travel insurance (which is always a good idea). Insurance covers missed departures and connections \u2013 if your flight is delayed, your company may be able to help change your travel plans, though it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll refund you if your flight is not affected but you no longer want to travel. Check your airline to see if it\u2019s offering passengers the chance to cancel or change dates. As the situation spirals and airlines reroute passengers on canceled flights, the flexibility may increase. At the time of writing, American Airlines is offering free changes for those due to fly on July 19 through eight major hubs (there are caveats as to rebooking dates). British Airways said it has increased flexibility for customers flying shorthaul routes over the weekend. Delta, United and American all issued waivers for impacted customers Are hotels or rental cars affected? Marriott International says some of its hotel systems have been impacted by the ongoing global IT outage. \u201cWe are actively working with our vendors to resolve issues that have impacted certain hotel systems. We apologize for any inconvenience that guests may experience,\u201d the company said in a statement to CNN Friday afternoon. CNN has reached out to\u00a0Hilton\u00a0Hotels for information on outages. One employee at the\u00a0Hilton\u00a0Phoenix Tapatio Cliffs Resort in Phoenix, Arizona, told CNN that guests had to wait for a bellhop to open their rooms for them because an outage hit the software the hotel uses to make key cards. Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty locations are open, according to a statement from Hertz. \u201cWe are seeing an increase in volume at our call centers and sustained demand for bookings, reservation modifications and one-way rentals. Some customers might experience longer than anticipated waits, and we are working diligently to get people on the road as quickly as possible,\u201d the statement said. Are trains and other public transport systems affected? Some train systems are reporting issues related to the tech outage. In the UK, National Rail reported \u201cwidespread IT issues across the entire network\u201d on Friday. National Rail said UK train operators are unable to access driver diagrams at certain locations, so there\u2019s the potential for short-notice train cancellations. In Italy, the transport ministry said Trenitalia and Italo train networks were suspended after systems went offline. Passengers called emergency services and demanded to be let off the trains because of extreme heat, after enduring delays up to 140 minutes. Some trains on rural Italian rail lines have been stopped because of extreme heat. In the United States, trains and buses in Washington, D.C., have been impacted by Friday\u2019s outages, according to the US capital\u2019s transit authority. In New York, Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) customer information systems went temporarily offline Friday morning, according to officials. However the MTA said \u201ctrain and bus service is unaffected.\u201d Again, this isn\u2019t an exhaustive list. If you\u2019re set to travel soon, wherever you are in the world, it\u2019s worth double checking your individual journey status before you travel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/travel/global-tech-outage-what-to-know-if-youre-traveling-this-weekend/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_tech_apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets", "text": "Apple has yielded to pressure by European regulators to give rivals access to the contactless payments technology on iPhones, meaning that their users will no longer be limited to the Apple Pay mobile wallet. The development on the tap-to-pay technology underscores mounting regulatory scrutiny of Apple (AAPL) in the European Union, where it is also facing a potential huge fine for allegedly breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, announced this and other changes to Apple\u2019s business practices Thursday, saying they would open up competition in mobile payments on iPhones. \u201ciPhone users will (now) be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores\u2026 while enjoying all the iPhone functionalities, including double click, tap-and-go and Face ID,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager told journalists. The tech giant has until July 25 to implement the changes, which will remain in force for 10 years and apply throughout the 30 countries in the European Economic Area. Under the agreement, third-party mobile wallet developers will gain free access to the standard technology used for contactless payments with iPhones, known as near-field communication (NFC) technology. Apple will also allow iPhone users to choose which mobile wallet to make the default wallet on their phones. \u201cApple is providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and\u00a0contactless\u00a0transactions for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets\u00a0from within their iOS apps,\u201d Apple said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cApple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the European Economic Area for users and developers.\u201d The European Commission first raised objections against Apple\u2019s tap-to-pay practices in 2022, having opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple Pay two years earlier. The regulators found that Apple had abused its dominant market position by restricting access to the NFC technology needed to make payments on mobile devices. That means rivals wanting to create apps or wallets using the tap-to-pay features on iPhones have been unable to do so and users have been forced to use Apple Pay for mobile payments. \u201cFrom now on, Apple can no longer use its control of the iPhone ecosystem to keep (competing) mobile wallets out of the market,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cCompeting wallet developers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice while keeping payments secure.\u201d The commitments do not extend to Apple Watches, however. \u201cOur impression was that the number of people who use Apple Watches for payments is rather small,\u201d said Vestager, adding that there was \u201climited harm done\u201d from excluding those devices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/tech/apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

The reclusive tribe has been sighted coming out of the rainforest more frequently in recent weeks in search of food, apparently moving away from the growing presence of loggers, said local indigenous rights group FENAMAD. The Mashco Piro were photographed at the end of June on the banks of a river in the Madre de Dios region in southeast Peru near the border with Brazil, Survival International said as it released the photos. \u201cThese incredible images show that a large number of isolated Mashco Piro live alone a few kilometers from where the loggers are about to start their operations,\u201d said Survival International director Caroline Pearce. More than 50 Mashco Piro people appeared in recent days near a village of the Yine people called Monte Salvado. Another group of 17 appeared by the nearby village of Puerto Nuevo, said the NGO, which defends indigenous rights. The Mashco Piro, who inhabit an area located between two natural reserves in Madre de Dios, have seldom appeared as a rule and do not communicate much with the Yine or anyone else, according to Survival International. Several logging companies hold timber concessions inside the territory inhabited by the Mashco Piro. One company, Canales Tahuamanu, has built more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) of roads for its logging trucks to extract timber, according to Survival International. A Canales Tahuamanu representative in Lima did not respond to a request for comment. The company is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, according to which it has 53,000 hectares (131,000 acres) of forests in Madre de Dios to extract cedar and mahogany. The Peruvian government reported on June 28 that local residents had reported seeing Mashco Piro on the Las Piedras river, 150 kilometers (93 miles) from the city of Puerto Maldonado, the capital of Madre de Dios.

{"id": "2024_07_19_middleeast_israel-west-bank-jerusalem-occupation-icj-opinion-intl", "text": "The United Nations\u2019 top court said Friday that Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal, in an unprecedented opinion that called on Israel to end its decades-long occupation of territories claimed by Palestinians for a future state. The advisory opinion, while non-binding, was the first time the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has expressed its view on the legality of Israel\u2019s presence in territories it captured in the 1967 war. An advisory opinion is not legally binding but carries moral authority and can shape international law,\u00a0according to the ICJ. Friday\u2019s opinion prompted condemnation from Israeli leaders and praise from Palestinian officials. In its sweeping judgment, the ICJ ran through a list of Israeli practices that it said violated international law, including confiscating land, building Israeli settlements in the territories, and depriving Palestinians of natural resources and the right to self-determination. The court called on Israel to\u00a0cease new settlement activity, evacuate settlers and make reparations for the damage caused. \u201cThe sustained abuse by Israel of its position as an occupying Power, through annexation and an assertion of permanent control over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, violates fundamental principles of international law and renders Israel\u2019s presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful,\u201d the opinion read. Judge Nawaf Salam, the president of the ICJ, which is based in The Hague in the Netherlands, said the court observed that \u201clarge-scale confiscation of land and the degradation of access to natural resources divests the local population of their basic means of subsistence thus inducing their departure.\u201d The court also found that Israel\u2019s declaration of Jerusalem as its capital helped to \u201centrench Israel\u2019s control of the occupied Palestinian territory\u201d and said that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are \u201cin violation of international law.\u201d During the 1967 war, Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights from neighboring Arab states. Soon after, it began establishing Jewish settlements in those territories. The Palestinians want the West Bank and Gaza for a future state, with East Jerusalem at its capital. Israel considers the entirety of Jerusalem as its \u201ceternal capital.\u201d In its opinion, the court concluded that all states and international organizations, including the United Nations, are under an obligation \u201cnot to recognize as legal the situation arising from the unlawful presence of the State of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\u201d The case predates the current Israel-Hamas war, and stems from a 2022 request for an advisory opinion by the UN General Assembly. The 15 judges on the court were asked to consider \u201cthe legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.\u201d It is also separate from the ICJ proceedings held in January over an accusation from South Africa that Israel was committing genocide in its war against Hamas following the October 7 attacks \u2013 a claim Israel has vehemently denied. \u2018False decision\u2019 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other politicians rejected the ICJ opinion. \u201cThe Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement. \u201cNo false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth, just as the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\u201d Foreign Minister Israel Katz also condemned the opinion, calling it \u201cfundamentally warped, one-sided, and wrong.\u201d Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, himself a settler, also spoke out against the court.\u00a0\u201cThe answer to The Hague \u2013 sovereignty now,\u201d Smotrich\u00a0said on X, a call for Israel to annex the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority (PA) welcomed the opinion, calling it \u201ca watershed moment for Palestine, for justice, and for international law.\u201d The opinion \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more timely or sorely needed,\u201d the PA said in a statement, adding that it \u201cis a vindication of their steadfastness and perseverance.\u201d The PA also urged all states and the UN not to recognize the legality of the settlements and to \u201cdo nothing to assist Israel in maintaining this illegal situation.\u201d Implications of the ICJ opinion While the ICJ has previously given advisory opinions about Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank, Friday\u2019s announcement is a step further, some experts said. The ICJ in 2004 delivered an advisory opinion on the Israeli separation barrier around the majority of the West Bank, urging Israel to remove it from occupied land. The nonbinding opinion had found that Israel was obligated to return confiscated land or make reparations for any destruction or damage to homes, businesses and farms caused by the barrier\u2019s construction. \u201cIf the 2004 opinion held that Israel had to dismantle the wall, or at least the parts of it that encroach onto the West Bank, (Friday\u2019s opinion) holds that Israel has to withdraw as rapidly as possible from the occupied territories,\u201d Eliav Lieblich, a professor of international law at Tel Aviv University, told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s a major difference \u2013 not the legality of the settlements per se, but the implications of the settlements and the entire practice around them,\u201d Lieblich said. While ICJ opinions are not binding, they are perceived as \u201cvery authoritative statements of international law as is,\u201d he said, adding that they may have an impact on international organizations taking this opinion to domestic courts, demanding for example that individual counties refrain from exporting weapons that may be used in the occupied territories.

{"id": "2024_07_18_middleeast_un-gaza-evacuation-displacement-intl-latam", "text": "United Nations agencies say that a new round of evacuation orders by the Israeli military in Gaza has prompted the largest displacements since October \u2013 making the delivery of emergency rations even more difficult than previously. The World Food Programme said in a post on X Thursday: \u201cMany distribution points have had to shut down. Only a few bakeries remain operational. We urgently need increased deliveries of food and greater capacity to deliver hot meals.\u201d A spate of evacuation orders issued\u00a0 by the Israel Defense Forces in late June and earlier this month increased the number of people displaced in Gaza from 1.7 million to 1.9 million, according to a UN assessment. The WFP says it has\u00a0provided more than 600,000 people in Gaza with food assistance this month, and more than 500,000 people with food parcels and wheat flour. But the agency also reported having to further cut rations in central and southern Gaza to ensure broader coverage for people who have been newly displaced. \u201cWFP still needs to deliver more fuel to the bakeries and other services, so they can provide emergency support to displaced families,\u201d it said. \u201cBasic commodities are available in markets in southern and central Gaza \u2013 but are unaffordable for many people \u2013 the shortage of commercial goods means food is sold at astronomical prices.\u201d On Wednesday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that the Israeli military had stopped all aid missions from going north of Wadi Gaza into central Gaza. \u201cThis means humanitarian workers were unable to reach any of the hundreds of thousands of people in need. It also made it impossible for them to collect supplies from the northern entry point of Erez West,\u201d it said. The Israeli agency in charge of coordinating the movement of aid convoys in Gaza, COGAT, told CNN it was unaware of any halt to the movement of convoys from the south of Gaza into northern areas through Wadi Gaza. Gaza\u2019s health sector remains under great stress. According to the World Health Organization, 15 of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals are partially functional, and 1,500 of the usual 3,500 hospital beds in Gaza are available \u2013 600 of them in field hospitals. Both the International Red Cross and the Gaza Health Ministry underlined the challenges to providing health care on Thursday. \u201cThe ambulance and emergency system is no longer able to respond to all calls and missions to transport the wounded and injured,\u201d the Health Ministry said because of a lack of ambulances, the arrest of paramedics by the IDF and a lack of gasoline.

In a statement, Gr\u00e9goire Goodstein, IOM\u2019s chief of mission in the country, blamed the tragedy on Haiti\u2019s spiraling security crisis and the lack of \u201csafe and legal pathways for migration.\u201d \u201cHaiti\u2019s socio-economic situation is in agony. The extreme violence over the past months has only brought Haitians to resort to desperate measures even more,\u201d he said. Haiti is\u00a0grappling with gang violence, a collapsing health system, and a lack of access to essential supplies, leading many Haitians to embark on dangerous journeys out of the country. The Caribbean nation\u2019s crisis escalated earlier this year when gang warfare exploded, forcing the resignation of the then-government. The number of migration attempts by boat from Haiti have risen since then, according to IOM data.

In recent weeks, the appointment of new Prime Minister Garry Conille and the arrival of several hundred foreign forces to bolster Haiti\u2019s National Police have offered new hope for addressing the crisis.

Sikorski explained that some missiles fired from around St. Petersburg fly along the Polish border through Belarusian airspace, before briefly entering Polish airspace for about 40 seconds before hitting targets inside Ukraine. \u201cOur dilemma is the following: if we shoot them down only when they enter our airspace, the debris is a threat to our citizens and to our property,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Ukrainians are saying, \u2018Please, we will not mind, do it over our airspace when they\u2019re in imminent danger of crossing into Polish territory,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cTo my mind, that\u2019s self-defense but we are exploring the idea.\u201d Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited Warsaw to sign a security cooperation agreement between the two countries.

The arrests all took place between July 4 and 14 and most were in the state of T\u00e1chira, according to the report.

{"id": "travel_grief-camp-experience-camps-mackenzie-galloway-cole", "text": "When Mackenzie Galloway-Cole saw the reminder in her Google calendar, her first reaction was dread: Three days, blocked out with two words, in all caps: \u201cGRIEF CAMP.\u201d Taking a few deep breaths, Galloway-Cole tried to calm her nerves. Of the two words, it wasn\u2019t the \u201cgrief\u201d part that made her panic. The prospect of \u201ccamp\u201d was way more daunting. \u201cI was nowhere near as afraid of talking about grief as I was afraid of being in a new space, doing something new, alone, with new people,\u201d Galloway-Cole tells CNN Travel today. Galloway-Cole, a New Yorker in her late 20s, is a recent widow. Last November, her wife, Megan, passed away from a sudden cardiac event. \u201cLosing my wife felt like losing my center of gravity,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cEverything in the world felt upside down and I felt untethered to reality.\u201d About a month after Megan\u2019s death, one of Galloway-Cole\u2019s close friends sent her details about Experience Camps, a US-based nonprofit that runs summer camps for grieving kids. In recent years, Experience Camps has expanded its program to include an annual adults-only grief retreat. When the organization appeared on Galloway-Cole\u2019s radar, Experience Camps was accepting applications for its summer 2024 adult getaway. Sitting in her parents\u2019 home in Kansas, Galloway-Cole scrolled through the details. The MO, according to Experience Camps, is that bereaved adults gather to \u201cgrieve, connect and play\u201d in the beautiful surroundings of a historic summer camp in the Poconos. On the agenda: traditional camp activities including campfires, arts and crafts and sports \u2013\u00a0 interspersed with opportunities for grief-based connection and contemplation. Galloway-Cole wasn\u2019t a camp kid. She spent her childhood and teenage summers taking extra classes at local colleges rather than sitting around a campfire toasting s\u2019mores. And while camp as a concept sounded fun \u2013 at least if Lindsay Lohan in \u201cThe Parent Trap\u201d was anything to go by \u2013 Galloway-Cole was unsure of the reality of \u201csleeping in a cabin in bunks with strangers.\u201d But in the wake of her wife\u2019s death, Galloway-Cole had adopted what she calls a \u201ckitchen sink\u201d attitude to grieving: She\u2019d try pretty much anything in the quest to adjust to her stark new reality. \u201cAt that point, I was also just looking for any sort of way to form connections with other people in the grief space \u2013 trying to just create and build a community,\u201d adds Galloway-Cole. \u201cBeing a widow in my 20s, I don\u2019t have as many people around me who relate to that grief experience. So, when I found out about the camp, I signed up the day I found out.\u201d \u2018A big leap of bravery\u2019 After a phone call with Experience Camps\u2019 program director, Galloway-Cole paid the requisite $425 fee \u201cand then put the dates in my calendar and didn\u2019t think about it too much.\u201d Then, suddenly \u2013 somehow \u2013 it was June 2024. Seven months since Galloway-Cole\u2019s wife passed away. Six months since she\u2019d signed up for grief camp. In that intervening period, Galloway-Cole had waded through the heavy haze of grief to rebuild something of a routine. She\u2019d left the comfort of her parents\u2019 house in Kansas and returned to the New York City apartment she\u2019d once shared with Megan. She\u2019d gone back to her job working in nonprofit communications. She\u2019d reconnected with friends. She\u2019d gone to therapy. She started blogging about her experiences on her Substack, Good Gay Grief. Life wasn\u2019t easy, but there was some semblance of \u201cnew normal\u201d that Galloway-Cole embraced as much as possible. Interrupting this routine to embark on a grief-focused summer camp was daunting, to say the least. But Galloway-Cole put on her favorite T-shirt, packed her suitcase, mapped out the route via GPS, and readied herself to drive two and half hours northwest to Equinunk, Pennsylvania. \u00a0 It was the first time she\u2019d gone on a vacation or trip since her wife died. \u201cSo, that was a big leap of bravery \u2013 and a big milestone to pack the car on my own,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. Galloway-Cole and her wife loved a road trip. (\u201cIf it was between a flight or a 10-hour drive, we would usually drive,\u201d she says). But Galloway-Cole was used to having Megan in the car, by her side. \u201cThere were so many times we would take a 10-hour drive, and we wouldn\u2019t even turn on music, because we would just talk the whole time,\u201d she recalls. As Galloway-Cole got behind the wheel, she was acutely conscious of the empty passenger seat. \u201cI got in the car knowing, \u2018I don\u2019t have my companion anymore. I don\u2019t have my person. I have to find a way to get through this and do it on my own,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd what that looked like for me was I put on a playlist that was high energy, trying to just sing along and keep myself motivated.\u201d Galloway-Cole sang as loud as she could as she navigated the concrete gridlock of New York City and headed toward the rural greenery of upstate New York. As she crossed the Pennsylvania border and got close to Equinunk, the views out the window got vaster, more verdant. Parking up at Camp Equinunk and Blue Ridge, her home for the weekend, Galloway-Cole felt her heart hammering in her chest. The nerves were in full swing. But almost immediately, Galloway-Cole began chatting to another recent arrival. \u201cShe turned out to be another camper who was also there for the weekend, who had previously been involved with Experience Camps before \u2013 so she knew what she was doing,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cI told her it was my first time and we talked a little bit about it \u2013 so I wasn\u2019t confused for long, there was someone helpful there right away to say, \u2018Here. Come with me. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u2019\u201d This first interaction was indicative of what was to come \u2013 Galloway-Cole was immediately welcomed into the fray. Only a couple of hours after arriving, she found herself sitting with other campers, making name necklaces to wear for the weekend. Threading beads onto the string, Galloway-Cole opted for her nickname \u201cMac\u201d over her full name \u201cMackenzie.\u201d She didn\u2019t usually skip straight to the abbreviation, but Gallowy-Cole figured she was about to share some pretty intimate stuff with her fellow campers, so why not skip the niceties? Opening up In the lead up to the weekend, the campers had been sent a schedule of activities, meals and sharing circles. \u201cI didn\u2019t memorize the schedule,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cI looked at it once and said, \u2018OK, I guess I\u2019ll figure out what all that means when I get there.\u2019 I think it was just a combination of nerves, but also I was open to letting whatever was supposed to happen, happen \u2013 and letting go and releasing a bit of the control. Just saying, \u2018I\u2019m here, I\u2019m open. And I\u2019m ready to see what this weekend is all about.\u2019\u201d That first day, Galloway-Cole found herself in a sharing circle with a handful of other campers and tried to embrace this mantra. She listened as other campers were candid about their bereavement experiences, watched as they oscillated between laughter and tears. Galloway-Cole stood back at first, taking everything in, feeling \u201cevery emotion on the emotional spectrum,\u201d but gradually she felt less daunted about the prospect of opening up herself. \u201cI was able to see how open everyone else was, in sharing their lives and sharing stories and fun tidbits about the people they love who they\u2019ve lost,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really empowered me to realize part of what\u2019s going to make this whole weekend so impactful is sharing, is pushing myself to share the hardest parts of my life with the strangers that I just met, minutes or hours ago.\u201d So, swallowing her nerves, Galloway-Cole started talking. She spoke about her late wife\u2019s love of basketball, and she was heartened by the reactions of her fellow campers. They were encouraging, nodding along. Afterward, someone suggested a game of pick-up basketball. Galloway-Cole was fighting back tears as she dribbled the ball, but she also felt a sense of lightness, a feeling of joy that had eluded her for a long time. It helped that everyone was so kind and welcoming. Galloway-Cole\u2019s fears about making friends were proved unfounded. While many of the campers knew each other already \u2013 either they\u2019d worked as Experience counselors at a kids\u2019 grief camp or attended previous iterations of the adult grief retreat \u2013 others were newbies like Galloway-Cole. And the old-timers and newbies were equally approachable. There were no cliques at grief camp. The campers ranged in age from early 20s to mid-60s, although the majority were around Galloway-Cole\u2019s age, late 20s to early 30s. In Galloway-Cole\u2019s everyday life, her grief sometimes feels like a stumbling block to connection with other young people \u2013 she doesn\u2019t always know when to mention her loss, can\u2019t predict how her peers might react and she\u2019s always conscious being a 20-something widow is relatively unusual, even shocking. \u201c\u2018Do I mention it? Do I not? Do I bring it up? Will other people feel uncomfortable? Will it sour the mood? Will someone say something and then I\u2019ll get annoyed that what they said was not what I needed to hear, because they don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m going through \u2026\u2019 Those are all the different types of thoughts that I unconsciously am filtering through constantly,\u201d explains Galloway-Cole. But at grief camp, everyone was united by loss, and everyone was there to talk about it. Grief was a fast track to connection, not a hurdle. Over the weekend, Galloway-Cole met other people who\u2019d lost their partners. Others who\u2019d suffered sudden, traumatic loss. Other people in their 20s. Other New Yorkers. Other queer people. She felt a sense of camaraderie and connection that she realized was sometimes lacking in her day-to-day life. While she\u2019s got a great support network of friends and family \u2013 who are also grieving the loss of Megan \u2013 there was something specifically comforting about meeting people going through the exact same experience. And while other campers\u2019 stories of loss were heavy, Galloway-Cole says there was also a consolation in knowing they were all supporting one another. \u201cGrief is so heavy, but it\u2019s the heaviest when you\u2019re holding it on your own,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when you do get to share parts of it with others, it\u2019s like they\u2019re helping you hold up this boulder. At grief camp, there were 100 people helping you hold up a boulder, it\u2019s a lot easier to hold than when you\u2019re doing it on your own.\u201d Marrying joy and sadness For the Experience Camps team, this idea of mutual support is at the center of everything they do \u2013 as is the idea that a moment of intense sharing could be swiftly followed by a freeing, spontaneous game of basketball. Experience Camps\u2019 years of operating summer camps for grieving kids mean the team puts joy and grief on equal footing. \u201cJoy and grief belong together,\u201d says Jesse Moss, Experience Camps\u2019 marketing director. \u201cYou can\u2019t be 100 percent sad all the time, because you won\u2019t be able to function and heal and grow and you can\u2019t be 100 percent joyful all the time \u2013 because then you\u2019re just pushing your grief down. \u2026 But I think joy and play really can get rid of your inhibitions, and kind of break you down in the same way that grief can \u2013 and so you\u2019re just your most authentic self.\u201d Experience Camps\u2019 kids camps have been running since 2009, meaning a whole generation of kids has now grown up with the program. The adults\u2019 retreat launched in 2022, inspired by feedback from the organization\u2019s adult volunteers. Many of them had their own grief stories, but they didn\u2019t have much opportunity to share them with one another, given their responsibilities at the kids camp. The pilot iteration of the adults retreat was exclusive to Experience Camps volunteers. There were around 30 attendees. In 2023, they extended the remit, opening up the retreat to any adults 21 and over who\u2019d experienced the loss of a parent, caregiver or sibling. Some 60 people signed up. In 2024, the parameters expanded to include anyone dealing with the death of someone important to them, and more than 100 campers gathered for the weekend. According to Experience Camps, interest continues to grow with many people discovering the program via TikTok. The adult camp is oversubscribed, and Experience Camps are looking at ways of expanding the program. Experience Camps isn\u2019t the only organization to run grief retreats \u2013 take Camp Widow, which hosts conference-style events for people grieving a partner across the country, or the kids-focused Comfort Zone Camp. But most of the grief retreat options available for adults don\u2019t include \u201csilly dances and an egg drop competition,\u201d two highlights of Galloway-Cole\u2019s June weekend. Experience Camps, which relies on donations and volunteers, also prides itself on its relative accessibility. The kids camp is free, and the adults camp costs $425 a person inclusive of all meals and activities, with adult scholarships available on a case-by-case basis. While some adult grief retreats lean into the luxury, wellness angle, Experience Camps firmly believes the less glamorous structure of summer camp lends itself perfectly to the grief space. Speaking to CNN Travel, the Experience Camps team suggests that embracing your inner child via games, campfire singalongs, dance competitions and friendship bracelets is the ideal counterpart to heavier moments of reflection and contemplation. These activities are a break from routine \u2013 from jobs, adult responsibilities, day-to-day mundanity. The only real difference between the kids program and the adult version, says Moss, is the adults have more freedom to do their own thing \u2013 and don\u2019t have to be told when to brush their teeth or go to bed. \u201cIn your personal life, you don\u2019t get to be silly, and do competitions and make up dances with your friends anymore. That was something 10 year olds did. But at this camp weekend, you\u2019re talking about your grief, but you\u2019re also making up dances with your friends,\u201d says Moss. \u201cIt\u2019s a really nice balance of nurturing your grief, nurturing your inner child, playing again and being vulnerable and meeting people who are like you.\u201d Michelle Cove, Experience Camps\u2019 director of communications, suggests campers are also better able to navigate their way through tougher moments of reflection and contemplation because they always know \u201cjoy and play is going to be on the other side of it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s really conducive for having these discussions, which you may or may not have if you\u2019re at a spa retreat with your girlfriends,\u201d Cove tells CNN Travel. The team suggests traveling is a great way of helping to process trauma, too. And it helps when the surroundings are so beautiful. Galloway-Cole calls the campground a \u201cmuch needed and wanted change of pace\u201d compared with life in New York City. \u201cThere\u2019s greenery everywhere,\u201d describes Galloway-Cole. \u201cThere\u2019s a lake, a big green lawn and there\u2019s a flagpole that we meet around every morning.\u201d During her time at camp, Galloway-Cole went for a solo walk around the grounds before each day\u2019s activities began. \u201cI would cross the bridge and head over to the lake. I would sit there, on the docks and just breathe some fresh air, center myself, wake up,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was really just a beautiful and tranquil way to start my day, every morning, to be alone with myself and my thoughts and try to connect with my wife a little bit before diving into a packed day.\u201d Making connections Experience Camps\u2019 kids camps have always been places where friendship thrives, and the Experience Camps team are happy to see this reflected in the adult campers\u2019 experiences so far. \u201cThe crossover between the kids camp and the adult camp is the word \u2018lonely,\u2019\u201d says Cove. \u201cHow lonely it is to be grieving. \u2026 And so having this space \u2013 whether it\u2019s for kids at camp or adults at camp \u2013 just to be with everybody who gets it, that\u2019s the star player.\u201d Since her wife passed away, one of Galloway-Cole\u2019s struggles is the idea that new people she meets won\u2019t get to meet Megan. \u201cI feel like they will never know this huge part of me,\u201d she says. But at grief camp, because she was encouraged to speak about Megan freely, Galloway-Cole felt as though she had introduced her partner to her new friends. On the last night of the retreat, the campers enjoyed some drinks and dancing. Toward the end of the evening, Chappell Roan\u2019s song \u201cHot To Go\u201d started blaring out of the speaker. For Galloway-Cole, this was both a joyous moment and a \u201cgut punch.\u201d The couple went to see the pop artist live last October, not long before Megan passed away. Since then, Chappell Roan has become a chart-climbing, global star. For Galloway-Cole, it\u2019s surreal and sad that Megan isn\u2019t able to witness one of her favorite artists hit the mainstream. In her normal life, Galloway-Cole might have swallowed down these thoughts and feelings \u2013 might have worried voicing them aloud would kill the vibe, worried about people\u2019s reactions. But at grief camp, Galloway-Cole didn\u2019t have these hesitations. Instead, she shouted over the music to her new friends: \u201cThis was the last concert Megan went to before she died!\u201d Rather than feeling like she\u2019d brought down the mood of the room, Galloway-Cole felt like she\u2019d just introduced Megan into the room. Her friends hugged her, cheered and the group spontaneously toasted Megan. It\u2019s a moment Galloway-Cole\u2019s thought about a lot since returning home. \u201cMegan\u2019s passing doesn\u2019t change the things she loved, it doesn\u2019t change the things we got to do together. And being able to just talk about her and who she was, and who she always will be, openly, I think is something that I will definitely bring more into my life.\u201d The experience at grief camp led Galloway-Cole to realize she can \u201ccontinue to introduce people to my wife, even though she\u2019s not with us anymore.\u201d She loves it when her grief camp friends reach out to mention something that\u2019s made them think of Megan, whether it\u2019s basketball news or pop music updates. \u201cThose are people that never got to meet her and know her while she was alive. But even they, through what I share with them, feel like they now have a connection to her,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cThat has been so impactful to hear from other people, and to see that she really does continue to be with me, and I can continue to bring her and introduce her to every person in my life that I come across.\u201d Galloway-Cole and her fellow campers are already planning future meet-ups and weekend trips together \u2013 as well as hopefully reuniting for the 2025 Experience Camps\u2019 adult grief retreat. Next year\u2019s applications aren\u2019t live yet, but those interested can still sign up to be the first to receive information. Galloway-Cole\u2019s also enjoyed sharing stories of grief camp with her friends and loved ones back home. She wrote a piece called \u201cGrief Camp is My Happy Place,\u201d for her Substack, describing her experiences. She set up a new, public Instagram to document her thoughts and feelings. \u201cI think a lot of people hear \u2018grief camp\u2019 and think it\u2019s going to be sad all the time. They think, \u2018Oh, that sounds awful, or how sad.\u2019 Meanwhile, I feel like I came back from grief camp, and I was the happiest and the lightest I had been since my wife passed, because I got to have such a joyous release,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cWe got to have those hard conversations, but also got to really experience community and connection and joy. And realize that it\u2019s OK for all of these things to coexist, because that\u2019s just what grief and a life with grief looks like.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/grief-camp-experience-camps-mackenzie-galloway-cole/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
