From a small apartment in South Korea\u2019s capital, Choi, who CNN is identifying by a pseudonym for his privacy and safety, is one of the parties engaged in what has become a tit-for-tat balloon feud between the two Koreas, heightening tensions on the Korean Peninsula. For many years, South Korean activists and North Korean defectors have sent balloons to the North, loaded with propaganda material criticizing dictator Kim Jong Un and\u00a0USB sticks filled with\u00a0K-pop songs and South Korean television shows\u00a0\u2013 all strictly prohibited in the impoverished, highly isolated nation. In response, North Korean authorities have sent more than 1,000 balloons toward the South since May carrying trash, waste and worms \u2013 fueling tensions as Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korea\u2019s leader, warned of \u201ctrouble\u201d ahead. In 2020, South Korea passed a law criminalizing the sending of anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the border as the previous liberal government in Seoul\u00a0pushed for engagement with Pyongyang. But many campaigners\u00a0defied the ruling before it was struck down by a court last year, which called the law an excessive restriction on free speech, in response to a complaint filed by North Korean defector-activists in the South. Choi, co-founder of the Committee for Reforming and Opening North Korea, is among the North Korean defectors who have vowed to continue sending balloons to their homeland. The balloons assembled by Choi\u2019s group from their Seoul apartment base are a step up from rudimentary balloons that randomly scatter their contents when they crash or pop. Fitted with GPS trackers,\u00a0the activists can monitor\u00a0these next generation \u201csmart\u201d balloons in real time on journeys that often span hundreds of kilometers.\u00a0The group once tracked one of its balloons that drifted all the way to China, according to its data. The group\u2019s oblong-shaped balloons are about 12 to 13 meters (about 40 to 42 feet) long, made of plastic and filled with hydrogen, Choi said. They carefully chose the plastic\u2019s thickness so it can both endure the wind and allow some hydrogen to naturally leak through, helping control the balloons\u2019 altitude, he added. The sensors and small circuit boards attached to the balloons help the balloons travel at a certain altitude and for a certain distance. \u201cIf the balloons float too high over 4,000 meters, the dispenser won\u2019t work properly so we keep an extra bag of leaflets to drop when it reaches too high in altitude,\u201d Choi said. \u201cIt\u2019s programmed to release the hydrogen gas depending on the altitude.\u201d \u201cI believe North Korea can change when the deification of Kim Jong Un is cracked, and sending these smart balloons is the way to achieve that,\u201d Choi added. \u201cI feel very proud that we have contributed to dismantling the idolization of Kim Jong Un.\u201d 3D-printed parts The smart balloons sent by Choi\u2019s group carry a number of different payloads, including some that are automated. In one version, the balloons carry a small, makeshift loudspeaker that looks like a camping lantern, held in place by zip ties and glue. Attached to a cushion, battery pack and a parachute, it blares propaganda as it floats to the ground, with one message declaring: \u201cNorth Korea can survive only if the Workers\u2019 Party is abolished.\u201d The balloons are sometimes fitted with an automated flyer-dispensing device. They can carry about 1,500 propaganda leaflets \u2013 which the dispenser spits out rapidly with the help of a timer and an altitude-adjusting device. \u201cWe devised a method to disperse the leaflets over a large area, covering 50 to 300 kilometers (about 31 to 186 miles), making it very difficult for North Korean authorities to collect them all,\u201d Choi said. \u201cWith our system, we can control the leaflets to fall every 300 meters or every kilometer, making sure more people can see them.\u201d These features allow the group more control over their devices than the typical balloons used by other activists. For example, smart balloons are designed to begin spitting out leaflets at specific points based on their wind speed and direction, Choi said \u2013 purportedly allowing them to distribute within target areas. They can also control the frequency of the leaflets\u2019 distribution. While Choi buys some parts for the devices, he uses 3D printers to make the others. He credits his engineering studies at a North Korean university before his escape to the South \u2013 and\u00a0YouTube videos and the rest of his group \u2013 for helping him improve upon the existing balloons being sent North, before setting up the organization in 2013. And this isn\u2019t his full-time job; he works elsewhere in the daytime, comes to the apartment after work, makes 3D-printed parts, then assembles them for up to six hours a day. Each smart balloon costs about $700 to make, he said. Choi\u2019s motivation, he said, is his family still living in North Korea. And he bristled at those in South Korea who have urged the activist groups to stop. \u201cTo those who criticize our activities, it\u2019s like saying, \u2018Let\u2019s help maintain the dictatorship in South Korea,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to\u00a0decades of authoritarianism in Seoul before the South\u2019s transition to democracy in the 1980s. Rising tensions The balloon feud has seen tensions heighten between the two Koreas, which technically remain at war \u2013 an armistice ended the Korean War that split the peninsula in 1953 but no formal peace treaty was ever signed. Relations between the two countries thawed somewhat in 2017 and 2018, allowing some South Korean elements, including parts of its pop culture, to seep into the hermit nation. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years as leader Kim ramped up weapons testing in defiance of United Nations sanctions and diplomatic talks fell apart, prompting strict rules to snap back into place in the North. Meanwhile, both nations are drawing closer to their respective partners \u2013 with North Korea recently signing a defense agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0and South Korea stepping up cooperation with Japan and the United States. On Tuesday, after South Korea detected the latest batch of 350 trash balloons from North Korea, the country\u2019s military warned it could restart loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts at the border \u2013 something it hasn\u2019t done since 2018. In past years, Seoul has used giant speakers to play propaganda and music across the heavily militarized border \u2013 including news reports and K-pop group Big Bang\u2019s hit song \u201cBang Bang Bang.\u201d \u201cOur military is ready to immediately start anti-North Korea propaganda broadcasts and will operate with flexibility according to the strategical and operational situation,\u201d said South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, adding that whether it resumes the loudspeakers is \u201cup to North Korea\u2019s actions.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/asia/north-south-korea-balloons-defector-activist-group-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

It was just the latest threat from a prominent Israeli public figure against Lebanon and\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0as tensions flare. It won\u2019t be difficult for Israel to plunge Lebanon into darkness. The country\u2019s power grid, already crippled by decades of mismanagement and the country\u2019s economic collapse, barely functions as it is. A few\u00a0well-aimed\u00a0airstrikes\u00a0will easily finish it off. Taking apart\u00a0Hezbollah\u2019s\u00a0military power in days, however, is a far taller task. Since its inconclusive 2006 war with the\u00a0Lebanese militant group, Israel has been planning for a re-match. Hezbollah too\u00a0has long been preparing for war. Its arsenal includes, according to Israeli estimates, at least 150,000 missiles and rockets. Israel estimates the group has already fired 5,000 since October, which means, as\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech last week, much of its arsenal remains intact. CNN has reported that Israeli officials have been surprised by the sophistication of the\u00a0militant group\u2019s\u00a0attacks. These include systematic pinpoint strikes on Israel\u2019s array of surveillance outposts along the border, shooting down high-flying top-of-the-line Israeli drones, and hits on Israel\u2019s Iron Dome batteries and anti-drone\u00a0defenses. Perhaps the biggest surprise for Israel, however, was the nine minutes of\u00a0drone footage\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0published\u00a0online\u00a0of highly sensitive civilian and military infrastructure in and around the northern city of Haifa. Highly trained and disciplined In addition to its\u00a0weaponry, Hezbollah\u00a0can\u00a0probably\u00a0field between 40,000 and 50,000 fighters \u2013 Nasrallah recently said more than 100,000. Many of these gained combat experience fighting\u00a0alongside\u00a0regime forces in the Syria civil war. As a fighting force,\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0is highly trained and disciplined,\u00a0unlike many other guerrilla groups.\u00a0During the 2006\u00a0war, in the experience of this correspondent, it was rare to encounter Hezbollah\u00a0fighters. One day we came upon several of them in the ruins of a southern Lebanese village. They were polite but firm, devoid of boastful bluster and swagger, insisting we leave immediately for our own safety. They wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. Unlike Gaza, Lebanon is not hemmed in by hostile\u00a0neighbors. It has strategic depth, with friendly regimes in Syria and Iraq, allowing direct access to Iran. Over the years Israel has regularly struck targets in Syria it believed were involved in trans-shipment of weapons to\u00a0Hezbollah, but all indications are those strikes have been only partially successful. In the event of war, full-scale war, both sides will be able to inflict significant pain on the other. Fire and blood Early this year the same Reichman University, where Gantz spoke, put out a report entitled \u201cFire and blood: The chilling reality facing Israel in a war with Hezbollah.\u201d\u00a0It laid out a grim scenario in which the Iranian-allied group would fire 2,500 to 3,000 rockets and missiles a day for weeks targeting Israeli military sites as well as densely populated cities in the\u00a0center\u00a0of the country. In the entire 34-day war\u00a0of\u00a02006\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0is estimated to have fired around 4,000 rockets \u2013 a daily average of 117. It may not amount to mutually assured destruction a la Cold War, but enough destruction will be wreaked on Israel and Lebanon to make it costly for both. At\u00a06 a.m.\u00a0on\u00a0July 13, 2006 \u2013\u00a0less than 24 hours after the start of the war \u2013 Israeli warplanes bombed and knocked out Beirut\u2019s Rafic Hariri International Airport. It\u2019s widely expected that if war breaks out now the airport will be one of Israel\u2019s targets. But unlike 2006, in 2024\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0may be able to hit Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion International Airport. In 2006, Haifa, Israel\u2019s third largest city, was in range of\u00a0Hezbollah\u2019s\u00a0missiles. This time those missiles are expected to reach much deeper into Israel. Shifting strategic balance Looking across the Middle East, the strategic balance that for so long\u00a0favored\u00a0Israel is changing. Its foes are no longer corrupt and incompetent Arab regimes, but rather an array of non-state actors \u2013 from\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0to Hamas to Islamic Jihad to the Houthis to militias in Iraq and Syria \u2013 in addition to Iran itself. And because of US support for Israel, all of these players also have the US, and\u00a0Western\u00a0interests in the Middle East, in their crosshairs.\u00a0US support was\u00a0underscored by recent CNN reporting that Washington has assured Israel of its backing in the event of full-scale war with\u00a0Hezbollah. The Houthis in Yemen, once the epitome of a rag-tag tribal militia, are now, with Iran\u2019s help, firing ballistic missiles toward Israel. The Houthis continue to target shipping in the Red Sea, despite the presence of a US-led armada off its shores. The Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria have largely held their fire since a series of US strikes in the aftermath of a drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan. But that could change if Israel and Hezbollah go to war. Recently\u00a0Qais Al-Khazali, the leader of the powerful Iranian-backed Iraqi militia Asa\u2019ib Ahl Al-Haq, warned that if the US supports an\u00a0Israeli\u00a0attack on Lebanon \u201cthen America should know that it will put all its interests in the region, particularly in Iraq, at risk and make them a\u00a0target.\u201d Throwing caution to the wind And then there\u2019s Iran.\u00a0Traditionally Tehran lets others fight its fights and stays in the background, but that changed in April when, in retaliation for the Israeli strike on its diplomatic complex in Damascus, Tehran responded with a volley of hundreds of missiles and drones toward Israel. In the event\u00a0Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s premier regional ally, its crown jewel, is attacked by Israel, and indeed is \u201ctaken apart\u201d by Israel as Gantz threatened, an Iranian response is likely. It could merely instruct its allies to throw\u00a0caution\u00a0to the wind and fire at will at US interests and Israel. But then there\u2019s this: Iran sits on the\u00a0Strait\u00a0of Hormuz, the entry point into the Persian Gulf. In the event of a major conflict, it has long been feared that Iran would block the\u00a0strait, a move that would send world oil prices skyrocketing. Since\u00a0October,\u00a0tensions on the Lebanon-Israel border have fluctuated. In the last few weeks, however, those tensions have escalated and war is looking ever more likely. The rhetoric on both sides is heating up. Germany, Sweden, Kuwait, the Netherlands and others are calling on their nationals to leave Lebanon immediately. If ever there was a danger of a regional war in the Middle East, that moment is now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-analysis-intl-latam-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_africa_kenyan-president-rejects-finance-bill-intl", "text": "Kenyan President William Ruto said Wednesday that he will not sign a controversial finance bill, backing down in the face of mass protests that swept the country and reportedly left at least 23 people dead. \u201cHaving reflected on the continuing conversation regarding the content of the finance bill 2024, and listening keenly to the people of Kenya who have said loudly that they want nothing to do with this Finance Bill 2024, I concede, and therefore I will not sign the 2024 finance bill,\u201d Ruto said during a television address Wednesday. \u201cThe people have spoken,\u201d Ruto said. \u201cFollowing the passage of the bill, the country experienced widespread expression of dissatisfaction with the bill as passed, regrettably resulting in the loss of life, the destruction of property and desecration of constitutional institutions.\u201d Protesters in Kenya say they will go ahead with a \u201cOne Million People March\u201d on Thursday despite Ruto accepting their key demand of scrapping the bill. A\u00a0poster shared widely\u00a0on social media calls on all generations to return to the streets across the country on Thursday and block roads leading to the capital Nairobi. Some protesters have also called for people to occupy the State House in Nairobi. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken with Ruto since the clashes to urge restraint. According to a State Department readout of their call, Blinken \u201cunderscored the importance of security forces demonstrating restraint and refraining from violence and encouraged prompt investigations into allegations of human rights abuses.\u201d Kenya, a nation often praised for its stability, had seen escalating protests over the bill, which the government introduced to rein in public debt. Last week, the government\u00a0scrapped\u00a0some tax increases, including a proposed 16% value-added tax on bread along with taxes on motor vehicles, vegetable oil and mobile money transfers. But the concessions were not enough to quell protests amid the\u00a0rising cost of living. On Tuesday they turned deadly when security forces fired teargas and live ammunition at protesters. Dramatic scenes in the nation\u2019s capital Nairobi saw government buildings set on fire and a ceremonial mace stolen from the parliament in the melee. Kenyan lawmakers were evacuated from the parliament as police went up against protesters, CNN affiliate NTV Kenya reported. At least 23 people died in the violence, according to Kenya\u2019s Police Reforms Working Group, (PRWG) a civil society organization. The PRWG alleged in a statement published by Amnesty International Kenya that police targeted young, unarmed protesters outside the parliament, with the violence continuing into the night. They added that \u201creports show police shot several people in Githurai, Nairobi, one over 40 times \u2014 between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m., way after the protest ended.\u201d This was in contrast to details given by Ruto, who said in his speech that six people died. \u201cI send my condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones in this very unfortunate manner,\u201d Ruto added. \u201cThere is need for us as a nation to pick up from here and go into the future,\u201d Ruto said, adding that he would hold an engagement with the young people at the forefront of the protests to hear their ideas and proposals. The Law Society of Kenya is calling for the resignation of Kenya\u2019s inspector general of police and the Nairobi regional commander over officers allegedly shooting protesters. \u201cWe saw plainclothes policemen shooting protesters as early as 11 a.m. There was a clear directive to kill protesters,\u201d Law Society of Kenya president Faith Odhiambo alleged in an interview with CNN on Wednesday evening. \u201cThere was no intent to let the protesters move around.\u201d The Law Society also said the police \u201cabducted\u201d several prominent social media users connected to the protests, and six people remain missing. \u201cThe reports from those who have been freed is that they were taken blindfolded and handcuffed, and they didn\u2019t know where they were,\u201d she told CNN, after the society secured the release of six people. \u201cEven after they come out, most of them are quite shaken and afraid and want to go into hiding. Our message to the government is that if a country is built on fear, one day people will stop fearing. And that\u2019s what we saw on Tuesday.\u201d Ruto\u2019s change of heart came as a surprise to some who observed his hardline stance just a day earlier. During a nationwide address after the parliament was set alight, Ruto said the events on Tuesday were a grave threat to \u201cnational security\u201d and that the conversation around the bill had been \u201chijacked by dangerous people.\u201d Kenyan analyst Herman Manyora said withdrawing the bill much earlier could have saved the lives lost on Tuesday. \u201cHis announcement should have come earlier. He has done today what he should have done two days ago to avoid what we went through yesterday. It pains me that we had to wait \u2026 for us to do what we should have done on Monday \u2026 and that\u2019s a general feeling among people,\u201d Manyora told CNN.

{"id": "2024_06_24_europe_dagestan-putin-extremism-pledge-failure-intl", "text": "Only a fraction of the violence that raged across Dagestan on Sunday is visible at the moment, and it is already horrific. Co-ordinated attacks in Dagestan\u2019s two main cities, hitting synagogues and churches. Reports a priest had his throat slit, hostages taken, and the sons of a local official and an MMA fighter among the five attackers. Videos of the violence showed police responding, racing down Makhachkala\u2019s panicked streets, as darkness fell. And police casualties appear improbably greater than the civilian toll, hinting worse news about civilian deaths may be yet to emerge. The partial information available is entirely by design. Moscow has tried for decades to keep a lid on the raging Islamist extremism its years of brutal suppression and poverty have fomented across the North Caucasus. Some times it is through brutal force, others through the selective release of information. But neither has conquered the problem. This attack \u2013 almost three months to the day after gunmen stormed into Moscow\u2019s Crocus City Hall killing 133 \u2013 compounds the unpleasant fact that Russia\u2019s Islamist threat has metastised, like it has across the world, and the next, younger generation retains the same vile hatred for the Kremlin\u2019s past and present. The extent of the law enforcement response will be key as Russia\u2019s political elite picks through the wreckage. The high death toll among police suggests they were either heavily targeted, or met fierce resistance when they intervened. The war in Ukraine \u2013 with police officers sent to the front \u2013 has left Russia\u2019s law enforcement depleted nationwide. But it is particularly bad in Dagestan, where protests broke out in the earlier months of the war, as their sons had been disproportionately mobilized. This is a poor, febrile pocket of Russia on the Caspian Sea, in places devoutly Muslim, where the war in Ukraine will have left many empty places at the dinner table, and fomented discontent against the Kremlin and its often corrupt local proxies. Dead and absent sons are hard to stomach, but if they come with worse security at home, it can be a critical problem for the Kremlin\u2019s grip on Dagestan. Extremist Islamism became Russia\u2019s curse after the savagery of its two wars in Chechnya. Putin came to power in 1999 graphically pledging to wipe out \u201cin the toilet\u201d the extremists apparently behind apartment bombings in Moscow. Chechen separatist militants like Shamil Basayev grew more radical in their ideology as Moscow\u2019s \u201cclean-up\u201d campaigns raged through Chechnya\u2019s villages in the early 2000s, often executing military-aged males randomly. Over the coming years, the two protagonists fed off each other; militants would reach yet more disgusting depths, and be answered by security forces who saw no limits on what they should do in response. The attacks on Christians in Dagestan on Sunday echo the militants\u2019 most ghastly crime \u2013 the siege of the school in Beslan, in 2004, where an Orthodox Christian area was targeted and more than 300 people died, most of them children. The security forces\u2019 response was woeful back then, until special forces arrived and bravely suppressed the siege, suffering great casualties in their ranks. Russian President Vladimir Putin sneaked into the area to see the wounded in hospital in the dead of night. Beslan was a manifestation of the sore he had pledged to cure when he came to power. As he has now, he failed back then, and wanted no photocall with the devastation. Chechen wars ignited entire region The perpetrators of Beslan had complex histories that spoke of how the Chechen wars had ignited an entire region. They were mostly not Chechens, but from nearby Ingushetia, another Russian region hit hard by its brutal war on extremism and separatists. Their decision to launch such a diabolical scheme \u2013 and there could only have been one real outcome from stringing up explosives in the basketball hoops above children\u2019s heads in a gym on the first day of school \u2013 came, they said, from the brutalities they had seen. I interviewed the only surviving Beslan gunman\u2019s father back in 2004, in a remote village in the Chechen hills. A tiny man, in a kufi hat and silver beard, he said little about his son\u2019s crimes. We spoke in a hurry, as Russian forces were then busy entering homes on the other side of his village in yet another clean-up operation. He said to me only this: \u201cIt is as Lenin said. There is White and there is Red. Always has been, and always will be.\u201d His point: there are two sides in this savage war, and they are irreconcilable. Fast forward a decade, and the North Caucasus came into focus again when two former residents perpetrated the Boston bombing in 2013. Their links back to Dagestan extremism proved slight. Most reporting suggested the elder brother had tried to be recruited by local jihadists, and hung around Makhachkala for weeks, hoping to get the invitation. But by then, Dagestan\u2019s extremists were hugely selective. Recruits would be expected to sit for months in isolation, without using cellphones or other contact, before jihadists would admit them to their training in the dense local forests and ranks of committed militants, eager to take innocent life. The caution was a by-product of Moscow\u2019s crackdown. Surveillance was omnipresent. Police would take no chances when intervening with suspects. Often a potential militant would be surrounded, his family permitted to leave, and then his home stormed, with little option for surrender. That was over 10 years ago. Nothing has improved since, and a younger generation have the lurid propaganda of ISIS\u2019s failed caliphate of 2014 to supercharge their fantasies. They face more potent fuel in the preaching and branding of ISIS-K, an offshoot of the Middle Eastern group in South and Central Asia, growing in its reach. But it is still the same problem Putin faced when he sneaked into Beslan in 2004. The extremist manifestation of anger in an impoverished, suppressed and exploited satellite region. A horror the Kremlin thought it could conquer, yet just accentuated through their brutality. A place Moscow cares little for, but will never allow to secede. A raging sore for the Kremlin, and a reminder of both how Putin came to power and his limits on it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/europe/dagestan-putin-extremism-pledge-failure-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_asia_bolivia-arrests-military-officials-failed-coup-intl-hnk", "text": "Bolivia has arrested more than a dozen high-ranking military and intelligence\u00a0officials following a failed attempt to unseat\u00a0the country\u2019s president in a coup allegedly led by its former army chief. Military officials first held meetings in May to plot the coup attempt on Wednesday, which involved mobilizing armed forces toward the capital\u2019s main square\u00a0and seizing power \u201cby force,\u201d according to\u00a0a report sent to CNN by the Bolivian government. The meetings were led by former army chief Gen. Juan Jose Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and former navy commander Gen. Juan Arnez, with Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u2019s civilian personal adviser allegedly devising the \u201cstrategy\u201d of the coup, the report claims. All three men are\u00a0among 17 people arrested so far in connection with Wednesday\u2019s events \u2013 most of them members of the military, the report says. Other top officials arrested include military intelligence chief Julio Buitrago. The coup attempt, which was condemned by the Bolivian government and international leaders, comes as the South American country of roughly 12 million people struggles with an economic crisis and political instability that has fueled mass street protests. On Wednesday, military units led by Z\u00fa\u00f1iga \u2013\u00a0who was fired as commander of the Bolivian army just a day earlier \u2013 occupied La Paz\u2019s main Murillo Plaza as armored vehicles rammed the presidential palace door and soldiers tried to break into government offices. Hours later, President Luis Arce \u2013 who had called on the public to \u201corganize and mobilize\u201d in defense of democracy \u2013 could be seen confronting Z\u00fa\u00f1iga in the crowded palace hallway, ordering the general to withdraw his soldiers and stand down. Arce, who has been in power since 2020, later declared victory to crowds in front of the Quemado Palace after\u00a0Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was handcuffed and forced into a police car. Following the coup attempt, Bolivia\u2019s defense minister Edmundo Novillo told a news conference the government had regained \u201ctotal and absolute control\u201d over its military. \u201cWe urge the population that everything goes back to normal,\u201d he said. As he was being arrested Z\u00fa\u00f1iga alleged \u2013 without providing evidence \u2013 that he was acting on Arce\u2019s instructions.

{"id": "2024_06_29_travel_europe-heat-waves-tourism-safety-intl", "text": "Growing up in Texas, Mary Beth Walsh thought she was accustomed to high temperatures. Her hometown of Dallas, which is currently being blasted by unrelenting heat, frequently experiences heat waves. But when the 21-year-old visited Athens in mid-June with her friends she was shocked by the \u201cunbearable\u201d 98 Fahrenheit (37 Celsius) heat\u00a0she faced. \u201cI actually had no idea about the heat that was going on until we were there, which was pretty surprising,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI always joke around that I have such a high heat tolerance; I bring my sweatshirt with me to class in August (in the US),\u201d she said. But the apartment she was staying in had no air conditioning and temperatures were too high during the day to explore the city on foot. \u201cOur energy levels were lower than we thought they would be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt pretty unbearable to walk in the direct heat.\u201d Climate crisis-driven sweltering summers in Europe are now a reality that many tourists are waking up to. Interest in visiting hotter Mediterranean countries dropped in 2023 amid record heatwaves and wildfires, with more temperate destinations becoming increasingly popular, experts say. Recent heat-fueled deaths and disappearances in Greece, including that of the British TV personality Michael Mosley, have the potential to further fuel this northward shift, as incidents of extreme heat influence vacation decisions. The degree to which the travel industry and tourists alike can adapt to the rising tide of climate impacts is becoming a bigger issue for countries in southern Europe, many of which rely on tourism to boost their economies. Night shift The recent high temperatures have brought the climate crisis into sharp focus for some European vacationers. \u201cThe climate crisis that we\u2019ve been fearing will happen in 10 or 15 years is already here in some parts of the world. That\u2019s the scary part,\u201d Roo Clark, 28, from Suffolk in eastern England, who is currently staying with his girlfriend on the Greek island of Skyros, told CNN. \u201cFive years ago, me and my friends wouldn\u2019t have even spoken about it (climate change), whereas now it\u2019s more of a conversation.\u201d Authorities in Greece have repeatedly warned tourists not to underestimate the intense heat, especially during the middle of the day. Hiking in high temperatures has been a common thread linking recent deaths in the country. Temperatures in Greece are forecast to be between 90 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit (low- to mid-30s in Celsius) over the next couple of weeks, a few degrees above summer average, according to CNN meteorologists, except for one to two days when rain is forecast, which will keep temperatures down. Stefanos Sidiropoulos, who runs Greece\u2019s largest travel agency specializing in outdoor activities, said tourists shouldn\u2019t jump straight into activities. \u201cPeople that are coming from north Europe, or from Canada, places with colder temperatures, it\u2019s more difficult for them. They need time to adapt to these conditions,\u201d he told CNN. Sidiropoulos\u2019 travel agency, Trekking Hellas, now offers some activities when temperatures are lower, such as during sunrise and sunset hours. \u201cOr at night, with torches,\u201d he adds. Hooked on tourism Climate change\u2019s influence on where tourists are taking their vacations will have serious repercussions for some countries dependent on income from travelers. In Greece, tourism contributes nearly 38 billion euros ($41 billion) - around 20% of the country\u2019s entire economy, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. In Italy, where level three heat alerts \u2014 the highest warning \u2014have recently been issued for the cities of Rome, Perugia and Palermo, tourism represents 10% of the country\u2019s economy, according to the latest figures, with one in every eight jobs linked to the industry. Following Europe\u2019s 2023 summer heat wave, which saw thousands flee from wildfires on the Greek island of Rhodes, there was a 7% rise in expression of concerns about climate change among European travelers, according to the European Travel Commission (ETC), a nonprofit association responsible for the promotion of Europe as a travel destination. This followed a decline in interest in southern Mediterranean vacation locations between the summers of 2022 and 2023, with cooler destinations like the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Denmark becoming more appealing, ETC told CNN. \u201cTravelers are increasingly aware of extreme weather events and their potential impact on their vacations,\u201d Eduardo Santander, CEO of ETC, told CNN, adding that in the future this could cause more travelers to visit southern Europe during spring and late fall instead of during the hotter summer months. For now, Santander said that tourist concerns about climate change tend to be relatively short-lived. \u201cTravelers are concerned after the summer but tend to forget about those events when booking their next holidays in spring,\u201d he said. \u2018Riddled with bites\u2019 Extreme heat is one consequence of climate change impacting tourist hot spots across Europe. But there are others. Warmer conditions caused by climate change are pushing populations of disease-transmitting mosquitoes into new areas of Europe, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Clark, the tourist currently staying on Skyros, said that the number of mosquitoes was very high during the heat wave in early June. \u201cWe were absolutely riddled with bites. There was no wind and even though we sprayed ourselves they still found a way,\u201d Clark told CNN. \u201cIt was definitely the low winds and high temperatures that was causing it.\u201d One key species of mosquito that can spread dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, called Aedes albopictus, is now established in many European countries, including Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, according to ECDC. Andrea Ammon, ECDC director, said travel can contribute to the expansion of the species\u2019 reach. \u201cIncreased international travel from dengue-endemic countries will also increase the risk of imported cases,\u201d she said in a statement. Last year, ECDC recorded 130 locally acquired cases of dengue in Europe, up from 71 cases in 2022. There have been no locally acquired dengue cases reported in Europe so far this summer, ECDC told CNN, but based on previous summer trends they expect the first cases to be reported in the coming weeks. One human case of West Nile virus infection, spread by the native Culex pipiens mosquito, was reported in Spain\u2019s Seville province in March, according to ECDC. Last year, the organization recorded 713 locally acquired human cases of West Nile virus infection in nine EU countries, resulting in 67 deaths. Adapting to the \u2018new normal\u2019 Last summer\u2019s record-breaking temperatures across the globe were driven by a mix of human-caused climate change and the return of the natural , El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which brings warmer global temperatures. This combination raised temperatures to record levels in parts of Europe, the planet\u2019s fastest- warming continent. But even as the impact of El Ni\u00f1o reduces, experts say that the long-term trend of global warming will continue. \u201cClimate change is tilting the odds in favor of more extreme events happening more frequently, and then becoming more severe,\u201d Rebecca Carter, director of climate adaptation and resilience at the World Resources Institute, told CNN. She added that high tourist numbers in some regions of Europe were putting already hard-pressed local authorities under pressure, as they juggle the need to keep residents safe from high heat as well as protecting visitors. Carter said that the travel industry needs to consider climate adaptation. \u201cIt\u2019s something I don\u2019t think the travel industry is thinking about as much as it should,\u201d she said, adding that booking rules could be made more flexible for flights and hotels, for example. \u201cWhen people plan these trips, it\u2019s weeks or months in advance and you can\u2019t predict when a specific place is going to have extreme heat.\u201d Some tourists, such as parents whose children are at school, have less flexibility when deciding travel plans, Carter said. In these circumstances, she said planning was key: \u201cWhat would you do if there was an extreme heat wave, and the power was out? Can you map out in advance where you would go for help?\u201d Sidiropoulos from Trekking Hellas agreed that forward planning was important, but he was keen for visitors to still get out and enjoy the beauty of Greece\u2019s culture and natural world. \u201cI always say to people who are travelling, \u2018don\u2019t stay in your hotel and just do the classic things like go to a restaurant,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou have the opportunity to see nature \u2026 and to see the authentic side of our country.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/travel/europe-heat-waves-tourism-safety-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2015_07_20_travel_shark-attack-how-to-survive", "text": "First things first. Despite some truly terrifying tales of survival, you are incredibly unlikely to be duking it out with a shark any time soon. But sharks do occasionally attack humans \u2013 and they certainly make news when they do: \u2022 A 14-year-old boy was bitten in the leg by a shark at a\u00a0North Carolina beach\u00a0in late June 2024. \u2022 A lifeguard and surf instructor, who also appeared in \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,\u201d after an apparent\u00a0shark\u00a0attack on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii, in late June 2024. \u2022 Florida fire officials asked beachgoers to exercise caution in early June 2024 after three people were injured in two separate shark attacks within just 90 minutes of each other at neighboring Walton County beaches. \u2022 A Russian citizen was killed by a shark in the Red Sea in Egypt on June 2023. While these kinds of encounters understandably cause would-be ocean swimmers to worry, there\u2019s no need to panic about your upcoming beach vacation. The chances of being attacked by a shark are extremely low despite the headlines. The Florida Museum of Natural History\u2019s International Shark Attack File found just 69 confirmed, unprovoked shark attacks on people and 36 confirmed bites worldwide in 2023. That compares with 57 confirmed, unprovoked shark bites on people and 32 bites in 2022. Think about it a minute \u2013 the world population is more than 8 billion people. Many of those live near or vacation at the coast. And that\u2019s all the shark attacks recorded. Your chances of drowning are much, much higher. In 2023, the United States once again led the way in unprovoked attacks in 2023 at 36; Florida had the highest state total at 16. That said, you can take steps to increase your chances of survival during a highly improbable attack, according to shark experts interviewed by CNN Travel. Before you get in the water Know your environment Sharks are salt-water creatures. The ocean is their home; we are the visitors. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to the ocean, you have to assume you could encounter a shark regardless of when or where that is,\u201d said Neil Hammerschlag, director of the Shark Research and Conservation Program at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School.  \u201cFortunately, humans aren\u2019t on the menu, and also fortunately, sharks tend to avoid people.\u201d Still, there are places you\u2019re more likely to encounter a shark.  River mouths are not the best place to swim You should avoid estuaries, said Richard Peirce, an author, shark expert and former chair of the UK-based Shark Trust and Shark Conservation Society.  Their often-murky waters are a favorite with bull sharks, which are the most likely to attack humans along with great whites and tiger sharks. \u201cAn awful lot of attacks occur in river mouths, where there is silt and other material in suspension in the river \u2013 people washing their clothes, people washing themselves,\u201d said Peirce. Hammerschlag pointed out another area where an encounter is more likely: deeper channels between the shoreline and sandbars farther out. Avoid areas with fishing Before you jump in the sea, have a look around the horizon: What do you see? If you see fishing boats, Peirce says \u201cforget it.\u201d \u201cWhether the fishing activity is commercial or recreational, material will often be being discarded, and unwanted dead fish, fish parts and the action of gutting fish are all putting chum in the water and inviting attention from sharks,\u201d he said.   Before you go in, watch for unusual fish activity, such as a whole bunch of small- and medium-sized fish jumping out of the water, Hammerschlag said. That\u2019s a possible sign a shark might be nearby. He also advised to not swim within roughly 50 yards of where someone is fishing from shore. Avoid dusk and dawn Swimming early in the morning or late at night can be lovely, but it\u2019s also the time when a shark attack is most likely. \u201cA lot of shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity,\u201d Peirce says, \u201cdue to reduced visibility and identification ability on the behalf of the shark.\u201d Hang with lifeguards Chris Lowe, professor in marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, advises to \u201cdo your homework\u201d before you go into unfamiliar waters. Bone up a little bit on species you might encounter in different places. If you have any questions, ask a local lifeguard. He said they are a great resource.  \u201cI always recommend people go to guarded beaches. It\u2019s a lot safer,\u201d he said. Don\u2019t wear shiny objects in the water \u201cBe careful with jewelry, anything that flashes because sharks are always looking for fish.\u201d Lowe said. In murky water, a shark may think that flash is a sign of a meal. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t want your hand or foot to get confused with that.\u201d Follow your instincts \u201cProbably the most important thing is to follow your gut,\u201d Hammerschlag said. \u201cIf you feel wary about getting in the water \u2026 just don\u2019t go in the water.\u201d \u201cA lot of people who have been bitten actually said they had a weird sensation before that, like they had an inner voice telling them to get out of the water and they didn\u2019t listen to it,\u201d he said. If a shark is nearby Don\u2019t panic So you\u2019re being circled by a shark. The worst thing you can do right now is panic. \u201cDon\u2019t start splashing around \u2013 you\u2019re just going to excite, incite and encourage the shark\u2019s interest,\u201d said Peirce. Humans, apes, dogs and cats all have paws and hands. If we want to explore something we pick it up and we touch it, we feel it, we put it to our nose. \u201cA shark has got no paws or hands, so if it wants to explore something, the only capability it\u2019s got to do that is to put it in its mouth,\u201d said Peirce.  \u201cThat\u2019s why we often get exploratory bites which don\u2019t result in death and sometimes don\u2019t even result in serious injury. If you go swimming and splashing away, you\u2019re almost inviting the shark to come give you an exploratory or an attack bite.\u201d Maintain eye contact As the shark swims around you, keep your head on a swivel and try to maintain eye contact. \u201cSharks are ambush predators,\u201d Peirce explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re turning around and facing it the whole time while it circles you, it\u2019s not going to be half as comfortable as if it\u2019s able to sneak up from behind.\u201d Hammerschlag concurred, saying you should posture your body toward the shark so it knows you see it and you\u2019re following it. Then slowly back up toward your exit to a boat or shore. If you\u2019re surfing, track the shark with your board, Lowe said. \u201cLet the shark know it\u2019s being watched.\u201d Marine biologists and shark divers Adriana Fragola and Kayleigh Grant show how that eye contact method works with tiger sharks. In a viral TikTok video (see top of story), the shark is seen as Fragola splashes away, capturing its attention. She turns around, faces the approaching shark, remains still in the water and gently deflects the shark away with her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely never going to outswim or outrun a shark if it were actually chasing you,\u201d Fragola says in the video. Stay big or get small This is where it gets complicated. If a shark is clearly in attack mode, you need to make yourself as big as possible in the water, according to Peirce.  \u201cThe bigger you are in the water, the more respect you\u2019ll get,\u201d he said. But if the shark seems to simply be passing through, Peirce\u2019s advice is to roll up into a ball. \u201cIf a shark sees you as a competitor for its food source, that can be one reason it attacks you,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t want to be seen by a great white shark as a competitor \u2013 and if it wasn\u2019t showing massive interest in me \u2013 I would actually curl up so he shows even less interest in me.\u201d If you\u2019re being attacked Don\u2019t play dead This isn\u2019t a bear, it\u2019s a shark. If you find yourself in an aggressive encounter, give it hell: punch, kick and poke at sensitive spots \u2013 but be careful where you aim. \u201cThere\u2019s all this talk about punching a shark in the nose. That\u2019s OK, but remember that just underneath the nose is a mouth,\u201d said Peirce.  \u201cThis is a moving object in the water and you\u2019re not staying still either, so what you don\u2019t want to do is end up effectively punching at the mouth or anywhere near it.\u201d A good shot to the gills can also do the job: \u201cThe gills are very sensitive \u2013 giving a shark a whack in the gills isn\u2019t a bad idea.\u201d Are you carrying anything with you? If so, turn it into a weapon.  \u201cIf you\u2019re a diver with an underwater camera, use it, if you\u2019re a snorkeler, rip off your snorkel and use it to poke the shark,\u201d Peirce says. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of sharks come at me, and it\u2019s (been) enough to use a shark billy \u2013 a small metal rod between two and three feet long \u2013 and I\u2019ve just given them a little nudge on their nose.\u201d It\u2019s a good idea to swim with other people, Lowe said. Not only does that decrease the chances of an attack, he said, but you\u2019ve got someone to assist you to a boat or shore if you are bitten. Cut off the angles If you\u2019re a diver and you run into trouble, try to get into a position where the shark can\u2019t get behind you, says Peirce. \u201cKeep your back to something like a coral reef. Then you\u2019ve only got one direction to look. You\u2019re protected from behind, for example, and that enables you to keep the shark in sight in front of you and maybe swim to the top of the reef slowly to where your boat is.\u201d Slowly back away Displace the least amount of water possible. Try not to thrash and splash around as you gradually swim backwards toward shore. \u201cYou must try and keep the animal in sight and very slowly and gently try and swim backwards and get into shallow water. Again, you\u2019ve got to be careful \u2013 large sharks can attack in very shallow depths.\u201d Doing the above may help to a degree, but Peirce says the likelihood of escaping without injury when a big shark attacks is slim. \u201cIf a white shark is in full attack mode, there\u2019s not much you\u2019re going to be able to do at that point,\u201d he says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2015/07/20/travel/shark-attack-how-to-survive/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_asia_myanmar-junta-weapons-thailand-banks-intl-hnk", "text": "International banks are playing a significant role in the Myanmar military junta\u2019s ability to carry out its systematic and deadly assault on its people, a new United Nations-backed report has found. Thai banks have now become the\u00a0main source through which the Myanmar military is buying weapons and military supplies \u2013 including parts for helicopter gunships \u2013 used to support its three-year civil war that has devastated the country and killed more than 5,000 civilians, Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Myanmar, said in a new report Wednesday. Since\u00a0seizing power in a coup in February 2021, the military has been fighting a deepening war against ethnic armed groups and people\u2019s resistance forces across Myanmar. In recent months it has faced significant losses of territory and troops. As it contends with widespread public opposition and an economic crisis that has sparked\u00a0soaring levels of poverty,\u00a0the junta has increased airstrikes and attacks against civilians\u00a0and civilian infrastructure, displacing more than 3 million people. Andrews said the junta has increased its deadly aerial attacks against civilian targets by \u201cfivefold\u201d in the past six months, fueling the humanitarian crisis as it seeks to \u201cscare\u201d civilians into ceasing resistance to the military. \u201cThey\u2019re able to do that by procuring weapons from abroad, and that\u2019s made possible by the services they receive from these banks,\u201d Andrews told CNN. The military\u2019s brutal campaign of violence has prompted Western nations to impose wide-ranging sanctions on military leaders, family and cronies, state-owned companies, banks, and jet fuel suppliers. The report, \u201cBanking on the Death Trade: How Banks and Governments Enable the Military Junta in Myanmar,\u201d found that 16 banks in seven countries have processed transactions linked to the military\u2019s procurement in the past year. Weapons, dual-use technologies, manufacturing equipment, and raw materials secured by the junta from abroad reached $253 million between April 2023 and March 2024, the report said. \u201cBy relying on financial institutions that are willing to do business with Myanmar state-owned banks under its control, the junta has ready access to the financial services it needs to carry out systematic human rights violations, including aerial attacks on civilians,\u201d Andrews wrote in the report. However, the volume of weapons and military supplies purchased by the junta through foreign banks has decreased by a third from 2023, with exports from Singapore dropping dramatically, according to the report. \u201cThe good news is that the junta is increasingly isolated,\u201d the report said.\u00a0\u201cThe bad news is that the junta is circumventing sanctions and other measures by exploiting gaps in sanctions regimes, shifting financial institutions, and taking advantage of the failure of Member States to fully coordinate and enforce actions.\u201d International banks, Andrews said, need to know there is a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d that transactions involving Myanmar\u2019s state-owned entities could be used to buy the weapons or weapons-grade materials fueling the junta\u2019s war-chest. \u201cIf you want to be sure that isn\u2019t happening, then don\u2019t conduct business with Myanmar\u2019s state-owned banks,\u201d he said. The Thai connection Singapore-based entities were Myanmar\u2019s third largest source of weapons and military materials. But following a government investigation, the flow of weapons materials to Myanmar from Singapore-registered companies dropped by nearly 90% compared to the previous year. In 2022, Singapore-based banks facilitated more than 70% of the junta\u2019s purchases passing through the banking system. By 2023, that had dropped to under 20%, the report found. Looking for other financial institutions, the junta found neighboring Thailand. Between 2022 and 2023, exports of\u00a0weapons and related materials from Thai-based entities more than doubled, from $60 million to nearly $130 million last year. \u201cMany SAC (junta) purchases previously made from Singapore-based entities, including parts for Mi-17 and Mi-35 helicopters used to conduct airstrikes on civilian targets, are now being sourced from Thailand,\u201d the report said. Siam Commercial Bank is among the Thai banks that have played a \u201ccrucial role\u201d in the shift, the report found. In 2022, the bank\u00a0facilitated just over $5 million in transactions relating to the military; by 2023 that figure ballooned to more than $100 million, according to the report. In a statement, SCB said it provides \u201cinternational transaction services\u201d between Thailand and Myanmar \u201cwith the primary objective of supporting Thai and international businesses in paying for consumer products and services to Myanmar.\u201d SCB\u2019s statement said the bank complies with all relevant anti-money laundering laws, and an internal investigation determined its transactions with Myanmar are not connected to the arms trade. \u201cSCB reaffirms its commitment to adhering to relevant anti-money laundering and related regulations,\u201d the statement added. A spokesperson for Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN, \u201cwe have seen the report and are looking into it.\u201d \u201cMany countries have been named and certainly these are countries where the majority of financial transactions in the region would pass through,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cOur banking and financial institutions follow banking protocols as any major financial hub. So we will have to first establish the facts before considering any further steps.\u201d Andrews told CNN he welcomed the Thai government\u2019s decision to \u201clook into the facts.\u201d \u201cI am hopeful that (the investigation) is going to lead to positive changes in Thailand, much as it did in Singapore,\u201d he said. In his report, Andrews said it was \u201ccritical\u201d that \u201cfinancial institutions take their human rights obligations seriously and not facilitate the junta\u2019s deadly transactions.\u201d In addition, sanctioning the networks supplying jet fuel to the junta and the military\u2019s \u201cgo-to bank\u201d Myanma Economic Bank, \u201ccould play a decisive role in helping to turn the tide in Myanmar and saving untold numbers of lives,\u201d the report said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/asia/myanmar-junta-weapons-thailand-banks-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_middleeast_us-new-language-hamas-israel-framework-intl", "text": "The United States has proposed new language to bridge gaps in discussions for a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, a senior US administration official said Friday. The three-phase Israeli proposal, outlined by US President Joe Biden last month, sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages being held by Hamas, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. But dashing hopes for a breakthrough, earlier this month Hamas responded to the Israeli proposal with further amendments. Israel has also not publicly accepted the plan. CNN contributor Barak Ravid first reported the news in Axios, citing three unnamed sources with direct knowledge. The US is pushing Egypt and Qatar to press Hamas to accept the change in language, according to Ravid. One source cited by Ravid said that if Hamas accepts the new language, it will \u201callow to close the deal.\u201d According to the sources cited by Ravid, the new language presented by the US focuses on the period during the first phase of the proposal where Israel and Hamas are expected to start more negotiations with the intention of activating a second phase, where a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza is implemented. The proposed US language aims to bridge a current disagreement triggered by Hamas\u2019 demands that negotiations for the second phase only focus on the number and identity of Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails as part of the deal, while Israel wants to have the ability to raise demilitarization of Gaza and other issues, the sources said according to Ravid. CNN has not seen the latest proposal and has reached out to Qatari and Egyptian officials. The second phase of the proposal has been a source of disagreement in the months-long negotiation between Israel and Hamas. Hamas has called for a permanent end to the war and a complete Israeli military withdrawal, while Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, had vowed for the continuation of the war until Hamas are eliminated. On Sunday, Netanyahu told Israel\u2019s Channel 14 he was ready to make \u201ca partial deal\u201d with Hamas to return only some hostages from Gaza, in comments that were at odds with the proposal. Netanyahu added that Israel will continue fighting in the enclave after the ceasefire. He walked back the comments a day later after fierce backlash from families of the hostages and several Israeli politicians. Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan told a news conference in Beirut Saturday that the most recent proposal it received was on June 24 and it fell short of meeting its demands for a permanent ceasefire and complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. \u201cThere is no real change in the negotiation to stop the hostilities until now, what is being reported on behalf of the US administration is within the context of applying pressure on (Hamas) to accept the Israeli proposal without any amendments,\u201d Hamdan said. Any proposal that did not include Hamas\u2019s core demands on a ceasefire and withdrawal was \u201ca waste of time,\u201d Hamdan added. He cited Netanyahu\u2019s remarks in the Channel 14 interview as showing that Israel will \u201ccontinue refusing to accept a permanent ceasefire and do not accept a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.\u201d Hamdan said he holds Netanyahu and his government responsible for the stall, describing Israel\u2019s position as an \u201cequivocation and evasion\u201d from the articles of the agreement. He also accused the US administration of being \u201cconniving\u201d in holding Hamas responsible for stalling the agreement, saying the group welcomed Biden\u2019s speech at the end of May and the UN Security Council resolution endorsing the proposal on the table. An Israeli government official said late Saturday that Israel is committed to the wording of the proposal that Biden welcomed and that its position has not changed. \u201cUp to this moment, Hamas has not responded to this proposal,\u201d the official said. Fighting meanwhile continued in a neighborhood of\u00a0Gaza\u00a0City, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and local officials, months after Israel said it had dismantled Hamas in the north. \u201cTroops are continuing operational activity against terror targets in the Shejaiya area, fighting simultaneously above and below ground,\u201d the IDF said, adding that the Israeli Air Force \u201cstruck terror targets and armed terrorist cells\u201d as part of their operations in the neighborhood, which began on Thursday. Gaza\u2019s civil defense officials said they had received numerous calls for help from injured people trapped by fighting in Shujaiya. \u201cA number of victims are still under the rubble and on the roads, and ambulance and civil defense crews cannot reach them,\u201d the Palestinian Ministry of Health in\u00a0Gaza said. The total number of Palestinians killed in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0since Oct. 7 is now 37,834, while the number of injuries has risen to 86,858.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/middleeast/us-new-language-hamas-israel-framework-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_tech_microsoft-teams-eu-antitrust", "text": "Microsoft has violated European Union antitrust laws by bundling Teams with its other popular applications for businesses, EU officials said Tuesday, marking the bloc\u2019s latest challenge to a US tech giant. If confirmed, the preliminary findings of an EU investigation could lead to a fine of up to 10% of Microsoft\u2019s global revenue, which totaled $211 billion in its latest financial year. The announcement comes a day after EU regulators accused Apple (AAPL) of breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act, a groundbreaking law that forced big changes on dominant tech platforms after it came into force in March. Apple, which has denied wrongdoing, also faces a huge fine if the charges are confirmed. The actions by the EU could result in changes to the way hundreds of millions of Europeans access services on some of the world\u2019s biggest digital platforms, reflecting a big push by European lawmakers to rein in the power of Big Tech. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, opened an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s software practices almost a year ago following a complaint in 2020 by the cloud-based internal messaging app Slack, which is now owned by Salesforce (CRM). Slack alleged that Microsoft (MSFT) had given Teams, which offers messaging, calling and video meetings, an unfair advantage by automatically including it with its Office software and thereby denying Slack an opportunity to compete on a level playing field. The European Commission shares Slack\u2019s worries. \u201cWe are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager said in statement. \u201cPreserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets. If confirmed, Microsoft\u2019s conduct would be illegal under our competition rules,\u201d she added. According to the Commission, Microsoft has been forcing customers to acquire Teams by automatically including the tool in its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites. The company\u2019s advantage over rivals \u201cmay have been further exacerbated by interoperability limitations between Teams\u2019 competitors and Microsoft\u2019s offerings. The conduct may have prevented Teams\u2019 rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers,\u201d the Commission said. Microsoft announced last year that it would stop the Teams bundling practice in Europe and extended the same commitment globally in April. But, while the Commission acknowledged that the company had started offering \u201csome suites without Teams,\u201d it said it believes \u201cmore changes to Microsoft\u2019s conduct are necessary to restore competition.\u201d In a statement, Microsoft President Brad Smith said: \u201cHaving unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission\u2019s remaining concerns.\u201d Salesforce, meanwhile, welcomed the Commission\u2019s findings, calling its actions \u201ca win for customer choice and an affirmation that Microsoft practices with Teams have harmed competition.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_29_sport_switzerland-italy-euro-2024-last-16-spt-intl", "text": "Reigning champion Italy was knocked out of Euro 2024 in the last 16 after Switzerland produced a stunning upset to win 2-0 on Saturday at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. Goals from Remo Freuler and Ruben Vargas either side of halftime were enough for Murat Yakin\u2019s side to book its place in the next round, as a sluggish Italy side which struggled to get a foothold in the game suffered an earlier than planned exit. Switzerland\u2019s early dominance was eventually rewarded in the 37th minute, as Freuler picked up the ball inside the penalty area from Vargas before his slightly deflected effort towards the near post with Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma unable to keep out. Swiss supporters didn\u2019t have to wait long after the break for a second goal \u2013 only 27 seconds to be exact. Italy\u2019s continued sloppiness on the ball carried over into the second half, immediately giving the ball away from it\u2019s own kickoff. Switzerland worked their way forward before Vargas curled a stunning effort from the edge of the box into the top right corner to leave the Italians reeling. While Switzerland deservedly advanced, it was an uncharacteristically\u00a0out-of-sorts performance for Italy, who\u2019s defense of its title ends in the first knockout game of the tournament. Italy\u2019s defeat means that the reigning champion has been eliminated in the round of 16 at the last three Euros. Switzerland now awaits the winner of Sunday\u2019s matchup between England and Slovakia to find out who it will face in the quarterfinals. Italy was without defender Riccardo Calafiori \u2013 who has emerged as one of the tournament\u2019s breakout stars \u2013 due to suspension, with Gianluca Mancini starting in his place. It was a cagey opening to the game, with clear-cut chances hard to come by. Switzerland started the brighter of the two sides, keeping Italy out of possession with an effective press, though the compact Italian defense prevented the Swiss side from having any real sights of goal in the opening 20 minutes. Switzerland was able to pick holes in the Italy backline eventually though, with Breel Embolo latching onto a through-ball over the top around the 20-minute mark. However, the striker squandered a gilt-edged chance, firing a tame effort against the palms of Donnarumma. The game appeared to spark into life at this point, with veteran forward Stephan El Shaarawy jinking past a pair of Swiss defenders before seeing his shot on goal blocked by Manuel Akanji. Italy\u2019s struggles playing out from the back persisted throughout the first half and was frequently pinned back by the constant press. Switzerland defender Ricardo Rodriguez attempted to break the deadlock in spectacular fashion but his effort from long range sailed over the crossbar. The breakthrough did come shortly after though for Switzerland; with red shirts flooding into the box, Vargas picked out Freuler who managed to squeeze his shot from close range past Donnarumma. The Azzurri, who had gone behind for the fourth game in a row, was unable to really trouble the Swiss defense in the opening 45 minutes and didn\u2019t show any signs of improving after going behind. Switzerland almost doubled its lead shortly before halftime when Fabian Rieder attempted to catch Donnarumma off-guard with a whipped free kick from the right flank, but the Italian keeper scrambled across his goal to tip the strike onto the near post. Yakin\u2019s team showed no signs of easing up after the break, with Vargas scoring the second-fastest second-half goal in Euros history, per the BBC. A stroke of luck very nearly got Luciano Spalletti\u2019s side back into the game, with Swiss defender Fabian Sch\u00e4r invertedly heading the ball against his own post with goalkeeper Yann Sommer rooted to the spot. Italy showed slightly more attacking intent after going two goals down, often finding space down the flanks through Federico Chiesa and Mattia Zaccagni, though it struggled to convert this threat into goalscoring opportunities. The Azzuri\u2019s best chance of the game came in the 73rd minute when Gianluca Scamacca\u2019s poked shot from close range struck the woodwork, before Nicol\u00f2 Fagioli fired well over from distance. Ultimately however, the Euro 2020 champion was unable to produce anything of substance in an uninspiring performance other than the occasional long-range strike against a well-organized and relentless Swiss team that looked dangerous every time it was on the ball.

{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_israel-gaza-children-starvation-malnutrition-intl", "text": "Younis lays disorientated on a green mattress in\u00a0Nasser Hospital, in southern Gaza. His long brown eyelashes rest delicately on his pale sunken face, as he drifts in and out of sleep. The 9-year-old Palestinian boy lies in his mother\u2019s arms, clearly wasted from severe malnutrition and suffering from dehydration. His blue jogging bottoms hang off his emaciated legs, as his tiny ribcage protrudes from his billowy orange T-shirt. \u201cI call on people with conscience to help me find health care for my son, so that he can go back to normal,\u201d his mother, Ghanima Juma\u2019a, told CNN last week at the hospital in Khan Younis. \u201cI am losing my son in front of my eyes.\u201d Two months ago, the family was forced to flee the southern city of Rafah as Israel ramped up its attacks there. These days, they struggle to survive, living along the polluted coastline of Asda\u2019a \u2014 near the Al-Mawasi tent camp \u2014 where they cannot find enough food, water, or even shade from the Gaza heat. \u201cWe have to keep moving from one area to the other because of the war and the invasion\u2026 Life is difficult,\u201d his mother said. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a tent over our heads.\u201d Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has depleted the territory\u2019s health system, leaving staff unable to treat malnourished children. Doctors told CNN they are being forced to turn away parents begging for baby milk, unable to even triage young patients with chronic illnesses compounded by severe hunger. And as Israel continues its siege on Gaza,\u00a0preventing aid groups getting enough food into the enclave, parents say they have no choice but to watch their children starve to death.\u00a0More than eight months of bombardment has shredded infrastructure, wiped out communities and laid waste to entire neighborhoods. Sanitation systems \u2014\u00a0already stressed by water shortages from extreme heat \u2014\u00a0have been heavily destroyed, according to\u00a0the UN, diminishing access to clean water. A report published Tuesday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which assesses global food insecurity and malnutrition, warned that almost all of Gaza will\u00a0face famine\u00a0within the next three months. The UN\u2019s food agency earlier warned that southern Gaza could soon see the same \u201ccatastrophic levels of hunger\u201d recorded previously\u00a0in the north,\u00a0where Israel concentrated its military offensive in the early days of the war. At least 34 children have already died of malnutrition in Gaza, the government media office reported on June 22. The true number could be higher, as limited access to Gaza has impeded aid agencies\u2019 efforts to fully assess the crisis there. More than 50,000 children require treatment for acute malnutrition, the\u00a0UN\u2019s agency for Palestine refugees\u00a0(UNRWA) said earlier this month. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on southern Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were abducted. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed\u00a037,658 Palestinians\u00a0and injured another\u00a086,237 people, according to Gaza health officials. Severe water shortages As Younis suffers in his mother\u2019s arms in Gaza\u2019s south, children in the north have been dealing with food shortages even longer. In the Jabalya refugee camp, they queue at a water truck, beads of sweat rolling down their faces, as they weave through the rubble-filled streets. Dozens of other Gazans crowd together to access water as aid workers nearby distribute thick, steaming red soup from large saucepans. It\u2019s rare access to food and clean water. Those in the north told CNN they have resorted lately to drinking polluted water, which does little to help dehydration and spreads infectious diseases. Israel insists there is \u201cno limit\u201d on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, but its inspection regime on trucks, restrictions on land routes and increased bombardment means relief is barely trickling in.\u00a0Even when aid enters the besieged territory, the risk of hungry Palestinians scrambling over convoys hampers distribution efforts. UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u00a0recently\u00a0warned the\u00a0absence of police authorities in Gaza during the conflict had led to \u201ctotal lawlessness.\u201d Earlier this year, the UN\u00a0warned that\u00a0Israel is creating an \u201centirely man-made disaster\u201d in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has\u00a0\u00a0denied allegations\u00a0by the International Criminal Court\u2019s chief prosecutor that he has used \u201cstarvation of civilians as a method of warfare.\u201d \u201cThe only water we have is what we get as aid. People are suffering as a result, it is indescribable,\u201d said one civilian named Hassan Kalash.\u00a0\u201cWe are ill and don\u2019t have the strength to transport the water\u2026 The water pipe is broken. We do not have water infrastructure.\u201d Civilians there told CNN they have no access to running water, relying on scant aid entering the area. At least 67% of water and sanitation facilities in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed or damaged in the eight months of bombardment,\u00a0UNRWA\u00a0said last week. All of five wastewater treatment plants in Gaza have shut down,\u00a0according to the UN Environment Programme. The UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has\u00a0accused Israeli authorities of obstructing humanitarian access to northern Gaza. In the first three weeks of\u00a0June,\u00a036 trucks carrying aid \u2014\u00a0 which were facilitated by Israel \u2014 were allowed to reach Gaza, while another 35 were either denied access,\u00a0impeded\u00a0or canceled due to logistical, operational or security reasons. The impact on the ground is visceral. In Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza, 5-year-old Razan wears a gold ring on her finger, which is covered in red sores. The Palestinian girl is sprawled on a trolley in the central Gaza facility, her grey eyes weary with exhaustion. \u201cShe changed after the war. She became weak,\u201d her aunt, Um Razan Mheitem, told CNN, adding that her niece had developed skin inflammation due to malnutrition. \u201cWe cannot find anything for her. Everything in the market is expensive, or not available.\u201d \u2018Waiting for them to die, one by one\u2019 Newborn babies and pregnant women are among the most at risk of malnutrition and dehydration in Gaza, according to aid agencies and health workers. Undernourished mothers are more likely to give birth prematurely, with\u00a0newborns dying because they weigh too little. At the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, doctors were unable to keep baby Amal alive just four days after her birth. CNN filmed the moments before her death, showing Amal drawing heavy breaths in an incubator, after her mother, Samaher, gave birth two months prematurely. Her tiny pink toes are covered in plastic tubes. \u201cThese babies are dying. It is God\u2019s decision, but it is caused by people,\u201d her father, Ahmed Maqat, told CNN, after she died on Saturday. Samaher had endured months of her pregnancy without sleeping, eating or drinking, Maqat said. \u201cEveryone in these beds today is at risk of dying. We are waiting for them to die one by one,\u201d he added, his voice quivering with grief. \u201cWe have no life.\u201d Dr Ahmed Kahlot, head of the incubators department at Kamal Adwan, told CNN that Samaher\u2019s poor health meant her daughter was just \u201cwaiting for death.\u201d Many of those who do survive are too dehydrated and malnourished to breastfeed their children. But health workers told CNN there are few alternatives, with shortages of lactose free or soya milk for infants. Another Palestinian in Kamal Adwan Hospital told CNN that her son, who suffers from an inflamed esophagus, is unable to access soya milk, which he needs in his condition. \u201cHe hardly sits,\u201d she said of her 2-year-old child. \u201cHe cannot even crawl, cannot walk.\u201d Around 250 patients are receiving treatment for malnutrition at the hospital, and there are only two functioning stabilization centers for severely malnourished children in Gaza, OCHA reported\u00a0earlier this month, endangering almost 3,000 children, who were receiving treatment for acute malnutrition in the south prior to the military escalation in Rafah. Doctors say they are often unable to treat babies who show symptoms of malnutrition, including breathing problems, chest infections, and severe dehydration, amid dwindling medical supplies. Malnourished patients with chronic or infectious illnesses are less likely to recover,\u00a0a local pediatrician\u00a0told CNN, as the spread of\u00a0disease spikes\u00a0in displacement shelters. Authorities in Gaza have recorded more than 1.4 million cases of infectious diseases since October 7, according to the Ministry of Health there. As hunger worsens and parts of the enclave hurtle towards widespread famine, aid agencies have repeatedly called for the opening of land crossings into Gaza, which they say are the most effective way of getting relief into the strip. A US-built floating pier designed to bring in aid in by sea has been beset by problems \u2014\u00a0from unfavorable sea conditions to distribution issues once the aid ins transferred on land \u2014\u00a0failing to make a meaningful difference to the crisis. Back in Khan Younis, Ismail Madi told CNN last week how worried he was for his 4-year-old son, Ahmad, who was suffering jaundice from malnutrition. \u201cMy son will not be able to survive this,\u201d he said. \u201cI call on the American president Joe Biden\u2026 to intervene,\u201d added Madi, \u201cto save this child who has nothing at all to do with any political conflict.\u201d But just days later, the boy died. With other young children to provide for, Madi\u2019s life as a parent is full of stress. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to feed a family of 10 in these difficult times.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/middleeast/israel-gaza-children-starvation-malnutrition-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

Fresh protests dubbed \u201cOne Million People March\u201d began Thursday, with demonstrators calling for roads leading to the capital Nairobi to be blocked. Others threatened to occupy the State House, the president\u2019s office,\u00a0and the official residence. In a surprise move on Wednesday, Ruto said he would not sign the finance bill, saying he had been \u201clistening keenly\u201d to the Kenyan people. He had been facing escalating protests over the bill, with a civil society organization saying at least 23 people had died in clashes. But so far his move has failed to quell the demonstrations. Security forces have set up roadblocks around routes leading to the State House while other parts of the capital city have been fortified with heavy police presence. \u201cIt\u2019s more than about the finance bill now,\u201d Maria, a Kenyan protestor from Nairobi told CNN. \u201c(They\u2019re) killing us as young people for what? We come in peace,\u201d she added. Despite being billed as a \u2018million people march,\u2019 turnout was noticeably lower in Nairobi\u2019s central business district, a CNN team observed. The heavy security presence within the city deterred a crowd from forming with police shouting at protesters to \u201cgo home\u201d in Swahili. What the largely youthful protesters now want varies. Some have called on President Ruto to resign for failing to withdraw the unpopular bill much earlier to save the lives lost. Others are seeking justice for the deceased protesters and demanding the recall of lawmakers who voted in support of the finance bill. \u201cI want them to listen to me,\u201d another protester told CNN. Civic groups such as the Law Society of\u00a0Kenya\u00a0are calling for the removal of\u00a0Kenya\u2019s inspector general of police and Nairobi\u2019s regional police commander after officers were accused of reportedly shooting dead protesters. Kenya, East Africa\u2019s dominant economy, has grappled with escalating living costs that have spiked food prices and other commodities. The nation also owes billions of dollars in foreign and local debts, spending a sizeable chunk of its revenue repaying its creditors. \u201cI am not going to preside over a bankrupt country, I am not going to preside over a country that is in debt distress,\u201d President Ruto said last month while defending his plans. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern about a \u201csignificant shortfall\u201d in Kenya\u2019s \u201ctax revenue collection\u201d while urging its government to consider measures to shore up its earnings to reduce borrowing. The bill proposed levies on locally produced products, such as diapers and sanitary towels, including taxes on motor vehicles, and\u00a0mobile money transfer fees, among others. Last week, Ruto shelved some of those taxes, but Kenyans remain angry, and called for the bill to\u00a0be\u00a0scrapped completely. International financial ratings\u00a0agency\u00a0Moody\u2019s warned that scrapping the bill \u201cwill create a revenue shortfall\u201d in Kenya\u2019s budgeting. Ruto warned of spending cuts across government financing if the tax measures were withdrawn. Ruto\u2019s leadership is now being tested like never before. His ability to navigate this period of unrest will be critical not only for his political survival but also for the stability of\u00a0Kenya. The ongoing protests suggest that mere policy reversals may not be sufficient. Analyst Herman Manyora, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi,\u00a0told CNN the\u00a0president\u00a0may need to engage in more substantial reforms to restore faith in his administration. \u201cThe way forward is for the president to go a little more than he has done now in order to get the goodwill of the people,\u201d Manyora said. \u201cHe needs to reshuffle his cabinet and economic advisers which will send a signal that will create the goodwill required. At that point, a government-led conversation can take place.\u201d Ruto, whose rise to the presidency was largely propelled by youth voters said in his address retracting the finance bill that he hoped to engage with young people in the country to listen to their ideas and proposals on how to solve the nation\u2019s economic challenges. But that won\u2019t come easy, Manyora said. \u201cThey (young people) feel betrayed.

Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_sport_germany-denmark-last-16-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Euro 2024 host Germany moved onto the quarterfinals of the tournament after beating Denmark 2-0 in a pulsating encounter at the BVB Stadion in Dortmund on Saturday. The game was delayed midway through the first half after lightning and driving rain forced the players off the pitch for around 25 minutes. Second half goals from Kai Havertz and Jamal Musiala \u2013 a contender for the player of the tournament award \u2013 sent\u00a0Die Mannschaft\u00a0into the next round as it held off a valiant Denmark side which appeared much improved from the group stage. After an end-to-end first half ended goalless, a frenzied start to the second period saw Denmark have a goal disallowed and concede a penalty within the space of a couple of minutes, with Havertz scoring from the spot to give Germany the lead. The lead was doubled in the 68th minute when Musiala found himself one-on-one goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, coolly slotting home to send the home fans into raptures. It was a disappointing evening for the Danish team, who battled hard but faded in the latter stages of the match, unable to find a breakthrough. Germany will take on either Spain or Georgia in the quarterfinals. Drama in Dortmund Denmark began the match yet to win a game at the tournament, having drawn each of its Group C fixtures against Slovenia, England and Denmark and scoring just twice in those three game. Its lack of attacking output was evident in the early stages, as Germany dominated possession and rained down shots on the Danish goal. The tournament host thought it had opened the scoring in the fourth minute when Nico Schlotterbeck rose highest to nod home from a corner, but referee Michael Oliver disallowed the goal after Joshua Kimmich was penalized for blocking Andreas Skov Olsen allowing Schlotterbeck to get free for the header. Germany maintained its rapid start, with Kimmich stinging the palms of Schmeichel from long range before the Denmark stopper tipped another Schlotterbeck header past the post. The Danes grew into the game however, with Christian Eriksen seeing a shot blocked and wing-back Joakim M\u00e6hle racing down the left flank before wastefully firing wide. Both sides looked threatening on the counter-attack, producing an end-to-end first half, but the free-flowing nature of the game was interrupted when the referee suspended proceedings due to adverse weather conditions. Both squads headed back out after a 25-minute delay with the match resuming around the 36-minute mark. The stormy conditions seemed to deliver a further jolt of life into an already electrifying affair. Havertz met a David Raum cross in the air but the Arsenal forward\u2019s header was straight at Schmeichel, while Schlotterbeck saw yet another headed effort drift wide moments later. The defender then had his blushes spared in the other penalty area after giving the ball away to Rasmus H\u00f8jlund, but the striker could only find the side netting. The second half began in a similarly chaotic fashion which produced a whirlwind few minutes for Denmark\u2019s Joachim Andersen. The defender thought he had scored his first international goal when he swept the ball in after a scramble in the box, but saw it disallowed by the video assistant referee (VAR) for an extremely tight offside in the buildup. Andersen\u2019s misery was compounded when VAR penalized him for a handball in his own box, with Havertz tucking away the resulting penalty to give Germany the lead in the 53rd minute. Havertz missed a glorious chance to double the lead shortly afterwards after being one-on-one with Schmeichel but wasn\u2019t made to rue his mistake as Musiala found the back of the net minutes later. The second goal was a crushing blow for Denmark, who had threatened to spoil the party on multiple occasions but ran out of steam towards the end of the game. It was hard-fought and nervy at times for Germany, but the host nation could it be on its way to a Euros triumph on home soil.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_sport_euro-2024-austria-biggest-surprise-spt-intl", "text": "It is not uncommon to see certain teams emerge as dark horses or surprise packages at international tournaments, but few could have predicted that Austria would be the story of Euro 2024. Placed in Group D alongside some tough opponents, it seemed as though Austria would have a hard time reaching the knockout stages. Poland possesses one of the most lethal strikers of all time in Robert Lewandowski.The Netherlands are loaded with talent, particularly along their backline. France is fresh off a World Cup campaign in 2022 where it finished as runner-up and is captained by superstar forward Kylian Mbapp\u00e9. After a hard-fought but disappointing 1-0 defeat against France on matchday one, it appeared as though the writing was on the wall for Das Team. So it came as a shock when Austria reeled off 3-1 and 3-2 victories against Poland and the Netherlands respectively to top the group and advance to the round of 16 of the Euros for only the second time. The victory against the star-studded Dutch side \u2013 Austria\u2019s first in 34 years \u2013 sparked wild celebrations amongst the squad. \u201cWhen you beat the Netherlands and win the group, then you can\u2019t be that bad,\u201d Marcel Sabitzer, who scored against the Netherlands, told UEFA.tv \u201cTo actually become the group winner in the end, that\u2019s incredible,\u201d said manager Ralf Rangnick. \u201cThe probability that both things will happen, us winning this game and at the same time France not winning (against Poland), whoever would have placed a bet on that would probably be a rich man or woman now. \u201cBut that\u2019s the great thing about football, that things like that happen.\u201d A unique style At major tournaments, importance is often placed on grinding out a result no matter what. Every point counts in the group stage, while it\u2019s \u2018win or go home\u2019 in the knockout rounds. Conservative styles of play can often be rewarded, but Austria has opted for more of a risk-taking mentality. A vibrant, high-octane approach that features constant movement has made Austria one of the most enjoyable teams to watch at the tournament. \u201cYou see that even when we rotate, nothing is missed,\u201d added Sabitzer. \u201cEverybody knows what they have to do in their position when they\u2019re on the pitch.\u201d Austria\u2019s transformation can be traced back to the appointment of Rangnick in 2022. The German coach is often credited with developing gegenpressing, a style of soccer that involves the relentless pressing of the opposition immediately after losing possession. He has influenced the likes of former Liverpool boss J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Julian Nagelsmann, currently the manager of the Germany national team. This approach can be incredibly tiring and leave Rangnick\u2019s teams vulnerable defensively, but can be overwhelming for opposing teams to deal with and makes for a thrilling watch at a tournament where there has occasionally been a dearth of entertainment. Austria scored six goals in their three group games \u2013 Group C\u2019s England, Denmark, Slovenia and Serbia only managed to find the net seven times between them in six games. Rangnick\u2019s redemption Perhaps the most compelling aspect of Austria\u2019s Euro 2024 campaign has been the reminder of Rangnick\u2019s abilities as a manager. The 66-year-old has an extensive coaching CV, having taken his first job in 1983.He had various stints with German clubs such as Stuttgart, Hannover and Schalke but is best known for his work with Austrian side Red Bull Salzburg and German team RB Leipzig. Both clubs belong the Red Bull GmbH conglomerate (RB Leipzig was only founded in 2009), with Rangnick being hired as sporting director of both clubs in 2012. He saw an extended period of success with Salzburg, winning the Austrian Bundesliga multiple times, while he oversaw the promotion of Leipzig from the fourth tier to the German Bundesliga. He managed Leipzig on two separate occasions as well, leading them into their first match at the highest level in 2018. He also guided the team into the Champions League for the first time in its history. After resigning from Red Bull in 2020, he had a four-month spell as manager of sports and development for Russian side Lokomotiv Moscow in 2021 before he was offered one of the biggest jobs of them all. Rangnick was appointed as interim Manchester United manager in November 2021 after the 13-time English Premier League champions parted ways with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. Tasked with turning around the fortunes of one of the biggest clubs in the world, Rangnick was handed the reigns until the end of the season but was unable to fully instill his footballing philosophy into his players and the team\u2019s struggles continued, finishing sixth in the league. He was initially slated to stay on in a consultancy role at the club, but left United altogether at the end of the 2021/22 campaign. Results were initially shaky when he was hired by Austria. The side was relegated to Nations League B, picking up only one win in the campaign. Form soon picked up though and Das Team booked its ticket to Euro 2024 after losing only one game in the qualifying stages. Having weathered the storm in a difficult group and a round of 16 match just around the corner, Rangnick\u2019s reputation is well on its way to being restored. How far can they go? Austria is set to take on Turkey on Tuesday, with the winner advancing to the quarterfinal. The match kicks of at 3 p.m. E.T. A win would take Rangnick\u2019s side into unchartered territory, having never advanced beyond the round of 16 at the Euros. The German wants to make sure that his players don\u2019t get ahead of themselves and played down his team\u2019s chances, but wouldn\u2019t go as far as ruling out his team making a fairytale run to the final. \u201cI said a few weeks or months ago that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very likely that we\u2019ll become European champions,\u201d he said when asked about the possibility. \u201cI think the boys are all ambitious themselves, they want to get as far as they can. But it\u2019s only possible step by step, game by game. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to approach the next few days, preparing ourselves the best we can for each opponent. Despite Rangnick\u2019s steady approach, his players are still riding on the high of winning the group. \u201cThe emotions in our country and among those that were in the stadium were of course huge,\u201d said team captain Marko Arnautovi\u0107. \u201cOur feelings on the pitch were, however, I think, even bigger. It\u2019s an incredibly wonderful feeling. We can still be happy about it today and maybe tomorrow . Then the preparations for the round of 16 will begin.\u201d Time will only tell if Austria can win its first ever major tournament, but this nation has already shaken up the status quo at what has turned out to be an unpredictable Euro 2024.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/sport/euro-2024-austria-biggest-surprise-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 68 were transferred to Cairo, Egypt, on Thursday, Israeli authorities say. COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for approving aid into Gaza, coordinated the passage along with the Israeli military, the US, Egypt and the World Health Organization (WHO). The news provided a moment of relief for the parents, whose children who had been unable to access lifesaving care after more than eight months of Israeli bombardment in Gaza.  \u201cIt was a tough time for us in northern Gaza, nine months of exhaustion, displacement,\u201d Samira Al-Saeedi, whose six-year-old daughter Jouri was evacuated, told CNN earlier this week. \u201cPeople started stealing just to eat\u2026 Sick children cannot withstand famine.\u201d CNN footage from Nasser Hospital on Tuesday showed another evacuee \u2013 five-year-old blood cancer patient Yasmin \u2013 squirming in pain, her emaciated limbs sprawled on a teal mattress. \u201cShe is suffering and moving between hospitals receiving blood treatments\u2026 Every day she feels more pain than the day before,\u201d said her mother Umm Ubaida. \u201cShe is extremely tired. She can\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d The evacuations come with the southern Rafah crossing, a key transit point, still closed despite negotiations on its re-opening. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the evacuation on Friday. He appealed for increased medical passage \u201cvia all possible routes including Rafah and Karem Shalom, to Egypt, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and from there to other countries when needed.\u201d But as Israel\u2019s siege persists \u2013 and the risk of famine grows \u2013 Palestinian officials have warned that the operation was \u201ca drop in the ocean\u201d compared to hundreds more severely ill children who are still trapped in the ravaged enclave.

Israel insists there is \u201cno limit\u201d on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, but human rights agencies warn that its rigid inspection regime on trucks, sustained restrictions on land crossings and relentless bombing campaign means relief is barely dripping in. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on southern Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were abducted.

{"id": "2024_06_29_europe_france-parliament-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "Polls have opened for the first round of France\u2019s snap parliamentary election, which could oust President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist alliance and leave him to see out the remaining three years of his presidential term in an awkward partnership with the far right. Voting began at 8 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET) Sunday, as France started the process of electing the 577 members of its National Assembly through locally-fought contests across the country and in its overseas territories. The election is being held three years earlier than it needed to be, and three weeks after Macron\u2019s Renaissance party was trounced by the far-right National Rally (RN), the party of Marine Le Pen, in the European Parliament elections earlier this month. Minutes after the humiliating defeat, in an apparent attempt to call voters\u2019 bluff, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent by voters and took the \u201cserious, heavy\u201d decision to call a snap election \u2013 France\u2019s first since 1997. Whatever the outcome, Macron has pledged to remain in post until France\u2019s next presidential election in 2027. The National Assembly is responsible for passing domestic laws \u2013 from pensions and taxation to immigration and education \u2013 while the president determines the country\u2019s foreign, Europe and defense policy. When the president and majority in parliament belong to the same party, things run well. When they don\u2019t, the government can grind to a halt \u2013 a prospect that could haunt Paris as it prepares to host the summer Olympics next month. France most recently had such a government \u2013 known as \u201ccohabitation\u201d - when right-wing President Jaques Chirac called snap polls and was forced to appoint a socialist, Lionel Jospin, as prime minister, who stayed in the post for five years. The first round of votes eliminates weaker candidates ahead of the second round next Sunday. If a candidate wins an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot on a 25% turnout, they win the seat. Typically, only a handful of deputies will be elected this way \u2013 but most will go to a second round. Only those who win more than 12.5% of ballots cast by registered voters are allowed to stand in the second round. Often this is fought between two candidates, but sometimes three or four. Some candidates choose to drop out at this stage to give their allies a better chance of victory. Most voters will choose one of three blocs: the RN-led far-right alliance; the New Popular Front (NFP), a recently-formed left-wing coalition; and Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble. The RN bloc is headed by Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old party leader handpicked by Le Pen, who has striven to polish the image of a party historically ridden with racism and antisemitism that proliferated under the decades-long leadership of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. Until recently, the prospect of a far-right government was unthinkable. In the past, opposition parties have made marriages of convenience in an attempt to block the RN \u2013 under its previous name, the National Front \u2013 from entering government. Now, within a couple of weeks, Bardella could become France\u2019s prime minister \u2013 and Europe\u2019s youngest in more than two centuries. On the left, a previously fractious cluster of parties have recently banded together to form the New Popular Front \u2013 a coalition meant to resurrect the original Popular Front that prevented fascists from gaining power in 1936. The broad alliance comprises more radical figures like Jean-Luc Melenchon, three-time presidential candidate and leader of the France Unbowed party, as well as moderate leaders like Place Publique\u2019s Raphael Glucksmann. Meanwhile, outgoing French prime minister Gabriel Attal \u2013 who was only appointed to his post by Macron in January \u2013 is representing Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance. Attal was reportedly among the last of Macron\u2019s inner circle to learn that a snap election was imminent. Polls will close at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday, with the full results expected early Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/europe/france-parliament-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_asia_arzo-afghan-girl-suicide-attempt-pakistan-taliban-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "Holding a mirror steady in one hand, Arzo carefully applies pencil to her brows as she gets ready for an English lesson a short walk from her home on the outskirts of\u202fPakistani megacity Karachi. Every step toward the classroom takes her closer to a future she no longer thought possible almost a year ago when she walked downstairs at her family\u2019s home in Afghanistan and tried to take her own life. \u201cOn that day, I felt like everything was over. I was overwhelmed by hopelessness, and that\u2019s why I drank acid, convinced it would end my life,\u201d said Arzo, whom CNN first met last November as she lay in bed, too weak to speak. At the time, she was 15 years old but weighed as much as a 4-year-old, her limbs painfully thin after months of starvation despite her siblings\u2019 best efforts to feed her through a tube inserted in her stomach. Now, after an extraordinary intervention, Arzo is making a remarkable recovery \u2013 but she faces a new threat that could force her family to return to Afghanistan, and a life under Taliban rule that has become so intolerable for women and girls that some would rather die. Pakistan, a place of refuge for millions of Afghans, is carrying out a mass deportation program that has already seen more than 600,000 people cross the border since September 15 \u2013 with the threat that more could follow in July, when another class of visas expires.  What awaits them is a system of gender apartheid \u2013 violations against women and girls so \u201csevere and extensive\u201d that a senior United Nations official says they may amount to crimes against humanity. It was what drove Arzo to try to take her own life. \u201cThe gravity and scale of the crimes cannot be overstated,\u201d Richard Bennett, the UN\u2019s Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, told a Human Rights Council meeting on June 18, as he presented his damning report on the Taliban\u2019s rule. \u201cWe have a collective responsibility to challenge and dismantle this appalling system and to hold those responsible to account,\u201d he said. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected the report as an attempt to \u201ctarnish perceptions\u201d of Afghanistan before a rare meeting this weekend between UN member states and Taliban officials in Doha, Qatar. Despite strong condemnation of the Taliban by most UN member states, the issue of women\u2019s rights will not be on the formal agenda. Instead, talks with Taliban officials will focus on counternarcotics and the private sector. Afghan women and other civil society members weren\u2019t invited to the meeting \u2013 they\u2019ll meet separately with member states, without the Taliban, the next day, according to a UN official. Rights groups are furious the Taliban meeting is going ahead without Afghan women, and say it legitimizes Afghanistan\u2019s leaders and fails to hold them to account for grave injustices. Smuggled across the border Arzo is not her real name. She and her older brother and sister, Ahamad and Mahsa, are using aliases to protect their family members in Afghanistan from reprisals from the Taliban, who have sought to silence critics of their repressive rule. They\u2019re also hiding from Pakistani authorities, who have threatened to arrest and deport undocumented foreigners, making every trip outside their rented room fraught with risk. After Arzo drank the acid in Afghanistan last July, a doctor told her family she\u2019d likely die if treated there, so they smuggled her across the border to Pakistan, where another doctor inserted a feeding tube into her stomach. For a year, the siblings have spent almost every hour inside a rented room in Karachi with three single beds, a ceiling fan and a carpet where they eat, study and read. For most of that time, Arzo has been confined to bed, unable to eat, after the acid created a stricture \u2013 or a blockage \u2013 in her esophagus. Every three hours, including through the night, Ahamad and Mahsa said they fed their little sister fluids \u2013 nutritional milk powder and juice \u2013 through the tube direct to her stomach. But it wasn\u2019t enough, and by November, Arzo weighed just 25 kilograms, or 55 pounds. By then, most of their money was gone, too, on rent and private medical bills. \u201cWe are financially broken here. Whatever we had, we spent it,\u201d Arzo\u2019s brother Ahamad, a 27-year-old journalist under threat from the Taliban due to his occupation, told CNN in November. \u201cI don\u2019t cry in front of her, but I kiss her and cry while she sleeps at night, for her future, for her treatment, so she can survive this sickness,\u201d he said. A lifesaving intervention Within hours of Arzo\u2019s story airing on CNN last December, an email arrived with the offer of help. A non-profit organization volunteered medical care on the condition that its name wouldn\u2019t be published due to potential repercussions in Pakistan for aiding an Afghan who is residing in the country illegally. \u201cShe was 20 to 22kg at the time that we saw her,\u201d said the doctor who treated Arzo, whom CNN has also agreed not to name. \u201cShe had come to us on a wheelchair and was bedridden at that point. She was essentially one influenza, or cold, or other kind of infection away from essentially dying,\u201d he said. Doctors told her siblings to increase her caloric intake threefold, so she\u2019d be strong enough for her first medical procedure \u2013 an endoscopic examination that revealed severe damage to her esophagus, so that it had almost closed, making it impossible to eat. Using X-ray guidance, the doctors passed a wire through a gap the size of a pinhole and inflated a tiny balloon to slowly widen the passage. \u201cOver the course of two months or so, with multiple staged procedures, we were able to open it up to the point where she was able to eat by mouth, which itself was a game changer,\u201d the doctor told CNN. Arzo\u2019s brother Ahamad sent CNN regular WhatsApp messages. \u2018These lives are not worth anything\u2019 During an interview this month, Arzo sat upright on the bed, straightened her head scarf and spoke for the first time about why she tried to take her own life. It was July 2023, and she was sitting on the second floor of her family\u2019s two-story home, in a remote Afghan province, eating what would be her last meal for months. \u201cAs I ate food at home, I glanced at pictures of my classmates and felt a deep sense of longing for them,\u201d she said. Arzo hadn\u2019t seen her classmates since the Taliban banned girls from secondary education after seizing power in August 2021, and rarely messaged them because the internet connection was cut to her family\u2019s village. So, in a moment of grief for the friends and the life that she loved, she walked downstairs to the battery her family used to power their home and drank its contents. Her sister Mahsa found her and forced her fingers down her throat to make her vomit. \u201cWhen I asked her why she had done such a thing, her response was heartbreaking,\u201d said Mahsa. Arzo had told her: \u201cThese lives are not worth anything,\u201d she said. At the time, Arzo was just 15. Mahsa also lost everything with the Taliban takeover. She was 22 and had graduated from high school before the Taliban banned girls from getting an education beyond elementary school. She held ambitions to become a dress designer or to work in a beauty salon, but those career paths were soon shut down. \u201cWhen I went to Kabul, I enrolled in a tailoring program. However, for three months, I lived in constant fear as the Taliban would visit our workshop daily and criticize us for not wearing the hijab. They eventually forced us to shut down the workshop,\u201d she said. The Taliban ordered beauty salons to close in July 2023. Instead of working, Mahsa found herself in Pakistan caring for Arzo, who was in constant pain with no medication to ease her suffering. \u201cWhen she was asleep, it provided a brief respite from the distress, but the moments when she was awake during our meals were particularly challenging for us to endure,\u201d Mahsa said. Arzo\u2019s treatment has allowed them both to think about their future, and for the first time in years, they\u2019ve glimpsed the possibility of a better life. \u201cWhen hope is lacking and life seems directionless, unexpected events can present themselves,\u201d Mahsa said. Arzo is determined to put the past behind her and has urged other girls in Afghanistan not to follow her lead. \u201cMy message to all girls in Afghanistan who can\u2019t continue their education or go to school is to stay strong and don\u2019t lose hope.\u201d No safe haven in Pakistan While the Taliban is in power, Arzo does not want to go back to Afghanistan, but she and her siblings are not wanted in Pakistan. Last October, Islamabad gave around 1 million undocumented Afghan migrants one month to leave the country or face arrest and deportation. More than 600,000 people fled \u2013 most voluntarily, though 89% said they did so for fear of arrest, according to UN data. Of the total, more than 30,000 people were arrested and deported. On the outskirts of Karachi, residents in one Afghan community thought they were safe from the deportation drive. Security officials came to their area late last year and painted red numbers on their homes to show how many people lived there and their visa status. \u201cAt the beginning, the local people were happy over the markings because \u2026 it would certify that only registered Afghan refugees were living in a specific premises,\u201d said lawyer Moniza Kakar, who showed CNN the markings. Some houses were marked with \u201cACC\u201d (Afghan Citizen Card), others with \u201cPOR\u201d (Proof of Registration) \u2013 both forms of identification issued to Afghans long before the Taliban\u2019s return. But then in April, the government added around 800,000 ACC holders to its removal list. And the expiry date for POR cards was set to June 30, putting another 1.35 million people at risk of deportation. Rain had already washed away some of the red paint, then residents tried to scrub it off to avoid encounters with police, said Kakar, managing partner at Abbas and Kakar Law Offices, who helps community members navigate Pakistan\u2019s immigration system. \u201cThey feel fear and uncertainty about what should happen to them,\u201d she said. Pakistan\u2019s policy on \u201cillegal foreigners\u201d is no different to that of other nations, Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mumtaz Zahra Baloch told CNN. \u201cIndividuals who are here illegally have to be dealt with according to Pakistani laws, and that includes fines, imprisonment and deportation,\u201d she said. Baloch told CNN on Friday that the government still hadn\u2019t decided whether to extend POR visas that were set to expire on Sunday, and had earlier said that Pakistan was considering the implications of \u201call the various options.\u201d Many of those at risk of deportation know little of Afghanistan. Amanullah was just a boy when his family sought refuge in Pakistan during the former Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s, an event that ultimately plunged the country into four decades of near constant conflict. Now he\u2019s firmly settled in the Afghan community in Karachi with seven children of his own, and two grandchildren. \u201cWe have nothing left in Afghanistan anymore,\u201d Amanullah told CNN. \u201cMy children have grown up here and know little about their homeland.\u201d A member of the Mughal tribe, Amanullah sells watermelon at a fruit stall, but he said some other residents had closed their businesses for fear of being deported with no notice. Pakistan has sheltered Afghan migrants for decades but now, amidst a surge in militant attacks on its territory, government officials say they present a security risk. The Taliban has denied any involvement, and relations between the two countries are worsening as they trade accusations \u2013 and in some cases retaliatory strikes. \u2018Our room is like a prison\u2019 In March, as Arzo began to regain strength, her brother Ahamad\u2019s messages turned to the threat of deportation and what that could mean for their family. There are ways out of Pakistan for people like Arzo, Ahamad and Mahsa, but they typically involve taking risky journeys across borders, or joining lengthy waiting lists to be relocated to a third country that agrees to receive them. Afghans without visas can\u2019t legally work in Pakistan, and many who fled Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover have already run out of money. Arzo and her siblings survive on handouts from a small number of supporters outside Pakistan, who are trying to raise enough money to sponsor them to move to Canada. But it\u2019s an expensive and time-consuming process, with no guarantee they won\u2019t be arrested and deported while they wait. Arzo realizes how lucky she is to be alive and says she\u2019s willing to go anywhere she can continue her education, to become a doctor like those who saved her life. \u201cI really thank all the doctors from the bottom my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cMy message to my friends is to be patient. One day, the Taliban will leave Afghanistan, and we will be able to pursue our goals.\u201d But until then, women and girls live in a suffocating silence, where the Taliban have issued at least 52 new edicts since last June, tightening their control over the female population, according to the UN report. \u201cIt should shock all of us that that there\u2019s a country on this planet that denies girls access to education beyond sixth grade, that denies women access to most paid employment,\u201d said Heather Barr, associate women\u2019s rights director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cWomen can\u2019t go to a park. They can\u2019t walk in the sunshine; they can\u2019t exercise; they can\u2019t play sport,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, all of these things that make you feel human.\u201d Barr is scathing of the UN process and says it\u2019s clear that engaging with the Taliban has not worked. \u201cDiplomatic engagement in terms of getting the Taliban to respect women\u2019s rights has been a 100% failure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s achieved nothing. And so, it\u2019s time now for us to be talking about other strategies.\u201d She said countries could bring a case against the Taliban in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), much like South Africa\u2019s allegations of genocide against Israel over its military actions in Gaza, or Taliban leaders could be charged with gender\u202fpersecution in the International Criminal Court (ICC). \u201cIt (also) means diplomats and countries listening to the Afghan women\u2019s rights defenders, who are calling for the crime of gender apartheid to be recognized under international law,\u201d Barr added. In his report, UN special rapporteur Bennett also backed calls for gender apartheid to be a punishable offense and predicted a dystopic future for women and girls should the world fail to act. \u201cLeft unchecked, the Taliban\u2019s institutionalized system of gender oppression will become more robust, as those resisting it suffer increasing violence, as memories of female role models and notions of female independence fade, and as new generations are raised and radicalized in a society unquestioning of its dehumanization and exploitation of women and girls,\u201d he wrote. Arzo doesn\u2019t want a life like that for herself, her sister, or the women and girls still in Afghanistan. She\u2019s learning English, hopeful that one day soon she\u2019ll be able to leave Pakistan for a safe country. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future holds, but as long as I am in Pakistan, I will continue my lessons,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m determined to achieve my goals \u2026 Now I am not scared of anything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/asia/arzo-afghan-girl-suicide-attempt-pakistan-taliban-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_africa_kenya-protests-tax-rises-intl", "text": "Kenyan President William Ruto denounced protests on Tuesday that saw parliament stormed and at least five people shot dead as \u201ctreasonous\u201d \u2013 but did not address the swelling outrage against a controversial finance bill that\u00a0sparked the widespread demonstrations. Kenya is in the grip of nationwide protests against proposed tax hikes, culminating in Tuesday\u2019s \u201ctotal shutdown\u201d of the country, which quickly turned violent as police used tear gas and live rounds on protesters. The controversial finance bill has unleashed widespread protests movement vowing for \u201c7 Days of Rage.\u201d Last week, the government scrapped some tax increases, including a proposed 16% value-added tax on bread along with taxes on motor vehicles, vegetable oil and mobile money transfers. But the concessions have not been enough to quell protests amid the rising cost of living. A CNN team saw\u00a0two bodies lying motionless on the ground in Nairobi as the country\u2019s parliament was breached. Kenyan police were also seen beating and later arresting\u00a0some paramedics\u00a0who were helping injured protesters. During a nationwide address after parliament was set alight, Ruto said the events on Tuesday were a grave threat to \u201cnational security\u201d and that the conversation around the bill had been \u201chijacked by dangerous people.\u201d \u201cIt is not in order, or even conceivable, that criminals pretending to be peaceful protesters can reign terror against the people, their elected representatives, and the institutions established under our Constitution and expect to go scot-free,\u201d the president said, adding that democratic expression and crime must be isolated from one another. Kenya\u2019s defense ministry said the military has been deployed to support the country\u2019s police services as human rights and civil society groups criticize the heavy-handed response by the police on Tuesday. It was reported that at least five people were shot dead and around 31 were injured during Tuesday\u2019s protests. Of these, 13 were hit with live bullets, four with rubber bullets, and three with launcher canisters, according to a joint statement by Amnesty International Kenya, the Kenya Medical Association, the Law Society of Kenya, and Police Reforms Working Group Kenya. The joint statement also accused the police of shooting at a medical emergency center located at a church. CNN has reached out to the\u00a0Kenyan police for comment. \u201cThe use of live bullets must now stop,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDespite the assurance by the government that the right to assembly would be protected and facilitated, today\u2019s protests have spiraled into violence. Human rights observers and medical officers have reported several incidents of human rights violation.\u201d The demonstrations, sparked by the Finance Bill 2024, have seen citizens rally under the banner of \u201c7 Days of Rage,\u201d as the nation faces more days of upheaval. The dramatic scenes that unfolded in the nation\u2019s capital saw government buildings set on fire and a ceremonial mace stolen from Parliament in the melee.  Kenyan lawmakers were evacuated from Parliament as police went up against protesters, CNN affiliate NTV Kenya reported. Internet monitoring site\u00a0NetBlocks reported a \u201cmajor disruption\u201d to internet connectivity Tuesday. Nairobi\u2019s City Hall, the office of the Governor of Nairobi, was also set on fire, live visuals from CNN affiliate Citizen TV showed. A fire could be seen blazing through a lower-ground window, with other windows also emitting smoke. According to Citizen TV, some people were seen removing furniture, including chairs, from the building. Vehicles parked at Kenya\u2019s Supreme Court, which is close to the City Hall, were also set on fire. Earlier on Tuesday, Auma Obama, the half-sister of former United States President Barack Obama, was teargassed by police during an interview with CNN live on air, while protesting\u00a0against the bill. \u201cI can\u2019t even see anymore, we\u2019re being teargassed,\u201d Obama said in dramatic footage captured by a CNN team on the ground. Obama, a\u00a0Kenyan-British activist, was speaking to CNN alongside a group of young protesters when the group was teargassed in Nairobi. A spokesman for former President Obama declined to comment on the tear gas incident on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m here because look at what\u2019s happening. Young\u00a0Kenyans are demonstrating for their rights. They are demonstrating with flags and banners,\u201d Obama said. Accusations of abductions Security forces have also been accused of abducting prominent Kenyans, particularly those who have large social media followings Amnesty International\u00a0Kenya\u00a0says it is investigating the whereabouts of up to 12 people who were \u201cabducted in the middle of night\u201d ahead of Tuesday\u2019s planned protests. The list includes bloggers, content creators, human rights defenders, a doctor, and a parliamentary staffer, Amnesty\u00a0Kenya\u00a0executive director Ir\u0169ng\u0169 Houghton told CNN. \u201cWe are horrified by some of the testimonies we have heard over the last 24 hours. We have about 12 people unaccounted for who have been picked up, in many cases, by people who are uniformed or not uniformed,\u201d Houghton said, adding that that they had not received legal assistance and their families didn\u2019t know their whereabouts. \u201cWe are now seeing not just abductions but disappearances,\u201d he said. CNN has reached out to the Kenyan police for comment. Kenya\u2019s opposition leader Raila Odinga called for the government to \u201cimmediately stop the violence its agencies are meting out on citizens.\u201d In a statement on X, Odinga also called for the arrest of police officers who are alleged to have shot and killed protesters, as well as for the immediate withdrawal of the country\u2019s controversial finance bill. International leaders urged for calm on Tuesday. The United Nations Secretary General called on Kenya\u2019s police and security forces to \u201cexercise restraint,\u201d his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday, adding that he was \u201cdeeply concerned over the reported violence that we\u2019ve seen.\u201d The African Union Commission called on all stakeholders to refrain from further violence. A statement from the body said its chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat urges \u201call stakeholders to exercise calm and refrain from further violence. The chairperson also appeals to national stakeholders to engage in constructive dialogue to address the contentious issues that led to the protests in the supreme interest of Kenya.\u201d The protests come as\u00a0Kenya\u2019s standing gains global prominence as US President Joe Biden designated\u00a0the country a \u201cmajor non-NATO ally\u201d on Monday, marking the first time a sub-Saharan African nation has received this status.

{"id": "2024_06_27_asia_us-air-force-rape-japanese-schoolgirl-intl-hnk", "text": "Japanese prosecutors have charged a US Air Force member with allegedly kidnapping and raping an underage girl just before Christmas last year, Okinawa police confirmed to CNN on Wednesday. Brennon R. E. Washington, 25, was indicted on March 27 on charges of \u201cnon-consensual sexual intercourse\u201d and \u201cindecent kidnapping,\u201d a court spokesperson in Naha, Okinawa\u2019s capital, told CNN, adding that the US military handed the serviceman over to the Japanese authorities on the same day. Washington was released on bail and transferred to the Kadena US Air Base in Okinawa for custody, according to a government spokesperson. His trial will begin July 12, according to the Naha District Court spokesperson. The court\u2019s spokesperson told CNN they do not have any details regarding the airman\u2019s legal representation. The prosecution comes at a time when Washington and Tokyo are deepening their military alliance \u2013 in part as geopolitical tensions rise with both China and North Korea. The alleged rape is the latest in a history of criminal cases involving US personnel in Okinawa, home to one of the largest US foreign military bases, and could exacerbate tensions with residents who have long opposed the presence of American troops and weaponry on the island. The presence of V-22 Ospreys, a tiltrotor military aircraft, have also been a regular source of anger and protest in Okinawa following a series of recent crashes and noise complaints. Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki told reporters Tuesday the allegations of rape and kidnap were \u201cextremely regrettable,\u201d adding it was necessary \u201cto strongly protest against the US military and other related organizations.\u201d The governor also said his office will \u201ctake a tough stance in dealing with the situation.\u201d Washington, the indicted serviceman, was stationed with the 18 Logistics Readiness Squadron at the Kadena Air Base in Japan, according to the US Air Force, which confirmed his rank and service record to CNN. \u201cThe 18th Wing is aware of a sexual assault allegation against a Kadena Airman involving a Japanese citizen,\u201d 18th Wing Spokesperson, 1st Lt. Alvin G. Nelson III, told CNN Wednesday. \u201cWe understand and share the local community\u2019s concerns regarding this case,\u201d Nelson said, adding that Wing leadership was \u201cdeeply concerned by the severity of this alleged crime,\u201d and has been working with local authorities to investigate the allegations. \u201cAll US service members are expected to uphold the highest standards, and the US military is committed to holding accountable those who are convicted of criminal acts,\u201d the Wing spokesperson said. The indictment comes nearly 30 years after three US servicemen raped a 12-year-old Okinawa schoolgirl in 1995, sparking a backlash against the US military on the island. In 2016, the rape and murder of a 20-year-old woman by a former US base worker in Okinawa triggered mass protests in the island\u2019s capital, with tens of thousands of residents demanding the US move its bases outside of Okinawa.\u00a0The fallout resulted in curfews for US personnel on the island. In another crime involving US personnel in Japan, a US Navy officer killed two Japanese nationals while driving down Mount Fuji in 2021. Masataka Okano, Japan\u2019s Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, called for stricter discipline and lodged a protest with the US Ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, on March 27, the day Washington was indicted, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. CNN reached out to the US Embassy in Japan, which said it was aware of the case but will not comment. The embassy told CNN in a phone call to contact Kadena Air Base, where Washington was based, for information on the case. CNN has contacted Kadena Air Base for comment. Japan and the US have a mutual defense alliance and a decades old military partnership that has only been deepened in recent years by regional threats, particularly North Korea and an ever more assertive China. US President Joe Biden met with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol at Camp David in August 2023 in a show of solidarity and force against Beijing. In what Biden hailed as a \u201cnew era of cooperation,\u201d the three powers committed to a yearly trilateral summit, intelligence sharing and annual military exercises.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/asia/us-air-force-rape-japanese-schoolgirl-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_middleeast_roba-abu-jibba-gaza-treatment-intl-cmd", "text": "Roba Abu Jibba looked shocked as the doctor delivered his news: She couldn\u2019t have the operation she desperately wanted. She nervously scrunched the fabric of her dress, fighting off the tears that began flooding her one remaining eye. The 19-year-old Palestinian woman had pinned all her hopes on getting a prosthetic eye after suffering life-changing injuries in an Israeli strike in Gaza. She was brought to Doha for treatment by the Qatari government. But once again, her dreams were shattered. \u201cI came here, and now they said I won\u2019t be able to get a prosthetic,\u201d she told CNN between sobs. \u201cWhy am I here? I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to see with it but it\u2019s good and my eyes will look the same.\u201d Abu Jibba lost her right eye and the surrounding part of her face in early January when an Israeli bomb hit the warehouse in central Gaza where she and her family had been sheltering for months. Three of her brothers and two of her sisters were killed. Her wounded mother and three surviving siblings tried to get help and left her behind, later believing she was dead. She spent more than three days surrounded by the bodies of her siblings before making it to a hospital \u2013 only to find out there were no doctors there to treat her because most of the medical staff had fled the fighting in the area. A weeks-long CNN investigation into the circumstances of the strike found that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), without any advance warning, attacked an industrial area housing dozens of civilians using a heavy munition, the aftermath of which was consistent with a 2,000-pound bomb, according to weapons experts. The Israeli military told CNN they carried out \u201ca precise strike\u201d after their troops came under fire from that location. Survivors told CNN in January that there were no militants in the warehouse that was hit but did report hearing \u201cresistance fire\u201d in the area. Looking back at that night, Abu Jibba told CNN that she blamed both Israel and Palestinian militants for what happened to her family. She said she believed Hamas or other militants fired a mortar from a nearby area. \u201cI blame the people\u2026,\u201d she said, thinking about her words. \u201cAnd Hamas \u2013 and this situation. Because we were living normally in the warehouse for a month\u2026 If it weren\u2019t for those who fired the mortar, the incident wouldn\u2019t have happened. We didn\u2019t even want to stay in the warehouse, but the (Israelis) made us stay there,\u201d she told CNN, using a pejorative to refer to Israeli troops. \u201cI blame (the Israelis) for killing the children. They spared no one,\u201d she added. Deep wounds Abu Jibba had once been gregarious and outgoing. After seeing her siblings killed in front of her, she became quiet and deeply depressed. Her aunt who accompanied her to Qatar told CNN the young woman now prefers solitude, and rarely goes outside. She spends most of her time looking at photos of her family taken before the war \u2013 the few that she still has. She said her one source of happiness was Mohammed, a friend of her brother. The two met after her family was displaced from their home in Gaza City and became close after the attack in January. When Abu Jibba and her family were separated, and she was hospitalized, Mohammed offered desperately needed emotional support. She said they were going to get engaged and married. \u201cHe didn\u2019t care about what people were saying about my appearance, when people would say, \u2018How could you marry her after she was injured in her eye and body?\u2019 He would say, \u2018I don\u2019t care about her body, I care about what\u2019s in her heart,\u2019\u201d she told CNN. Seven days before Abu Jibba left Gaza for treatment, Mohammed was killed by an artillery shell while collecting firewood in Rafah, she said, adding that her cousin who was with Mohammed was injured in the attack and lost his leg. Abu Jibba said she doesn\u2019t even have a photo of Mohammed, having lost her phone in the carnage. Difficult choices Abu Jibba\u2019s injuries were so severe that Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health put her on a list of people who needed treatment abroad. Three days after CNN\u2019s report on Abu Jibba aired in February, she was cleared for medical evacuation. After weeks of waiting, she was able to cross into Egypt and was then flown to Qatar for treatment. Most of the 2.2 million Palestinians who live in Gaza have never left the strip. Before the war, some 18,000 Gazans had work permits that allowed them to work in Israel. But after Hamas launched its deadly terror attack from Gaza on October 7, Israel shut the borders, in general only allowing foreigners and a few hundred of the most seriously wounded to leave. \u201cIt\u2019s hard leaving your family especially at a time of war and in a difficult situation,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m worried something else (could) happen to them and I can\u2019t bring them with me.\u201d Abu Jibba told CNN she decided to leave because she believed that doctors could surgically restore her vision. In Egypt, she was told that wouldn\u2019t be possible because her entire eye had been removed but was offered further treatment by the Qatari government. But her stay in Doha has turned into yet another traumatic experience. The doctor told her that Qatar did not offer orbital prosthetic implants and said that her issue was just \u201ccosmetic.\u201d Research has long shown that ocular prosthesis leads to significant improvements in the patient\u2019s physical and psychological health. The prosthetic consists of an artificial eye, eyelids, and any part of the eye socket or the surrounding area missing. It\u2019s a cost-effective and less complicated alternative to reconstructive surgery and is performed routinely across the world. As Abu Jibba left the doctor\u2019s office, the weight of the moment crushed her. She shook and gasped. Panic set in, and she looked like she was reliving the worst moment of her life. She squeezed her hands against her ears, leaning against the wall. Nurses eased her onto a stretcher. She curled up into a ball and hid under a blanket. She is keeping the news away from her mother, fearing the shock might cause her even more pain. \u201cShe pushed me to leave to get the surgery. I don\u2019t want to go back to her with this patch,\u201d she said. \u201cI (need this) so my mother doesn\u2019t see me like this and be depressed.\u201d Later that day, Abu Jibba told CNN that what she wanted more than anything was to go back to Gaza. \u201cYes, there\u2019s a war in Gaza but at least you are with your family and loved ones,\u201d she said. \u201cI just hope to God this war is over\u2026 but even if there is war I want to go back.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/middleeast/roba-abu-jibba-gaza-treatment-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "style_article_kate-moss-glastonbury-fashion-remember-when", "text": "Remember when Kate Moss wore wellies (that\u2019s rain boots for those outside the UK) to Glastonbury? As the historic festival once again returns to Worthy Farm, we look back at one of its most memorable fashion moments. After all, no British summer would be complete without copious amounts of mud.  And no one has conquered it quite like Moss.   Some 19 years ago, Britain\u2019s best-known supermodel broke fashion\u2019s proverbial fourth wall and joined the mortals in their muddy squalor. Sure, she\u2019d probably spent the weekend glamping in the festival\u2019s VIP zone. But a filthy field is England\u2019s great leveler \u2013 and during those brief, well-photographed walks through the Glastonbury grounds, cigarette in hand, she was just like us. Until, that is, her choice of practical footwear transformed festival fashion and helped save a heritage boot maker from the brink of obsolescence. It was the summer\u00a0of 2005 and Moss was near the height of her powers. Media interest in her festival whereabouts was amplified by a fixation with her then-nascent dalliance with Pete Doherty. But while The Libertines\u2019 frontman certainly looked more at home in the conditions, it was Moss who grabbed the limelight.  Matching a pair of classic black Hunter rain boots with a waistcoat, short shorts and studded belt (and later a glittering tunic), the model was a picture of understated glamor. Below the knee her look was interchangeable with that of a Somerset pig farmer. But above it, she could just have easily emerged from a Chelsea mansion to a well-placed paparazzi ambush. The images quickly went viral (or as viral as they could in the pre-social media age). The bastion of mid-1990s so-called \u201cheroin chic\u201d had become the face of its slightly older, more respectable cousin: mid-2000s festival chic. In the process, wellies secured their place in the popular imagination. No longer the preserve of agriculture, they had become a rubbery status symbol best matched with trilby hats, cravats and other questionable noughties accessories. This once-practical boot had morphed into bourgeois badge of honor indicating that the wearer was prepared to \u201crough it\u201d and still look fabulous (the drug-afflicted rockstar boyfriend remained an optional part of the look). Suddenly, festival wear became its own category of clothing, something far greater than an amalgam of items you didn\u2019t mind ruining. But an even more profound transformation was also taking place \u2013 that of the then-struggling Hunter Boot Limited. The Scottish brand\u2019s true heyday may have been during the World Wars, when it produced huge quantities of waterproof boots for the front lines. But never before in the company\u2019s then 149-year history had its sensible footwear been so desirable. While one shouldn\u2019t overstate the power of the Moss effect (her endorsement couldn\u2019t save the boot maker from entering administration in 2006), it helped set in motion a remarkable turnaround in the company\u2019s fortunes.  By 2007, the firm was under new ownership and reporting an 85% increase in year-on-year sales. It has since become a bona fide festival fixture, producing rainwear, outerwear and boots in all manner of colors and styles. Once prized for keeping gangrene at bay in the trenches, Hunter has completed the ultimate 21st-century transformation to become the rainy-day boot de jour for celebrities from Rita Ora to Rihanna, Cara Delevingne to Alexa Chung. And to think that all Kate wanted was a pair of snug, dry feet.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/article/kate-moss-glastonbury-fashion-remember-when/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Russian Ministry of Defense said in a post on Telegram that Ukraine carried out the attack using \u201cUS-supplied ATACMS operational-tactical missiles equipped with cluster warheads.\u201d Four missiles were shot down by Russian air defense but another \u201cdeviated from its flight trajectory in the final section due to the impact of air defenses, with the warhead exploding in the air over the city,\u201d the post added. Video footage posted on X shows the aftermath of the strike, with\u00a0wounded civilians seen being carried from the beach in stretchers before being loaded into vehicles. Beachgoers, some of them still in their swimwear, can be seen evacuating the area. One of victims killed in the Ukrainian strike was the daughter of Oleg Averyanov, Deputy Mayor of Magadan. Yuri Grishan, the Mayor of Magadan, said Averyanov\u2019s daughter Sofia was nine and on vacation with her parents in Sevastopol. The casualties were partially caused by the timing of the strike, which came \u201cat a time when civilians, some were returning from work, some had already gone to the beach with their children,\u201d according to Governor Razvozhayev, who has announced a day of mourning. According to eyewitnesses on the ground, there was no air raid siren which warned of the attack. Many local residents also took to the comment section of official posts to express their dissatisfaction about the air raid siren not alerting them to an incoming attack. In response to Ukraine\u2019s attack on Sevastopol, the Russian Ministry of Defense said \u201csuch actions will not go unanswered,\u201d saying responsibility for the attack lied with Washington. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry\u00a0Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin is in constant contact with Sevastopol authorities, adding that the Russian government\u2019s priority is to provide all necessary assistance to victims, RIA says. Ukraine has not officially commented on the attack, but CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian military for a comment. Crimea has been occupied by Russia since its forces annexed the peninsula in 2014. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, it has come under sporadic attack from Ukrainian forces. Kyiv has previously insisted that its strikes on Crimea, which have targeted Russian naval bases and vessels, are an integral part of their\u00a0strategy, intended to try to isolate the peninsula and make it more difficult for Russia to sustain its military operations on the Ukrainian mainland, a Ukrainian source familiar with the strategy told CNN last year. Before Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Sevastopol \u2013 the largest city in Crimea \u2013 was a popular tourist destination for Russians. Even after the outbreak of war, Russians have continued to flock to the coastal city despite the dangers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/europe/at-leastfivedead-and-over-100-injured-in-ukrainian-strike-in-russian-occupied-crimea/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_israel-ultra-orthodox-draft-explainer-intl", "text": "The Israeli Supreme Court issued a ruling on Tuesday ordering the government to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military. Since Israel\u2019s founding, ultra-Orthodox Jews have been exempt from mandatory military service. The court also said that the government could no longer fund any religious schools (called \u201cyeshivas\u201d) whose students don\u2019t participate in the draft. Though both men and women are subject to Israel\u2019s mandatory conscription, the ruling only applies to ultra-Orthodox men. Who are the ultra-Orthodox? The ultra-Orthodox, known as \u201cHaredim,\u201d in Hebrew, practice a form of Judaism that is marked by stringent religious observance and strict lifestyles. They make up around 14% of Israel\u2019s 9.5 million citizens, and are the fastest-growing segment of the population. Because they are disproportionately young, they make up 24% of recruitment-age Israelis, according to the Israel Democracy Institute. Why don\u2019t they serve in the military? Some do, but far fewer than most Israeli Jews. The vast majority do not participate in the country\u2019s mandatory military service. For ultra-Orthodox men, studying Judaism\u2019s religious texts is central not only to their own lives but \u2013 they believe \u2013\u00a0the preservation of all of Judaism, and even the defense of Israel. Torah study begins in the teenage years and often continues into young adulthood. It is a full-time pursuit that precludes secular study, participating in the workforce (and therefore paying taxes) \u2013 or serving in the military, as most non-ultra-Orthodox Israeli Jews do. Technically, the military service exemption applied to young men who were actively studying at a yeshiva. In practice, anyone who tells a recruiter that he studies at yeshiva \u2013 anyone who presents themselves to be ultra-Orthodox \u2013\u202fcan get out of service. \u201cThe Jewish people survived persecutions, pogroms and wars only thanks to the preservation of their uniqueness \u2013 the Torah and the mitzvot,\u201d the head of Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Shas party said on Tuesday, referring to the 613 commandments that rule orthodox Jewish life. \u201cThis is our secret weapon against all enemies, as promised by the Creator of the world. Even here, in the Jewish state, alongside our precious fighters who sacrifice their lives against the enemies, we will continue to guard those who learn the Torah, which preserves our special power and creates miracles in battle.\u201d What did the Supreme Court say? In essence, the court said that the ultra-Orthodox could not be treated differently from other Israeli Jews. The law that mandates military service, it said, also applies to them. (Palestinian citizens of Israel remain exempt from service.) \u201cThere is no legal framework that makes it possible to distinguish between yeshiva students and those destined for military service,\u201d the court said in its ruling. The government \u201cseriously harmed the rule of law and the principle according to which all individuals are equal before the law.\u201d Why is it important now? The fight over whether the ultra-Orthodox should serve in the military is nothing new. Their exemption is as old as the state of Israel itself \u2013\u00a0in place from its founding in 1948. The Supreme Court ripped up that longstanding rule 50 years later, telling the government that allowing the ultra-Orthodox to get out of conscription violated equal protection principles. In the decades since, successive governments and Knessets (the Israeli parliament) have tried to solve the issue, only to be told repeatedly by the court that their efforts were illegal. The latest government attempt to paper over the problem, in place since 2018, expired at the end of March. It of course took on new significance on October 7, when Hamas and other militant groups crossed over from Gaza and killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, and took hundreds captive. The months since have put incredible strain on Israel\u2019s military, and particularly on the reservists who have been called up for extended tours of duty. Growing fears of a full-scale war with Lebanon only add to those worries. Ultra-Orthodox politicians argue that the fight over getting them to serve is being used a political bludgeon, and that the military has no manpower problem. The Israel Defense Forces\u2019 (IDF) leaders disagree. \u201cWe want to move forward, not because it\u2019s nice, [but] first of all because it\u2019s necessary,\u201d IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said recently. \u201cEvery such battalion that we establish, an ultra-Orthodox battalion, decreases the need for the deployment of many thousands of reservists thanks to the mandatory service people.\u201d The ultra-Orthodox service exemption has also stoked resentment among Israelis who have spent months away from their families while serving in the military, and seen loved ones killed. It has further opened the religious-secular divide in Israel that has always been present, but has grown, especially as the ultra-Orthodox share of the population increases. What does it mean for the war? In the short term, probably very little. Because the ultra-Orthodox have such strict religious practices, they usually serve in special units. The IDF is working to expand those units, but it will take time. \u201cAccording to the calculations of the army, there were 1,800 that were conscripted last year,\u201d Gilad Malach, director of the Ultra-Orthodox in Israel program at the Israel Democracy Institute, said after Tuesday\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe army needs to do some change in order to conscript them. According to the army, next year the army can receive 4,800.\u201d Israel\u2019s Deputy Attorney General Gil Limon instructed the government on Tuesday to immediately begin recruitment of an additional 3,000 ultra-Orthodox men, which the military has already said it could accommodate. He also that that \u201cin light of the current needs of the army and to promote equality in the burden,\u201d the military must \u201cdevelop and present a recruitment plan to increase this number.\u201d Where it could have a bigger impact is if it causes Israel\u2019s governing coalition to fall apart, which is entirely possible. Why is this ruling bad news for Netanyahu? When Netanyahu formed his government coalition in late 2022, he included two ultra-Orthodox parties \u2013 Shas and United Torah Judaism \u2013 to form a thin majority. Because yeshiva study is so important to those parties, this ruling could have big ramifications. For the moment, they seem to be downplaying the decision, saying they have no plans to pull out of the coalition. Despite the court\u2019s ruling, the ultra-Orthodox parties are still trying to pass legislation in the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, that would enshrine the draft exemption in law. Because the IDF doesn\u2019t have the capacity yet to draft the ultra-Orthodox into special units, it\u2019s unlikely that many will be drafted anytime soon. Once those draft orders start going out, the court\u2019s order for the government to stop funding yeshivas whose students refuse to serve could have a big impact \u2013\u00a0and affect whether the ultra-Orthodox party leaders still think there\u2019s benefit to being part of the government. What comes next? This story has been full of endless twists and turns. It will almost certainly not be the final word. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, along with his ultra-Orthodox allies, will continue to try to pass a law enshrining the draft exemption in law. But as the past decades have proven, there is little guarantee that they will be able to do that in a way that satisfies the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/middleeast/israel-ultra-orthodox-draft-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_28_style_but-im-a-cheerleader-movie-visuals", "text": "Originally an outlier amid a glut of \u201990s teen romcoms, one indie film with a femme lesbian lead, set in a hyper-artificial gay-conversion camp, has since become one of the era\u2019s most beloved titles. \u201cBut I\u2019m a Cheerleader,\u201d starring Natasha Lyonne as an all-American church girl with latent sapphic desires and Clea DuVall as her brooding love interest, proved divisive when it debuted at film festivals in 1999 and was initially panned by many critics. But 25 years on, it\u2019s held up as campy take on gender constructs and a (then) rare, joyful romance between two teenage girls. The movie embraced the absurd from the very beginning, as Megan (Lyonne) endures an overtly sloppy make-out session with her jock boyfriend while tightly cropped scenes of cheerleaders\u2019 bodies flash through her brain. But in her feature-length debut, director Jamie Babbit\u2019s vision soon crystallizes as Megan\u2019s family and friends stage an intervention to pluck her from her picture-perfect, prudish suburban life into the plasticky, pink-and-blue world of True Directions, where its founder, Mary (Cathy Moriarty) tries to recalibrate teenagers\u2019 sexualities through restrictive, Bible-approved gender roles. But no amount of baby doll rearing, wood chopping or simulated heteronormative sex can hide everyone\u2019s real desires, including Mary\u2019s own daisy duke-wearing son, Rock (Eddie Cibrian) and the group\u2019s \u201cex-gay\u201d lead, Mike (the matchless RuPaul), who sports a \u201cStraight is Great\u201d shirt and a whistle for any delinquent behavior. (Serious offenses mean a week in solitary confinement: a pink picket-fence doghouse.) Long before \u201cBarbie\u201d turned its plastic world into a summer blockbuster, Babbit was looking at many of the same references as Trojan horse for ideas around sex and gender. She\u2019d grown up \u201cobsessed\u201d with Barbies, pretending they all lived in New York City and dated each other, she recalled in a video call with CNN. \u201cIt was my weird femme fantasy of what my grown-up life was going to be.\u201d \u201cI wanted True Directions to look like the Barbie Dreamhouse,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd the more \u2018straight\u2019 the characters become in \u2018gay rehab,\u2019\u201d the more \u201cplastic and artificial\u201d they become. For a small crew designing nearly everything by hand, the visuals of \u201cCheerleader\u201d punched far above their weight, from the pink-painted Victorian home that housed True Directions to the shimmering bubblegum pink dresses and neon blue suits worn by the group at their \u201cstraight\u201d graduation. Over the course of the film, which was written by Brian Wayne Peterson, the color palette shifts from neutral to color-blocked to rainbow, as Megan enters new stages of her journey and embraces her sexuality. Taking cues from the retro fantasy of Tim Burton\u2019s \u201cEdward Scissorhands\u201d and the outlandish camp of John Waters, Babbit worked with costume designer Alix Friedberg and production designer Rachel Kamerman, two other industry upstarts, to bring the visuals to life. The movie cost $1 million to make and only made around $60,000 at four theaters during its opening weekend, though it eventually accrued around $2.6 million at the box office. In 2005, it got the musical treatment in New York, with a stage adaptation that has since had three runs in London. It\u2019s also had the Phoebe Bridgers stamp of approval in her 2022 music video with MUNA, \u201cSilk Chiffon,\u201d which pays homage to the film. \u201cI just love the cult following that it\u2019s had,\u201d Friedberg said in the call with Babbit and Kamerman. \u201cI think we all knew we were making something really special. It was the first movie I ever designed, and it was so hyper realistic and fun and colorful, and we got to build all kinds of fun things and play.\u201d At the time, she added, \u201cpeople didn\u2019t understand how great it was.\u201d Babbit recalls an early thumbs-up review by Rogert Ebert, which they Xeroxed and handed out at screenings. But scores of less-flattering reviews followed \u2014 including CNN\u2019s own caustic take \u2014 with many critics seeming to take offense at the satirical handling of a story about conversion practices. Looking back, Babbit says the criticism was a product of its time, as LGBTQ representation in popular culture was mostly limited to trauma and tragedy, heavily colored by the pain of the AIDS epidemic. It was the era of movies such as \u201cBoys Don\u2019t Cry,\u201d \u201cHigh Art\u201d and \u201cGia\u201d when gay or trans love was sure to end in sorrow. Meanwhile, Babbit was trying to make what she\u2019s called a \u201cgay \u2018Clueless.\u2019\u201d Writing a happy ending for two lesbians was \u201crevolutionary,\u201d she said. And the film was also ahead of its time for exposing the performativity of gender in an accessible way. For Babbit, a woman who had realized young that she was a lesbian but didn\u2019t fit the stereotypes she was familiar with, \u201cCheerleader\u201d was all too personal. \u201cI realized from a young age that gender constructs were pointless in your sexuality. They don\u2019t really go together,\u201d she said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen it discussed in film, but I was living it. So I was just being honest about where I was at with that whole idea.\u201d Hyper-colorful delirium Building out the world of \u201cCheerleader\u201d may have been a joy for the filmmaking team, but it was also exhausting, they recalled, as their ambitious plans required far more resources than they had on\u00a0hand. \u201cWe had like, absolutely no money and no help,\u201d Friedberg recalled. Costumes were made (or remade) in her living room, whether dyeing thrift finds for Megan\u2019s early wardrobe or sewing strips of color into the rainbow pajamas worn in film\u2019s refuge for gay teens who have left True Directions. Finding the Victorian house in Palmdale, California, that served as the conversion camp, happened by chance, as Babbit passed it by in the car with her producer and then-girlfriend. The owner agreed to let them film because he could no longer keep the home, Babbit recalled, and said they could do whatever they wanted on the first floor as long as he and his family could remain upstairs\u00a0\u2014 the girls\u2019 shared candy-colored bedroom at True Directions was actually the garage. Babbit also hired the man to repaint the house with its magenta pink detailing for the film, she said. Like the house, nearly all of the locations were real sites, except for soundstages Kamerman designed for two of the film\u2019s most stylized scenes: a color-coded montage in rooms of purple, teal and pink where the girls perform domestic tasks of womanhood and the program\u2019s final test, which sees group members act out a surrealist simulation of married life in order to graduate. Filming the domestic montage \u2014 during which Megan and Graham (DuVall) begin to fall in love \u2014 did not go to plan, though, Kamerman recalled, and they had to abandon a final shot that would pull back the curtain and show the constructed nature of the scenes. \u201cWe were (setting up) to do a big exterior wide shot to show how artificial it was\u2026 and then we had a huge windstorm that day, so the whole sequence blew down,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI think it was also when we had high fevers \u2014 there was something going around. Everybody was so exhausted; it was delirium.\u201d The simulation scene was similarly delirious \u2014 intentionally, this time \u2014 as True Directions members tried to pass their final test and graduate as \u201chappy heterosexuals.\u201d To do so, they were paired up in hetero couplings to imitate sex, while wearing nude full-body leotards with Adam and Eve-esque leaves stitched over their genitals, courtesy of Friedberg. The scene, set against bright yellow and pink gingham walls with blue trim and rose decor, was meant to be discordant and over-the-top, influenced by the provocative\u00a0and often allegorical visuals of the photographer and director David LaChapelle. Kamerman found an erotic circular bed and dressed it up in hot pink to clash with the prudish, Biblical costumes. \u201cThat round bed felt like the most heightened sexual porno bed,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThat was an amazing find.\u201d \u201cEverything we did in those tableaus speaks to our youth and naivete and our ability to have so much freedom as young artists coming up in the business,\u201d Friedberg added. \u201cWe weren\u2019t worrying, \u2018Is this too far?\u2019\u201d In fact, the only time that Babbit recalls reining in it was in a scene where Megan leaves True Directions and is greeted warmly in the rainbow-colored home of two \u201cex-ex-gays\u201d who went through the program, only to rebel and create an \u201cunderground homo railroad\u201d for current students. Initially, they greeted her with a platter of sex toys, Babbit said. \u201cA lot of gay people on set were like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, Jamie \u2014 you\u2019ve gone too far here\u2026 she\u2019s really getting plastic d***s the moment she comes out?\u201d Babbit recalled. Still, \u201cCheerleader\u201d feels tame today for its R rating, with only a few allusions to actual sex, such as an artful scene of intimacy between Megan and Graham to the heartstring-tugging song \u201cGlass Vase Cello Case\u201d by Tattle Tale. Despite that, it nearly received an NC-17 rating, which would have severely limited its theater run, due to dialogue about oral sex and a brief masturbation scene that Babbit was forced to edit, she said. As raunchy teen romcoms hit box offices in droves, the director felt that \u201cCheerleader\u201d was being dealt an unfair hand \u2014 particularly as the infamous apple pie scene in \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d had skirted through with a R-rating (though the movie did also reportedly require cuts). Despite the film\u2019s barriers, Babbit, Friedberg and Kamerman are all pleased with its longevity, particularly as they\u2019ve seen it gain cachet with an entirely new generation this past decade. \u201cCheerleader\u201d has stood on its own as a riotous cult LGBTQ film \u2014 and one that keeps revealing more through each rewatch through the meticulous (and often ridiculous) details of its set design and costuming. Babbit will always look back on her debut fondly. \u201cWe were just making our weirdo indie film of queer joy and female power in a vacuum.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/style/but-im-a-cheerleader-movie-visuals/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_27_tech_cambodia-coolapp-messaging-surveillance-fears-intl-hnk", "text": "Cambodian strongman leader Hun Sen has thrown his weight behind a new homegrown messaging app, which critics say is a way for the government to monitor and undermine political discussion in the country. CoolApp, launched this month to rival WhatsApp and Telegram, will make it \u201cdifficult for foreigners to interfere with our information,\u201d the former prime minister wrote in a post on his official Facebook page this week, adding that he was mindful of \u201cnational security.\u201d \u201cIt is the first-ever Cambodian program and used within the Cambodian security domain,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOther countries have their own social media means of communication like China\u2019s WeChat, Vietnam\u2019s Zalo, South Korea\u2019s Kakao Talk and Russia\u2019s Telegram, so in Cambodia, we have \u2026 our own product,\u201d he added. One of the world\u2019s longest-serving leaders, Hun Sen has ruled Cambodia with an iron fist for more than three decades. Though his eldest son, Hun Manet, succeeded him as prime minister last year, Hun Sen remains the ruling party\u2019s center of power. The country has been at the center of a multi-billion dollar online scam epidemic in Southeast Asia, run predominantly by Chinese gangs, which has raised global security concerns from bodies like the US State Department and the United Nations. CoolApp founder and CEO Lim Cheavutha told CNN the app has been downloaded 150,000 times and does not monitor, collect or store user data. It uses end-to-end encryption to ensure data and calls remain secure, he said. \u201cOnly you and the person you are communicating with can read or listen (to messages and calls) \u2014 nobody in between,\u201d he said. He predicted the app will eventually reach 500,000 or 1 million downloads, though he did not provide a timeframe. Meta\u2019s WhatsApp, the world\u2019s most popular messaging app, is estimated to have millions of users in Cambodia. Greater online surveillance Internet freedom in Cambodia has experienced a drastic regression under Hun Sen\u2019s rule, rights groups say. Censorship, media blackouts and online harassment are rampant. Activists have noted increased state surveillance, which has led to the arrest and persecution of government critics over the years as well as the shutdown of independent media outlets and websites. CNN has reached out to Hun Sen\u2019s office for comment. A prolific social media user who once famously denied buying likes for his Facebook page, Hun Sen has considered banning the site, the most popular social media platform in the country, saying he was fed up about online abuse from political opponents abroad. In 2023, a quasi-independent oversight board for Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta (META) recommended that Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts be suspended for six months for using language that could incite violence, according to Reuters. Mu Sochua, an opposition leader living in exile overseas, told CNN that Cambodians \u201cshould not be fooled by the strongman leader\u2019s promotion of CoolApp.\u201d \u201cI see it as nothing but another violent assault on civil liberties in Cambodia,\u201d she said, calling the app a \u201cChinese-style mechanism for the control of public discourse and mass surveillance.\u201d Hun Sen and the Cambodian government have close ties with China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, which oversees a massive surveillance network. \u201cAlready civil servants are ordered to download CoolApp,\u201d Mu Sochua said. \u201cWho dares to oppose the order?\u201d Another exiled Cambodian opposition leader, Sam Rainsy, echoed calls to boycott CoolApp, saying the app would \u201cstrengthen repressive tools at the disposal of the regime.\u201d \u201cThis is ironic coming from a leader who has a long history and track record of secretly listening in to private opposition discussions,\u201d Sam Rainsy said, noting previous instances of Hun Sen controlling social media discourse.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/27/tech/cambodia-coolapp-messaging-surveillance-fears-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_26_americas_bolivia-coup-attempt-claims-intl-latam", "text": "A Bolivian general has been arrested and accused of mounting a coup against the government after attempting to storm the presidential palace on Wednesday. Military units led by Gen. Juan Jose Z\u00fa\u00f1iga \u2013 dismissed as commander of the Bolivian army just a day earlier \u2013 occupied the main square in the capital, La Paz, as armored vehicles rammed the palace door and soldiers tried to break into government offices. Hours later, President Luis Arce \u2013 who had called on the public to \u201corganize and mobilize\u201d in defense of democracy \u2013 could be seen confronting Z\u00fa\u00f1iga in the crowded palace hallway, ordering the general to withdraw his soldiers and stand down. After Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was handcuffed and forced into a police car, a triumphant Arce raised his clenched fist to the huge crowds that had flocked to the presidential palace, signaling the defeat of the attempted coup. His defense minister Edmundo Novillo later told a news conference the government had regained \u201ctotal and absolute control\u201d over its military. \u201cWe urge the population that everything goes back to normal,\u201d he said. Bolivia has a long history of political instability - there have been almost 40 attempted or successful coups since 1946. The failed takeover comes as the landlocked South American country of some 12 million people struggles with a spiraling economic crisis that has sparked street protests in recent months. The country has been wracked by dwindling foreign currency reserves, particularly the US dollar, and shortages of fuel and other basic necessities. As he was being arrested Z\u00fa\u00f1iga alleged \u2013 without providing evidence \u2013 that he was acting on Arce\u2019s instructions. \u201cOn Sunday I met with the president and the president told me, \u2018The situation was very f*****, that this week would be critical. And so, it\u2019s necessary to prepare something to bring up my popularity.\u2019 And so he told me, he asked me, \u2018Shall we take out the armored (vehicles)?\u2019\u201d Z\u00fa\u00f1iga told reporters. Justice Minister Ivan Lima denied Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u2019s claims, saying he \u201clies and tries to justify himself about a decision he took and over which he will have to answer to justice.\u201d The attempted coup was widely condemned by the Bolivian government and international leaders. Bolivia\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office said it has launched a criminal investigation against Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and \u201call the other participants\u201d involved in the incident. It is unclear where Z\u00fa\u00f1iga is being held. \u2018The people have no future\u2019 Earlier Wednesday, footage from the scene showed armed soldiers occupying Murillo Plaza, a main square in La Paz where the national executive and legislative offices are located. Armored vehicles were seen ramming into the doors of Bolivia\u2019s government palace, according to the Associated Press, as former president Morales, who is a member of Arce\u2019s Movement to Socialism (MAS) party, said on X that a \u201ccoup d\u2019\u00e9tat is brewing.\u201d Video also showed some civilians facing off with soldiers in Murillo Plaza during the coup attempt. Bolivia\u2019s latest political showdown comes as tensions rise over plans by leftist former president Evo Morales to run for reelection against one-time ally Arce in general elections next year. Prior to his detention, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga addressed reporters in the square, flanked by soldiers, saying, \u201cWe want to restore democracy,\u201d as he spoke of the country\u2019s economic woes. He had earlier been dismissed reportedly for threatening to block a bid by Morales for reelection. \u201cThe people have no future, and the army has the courage to look out for the future of our children, the well-being and progress of our people,\u201d he said. He vowed \u201cto free all political prisoners\u201d including former president Jeanine Anez,\u00a0currently imprisoned for what the courts said was her role in deadly protests that erupted after her ascension to power in 2019. Amid the chaos, President Arce announced new military commanders, including Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u2019s replacement as army chief, Gen. Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez. The situation appeared to have been defused when S\u00e1nchez ordered the soldiers in the square\u00a0to return to their units. Armed vehicles were seen leaving Murillo Plaza soon after, according to footage from Bolivia TV. Arce also announced new heads of the navy and the air force. CNN is trying to contact Bolivia\u2019s government for comment. Morales, who publicly split from his former ally Arce, resigned as president in 2019 following mounting protests over accusations of election fraud; at the time, he claimed he was forced out in a coup. Gustavo A. Flores-Mac\u00edas, professor of government and public policy at Cornell University, told CNN the attempted coup reflects widespread discontentment in the country. \u201cWhat is happening in Bolivia is that broad sectors of society, across social strata, across all levels, are very unhappy with the way things are, especially on the economic front. And, we have an election coming in 2025,\u201d he said. In that election, Arce and Morales \u201cseemed to be in this collision course. Both of them angling to become the next president,\u201d he added. International condemnation Fredy Mamani, former deputy foreign minister of Bolivia and an ally of Morales and Arce, told CNN that despite the \u201cundemocratic\u201d nature of \u201cthe tanks, the uniformed soldiers and taking the square\u2026 it is essential to highlight that the Bolivian people are united in the face of any coup d\u2019etat.\u201d But echoing Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u2019s comments, an opposition MP accused the government of staging the coup in a bid to rally support. \u201cWhat happened today in Bolivia is a really bizarre situation,\u201d Andrea Barrientos, a Senator for the opposition Civic Community party, told the BBC. \u201cWe can confirm that this was a self-coup, organized by Luis Arce\u2019s government.\u201d News of the attempted coup was roundly condemned by international and regional leaders, including Paraguay\u2019s President Santiago Pe\u00f1a, Mexico\u2019s president, and the European Union. \u201cWe express our support for democracy in our brother country and to the legitimate government of Luis Arce,\u201d Chile\u2019s President Gabriel Boric said on X. The US Embassy in La Plaz said it was \u201cclosely monitoring the situation.\u201d The secretary general of the pan-American Organization\u00a0of\u00a0American\u00a0States (OAS), Luis Almagro, condemned the mobilizations in the \u201cmost energetic way,\u201d on X, saying the \u201carmy must submit to the legitimately elected civil power.\u201d Bolivia has struggled with both persistent political crises and ongoing interference from the army, Carlos Solar, Senior Research Fellow at RUSI, told CNN. This added to a \u201chigh degree of polarization by politicians who have not been able to carry out electoral successions\u201d have undermined Bolivia\u2019s democratic governance.

The Princess Royal, 73, had been injured while walking near horses at the royal estate, in Gloucestershire, western England, on Sunday evening. Anne will continue to rest and recover at home, returning to public engagements when her medical team recommends it is safe and comfortable to do so, the source told CNN. Her husband Vice-Adm. Tim Laurence expressed his gratitude to the medical staff for their care. He said in a statement, \u201cI would like to extend my warmest thanks to all the team at Southmead Hospital for their care, expertise and kindness during my wife\u2019s short stay.\u201d The exact circumstances that led to the Princess Royal\u2019s injuries were not clear but there were horses in the vicinity and previously her medical team said that her head injuries were consistent with a potential impact from a horse\u2019s head or legs. Emergency services were sent to the estate and, after medical care at the scene, she was transferred to Southmead Hospital in Bristol for appropriate tests, treatment and observation. CNN understands the princess has not been able to recall the details of what happened on Sunday evening due to her concussion. While it\u2019s not known how long the princess will be convalescing for, she will be receiving rehabilitation support at home as she follows standard concussion protocols. Anne is widely considered to be one of the hardest working royals, dutifully undertaking hundreds of engagements each year. She is one of several senior royals that stepped up further to support the King when he briefly stepped away from public-facing duties following his cancer diagnosis. The five-day hospital stay caused the princess to miss several engagements this week, including a state banquet at Buckingham Palace held for the emperor and empress of Japan on the first day of their state visit to the United Kingdom. She had also been due to travel to Canada for a royal visit this weekend. Her accident is the latest in a series of health challenges the family has faced since the new year, with her brother Charles and the Princess of Wales continuing their cancer treatments.

Preparations are being made for Modi\u2019s visit to Moscow and dates will be announced soon, Kremlin spokesperson Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russia\u2019s state-owned TASS news agency. \u201cI can confirm that we are preparing a visit by the Prime Minister of India,\u201d he said, according to TASS. \u201cI can\u2019t say about the dates yet, because the dates are announced by the parties in agreement. But we are actively preparing. And this visit will happen.\u201d CNN has contacted India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs for comment. The upcoming trip will be Modi\u2019s first to the country since 2019 and comes less than a month\u00a0after he was narrowly re-elected as prime minister during a weekslong vote. Modi\u00a0last met Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Uzbekistan in 2022, where he told the leader that today\u2019s era is \u201cnot of war\u201d. Putin also visited New Delhi just months before his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. India\u2019s ties with Russia date back decades to the Cold War and have remained strong despite repeated sanctions on Moscow from Western governments. New Delhi has repeatedly abstained from votes condemning Russia at the United Nations and has avoided public criticism of Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine. India remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment \u2013 a vital link given India\u2019s ongoing tensions at its shared Himalayan border with China \u2013 and has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin\u2019s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces global isolation. At the same time, India\u2019s ties with the United States have grown stronger, amid shared concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi met with US President Joe Biden during a state visit to Washington last June, in a trip further cementing their defense, trade and technology partnership. The Indian leader also addressed Congress during that trip, an honor typically reserved for close US allies and partners, and attended a lavish state dinner. Later that year, Putin did not attend the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in New Delhi, during which leaders delivered a consensus statement criticizing his invasion of Ukraine.

{"id": "2024_06_26_tech_uae-ai-minister-omar-al-olama-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "The world\u2019s first minister dedicated to developing artificial intelligence (AI) strategy is already becoming embroiled in a global power struggle for tech supremacy. In April, Microsoft (MSFT) announced a $1.5 billion investment in G42, an AI group based in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and chaired by an influential member of the ruling royal family. The deal, which analysts say was motivated by the Biden administration\u2019s desire to limit Beijing\u2019s influence in the region as the US battles to maintain its lead over China in the AI race, firmly pulled the firm into the orbit of the United States. \u201cI think the UAE and the US really see eye to eye with regards to how these technologies are pushed forward,\u201d UAE AI Minister Omar Al Olama, who was appointed in 2017, told CNN in a recent video interview. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see more alignment there.\u201d G42, a holding firm, is comprised of seven companies that work across data centers, energy, healthcare, surveillance and biotechnology. Its controlling shareholder is Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who also serves as the UAE national security adviser. The UAE is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of fossil fuels, and Abu Dhabi sees its AI push as crucial for diversifying away from oil. AI could contribute $96 billion to the UAE economy by 2030, equivalent to nearly 14% of its gross domestic product, according to a report by PwC Middle East. \u201cWe want to ensure that we are at the frontier of the technology, and that\u2019s why we work with partners around the frontier,\u201d said Olama, \u201cand play by the rules that are set by the market leaders.\u201d Olama, whose ministerial remit includes digital economy and remote work applications, wants to make the UAE a global leader in artificial intelligence by 2031. The UAE has laid out a national strategy to get there. Its objectives include deploying AI in priority sectors such as energy and logistics, developing an ecosystem and attracting talent. The country is putting public officials through AI training, and Dubai is aiming to teach a million citizens effective prompt engineering, instructing AI models to produce high-quality output. As of September, the Gulf country had 120,000 people working on AI or related industries, up from 30,000 two years earlier, Al Olama has said. Choosing sides Sometimes, the country has had to prioritize its relationship with the US over Washington\u2019s rivals. A US Congressional committee called on the Commerce Department in January to investigate G42\u2019s links to Chinese military companies and intelligence services (G42 denied any such connections), and the Microsoft investment required G42 to cut ties with Chinese hardware suppliers, reportedly including Huawei, in favor of US companies. \u201cThe US does not shy away from saying that \u2018on this technology specifically you need to choose sides,\u2019\u201d said Olama. The UAE has historically performed a balancing act with its foreign policy. It cooperates with the US on a range of issues, including defense, and in recent years the US has sold tens of billions of dollars of military equipment to the Gulf nation. The Biden administration, which sees maintaining a lead in AI as crucial for its future economic success and national security, has implemented a series of measures including export controls on AI and semiconductor technologies to slow China\u2019s advancement in the industry. Washington has also limited the sale of sophisticated US chips to ensure China doesn\u2019t use Middle Eastern nations as a back door to access the newest AI technology, according to Reuters. Nvidia, the world\u2019s third biggest company after Microsoft and Apple, said in an August 2023 regulatory filing that the US government had informed the chipmaker that some of its products would face additional licensing requirements for \u201ccertain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\u201d Some US politicians have raised concerns that they don\u2019t have enough details about the deal between G42 and Microsoft and that US technology might be vulnerable to Chinese espionage in the UAE. The country has ties to Beijing, too, and China is a key trade partner. Olama insists the UAE is a trustworthy partner. \u201cI really don\u2019t think that there is any risk, especially since there\u2019s a lot of cutting-edge American technology that is in the UAE,\u201d said Olama, adding that he was speaking in his personal capacity, not as a government official. \u2018A leading tech power\u2019 In late 2023, Abu Dhabi\u2019s government-backed Technology Innovation Institute unveiled a large language model (LLM), the technology behind generative AI chatbots, called Falcon10B. It outperformed offerings from Google and Meta by some metrics. \u201cThe UAE put a stake in the ground in the AI race with Falcon,\u201d James Lewis, who studies technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington DC-based think tank, told CNN. In October 2023, a collaboration between Abu Dhabi\u2019s Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, Silicon Valley-based Cerebras Systems and Inception, a subsidiary of G42, produced Jais, a generative AI model trained on Arabic as well as English. Its creators said it could pave the way for LLMs in other languages that are \u201cunderrepresented in mainstream AI.\u201d Unlike ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, Falcon and Jais are open-source, which means their code is available for anyone to use or change. By opening up the technology, Abu Dhabi is positioning itself as an ally to developing nations that don\u2019t have the resources to build their own AI tools. \u201cWe know that not every country can develop these systems or these tools,\u201d said Olama. \u201cSo, we want to ensure that we\u2019re able to develop it for them.\u201d Some analysts say the UAE\u2019s vast oil wealth will be key in developing hugely expensive AI infrastructure. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a financial story,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cIt gives them an edge in terms of being one of the leading tech powers in the future.\u201d As fears grow about the potential risks of AI, Olama has called for a global coalition to regulate the development and use of the technology.

{"id": "2024_06_23_europe_dagestan-synagogue-attack-russia-intl-latam", "text": "Gunmen opened fire on places of worship in two cities of Russia\u2019s southernmost Dagestan province on Sunday, killing at least 15 police officers and four civilians, including an Orthodox priest, in what appeared to be a coordinated attack. Sergey Melikov, head of the Dagestan Republic, said at least six \u201cmilitants\u201d were also killed following the attacks on churches, synagogues and police posts in the cities of Derbent and the regional capital Makhachkala, which are about 120 kilometers (75 miles) apart. The attacks took place in the republic of Dagestan in the North Caucasus, a predominantly Muslim region on the Caspian Sea that has a history of separatist and militant violence. The turbulence in the region has been further fanned by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, where ethnic minorities have been disproportionately mobilized to fight. Video and photos showed large flames and plumes of smoke billowing heavily out of a synagogue in Derbent, while footage filmed from the window of a building in Makhachkala shows black-clad unidentified people shooting at a police car in a street. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks, which come three months after ISIS affiliate ISIS-K said it carried out an assault at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow that claimed more than 140 lives in one of Russia\u2019s deadliest terrorist atrocities in years. Russian law enforcement agencies told state-run news agency TASS on Sunday that the gunmen in Dagestan were \u201cadherents of an international terrorist organization.\u201d TASS reported Monday that five of the gunmen had been identified and that some of them were related to the leader of the Sergokalinsky district, which lies between Derbent and Makhachkala. It identified one of the men as former mixed martial arts fighter Gadzhimurad Kagirov. Kagirov had taken part in the attack on Derbent and was also a cousin of the head of the Sergokalinsky district, Magomed Omarov, it said. Omarov\u2019s son and nephew were also among the attackers, authorities alleged. The head of Dagestan, Sergei Melikov, told reporters Monday that Omarov had been relieved of his duties and expelled from one of the main parties in the Russian parliament, the United Russia party, pending an investigation. Russia\u2019s National Antiterrorist Committee (NAC) said Monday that \u201carmed militants attacked two Orthodox churches, two synagogues and police officers\u201d in the two cities. It added that the counter-terrorism operation in Makhachkala and Derbent had ended, TASS reported. Four civilians were killed in the attacks, Russia\u2019s investigative committee said on Monday, bringing the death toll up to 19. Dagestan head Melikov also said in a Telegram post early Monday that the active phase of the \u201coperational and combat measures in Makhachkala and Derbent\u201d was completed but further investigations would continue. Melikov described the possible involvement of \u201csleeper cells\u201d and suggested the attacks may have had foreign help. \u201cOperative-search and investigative measures will be carried out until all participants of the sleeper cells are identified, which, undoubtedly, include some that were organized from abroad,\u201d he added. Three days of\u00a0mourning\u00a0have been declared in Dagestan following the deadly shootings, with state flags lowered to half-staff, Melikov said. Financial assistance will also be given to families of the victims, according to TASS. Priest killed, synagogue set on fire Dagestan is home to a small Christian minority and even smaller Jewish population that appeared to be among the targets of Sunday\u2019s attacks. A priest killed during an attack on a church in Derbent was identified as Father Nikolay by Dagestan Public Monitoring Commission Chairman Shamil Khadulaev. The priest\u2019s wife said her husband had been shot in the head by one of the attackers, contradicting earlier reports that his throat had been slit. \u201cHe (the attacker) walked in, shot him in the head and left,\u201d Valentina Kotelnikova said, according to a video published by the Russian online media outlet Mash on Monday. Nighttime video, shared by the Republic of Dagestan\u2019s Ministry of Internal Affairs, showed at least a dozen law enforcement officers \u2014 who appear to be armed and wearing tactical gear \u2014 outside the gates of a cathedral in northwest Makhachkala. CNN has geolocated the video to the gates of the\u00a0Cathedral of the Assumption (Svyato-Uspenskiy Sobor), a Russian Orthodox cathedral in the city. Earlier Sunday, TASS reported that a security guard was killed in a shootout at the cathedral, and 19 people had locked themselves inside the premises during the attack. Those who had holed up there have since been evacuated to safety, TASS reported, citing the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Dagestan. Meanwhile, two synagogues in Dagestan \u2014 one in Derbent and one in Makhachkala \u2014 were also attacked, according to a statement from the Russian Jewish Congress (RJC). Forty minutes before evening prayer, gunmen stormed the synagogue in Derbent and \u201cset the building on fire using Molotov cocktails,\u201d while police and security guards were killed outside, the RJC said. Photos showed flames and plumes of smoke billowing out of a series of windows on at least one floor of the structure. Dagestan\u2019s small Jewish community is part of the Mountain Jews that historically lived for centuries in parts of Azerbaijan and what is now Russia\u2019s Caucasus,\u00a0according to Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the Derbent synagogue had \u201cburned to the ground\u201d and that local guards had been killed, while the synagogue in Makhachkala had been attacked by gunfire. \u201cAs far as is known, there were no worshipers in the synagogues at the time of the attack, and there are no known casualties from the Jewish community,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Security guards had been placed outside of local synagogues ever since an antisemitic mob stormed through the local airport in October in an attempt to block a passenger plane arriving from Tel Aviv. The clashes left at least 10 people injured and videos showed a crowd of people inside the Makhachkala Uytash Airport and on the runway, some waving the Palestinian flag, others forcing their way through closed doors in the international terminal. The airport attack came amid rising public anger in the region over Israel\u2019s bombardment and blockade of Gaza in response to Hamas\u2019 deadly October 7 attacks on Israel. Investigation underway after police killed An attack was also reported Sunday at a police traffic post in Makhachkala. One of the law enforcement officers killed was Mavludin Khidirnabiev, the head of the \u201cDagestan Lights\u201d police department, according to the Dagestan Ministry of Internal Affairs\u2019 Telegram channel. In an earlier Telegram post, Dagestan head Melikov said, \u201cunknown persons made attempts to destabilize the social situation. Dagestan police officers stood in their way. According to preliminary information, there are victims among them.\u201d The identities of the attackers was being established, he said. \u201cThe attacks, the encroachment on our brotherhood, on our multinational unity, on our confessional indivisibility, are an attempt to split our unity, thereby creating rifts between us,\u201d Melikov said later in a video address. The Investigative Directorate of the Investigative Committee of Russia for the Republic of Dagestan said it had launched a terror investigation into the attacks under the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. \u201cAll the circumstances of the incident and the persons involved in the terrorist attacks are being established, and their actions will be given a legal assessment,\u201d the agency said in a statement. While the investigation is underway, some local Russian officials pointed the finger at Ukraine, without providing evidence. The State Duma Deputy from\u00a0Dagestan, Dmitry\u00a0Gadzhiyev, said he believes \u201cspecial services of Ukraine and NATO countries\u201d could be behind the attack. But Russian senator Dmitry Rogozin disputed the claim, saying in a Telegram post that writing off every terrorist attack as the \u201cmachinations of Ukraine and NATO\u201d would lead to \u201cbig problems\u201d for Russia. A US State Department spokesperson said the US does not have an assessment of who was behind the attack, but called Russian claims that Ukraine and NATO were behind it \u201cridiculous.\u201d This is a developing story and will be updated.

{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_icc-arrest-warrants-shoigu-gerasimov-intl", "text": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and the Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov for alleged international crimes, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court said Tuesday the pair were allegedly responsible for two war crimes: directing attacks at civilian objects and causing excessive incidental harm to civilians or damage to civilian objects. They are also accused of committing crimes against humanity. On the same day, Europe\u2019s top court found Russia guilty of systemic human rights violations in occupied Crimea committed since February 2014, marking a victory for Kyiv in its first interstate hearing brought against Moscow over the peninsula that could pave the way for more such cases. Following the ICC\u2019s announcement, Russian state news agency TASS quoted the Security Council of Russia, the government body headed by Shoigu, as calling the the court\u2019s decision \u201cnull and void.\u201d \u201cIt is meaningless, as the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend to Russia, and [the decision] was made within the framework of the West\u2019s hybrid war against our country,\u201d TASS quoted the body as saying. Ukrainian officials welcomed the ICC\u2019s announcement on Tuesday. President Volodymyr Zelensky said the decision shows that \u201cno military rank or cabinet door can shield Russian criminals from accountability.\u201d The country\u2019s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said the ICC decision meant Ukraine was a step closer to getting justice. \u201cSooner or later, a just punishment will overtake every war criminal!\u201d he said in a statement posted on his Telegram. Andriy\u00a0Yermak, the head of Ukraine\u2019s presidential office, said Shoigu and Gerasimov were being held \u201cindividually responsible.\u201d \u201cThis is an important decision. Everyone will be held accountable for evil,\u201d he said in a statement. The arrest warrants put Shoigu and Gerasimov on the ICC\u2019s wanted list, although it is uncertain whether they will ever stand trial. The court does not conduct trials in absentia and it is unlikely they would be handed over by Moscow. The two warrants bring the total number of top Russian officials wanted for war crimes to four as the ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u00a0and Russian official\u00a0Maria Lvova-Belova\u00a0for an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. Located in The Hague, Netherlands, and created by a treaty called the Rome Statute, the ICC operates independently. Most countries \u2013 124 of them \u2013 are parties to the treaty, but there are notable exceptions, including the United States, Russia and Ukraine. Under the Rome Statue, any country that is a signatory is obliged to arrest and hand over anyone facing an ICC arrest warrant. Crimea human rights ruling In a separate case Tuesday, the European Court of Human Rights unanimously ruled that Russia violated 11 articles of the European Convention of Human Rights in Crimea, which was annexed by Moscow following its illegal invasion of the peninsula 10 years ago. They included violations of the rights to life, liberty, security and a fair trial, and the prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment, according to a court news release. The court also found that Russia violated three protocols of the European Convention: the protection of property, the right to education, and the freedom of movement. The court ruled Russia must safely return prisoners who were taken from Crimea into Russia. Some of the violations that Russia was found guilty of date back to 2014. Margarita Sokorenko, Commissioner for the European Court of Human Rights of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine, said the ruling \u201cessentially nullifies Russia\u2019s decades-long claims that human rights in Crimea are respected.\u201d Russia has previously denied allegations of human rights violations in Crimea, and was expelled from the Council of Europe in March 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In response, Moscow removed itself from the European court\u2019s jurisdiction, and set March 15, 2022 as a cut-off point after which it claimed any rulings made against Russia would not count. Harming civilians Shoigu, one of the Russian nationals wanted by the ICC, is a long-time close ally of Putin who served as Russia\u2019s defense minister for 12 years. He was fired by Putin last month, replaced with the economist Andrey Belousov. He led the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which caught Kyiv by surprise but was soon pushed back, exposing the weaknesses of Moscow\u2019s corruption-riddled military. Still, Shoigu has remained a popular politician in Russia. Having spent two decades as the minister of emergency situations, he cultivated an image of an official who brings help when it\u2019s needed. Gerasimov, meanwhile, has been at the helm of Russia\u2019s armed forces for more than a decade. He was one of a small group of people responsible for planning the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He was formally appointed as the overall commander of the campaign in January 2023. The ICC said the alleged crimes relate to \u201ca large number of strikes against numerous electric power plants and sub-stations\u201d that were carried out by the Russia across Ukraine between October 2022 and at least March 2023. The panel of three judges who made the decision to issue the arrest warrants on Monday concluded that Shoigu and Gerasimov ordered strikes against civilian objects, which constitutes a war crime under international humanitarian laws. The judges also said that even though some of the targets could have been seen as relevant to Russia\u2019s military campaign at that time, it was clear that striking them would cause harm to civilians and that the expected harm would be excessive compared to the military advantage of hitting them. The court\u2019s prosecutor Karim Khan said in a separate statement on Tuesday that the Russian campaign at that time represented \u201ca course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts against a civilian population.\u201d As such, he said, the actions by Shoigu and Gerasimov may amount to a crime against humanity. That designation is reserved for the most serious crimes committed as part of a widespread, systemic attack directed at a civilian population.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/icc-arrest-warrants-shoigu-gerasimov-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_weather_us-summer-heat-forecast-climate", "text": "Summer is off to a sweltering start after multiple record-breaking heat events sent temperatures soaring for millions of people in the US. So when will it end? Forecasts for the coming weeks and months show exceptional heat is largely here to stay, with only fleeting periods of respite. And the sobering summer reality on a planet warming due to fossil fuel pollution is the heat isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 it\u2019s only going to get more frequent and intense as global temperatures rise. \u201cSummers like the one we are experiencing now and the summer we had last year \u2013 which was the hottest on record \u2013 are going to become par for the course in the years ahead,\u201d said Kristina Dahl, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. A sign of things to come There will still be colder-than-average summers in the future, but climate change is making it likelier more summers will end up hotter-than-average, Dahl told CNN. And the fingerprints of a changing climate are already visible, even before summer has reached its hottest months. This spring, hundreds of cities in the eastern half of the US experienced one of their 10 hottest Mays on record in what was another sign of a changing climate: dangerous heat seeping into typically cooler seasons. Early season heat waves add to the danger of what\u2019s already the deadliest weather threat because the body can\u2019t gradually acclimatize, or cope better with the heat, Dahl explained. Acclimation or not, the abnormally hot temperatures are also altering the perception of what\u2019s hot. Temperatures through at least midweek will climb up to 10 degrees above normal in parts of the western and southern US, but that pales in comparison to last week\u2019s roasting conditions. Summer should be hot, just not this hot: Parts of the central and eastern US sweltered through temperatures 25 or 30 degrees above normal last week. The heat was so extreme Caribou, Maine, a town just 10 miles from the Canadian border, hit 96 degrees, tying its all-time record high temperature. \u201cThis is not your grandmother\u2019s heat, this is significantly different,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cThis (heat) really isn\u2019t normal and it\u2019s measurably influenced by climate change.\u201d The hottest is yet to come Forecasts for the next few weeks, the next month and the rest of the summer all show one trend clearer than anything else: hotter-than-average temperatures for large sections of the US. Above average temperatures are expected into early July for a vast majority of the Lower 48 with the exception of states along the northernmost tier of the country, according to forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center. July is typically the hottest month of the year, but it is expected to be even hotter than normal this summer in almost every state. Most of the East and parts of the Rockies are likely to be the most anomalously warm areas next month. This prolonged heat could be record-breaking. Last July in Phoenix was the hottest month ever experienced in any US city. The city\u2019s average July temperature \u2013 calculated based on both high and low temperatures for the month \u2013 was an astonishing 102.7 degrees. Heat in Phoenix last summer wasn\u2019t just extreme, it was long-lasting. Its longevity and dangerously high daytime and overnight temperatures took a toll on human health. The scorching July contributed to the deadliest year for heat in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, since officials began keeping records in 2003. Heat lasted well beyond July last summer for much of the US. A series of unrelenting heat domes baked huge parts of the country with the effects of each worsened by the one before. Every heat dome that parked over part of the country roasted the ground, dried out soils and made subsequent temperatures even hotter. This year looks to be no different. Warmer-than-normal conditions are expected to extend through the summer and most of the fall, according to the CPC. Warmer-than-normal falls aren\u2019t nearly as dangerous as hot summers. But the cooler seasons only mask the lingering threat of extreme heat as long as global temperatures continue to rise, which scientists say can only be mitigated by dramatically reducing or phasing out planet-polluting fossil fuel use. \u201cThe more we try to normalize (heat), the greater the danger we have of taking our eye off the ball in terms of what needs to be done to address climate change,\u201d Dahl said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/weather/us-summer-heat-forecast-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_world_julian-assange-plea-deal-hearing-intl", "text": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has landed back home in Australia, a free man for the first time in 12 years, after a US judge signed off on his unexpected plea deal on Wednesday morning. Cheers erupted from supporters gathered at Canberra Airport in the Australian capital as Assange disembarked the aircraft. He waved to the crowds as he walked across the tarmac. As he approached the terminal, his wife Stella emerged with a broad smile on her face. Assange pulled her into hug, lifting her off the floor before the pair kissed. \u201cJulian wanted me to sincerely thank everyone. He wanted to be here. But you have to understand what he\u2019s been through. He needs time, he needs to recuperate and this is a process,\u201d she said at a press conference after her husband\u2019s arrival. With tears in her eyes, Stella took several brief pauses in an apparent bid to gather her emotions as she spoke to reporters. \u201cI ask you please, to give us space, to give us privacy, to find our place, to let our family be a family before he can speak again at a time of his choosing,\u201d she added. Earlier Wednesday, Assange walked out of the courtroom in Saipan, on the Northern Mariana Islands, a remote US Pacific territory, raising one hand to a gaggle of the world\u2019s press before departing by car for the airport to journey on to Australia. Speaking outside the court, Assange\u2019s US lawyer Barry Pollack said he had \u201csuffered tremendously in his fight for free speech and freedom of the press.\u201d \u201cThe prosecution of Julian Assange is unprecedented in the 100 years of the Espionage Act,\u201d Pollack told reporters. \u201cMr. Assange revealed truthful, newsworthy information \u2026 We firmly believe that Mr. Assange never should have been charged under the Espionage Act and engaged in (an) exercise that journalists engage in every day.\u201d In a stunning turn of events, the 52-year-old Australian was released from a high-security prison in London on Monday afternoon and had already boarded a private jet to leave the United Kingdom before the world even knew of his agreement with the US government. He appeared in a US courtroom on the Northern Mariana Islands to formalize the agreement, officially pleading guilty to conspiring unlawfully to\u00a0obtain and disseminate classified information over his alleged role in one of the largest breaches of classified material in US military history. \u201cI am, in fact,\u00a0guilty of the charge,\u201d Assange told the court in Saipan. Assange - who has long held a deep mistrust of the US, even going so far as accusing it of allegedly plotting his assassination - was hesitant about stepping foot in the continental US, and so prosecutors asked for all proceedings to take place in a day in a US federal court based in Saipan, the largest island and capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, which are located around 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles) west of Hawaii. Justice Department prosecutors also said the court on the islands made logistical sense as it is closer to Australia, where Assange will ultimately travel to following the conclusion of his legal battle. Kevin Rudd, Australia\u2019s Ambassador to Washington and former prime minister who helped facilitate negotiations with the US, watched proceedings in the courtroom. \u2018I hope there will be some peace restored\u2019 At the start of the plea deal hearing the judge reminded Assange that he was back in the US and that this court was the \u201csmallest, youngest, and furthest from nation\u2019s capital.\u201d Assange looked relaxed in the courtroom, wearing a black jacket and brown tie, while next to his attorneys. Asked by the judge, Honorable Ramona Manglona, to describe what he had done to be charged, Assange said: \u201cWorking as a journalist,\u00a0I encouraged my source to provide information that was said to be classified in order to publish that information. I believe that the First Amendment protected that activity\u2026 I believe the First Amendment and the Espionage Act are in contradiction with each other, but I accept that it would be difficult to win such a case given all these circumstances.\u201d In her sentencing, the judge said Assange was entitled to a credit of time served for his incarceration at a British prison. \u201cIt appears that your 62 months imprisonment is fair and reasonable,\u201d Manglona said. \u201cYou will be able to walk out of this courtroom a free man. I hope there will be some peace restored.\u201d The judge told Assange that \u201ctiming matters\u201d and she would have been less inclined to accept a plea 10 years ago. She also said there was no personal victim in this case \u2014 Assange\u2019s action did not lead to any known physical injury. For years, the US argued that the self-appointed champion of free speech endangered lives and posed a threat to national security. Following his release, the US Department of Justice said in a statement that Assange is barred from returning to the US without permission, \u201cpursuant to the plea agreement.\u201d Assange and his whistleblower website rose to global prominence in 2010 after a string of leaks from former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The website posted a video showing a US military helicopter firing on and killing two journalists and several Iraqi civilians in 2007. Several months later, it disclosed more than 90,000 classified Afghan war documents dating back to 2004. Later in 2010, he was wanted in Sweden to answer questions over allegations of sexual assault that had emerged. Two years later, Assange sought political asylum within the Ecuadorian embassy in west London. He remained there for almost seven years until the Metropolitan Police entered his safe haven in 2019 acting on an extradition warrant from the US Justice Department. The deal brokered with the US is the final act of a 14-year legal drama that has spanned continents, though it was not immediately clear why it reached a resolution now. Australian officials have been pushing diplomatic angles for some time. It was widely thought that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had raised Assange\u2019s case when he visited the White House last October. Speaking in parliament on Wednesday, the Australian leader said he was \u201cpleased that (Assange) was on his way home to Australia to reunite with his family.\u201d \u201cThis outcome has been the product of careful, patient and determined work,\u201d Albanese said, adding \u201cthis is what standing up for Australians around the world looks like.\u201d US President Joe\u00a0Biden\u00a0had in recent months alluded to a possible deal pushed by Australian government officials to return\u00a0Assange\u00a0to Australia. However, the administration distanced itself from the developments on Tuesday. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson told CNN it \u201cwas an independent decision made by the Department of Justice and there was no\u00a0White House involvement.\u201d Now the WikiLeaks founder has touched down in Australia, one thing on his to-do list will be paying off his government for the ride home. Assange will owe $520,000 for the charter flight, according to the international campaign that called for his release. To cover the purported expenses as well as other funds for his recovery, the campaign has launched an appeal, asking supporters for donations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/world/julian-assange-plea-deal-hearing-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

The center warned earlier on Saturday that the storm was likely to develop into a \u201cdangerous major hurricane\u201d as it approaches the Windward Islands Sunday night or Monday. It brings a risk of heavy rainfall, hurricane-force winds and dangerous storm surge and waves to the central and western Caribbean. \u201cBeryl is expected to rapidly strengthen and be a major hurricane when it reaches the Windward Islands late Sunday night or Monday, bringing destructive hurricane-force winds and life-threatening storm surge,\u201d warns the center. The hurricane\u2019s early arrival is unusual: the average date for the first hurricane is August 11. The storm has been intensified by exceptionally warm ocean temperatures, driven by planet-warming fossil fuel pollution. Beryl could lash parts of the Lesser Antilles \u2013 the arching chain of islands that form a broken barrier between the open Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea \u2013 by the end of the weekend. A hurricane warning is in effect for Barbados and hurricane watches have been issued for St Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada. Tropical storm watches have been issued for Martinique and Tobago. The storm is also worth monitoring for those with interests along the US and Mexico Gulf coasts, but it will take a few days to sort out exactly where it will go or how strong it will be. More clarity should come once it is in the Caribbean Sea early next week. It\u2019s rare for tropical systems to form and track east of the Lesser Antilles in June. That this formed so early in the season \u2013 and in this part of the Atlantic \u2013 is a sign of the hyperactive hurricane season to come, according to research from Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University. Normally, ocean temperatures aren\u2019t warm enough in this region in June and July to help tropical systems thrive. That\u2019s hardly the case this year, and one of the reasons behind record-high hurricane season forecasts over the past few months. Ocean temperatures remain close to the off-the-chart highs being set this time last year in the area where the storm is tracking through and are currently at levels more commonly found in August and September. \u201cBeryl has found an environment with very warm ocean waters for this time of year,\u201d Dr. Mike Brennan, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s\u00a0National Hurricane Center, told CNN\u2019s\u00a0Fredricka Whitfield Saturday. \u201cThese are ocean waters you\u2019d normally see like in August or September, but now we\u2019re seeing them in late June,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of opening up more of the deep tropical Atlantic for formation before we get to what would be the traditional peak of the hurricane season.\u201d  It\u2019s a small slice of a bigger problem. Ocean temperatures across the globe and the Atlantic were record warm for over a year, driven upward by planet-warming fossil fuel pollution and in part by El Ni\u00f1o. This system is not alone. There are two other areas being monitored by the National Hurricane Center for development, including one in the same area of the Atlantic where this system formed and another in the southwest Gulf of Mexico. Both have low odds of developing over the next week, but given the unusual early season action and favorable ocean temperatures, they will have to be watched closely. The NHC is forecasting above-normal activity this year with 17 to 25 named storms \u2013 eight to 13 hurricanes, as well as four to seven major hurricanes. \u201cThat\u2019s well above average,\u201d Brennan noted. Caribbean islands urge public to make preparations as hurricane gains strength As the hurricane continues to rapidly strengthen, countries likely to be affected are urging their residents to take precautionary measures. Officials in Barbados say the island is expected to feel the impact of the storm as early as late Sunday night. Its meteorological service is anticipating storm-force winds, 3 to 6 inches of rain, \u201chazardous\u201d marine conditions, and severe thunderstorms that may interrupt power utilities. \u201cAll the regular preparations that we do for a hurricane is in full swing,\u201d Minister of Home Affairs and Information Wilfred Abrahams said in a message to the public. \u201cWe have less than 48 hours until we expect to see the effects of this system impacting Barbados. Please use the time very wisely.\u201d In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves warns that the storm could hit the islands by Monday morning as a Category 2 hurricane. The meteorological service forecasts sustained winds of 74 to 110 mph (119 to 177 kmh) or greater and rainfall of 4 to 6 inches. \u201cKingstown is going to be flooded once this hurricane is on track,\u201d Gonsalves said of the capital city. \u201cNormally, two inches of rain \u2013 sustained rain \u2013 in a relatively short period of time will flood the city. Four inches will undoubtedly flood the city.\u201d In Saint Lucia, the government warns that the storm could bring \u201cmoderate to heavy showers, thunderstorms, and gusty winds\u201d to the region. Prime Minister Philip J. Pierre is advising residents to make necessary preparations and review their family emergency plans. In Grenada, the National Disaster Management Agency is also urging residents to prepare by having disaster supplies kits, trimming overhanging trees and branches, clearing drains and knowing where their emergency shelters are located.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/weather/tropical-depression-storm-beryl-hurricane/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz Ag Mohamed Ag Mahmoud, who was a senior member of the Islamic Police, was recruited by al Qaeda leaders, the\u00a0ICC said in a statement. The Islamic Police played a \u201cpivotal role\u201d in the system that al Qaeda, alongside Islamist group Ansar Dine, put in place to commit crimes against humanity and war crimes in Timbuktu between April 2012 and May 2013, the ICC said. Al Hassan was convicted by majority of directly committing, contributing to, or aiding and abetting crimes against humanity of torture and war crimes of torture and outrages upon personal dignity, the ICC confirmed. The court, in the Dutch city of The Hague, acquitted him of crimes related to rape, sexual slavery, forced marriage and attacking protected objects due to insufficient evidence that he was responsible, the statement said. The ICC said that 2,196 victims participated in the trial proceedings. Across 195 hearings, 7,896 documents were recorded and 13,275 items of evidence were submitted, the court said. Al Hassan will remain in detention until he is sentenced in a separate hearing. Parties have 30 days to appeal the conviction. Following a 2012\u00a0coup in Mali, Islamic extremists, some with ties to al Qaeda, capitalized on the country\u2019s instability. CNN previously reported that they toppled the Tuareg tribe roaming in the north, and seized control of Timbuktu and other cities in the region. They carved out a large portion of the region and began instituting their own laws. They banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television, and destroyed historic tombs and shrines in the north. Public executions, amputations, floggings and other inhumane punishments were also common, the\u00a0United Nations said\u00a0at the time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/africa/war-crimes-qaeda-mali-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

Argamani, one of four hostages rescued by the Israeli military in a special operation in Gaza this month, spoke out in footage played at a protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday in which she also called for the return of the remaining 120 captives, who include her partner Avinatan Or. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m home now, we can\u2019t forget about the hostages who are still in Hamas captivity, and we must do everything possible to bring them back home,\u201d Argamani said in the two-minute clip, which was played during a rally led by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Argamani said she felt privileged to be back with her family, especially her mother, who has late-stage cancer. \u201cAs an only child to my parents \u2013 and a daughter to a mother with a terminal illness \u2013 my biggest worry in captivity was for my parents.\u201d Argamani and her partner Or were abducted by Hamas at the Nova music festival on Oct. 7. Widely circulated footage of her kidnapping showed her being hoisted onto the back of a motorcycle and driven away as Or was apprehended and made to walk with his hands behind his back. Argamani was in captivity for eight months before she and three other hostages \u2013 Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv \u2013 were rescued in an Israeli operation that Gazan authorities said killed more than 200 people. A senior Hamas official has told CNN that \u201cno one has an idea\u201d how many hostages are still alive. \u201cI want to take this opportunity to remind everyone that there are still 120 hostages in Hamas captivity. Among them is Avinatan Or, my partner, from whom I was separated at the moment of abduction,\u201d Argamani said in the video message. Her\u00a0statement stopped short of calling on the government to strike a ceasefire deal with Hamas that could lead to the release of more hostages. The video was played before a crowd of protesters, who have been holding large rallies in Tel Aviv for months.\u00a0Such rallies often attract thousands of people, with many calling for the return of all hostages, some demanding a hostage deal, and others pushing for the ouster of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. During the latest demonstrations on Saturday, a group of protesters lit fires, tires and torches in the middle of the street, according to Israeli police. Authorities said they stepped in to maintain public order and extinguish the flames. Footage from around the scene showed officers confronting the crowd and at one point, they appeared to forcefully restrain lawmaker Naama Lazimi, who took part in the rally, before they let her go. Police did not say if anyone was arrested.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/middleeast/noa-argamani-hostage-video-israel-protests-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_26_middleeast_israel-gaza-rescue-operation-palestinian-family-intl-cmd", "text": "Bullet holes fleck the bloodstained walls of the Miqdad family home, in Nuseirat camp, central Gaza. CNN footage from the house shows a cream teddy bear perched on a white cupboard, with broken plastic strewn across the shelves. In another room, mother-of-four Rasha Abdel Miqdad shudders with grief, before breaking down in tears. \u201cThis is the blood of my son, Yamen. May God bless his soul,\u201d the 32-year-old Palestinian told CNN on June 12. \u201cMy son was innocent. \u201cWe are civilians, and we have no connection to the resistance or anything or any faction. We have no connection to it at all.\u201d CNN spoke to seven members of the family who described a horror-filled haze of gunfire, tank artillery and aerial bombardment around their home on June 8. Israeli forces stormed through the building searching for militants and indiscriminately spraying bullets, according to the family members. Four people suffered gunshot wounds, leaving one child severely injured and 12-year-old Yamen dead, the family alleged to CNN. Soldiers interrogated and beat male relatives, and forced a child to strip, relatives claimed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released footage on June 16 showing forces in the Miqdad\u2019s house on the same day as a\u00a0high-profile hostage rescue operation\u00a0nearby. In the heavily edited video, shared on social media and described as forces \u201csecuring the area\u201d during the operation, members of the Israeli Paratroopers Reconnaissance Battalion appear to enter the home. The video does not show what happened on the third floor, where the family say they were attacked. CNN has reached out to the IDF but has not received a response to the specific allegations made. The allegations provide a window into the scale and force of this\u00a0Israeli\u00a0operation\u00a0to free hostages taken during the attack on Israel last October. Eyewitnesses say they are still traumatized, after more than 270 Palestinians were killed and another 698 people injured on June 8, according to authorities in Gaza. Health staff said that hospitals, already stretched beyond their limits, were completely overwhelmed. These extremely high reported casualty tolls prompted renewed warnings from human rights organizations who say Israel is not doing enough to protect civilians as it prosecutes its war, and that militants are endangering Palestinian lives. The UN human rights office (OHCHR)\u00a0warned that\u00a0Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups may have committed war crimes through their actions. OHCHR spokesman Jeremy Laurence said the Israeli operation \u201cseriously calls into question whether the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution\u2026 were respected\u201d and that, by holding hostages in densely populated areas, Palestinian armed groups are \u201cputting the lives of Palestinian civilians, as well as the hostages themselves, at added risk.\u201d It was not clear how many of those killed were militants. The Ministry of Health in Gaza does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. But the ministry said many of those impacted were women and children, as well as people recently displaced by Israel\u2019s offensive in the southern city\u00a0of Rafah. The IDF has disputed the ministry\u2019s numbers, claiming that casualties from the operation were \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the casualty figures given by either side. The IDF said special forces teams launched the rescue operation in Nuseirat camp just after 11 a.m. local time, and by 11:25 a.m. had begun\u00a0raids\u00a0on both buildings where hostages were being held. After exchanging heavy fire with militants, and as the surrounding area came under intense Israeli missile and rocket fire, the special forces retrieved the hostages then started to travel out of the camp, toward an area near the US military\u2019s floating pier on the Mediterranean coast. It was along this route that Israeli forces stormed the Miqdad family house for between 30 and 45 minutes, according to eyewitness accounts corresponding with videos analyzed by CNN. Flames and plumes of smoke billow over wrecked vehicles in the aftermath of the operation, according to footage taken at 1:10 p.m. local time and obtained by CNN. Civilians wail over bodies heaped on top of each other, as young children look up to the sky in disbelief. In one frame, filmed on a nearby street, members of the Miqdad family can be seen carrying their injured children into a car as Israeli drones buzz overhead. The Miqdad family home, which a CNN team visited later, stands just under a mile (1.5 km) from the site where the hostages were held, as determined by CNN through video analysis. \u201cThey left nothing behind. It\u2019s all destroyed,\u201d said the mother Rasha, speaking fourtwo days after the operation. \u201cThe room is full of blood. My children\u2019s clothes are all blood. \u201cThere is no safe place\u2026 no place where we can protect ourselves.\u201d Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on southern Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed 37,658 Palestinians and injured at least another 86,237 people, according to Gaza health officials. \u2018Felt like an earthquake\u2019 Artillery and missile fire erupted near the Miqdad family home before the Israeli forces entered on June 8, the father, Mohammad, told CNN. He said he gathered his family \u2013 some 14 people, mostly women and children \u2013 into a room. The family trembled with fear as the voices of soldiers grew closer, until, they claim, the troops kicked down the door, opened indiscriminate fire, threw stun grenades and pointed weapons at some of the children. \u201cThey came to the apartment we were at, and started shooting and saying, \u2018Who is here, who is here?\u2019 We told them we were civilians, children and women,\u201d Mohammad told CNN. Rasha told CNN the raid \u201cfelt like an earthquake,\u201d adding that soldiers confiscated their cell phones. \u201cThey carried weapons, pointing them at an eight-month-old baby and a four-month-old baby.\u201d Israeli troops detained the two men present and demanded to know whether there were any militants in the building, Mohammad said. He and his father-in-law, Abdul Raouf, 58, tried to declare their innocence. Then, they allege, soldiers forced bags over their heads, tied their hands behind their backs and physically assaulted them. Mohammad\u2019s second oldest child, Ahmad, is still reeling from the attack. The 13-year-old told CNN he could hear the soldiers beating his father and grandfather in the hallway, before he claims he was himself forced to strip. Soldiers then told him to put his clothes back on, he said, before he was taken out of the room and \u201cpunched,\u201d pointing to his face. \u201cHe asked me to take off my clothes to make sure I was a little boy,\u201d Ahmad recalled. \u201cHe threw me to the ground and put blindfolds on me,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wanted to tie me, but I started kicking with my feet, so he put his shoe here,\u201d he said, pointing to his neck, \u201cand stepped on me to silence me. \u201cThey meant to kill me.\u201d Mohammad told CNN that before the Israeli forces withdrew, they threatened to shoot his relatives, after which he heard gunshots. \u201cThe soldier said, \u2018If you don\u2019t tell me where the resistance fighters are and where the weapon is in your house, I will kill your children,\u2019\u201d Mohammad said. \u201cHe went to the room,\u201d he said, referring to the part of the house where the women and children were, adding, \u201cA minute after, and I heard the gunshots.\u201d Ahmad told CNN: \u201cAt that moment, we assumed my brothers had been killed.\u201d It is not clear if any of the family members were hit in the second round of shooting. Bullet casings that appear in a video filmed by CNN at the house are stamped with IMI, which denotes the Israeli weapons manufacturer Israeli Military Industries, according to two weapons experts, Richard Weir, senior researcher in the Crisis and Conflict division at Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member. One casing is a 9mm caliber, likely a pistol, or a machine pistol or a submachine gun, Weir said. Israeli forces were in the house for up to 45 minutes, family members told CNN. When they eventually left, Mohammad, still blindfolded, says he called on Rasha to remove the bag over his head. They say their two sons were limp and bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds. One of their children, Mumen, 16, says he was shot in his shoulder and abdomen, while his younger brother, Yamen, 12, had bullet injuries to his abdomen and leg. \u201cI called the ambulance, but they said they cannot come because the area is dangerous,\u201d Mohammad told CNN. Instead, the family raced north by car to Al-Awda Hospital. But for Yamen, it was too late. \u201cThey gave him CPR for 10 minutes, but he was already martyred,\u201d Mohammad said. Scenes of \u2018massacre\u2019 at local hospitals The footage obtained by CNN from the area shows survivors clambering over rubble as missiles streak across the sky. Entire buildings are hollowed out. Palestinian men and boys delicately cover dead bodies with blankets, trying to give dignity to those killed in the Israeli\u00a0operation. Hospital workers say they could not manage the flood of casualties from the daytime raid, which was carried out when the streets and market were busy with people. At least 250 Palestinians wounded in Nuseirat were transferred from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital to Nasser Hospital, according to health authorities. Al-Aqsa hospital is serving nearly five times the number of in-patients it had pre-war with just one functioning electricity generator, the UN\u2019s Office for Humanitarian Affairs reported\u00a0on June 10. Footage from\u00a0the hospital courtyard\u00a0taken on June 8 shows trucks lined with shrouded bodies and men trying to comfort shellshocked children, as scores of Palestinians clamor to get seen by medics. \u201cThere were many martyrs lying in the streets,\u201d said Rasha\u2019s mother, 54. \u201cThe street was full of people and the planes were shooting.\u201d Critical shortages of resources including painkillers at Al-Aqsa hospital hampered efforts to treat trauma wounds \u2013 including severe burns, open fractures, amputations and brain injuries, aid workers with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, told CNN.\u00a0Israel\u2019s siege\u00a0of Gaza has drastically reduced the entry of medical and other supplies. \u201cIt was just like a plane crash had happened,\u201d said Karin Huster, an MSF staffer who treated patients in the hours after the attack. \u201cPretty much everybody was on the floor, kids, women\u2026 hundreds of people. \u201cIt takes a special kind of people to survive this,\u201d she told CNN on June 11. Another health worker at Al-Aqsa hospital, Maryame El Abbassi, said she is emotionally scarred after treating a severely burned child whose face \u201cwas melting\u201d between her hands. \u201cI wish I wouldn\u2019t have experienced the massacre,\u201d the 23-year-old nurse told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t think they invented any words that can describe how cruel the situation was\u2026 There were so many children brought in by strangers. \u201cThose kids will be traumatized until the end of their life,\u201d she said. Mumen, who is still being treated for wounds to his shoulder and abdomen, having been moved to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, drew in labored breaths as he recalled what happened to his brother. \u201cMy younger brother, Yamen, I saw them shooting him,\u201d Mumen said on June 10. \u201cThey came into the room and simply shot us, without saying a word\u2026 My future is gone.

It was a nail-biting finale in Bridgetown, Barbados as India set a total of 177 to win \u2013 the highest ever score in a men\u2019s T20 final \u2013 but South Africa matched it run for run, even pulling ahead at points before some exceptional bowling from India and an outstanding catch from Suryakumar Yadav restricted the Proteas right at the end. Victory sparked jubilant and emotional celebrations for India after a year of heartbreak for many of its players who lost to Australia in the finals of both the ODI Cricket World Cup and World Test Championship. India was under pressure early in its innings as some sharp South African bowling reduced it to 39-3 after five overs. But with Axar Patel and talismanic batter Virat Kohli at the crease, India rebuilt. Together, they put on a 72-run partnership as Axar lofted several sixes over the boundary before a moment\u2019s hesitation allowed Quinton de Kock to run him out at the non-striker\u2019s end and he departed with 47 off 31 balls. Shivam Dube walked out to the middle and added a quickfire 27 while at the other end, Kohli ticked along and reached a half century \u2013 even as he struggled to find the boundary for much of the game. Perhaps spurred by the knowledge that he was playing in his final T20 match for India, as he revealed in his post-match interview, Kohli accelerated in the final three overs to score 76 off 59 balls \u2013 a match-changing innings. He departed in the 18th over, and India lost several late wickets as it chased any possible runs to set a total of 176-7. Jasprit Bumrah, who has already enjoyed a phenomenal tournament and was named its best player after the match, gave India the perfect start as he bowled Reeza Hendricks in only the second over and South Africa found itself 12-2 shortly afterwards. But there was still time for the game\u2019s momentum to shift once more as De Kock and rising star Tristan Stubbs sprinted towards a 50-run partnership before Stubbs was bowled by Axar, much to the frustration of De Kock. South Africa continued to build steadily and almost found itself in a match-winning position when Heinrich Klaasen produced an astonishing performance in the 15th over, hitting Axar for 24 runs and racing towards a half century in just 23 balls, the fastest ever in a men\u2019s T20 World Cup final, according to Opta. He was finally out after edging Hardik Pandya to Rishabh Pant, giving India a lifeline. With the match poised on a knife-edge, India\u2019s captain Rohit Sharma sent Bumrah in to bowl his final two overs well ahead of schedule and the star bowler repaid his captain by stymieing the run rate and taking the wicket of Marco Jansen for good measure. Then, as the tide turned towards India, it seemed as if David Miller had hit a six for South Africa in the penultimate over but for a brilliant catch from Suryakumar Yadav on the boundary, where he caught the ball, threw it up in the air and caught it again as he jumped back inside the ropes. That gave India the platform it needed and it held on to take the victory by the narrowest of margins.

{"id": "2023_06_19_style_unseen-photos-of-glastonbury", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 This year\u2019s Glastonbury Festival is underway, with headliners Dua Lipa, Coldplay and SZA topping a bill of some 2,000 acts across 100 stages, and more than 200,000 people expected to attend. Now a global juggernaut, the festival has changed unrecognizably since the summer solstice of 1971 when the first Glastonbury Fair, as it was then known (and prior to that, the \u201cPilton Pop, Folk and Blues Festival\u201d), opened its gate \u2014 singular \u2014 and 12,000 revelers paid nothing at all to see acts including David Bowie and Fairport Convention. -Twenty six-year-old British photographer Paul Misso was there on a dual mission: to drive an RV for his friend, the Oscar-winning actress Julie Christie, and to take pictures of the event. He was working for film director Nicolas Roeg who was making a documentary about counterculture, with Christie roped in\u202fas a famous face. It was Christie who got Misso the gig as Roeg\u2019s stills photographer. \u201cShe said \u2018give him some film\u2019 and (Roeg) gave me 250 rolls of color film, which at the time was probably worth enough to buy a house,\u201d recalled the now 78-year-old photographer\u00a0in a phone interview. \u201cWe drove into a field \u2014 someone in the village had directed us to where this insanity was going to occur \u2014 and there\u2019s the tor (a cone-shaped hill) in the distance and this pyramid (stage) being built,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a magic kingdom and\u2026 the most incredible opportunity of my life.\u201d Misso, who was working as a fashion and advertising photographer having trained at the London School of Printing and Graphic Arts, set about taking pictures that encapsulate every nostalgic hippy fantasy imaginable. His images show verdant British midsummer, beards, sunshine and rain, nudity, sunburn, flowers \u2014 the kind of authentic beauty that can\u2019t be made with a filter. Hedonism and high-jinx underpinned by wholesomeness. Once back in London, Misso went through 7,000 transparencies and selected 160 to show Roeg, who he recalled saying: \u201cYou got it and I didn\u2019t.\u201d Roeg\u2019s film was shelved before eventually being picked up by fellow filmmaker Peter Neal in 1972, who turned it into\u202f\u201cGlastonbury Fayre,\u201d a project more akin to a music video than the project\u00a0Roeg\u202fhad first envisaged.\u202fIt also meant Misso\u2019s stills were shelved. \u201cHim dropping the film meant my pictures\u202fwere useless,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey just languished in a drawer for decades.\u201d A few years ago, Misso revisited the images, printed them cheaply and placed them in sequence in a scrapbook \u201cto see them as a story.\u201d Then, someone in his local photo lab helped turn the print images into large, digital files\u00a0that were, in Misso\u2019s words, \u201cmarketable.\u201d But the selling side of things was a challenge for Misso. The pictures sat on the lab\u2019s computer until one of the staff offered to \u201cshow them around.\u201d Within a couple of weeks the photographer had a publisher at IDEA Books. The resulting tome,\u202f\u201cIn The Vale of Avalon: Glastonbury Festival 1971,\u201d\u202fmay be more than 50 years after the event, but it serves as both a work of art and a historical document. \u201cPaul\u2019s photographs from Glastonbury have a real energy of their own; that of the people who gathered to make that festival happen,\u201d said David Owen, co-founder of IDEA Books, over the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s rare to find something so elemental within the world of youth culture and alternative living that has not been seen before. To release them now, when the world is rather less hopeful and harmonious than it was in those five days in 1971, is just something we had to do.\u201d One of Misso\u2019s standout images from the book is of British model Jean Shrimpton. \u201cAt the time she was\u202fthe supermodel \u2014 forget Twiggy or anyone else,\u201d said Misso. \u201cShe\u2019s in profile with her Nikon camera lit by sunlight,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can just see it\u2019s her \u2014 the hair is extraordinary; the hands are utterly beautiful.\u201d Although Misso can\u2019t pick a favorite (\u201cThese pictures are old friends; I know them all intimately,\u201d he said), he did concede that an image of the first ever Pyramid stage, with the campfire in the foreground, is special. People find it striking, he said, adding that Bill Harkin, who designed the stage, had painstakingly placed it specifically above the\u202fGlastonbury-Stonehenge ley line \u2014 an invisible ancient boundary or energy line believed by some to move through the Earth. \u201cThere was a sense of innocence,\u201d Misso recalled. \u201cWe were without guile, without artifice, without manufactured cleverness. We were friendly, lovable and charming. We just wanted to be free; to smile and love each other and dance and be happy and connect to the spiritual roots of the country \u2014 the Vale of Avalon (the pocket of countryside where the festival takes place) is magic not just at festival times.\u201d The event is now marketedly different, more commercial, more costly and sprawling in scale.\u00a0Misso said he still attends most years. \u201cCompletely and utterly \u2014 it\u2019s my spiritual home,\u201d he said.\u202f\u201cThere are pockets of Glastonbury that are entirely the same (as in 1971) with the same ethos.\u202fIt\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d \u201cIn The Vale of Avalon: Glastonbury Festival 1971\u201d is published by IDEA books and available in a limited run of 1,000 copies at Dover Street Market, London.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/06/19/style/unseen-photos-of-glastonbury/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_europe_evan-gershkovich-trial-begin-russia-intl", "text": "Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, went on trial Wednesday, appearing in a Russian courtroom\u2019s glass cage with his head recently shaved. Later Wednesday, Gershkovich\u2019s family said the past 15 months had been \u201cextraordinarily painful.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re deeply disappointed that he will have to endure further attempts to discredit him and to paint a picture that is unrecognizable to anyone who knows him. Evan is a journalist, and journalism is not a crime,\u201d his family said in a statement. Gershkovich, 32, was arrested while reporting for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which he joined in January 2022, just weeks before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While many newsrooms subsequently pulled their reporters out of Russia, Gershkovich remained, covering the war and how it was changing life in the country. He was arrested while on a reporting trip in the city of Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and later accused of spying for the CIA. Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him. Within two weeks of his arrest in March 2023, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release. The press was briefly allowed into the courtroom 15 minutes before Wednesday\u2019s hearing began at 11 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET). During earlier appeals against his pre-trial detention, Gershkovich has made love-heart signs and given a thumbs-up to his friends, family and supporters. On Wednesday, Gershkovich stood cross-armed, seeming healthy and composed, occasionally smiling and waving to the crowd of reporters. No reporters will be allowed into the courtroom during the trial itself, which is expected to last months. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. After Wednesday\u2019s hearing wrapped early afternoon, court officials said the trial would resume on August 13, state news agency TASS reported. The trial of Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet-era emigres to the US, has highlighted the extent to which Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has harmed relations between Moscow and Washington. In their indictment, Russian prosecutors said that \u201cunder instructions from the CIA\u201d and \u201cusing painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d Gershkovich \u201cwas collecting secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory. Russian authorities have not publicly offered any evidence for their claims. WSJ Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker said it was \u201cjarring to see him in yet another courtroom for a sham trial held in secret and based on fabricated accusations.\u201d \u201cWhile we are told he\u2019s doing well given the circumstances, Evan\u2019s wrongful detention continues to be a devastating assault on his freedom and his work and an unfathomable attack on the free press. It\u2019s outrageous that he has already endured 455 days in prison when he never should\u2019ve been arrested,\u201d she said in a statement. Pjotr Sauer, Russian affairs reporter for Britain\u2019s The Guardian newspaper and friend of Gershkovich, told CNN, \u201cEvan is just an honest journalist,\u201d and emphasized that Russian authorities have not presented any evidence against him. \u201cWe\u2019re not holding our breath, it could take weeks or months. And we don\u2019t have much trust in the Russian justice system,\u201d said Sauer, who exchanged letters with Gershkovich before the American reporter was transferred to Yekaterinburg. \u201cRealistically, we believe that Russia will convict him because they\u00a0arrested him in the end because he\u2019s a bargaining chip for Moscow, for Putin to be exchanged.\u201d Ahead of the trial, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US \u201ccertainly\u201d does not expect Gershkovich to have \u201ca free and fair trial given that these are charges that never should have been brought in the first place.\u201d Miller said embassy personnel were traveling to Yekaterinburg, more than 800 miles from Moscow, and would attempt to attend the trial. Before being transferred to Yekaterinburg, Gershkovich was held in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo prison, spending almost every hour of the day in a small cell as his pre-trial detention period was extended several times. He has passed the time by writing letters to his friends and family, his parents, Ella Milman and Mikhail Gershkovich, said in a recent interview with the WSJ. \u201cHe\u2019s managing the best way he can, in a tiny space, one hour walking outside \u2013 six steps, six steps, six steps,\u201d Milman said, drawing a small courtyard with her finger. \u201cHe\u2019s been exercising, meditating, reading a lot, answering letters. His knowledge of the Russian language and the culture helped him adjust to the situation.\u201d Political \u2018pawns\u2019 In his State of the Union address in March \u2013 with Gershkovich\u2019s parents in the audience \u2013 US President Joe Biden said his administration was working \u201caround the clock to bring home Evan\u201d and other \u201cAmericans being unjustly detained all around the world.\u201d Shortly after the first day of Gershkovich\u2019s trial concluded, the US Embassy in Moscow demanded Russia stop using him and other detained Americans as \u201cbargaining chips.\u201d \u201cThis trial is not about the presentation of evidence, due process or the rule of law. We are talking about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political goals,\u201d the embassy said. The number of Americans being held in Russia has swelled in recent years. Paul Whelan, a former US Marine, was arrested in Moscow in December 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020 on espionage charges, which he has consistently and vehemently denied. The US State Department has also declared him wrongfully detained. After marking another grim milestone last week, surpassing 2,000 days in Russian custody, Whelan told CNN he has spent \u201can incredible amount of time\u201d in detention \u201cfor a crime that never occurred\u201d as he urged the Biden administration to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d to bring him and Gershkovich home. Brittney Griner \u2013 the basketball star who used to play in Russia during the WNBA offseason \u2013 was detained in Russia and sentenced to nine years in prison after authorities found cannabis oil in her luggage. After spending nearly 300 days behind bars, Griner was freed in a prisoner swap for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, nicknamed the \u201cMerchant of Death\u201d by his accusers. A former Soviet military officer, Bout was serving a 25-year sentence in the US on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles and provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2013 charges he and the Kremlin denied. The Kremlin has consistently said that any negotiations regarding a potential prisoner swap\u00a0should be conducted in complete confidentiality, without disclosing any details on the progress of these discussions. Western officials and analysts have accused Russia of using jailed Americans as political pawns. Discussing the case of Ksenia Karelina \u2013 a US-Russian dual citizen also on trial in Yekaterinburg after being accused of donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity \u2013 Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov told CNN that Russia aims \u201cto build up a bank of hostages with American passports,\u201d which Moscow can use \u201cas leverage\u201d in any negotiations with Washington. In an interview with American right-wing pundit Tucker Carlson, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested the Kremlin could be willing to free Gershkovich in exchange for Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from Russia\u2019s domestic spy organization who was convicted of assassinating a former Chechen fighter in broad daylight in Berlin in 2019. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll tell you: sitting in one country, a country that is an ally of the United States, is a man who, for patriotic reasons, eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals,\u201d Putin said.

{"id": "2024_06_28_asia_ratan-tata-sick-dog-scli-intl", "text": "A super-rich Indian businessman took to social media to appeal for urgent blood donations for a critically ill puppy. Ratan Tata, 86, rose to prominence at the helm of the Mumbai-based conglomerate the Tata Group, where in 2008 he famously oversaw Tata Motors\u2019 purchase of British car brands\u00a0Jaguar\u00a0and\u00a0Land Rover\u00a0from Ford. He retired as chairman in 2012 and has since thrown himself into improving the lot of India\u2019s many stray animals. On Thursday, the multimillionaire took to Instagram to appeal for help for a young dog being cared for at the Small Animal Hospital Mumbai, which was set up by Tata himself and opened earlier this year. The post featured a picture of the sick pup, with an IV drip in its front left leg, covered by a blue bandage. Tata, who has 9.7 million Instagram followers, wrote: \u201cI would really really appreciate your help. \u201cThis 7 month dog at our animal hospital needs urgent blood transfusion. He is admitted for a suspected tick fever and life threatening anaemia.\u201d Tata, who tagged the hospital in the post, did not identify the dog by name or sex. However, he did go on to detail the requirements for potential blood donors. Eligible dogs would need to be clinically healthy, aged between 1 and 8 years old, weighing at least 25 kilograms (55 pounds), fully vaccinated and with a clean bill of health. His efforts quickly proved successful, as Tata wrote in a later post that same day: \u201cI would like to thank the spirit of Mumbai and Casper, Leo, Scooby, Ronny and Ivan for coming forward to donate blood for the patient in crisis. We have a cross match on one of you and hope that the recovery will be quick.\u201d According to its website, the new veterinary hospital features \u201cevery possible diagnostic and treatment specialty.\u201d It states: \u201cThe city of Mumbai and its small companion animals have long awaited a one-stop healthcare facility where no stone is left unturned to treat your valued family member. At the Tata Trusts, we have recognised this plea.\u201d In a phone call with CNN, Sandeep Palav on the hospital\u2019s front desk, said: \u201cThe post was put out yesterday and the response was very encouraging. We got the blood donor yesterday and the puppy is now on the way to recovering.\u201d It is unclear whether the dog has an owner or is a stray. Last year, the Press Trust of India estimated there were around 62 million stray dogs in the country, although experts say the real number would be nearly impossible to verify. It is an issue that Tata has previously spoken out about. In an Instagram post last year, he expressed concern for the safety of stray cats and dogs that shelter under cars during the monsoon season. In 2019, Tata posted a picture of himself holding the paw of a German shepherd dog. He wrote: \u201cToday would be the 14th birthday of my late dog, Tito. I still come home to two kind souls and meet so many others in and around the office. While few have the comfort of families, many struggle on the streets, and yet somehow, their affection remains the same. Those of you who strive for the welfare of the voiceless, truly have my respect.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/asia/ratan-tata-sick-dog-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_29_middleeast_iran-presidential-election-runoff-inconclusive-first-round-intl", "text": "A reformist candidate won the most votes in the first round of Iran\u2019s presidential election and will face a conservative hardliner in a run-off next week. None of the four candidates secured more than 50% of the vote in Friday\u2019s election, prompting a second round on July 5. The election saw the lowest voter turnout for a presidential election since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. Reformist lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili, who received the most votes, will face off in the runoff, according to Mohsen Eslami, the spokesperson for the election committee. Pezeshkian led with 42.5% of the votes, followed by Jalili with 38.6%, according to the state news agency IRNA. Out of 60 million eligible voters, 24 million cast their ballots, resulting in a 40% turnout, Eslami said. The results will be reviewed by the Guardian Council, the powerful 12-member body tasked with overseeing elections and legislation,\u00a0before the two candidates start campaigning again. The snap election was held after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash on May 19 in the country\u2019s remote northwest, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials. Two conservatives dropped out of the race just a day before the elections to help the hardline candidates consolidate the conservative vote. Pezeshkian was the only reformist candidate after dozens of other contenders were barred from running by the Guardian Council. The Iranian electoral process has been marred by voter apathy of late, causing embarrassment to an establishment that has relied on high voter turnout to bolster its democratic credentials and popular legitimacy. Nationwide discontent was evident in low voter turnout in both parliamentary and presidential elections in recent years. While Iran has boasted exceptionally high voter participation, its last legislative election in March recorded the lowest turnout since in 1979, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged Iranians to head to the polls and vote after he cast his ballot in the election on Friday morning. \u201cPeople\u2019s participation is part of the essence of the state and continuation of the existence of the Islamic Republic and its status in the world is tied to people\u2019s participation\u201d, he said. Sina Toossi, an Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, DC, said Pezeshkian may have been allowed to run in the elections in an attempt to boost voter turnout. \u201cThis move could be seen as a strategy to create a more dynamic and engaging election process, thereby encouraging greater public participation,\u201d he told CNN. Who is Masoud Pezeshkian? The two candidates set to compete in the next round of elections represent opposite sides of Iran\u2019s political spectrum, and\u00a0both have run for presidential elections unsuccessfully in the past. A health minister under reformist president Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian is a trained heart surgeon and lawmaker. He gained prominence for his stance against the crackdown on the 2009 pro-democracy protests and violence perpetrated by the morality police in 2022 following the death of a young woman in police custody after she was detained for not adhering to the Islamic Republic\u2019s strict dress code for women. During the 2022 protests, Pezeshkian said in an interview with Iran\u2019s IRINN TV: \u201cIt is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\u201d After losing his wife and one of his children in a 1994 car crash, he devoted much of his time to politics. Pezeshkian ran for president in the 2013 and 2021 elections, but failed to make headway. The 69-year-old hails from an ethnically mixed family \u2013 his father is Azeri and his mother is Kurdish. Persian isn\u2019t his mother tongue. That has burnished his image for Iran\u2019s minorities but left him open to xenophobic attacks from some opponents. A more moderate face in the presidency could make it easier for Western states to have conversations with Iran, particularly on the nuclear issue, regional issues and trade, Vali Nasr, a Middle East academic and former adviser to the US State Department, told CNN. Ahead of Friday\u2019s vote, however, Khamenei condemned those seeking improved relations with the West. Pezeshkian has publicly stated that he would defer to Khamenei on matters of foreign policy. Who is Saeed Jalili? Jalili is an ultraconservative hawk known for his uncompromising dealings with the West. He is a longtime top security adviser to Khamenei and a former soldier with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) during the decade-long Iran-Iraq war. As lead negotiator of the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers, he spearheaded Tehran\u2019s efforts to win sanctions relief in exchange for controls on its nuclear program. He emerged as a hard-headed opponent, often lecturing US officials on Iran\u2019s rights during negotiations in Geneva. Iranian media outlets describe him as \u201ca firm and meticulous negotiator who did not make concessions\u201d during nuclear negotiations, believing Iran\u2019s economic development should not depend on \u201cforeign will,\u201d lines echoed by the Supreme Leader ahead of the Friday vote. Jalili unsuccessfully ran for the 2013 presidential election. He ran again in 2021, but withdrew in favor of Raisi, who eventually won. Nasr, the Middle East academic, says that with Friday\u2019s election, the clerical establishment in Iran may have been rethinking what the last presidential election produced. Under Raisi, he says, \u201cthe entire system became uniformly hardline, conservative.\u201d Arash Azizi, an Iranian writer and fellow at the Center for Middle East and Global Order (CMEG), said that \u201ca victory by the fundamentalist Jalili\u201d would complicate efforts to restart negotiations with the West. Escalating tensions The elections came at a delicate time for the Islamic Republic. The country is embroiled in escalating tensions with Israel and its Western allies, triggered by the war in Gaza and the advancement of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The vote also takes place just two months after Iran and Israel exchanged fire for the first time as the Gaza conflict widened. Israel is now preparing for a potential second front with Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s primary regional proxy, in Lebanon. Azizi said Iran\u2019s shadow war with Israel \u201cwill go on regardless of who wins\u201d as the most important decisions in that regard are taken by Khamenei and security bodies, not the president. The country\u2019s Supreme Leader is the final arbiter for most decisions in Iran, but the elected president will be the face of the Islamic Republic abroad. Iran\u2019s fight with the US has left the economy in tatters, crippled by years of American sanctions, a weakening local currency and high inflation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/29/middleeast/iran-presidential-election-runoff-inconclusive-first-round-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

The cause of the crash remains unclear and investigation is ongoing, according to the emergency services. Those who died are believed to have been on the bus. Slovak national railway company ZSSK said on a statement on Facebook that none of the more than 100 passengers on the EuroCity train died as it sent its condolences to \u201cthe families and loved ones of the bus passengers who were injured or lost in this accident.\u201d The emergency response continued into the night at the crash site in Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky, southern\u00a0Slovakia, the Slovak Emergency Medical Service said. Five ambulance vehicles and three ambulance helicopters are on the scene. Reuters footage from the scene showed smoke and fire billowing from a train carriage, with a person in the background heard saying: \u201cThere was just a big bang. Then the train stopped. We were able to get off, but the whole front part of the train was burning.\u201d The train was traveling from the Czech capital of Prague to the Hungarian capital of Budapest. More than 100 of its stranded passengers were transported by buses to the town of Sturovo on the Hungarian border. The locomotive and the driver of the train belonged to the Czech national railway company, while the carriages and the rest of the train staff were Slovak. The crash on Thursday was a second deadly collision involving an international train in the region in just three weeks. Four people were killed and more than 20 others injured on June 6 when a passenger\u00a0train\u00a0collided with a freight\u00a0train\u00a0in Pardubice in the\u00a0Czech\u00a0Republic. \u201cAll passengers were evacuated from the scene with the assistance of our staff.

The latest people to be apprehended were the former commanding general of the air force, a sergeant accused of ramming a military vehicle into the government palace, another sergeant accused of driving a separate vehicle carrying military leaders, and an infantry captain accused of coordinating the movement of troops, according to Government Minister Eduardo del Castillo. The news brings the total number of arrests to 21. Wednesday\u2019s coup attempt prompted shock around the world, with images out of the capital La Paz showing military personnel occupying a square, armored vehicles ramming the palace door and soldiers trying to break into government offices. A report sent to CNN by the Bolivian government said military officials first held meetings in May to plot the coup attempt. The meetings were led by former army chief Gen. Juan Jose Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and former navy commander Gen.

{"id": "2024_06_28_middleeast_iran-presidential-election-june-28-mime-intl", "text": "Under the specter of conflict with Israel, a struggling economy and social discontent, Iranians headed to the polls on Friday for snap presidential elections that could be the most important for the country in decades. The sudden death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a recent helicopter crash, alongside Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials, has left a leadership void. Raisi, a hardline regime loyalist, was widely regarded as a leading candidate to replace Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, 85-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate authority over all state matters. It is also the first presidential election since the death of Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country\u2019s notorious morality police in 2022, an event that sparked the largest protests since the regime\u2019s founding in 1979. The vote takes place amid deteriorating relations with the West, an advancing Iranian nuclear program, and an increasing risk of direct war with Israel. Just two months ago, Iran and Israel exchanged fire for the first time as the Gaza conflict widened, and Israel is now preparing for a potential second front with Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s primary regional proxy, in Lebanon. Three conservatives are vying with a single reformist candidate for the country\u2019s top elected seat, after dozens of other candidates were barred from standing. Of those running, Masoud Pezeshkian, 69, a reformist lawmaker and former health minister, Saeed Jalili a hardline security adviser and nuclear negotiator, and Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the conservative speaker of the Iranian parliament, are widely considered the frontrunners in the first round of elections. The final candidates were pre-selected by Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, which reports directly to Khamenei. Some polls have shown increasing popularity for Pezeshkian, with the rest of the conservatives splitting the vote. During nationwide protests against Amini\u2019s death in 2022, Pezeshkian said in an interview with Iran\u2019s IRINN TV: \u201cIt is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\u201d On Thursday, two conservative candidates, Amirhossein Qazizadeh-Hashemi and Alireza Zakani, withdrew from the race to help consolidate the hardline vote. Qazizadeh-Hashemi urged other candidates from the \u201crevolution camp\u201d to do the same to secure a hardliner victory. Any candidate who wins at least 50% of votes in the first round will be elected president, otherwise the two top-ranking candidates will face off in a second round a week later. \u201cThese are nothing like free and fair elections, and only those who\u2019ve already pledged absolute loyalty to Khamenei and the Islamic Republic can run,\u201d said Arash Azizi, an Iranian writer and fellow at the Center for Middle East and Global Order (CMEG), a Berlin-based think tank. \u201cBut there are still very important differences between the three main candidates. Each of them present certain problems for Khamenei.\u201d The top contenders are children of Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution, likely shaped by their experiences fighting the then US-backed Saddam Hussein regime in the bloody, decade-long war with their neighbor Iraq, as well as careers serving the Iranian state. \u00a0\u00a0But voters\u2019 choice between either of the conservatives or their reformist co-candidate will steer a different path forward for the country. \u201cWhat we have seen in this election compared to (the) previous one (in 2021), is that in the last couple of days there has been a degree of energy for the election,\u201d said Trita Parsi, a Washington-based Iran analyst and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, suggesting the participation rate may end up being higher than previous elections. The Iranian electoral process has been marred by voter apathy of late, causing embarrassment to an establishment that has relied on high voter turnout to bolster its democratic credentials and popular legitimacy. Elections in March for the parliament and the Assembly of Experts, an oversight body responsible for selecting the Supreme Leader\u2019s successor, recorded the lowest turnout since the Islamic Republic\u2019s founding, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot. Khamenei urged Iranians to head to the polls and vote after he cast his ballot in the election on Friday morning. \u201cPeople\u2019s participation is part of the essence of the state and continuation of the existence of the Islamic Republic and its status in the world is tied to people\u2019s participation\u201d, he said. Despite some momentum, however, low voter turnout \u201cremains a distinct possibility, fueled by widespread disillusionment and economic hardships,\u201d said Sina Toossi, an Iran analyst and senior fellow at the Center for International Policy in Washington, DC. \u201cMany Iranians feel disenfranchised and skeptical about the electoral process, doubting its ability to bring about meaningful change, particularly in light of the government\u2019s violent repression of popular protests in recent years,\u201d he said. \u201cA substantial number of Iranians say they will boycott the elections, including prominent civil society activists and political prisoners like Nobel Laureate Narges Mohammadi.\u201d \u2018Iranians need simple things\u2019 At Shiroudi stadium in Tehran, there was an ebullient atmosphere Wednesday as supporters of the conservative Ghalibaf gathered for his final campaign rally. Several thousand Iranians crammed into the indoor arena, mobbing the candidate as he entered, chanting: \u201cWe salute Raisi, we say hello to Ghalibaf.\u201d \u201cGhalibaf is the one who supports the Supreme Leader and follows him. Whatever the Supreme Leader says, he puts into practice,\u201d Ahmad, 32, a clerical official, said in the crowd. Iranians who spoke to CNN only agreed to give their first names in order to be able to speak candidly. Economic concerns are foremost on the minds of many voters. In June, inflation in Iran stood at 36.1%, straining wallets across the country. Although down from highs exceeding 45% last year, the country\u2019s annual inflation rate hasn\u2019t dipped below 30% in over five years. This persistent inflation follows the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement and the subsequent reimposition of heavy sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Ghalibaf has been determined in his attacks on the 2015 nuclear deal and paths towards rapprochement with the West, pinning much of the country\u2019s economic woes on Iran\u2019s Western enemies. \u201cThe first thing people expect is economic development. There is no doubt that this development can happen through the path of elections,\u201d Ghalibaf shouted to the crowd, echoing promises from his campaign. Draped along the walls were campaign pledges of food on the table of all Iranian households and free land for homeless families. \u201cIt worries me when people run after candidates like Ghalibaf,\u201d one university worker told CNN outside the rally. Leaning towards voting for Pezeshkian, the only reformist candidate, she said she had come to Ghalibaf\u2019s rally to hear him speak before deciding who to vote for. \u201cIranians need simple things, a good economy, good relations with other countries,\u201d she said, adding that she trusted Pezeshkian to deliver on them. \u2018A small window of hope\u2019 As night fell at the nearby Heidarnia stadium, supporters of Pezeshkian gathered to hear him speak, with many focused on improving Iran\u2019s international relations. \u201cThe change we need in politics is foreign policy so it will result in improvements in people\u2019s economic situation,\u201d Mariam, 23, told CNN. She added that voting for a conservative would be a repeat of the late President Raisi, whom she criticized for failing to fulfill his promises, and for not reining in Iran\u2019s infamous morality police. Around her, the crowd was on edge, an urgent energy rippled across the stadium. An hour before, organizers abruptly announced the event had been cancelled, and police blocked the gate. Despondent supporters poured into nearby streets; their chants, like the mood, were resolute: \u201cOur vote is one word: Pezeshkian.\u201d Cheers surged through the crowd of several thousand Pezeshkian supporters when they were later allowed into the stadium but the incident in the final hours of his campaign stung his assembled voters. \u201cWe only have a small window of hope, which is Pezeshkian,\u201d Mohammad, 47, a journalist, told CNN at the rally. \u201cWe cannot change the constitution \u2026 we should move forwards step by step, until we reach the democracy that people are seeking.\u201d Parsi, the Iran expert, suggested that enthusiasm for this vote may stem from it being a snap election. \u201cNo one expected this to happen,\u201d he said, noting that Raisi\u2019s unexpected death might be creating a public perception that \u201cperhaps the regime doesn\u2019t have the capability of controlling this election,\u201d as it has in the past. Relations with the West Iran\u2019s foreign policy direction is largely steered by Khamenei, and the president\u2019s role is principally domestic. However, the future president and his foreign minister will play a crucial role in the working relations with the international community. \u201cPezeshkian\u2019s victory won\u2019t be bad news for Khamenei and, in fact, might even be the best outcome since he will be a weak president with a smaller base and thus easier to control,\u201d said Azizi. Pezeshkian\u2019s key ally is former Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. If the US-educated Zarif, who oversaw the warmest recent period of ties with Washington, returns in an official capacity, he may provide a conduit for an easing of tensions with the West. However, this week Khamenei condemned those chasing improved relations with the West - in an apparent implicit attack on Pezeshkian and Zarif. He blasted thinking that, \u201call the ways of progress pass through the US.\u201d Politicians who think they cannot progress without being in the US\u2019 favor \u201cwill not manage (the country) well,\u201d Khamenei was cited as saying in Iranian state media. Even if Tehran isn\u2019t expected to pivot towards the West anytime soon, the prospect of an uncompromising Trump presidency and the already bloody tensions in the Middle East make any improvement in relations crucial. Moreover, even if a more Western-friendly candidate takes power, a shift in Iran\u2019s foreign relations is not guaranteed, as goodwill gestures toward the West may not be reciprocated. \u201cA more Western-oriented administration in Iran may not find a willing partner in Washington under Biden,\u201d Parsi said. \u201cIt takes two to tango.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/28/middleeast/iran-presidential-election-june-28-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

Taylor Casey was last seen on June 19 around Paradise Island, a small resort enclave just off the shore of the island of New Providence, the Royal Bahamas Police Force said. The organizers of the retreat asked Bahamian police to investigate, according to a statement from the Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat obtained by CNN on Tuesday. The retreat learned of Casey\u2019s disappearance when she failed to attend morning classes, according to the statement. She was last seen late on the evening of June 19 and the \u201corganization has also advised the US Embassy as well as Taylor Casey\u2019s family,\u201d the statement said. A missing person flyer released by police did not provide details of the circumstances of her disappearance or say whether foul play is suspected. Authorities said Wednesday that they found Casey\u2019s cellphone in the waters, but it\u2019s unclear the distance it was from the yoga retreat. \u201cWe have conducted extensive investigation into the matter,\u201d Royal Bahamas Police Force Chief Superintendent Chrislyn Skippings said in a press conference Wednesday. \u201cOur priority is to find Taylor and to find Taylor in good health.\u201d Skippings said police have utilized drones, search-and-rescue dogs and divers in the investigation. They are also working with Casey\u2019s family, checking CCTV cameras and interviewing retreat attendees, Skippings said. Casey\u2019s family is pleading with the public for help finding her and urging anyone with information to contact police in the Bahamas. \u201cWe are deeply concerned for Taylor\u2019s safety and well-being,\u201d said Casey\u2019s mother, Colette Seymore, in a\u00a0release\u00a0posted on a\u00a0Facebook page\u00a0dedicated to locating Casey. \u201cWe love Taylor and want her home.\u201d Taylor, who has been practicing yoga for 15 years, went to the yoga retreat \u201cto fulfill a long-term goal of deepening her practice,\u201d the family said in the release. Seymore found out her daughter was missing when she received a call from the retreat where Casey was training for her yoga certification, she said in an interview with ABC\u2019s Good Morning America Wednesday. \u201cA young lady called me and said, \u2018Have you heard from Taylor?\u2019\u201d Seymore said. \u201cAnd then she said, \u2018Taylor hasn\u2019t showed up for yoga classes.\u2019\u201d \u201cA mother\u2019s intuition and answers I was getting just didn\u2019t correlate \u2013 just wasn\u2019t what I wanted to hear,\u201d Seymore told ABC. Seymore earlier on Facebook said she fears Casey is in danger because her daughter was \u201ceager to share her yoga retreat experience with others upon her return.\u201d \u201cTaylor would never disappear like this,\u201d the mother added. Seymore told CNN she was headed to the\u00a0Bahamas\u00a0on Tuesday but provided no further comment. CNN has reached out to a family spokesperson for more information. Casey\u2019s family described her as\u00a0\u201ca light-skinned Black woman, approximately 5 feet 10 inches tall and 145 pounds, with has brown hair and brown eyes.\u201d The US State Department in January issued a\u00a0Level 2\u00a0travel\u00a0advisory\u00a0for Americans traveling to the\u00a0Bahamas, warning them to \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d due to crime.

{"id": "2024_06_25_world_julian-assange-plea-deal-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange pled guilty to a single espionage charge in front on a US judge Wednesday and walked free after his 12-year battle against extradition to the United States ended in a plea deal. The controversial figure was released from a British prison on Monday and flew by charter jet to a remote US territory in the Pacific where he officially entered his guilty plea and was sentenced to time already served. He then flew onward to Australia, arriving in his home nation as a free man on Wednesday night. The 52-year-old has spent the past five years in the high-security prison in southeast London and nearly seven years before that holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in the British capital,\u00a0trying to avoid arrest that could have led to life imprisonment. On Monday, Assange agreed to plead guilty to a felony charge related to his alleged role in one of the largest US government breaches of classified materials after his whistleblowing website published nearly half a million secret military documents relating to the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The plea deal caps a years-long legal saga that has spanned multiple continents. Here\u2019s what we know: Where is Assange? Assange boarded a flight from London\u2019s Stansted airport on Monday after being released on bail from prison, according to\u00a0a\u00a0statement\u00a0from WikiLeaks on Tuesday. \u201cJulian Assange is free,\u201d WikiLeaks said. \u201cHe left Belmarsh maximum security prison on the morning of 24 June, after having spent 1,901 days there.\u201d Traveling with Australia\u2019s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Stephen Smith, Assange flew to Saipan, the largest island and capital of the remote Northern Mariana Islands in the Pacific. Under the terms of the agreement, US Justice Department prosecutors sought a 62-month sentence \u2013 which is equal to the amount of time Assange served in\u00a0the United Kingdom while he fought extradition. The plea deal\u00a0credited that time served, allowing Assange to immediately return to Australia. With Assange resistant to setting foot in the continental US to enter his guilty plea, a judge conducted the hearing and sentencing together on Wednesday in Saipan, where a US federal district court is located. \u201cIt appears that your 62 months imprisonment is fair and reasonable,\u201d Judge Ramona Manglona said in her sentencing. \u201cYou will be able to walk out of this courtroom a free man.\u201d The Pacific island chain is a US territory some 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles) west of Hawaii and\u00a0closer to\u00a0Australia, where Assange is a citizen and traveled onto next. What did Assange do? Assange was wanted by\u00a0US authorities on\u00a0espionage charges\u00a0connected to Wikileaks\u2019 publication of\u00a0hundreds of thousands of sensitive military and government documents supplied by\u00a0former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning\u00a0in 2010 and 2011. The US accused Assange of endangering the lives of confidential sources by releasing the unfiltered cables and had for years been seeking his extradition. He faced 18 charges for his alleged role in the breach and faced a maximum of up to 175 years in prison. British authorities had sought reassurances from the US that he would not receive the death penalty. From Townsville, eastern Queensland, Assange started WikiLeaks in 2006 as an online repository that would publish anonymously submitted material, including the US military\u2019s operating manual for its detention camp in Guantanamo Bay and internal documents from the\u00a0Church of Scientology. In 2010, WikiLeaks was catapulted to global attention when it released video that claimed to show a deadly 2007 US helicopter attack in Iraq. Soon after, WikiLeaks released thousands of classified US military documents relating to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as a trove of diplomatic cables. Assange described the documents previously to CNN as \u201ccompelling evidence of war crimes\u201d committed by US-led coalition and Iraqi government forces. Fight against extradition Assange had long argued the case against him was politically motivated, that he would not face a fair trial, and his handover would violate the European Convention on Human Rights. Free speech advocates condemned the extradition attempt, saying it would have a chilling effect on press freedom. In August 2010, Assange was accused of sexual assault in Sweden and faced an international arrest warrant. He denied the allegations as \u201ca smear campaign\u201d and refused to go to Stockholm for questioning. He turned himself in to British authorities but while out on bail in 2012 as he appealed extradition to Sweden, Assange fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy requesting political asylum. During his time in the embassy, WikiLeaks kept up its data dumps, including in 2016 when it released thousands of emails apparently hacked from the Democratic National Committee and emails stolen from the private email account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, on the eve of the US election. But over time, his relationship with his host soured and Ecuador\u2019s president came under pressure from the US\u00a0to expel him from the diplomatic bolthole. In 2019, Assange was pulled from the embassy by London\u2019s Metroplitan Police on an extradition warrant from the US Justice Department, and spent the next five years living\u00a0mostly isolated, in a 3-by-2-meter cell at Belmarsh prison. The prison has capacity for more than 900 inmates and is known for once housing infamous terror suspects such as the radical Egyptian cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri\u00a0within its high-security unit. Support for Assange\u2019s release There has recently been increased pressure for Assange\u2019s case to be resolved. In May, London\u2019s High Court ruled that Assange\u00a0had the right to appeal in his final challenge against extradition to the US, and US President Joe Biden had alluded to a possible deal pushed by Australian government officials in April. The UN special rapporteur on torture and Amnesty International were among those who called on the United Kingdom to halt the possible extradition, citing concerns over the risk of abuse and other ill-treatment if Assange was sent to the US. Upon his release Monday, Assange\u2019s wife, Stella\u00a0Assange, posted on social media, \u201cJulian is free!\u201d \u201cWords cannot express our immense gratitude to YOU- yes YOU, who have all mobilised for years and years to make this come true,\u201d she wrote. Assange\u2019s mother, Christine Assange, said she is \u201cgrateful that my son\u2019s ordeal is finally coming to an end,\u201d in a statement obtained by CNN on Tuesday. Speaking in parliament Wednesday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was \u201cpleased that (Assange) was on his way home to Australia to reunite with his family.\u201d \u201cThis outcome has been the product of careful, patient and determined work,\u201d Albanese said, adding \u201cthis is what standing up for Australians around the world looks like.\u201d Former Ecuadorian president Len\u00edn Moreno told CNN he is glad the WikiLeaks founder won\u2019t be handed over to the US. Moreno withdrew\u00a0Assange\u2019s asylum in April 2019, which had\u00a0allowed him to stay at the South American country\u2019s embassy in London. Among those celebrating Assange\u2019s release were the presidents of Colombia and Mexico. \u201cAssange\u2019s eternal imprisonment and torture was an attack on press freedom on a global scale,\u201d said Colombian President Gustavo Petro. Meanwhile, Alan Rusbridger, editor of the UK political monthly Prospect Magazine who previously collaborated with Assange, said in a post on X that it was \u201cgood news that Assange is apparently free.\u201d He continued, \u201cEnough was enough. But his treatment was a warning to journalists and whistleblowers to keep quiet in future. And I suspect it will have worked.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/world/julian-assange-plea-deal-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
