Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

{"id": "2024_05_06_asia_china-australia-helicopter-flares-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "Australia has accused a Chinese fighter jet of firing flares into the path of a naval helicopter last weekend over international waters of the Yellow Sea, an action that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese blasted as \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d The Australian MH-60R Seahawk helicopter was on patrol enforcing United Nations sanctions on North Korea at the time of the incident, the Defense Ministry in Canberra said, adding the move put the lives of the helicopter crew in danger. \u201cThis was an unsafe maneuver which posed a risk to the aircraft and personnel,\u201d the statement from Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said. The Chinese jet \u201cdropped flares about 300 meters (984 feet) in front of the Seahawk helicopter and about 60 meters (197 feet) above it,\u201d Marles said in an interview with CNN affiliate Nine News on Monday. No damage or injuries were reported, but flares can lead to the downing of a helicopter if they strike and damage its rotor blades, or if they are ingested into its engines. The incident is the latest in a growing list of confrontations in international waters between China\u2019s military and other nations, and it comes as Canberra and Beijing are pursuing a rapprochement following a bruising few years of trade disputes and strained relations. China defended the action by its military and rejected Australia\u2019s claim that the interception was unsafe. \u201cUnder the guise of implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions, Australian warships and aircraft deliberately approached China\u2019s airspace to cause trouble and provocation, endangering China\u2019s maritime and air security,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters at a regular briefing. \u201cAs a warning, the Chinese military took necessary measures at the scene. Relevant operations are legal, compliant, professional and safe.\u201d In a separate statement, China\u2019s Ministry of Defense said the Australian helicopters were conducting \u201cclose reconnaissance\u201d during China\u2019s \u201cnormal training activities\u201d and called its actions warning them to leave \u201clegitimate.\u201d It also accused Australia of \u201cspreading false narratives.\u201d The MH-60 Seahawk is a twin-engine helicopter and carries a crew of three, according to the Australian Navy. The Australian helicopter was operating from the destroyer HMAS Hobart in international waters of the Yellow Sea as part of Operation Argos, Canberra\u2019s contribution to a multinational effort to enforce UN sanctions against North Korea, according to a statement from the Australian Defense Ministry. Albanese called the Chinese actions \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d in a television interview Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re in international waters, international airspace, and they\u2019re doing work to ensure that the sanctions that the world has imposed through the United Nations on North Korea, due to their intransient and reckless behavior, are enforced,\u201d the prime minister told CNN affiliate Nine News. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have been at any risk while they engaged in that behavior,\u201d Albanese said of the Australian crew. Albanese said \u201cappropriate diplomatic representations\u201d have been made with Beijing. \u201cWe\u2019ve just made it very clear to China that this is unprofessional and that it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d he said. The incident was similar to an encounter between a Chinese fighter jet and a Canadian military helicopter over the South China Sea in late October when flares were also fired in the path of the helicopter. \u201cThe risk to a helicopter in that instance is the flares moving into the rotor blades or the engines so this was categorized as both unsafe and non-standard, unprofessional,\u201d Maj. Rob Millen, air officer aboard the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ottawa, told CNN after the October incident. After that incident China defended its actions and accused Canadian forces of conducting unspecified \u201cmalicious and provocative act with ulterior motives.\u201d Australian opposition leader Peter Dutton urged Albanese to call Chinese leader Xi Jinping to express Canberra\u2019s concerns over the latest incident, but also over a long list of Chinese encounters with Australian and allied aircraft and ships. \u201cAt some stage, there\u2019s going to be a miscalculation and an Australian Defense Force member is going to lose their life. That is a tragic circumstance that has to be avoided at all costs,\u201d Dutton said in an interview with Nine News. \u201cThere will be a miscalculation by somebody who\u2019s flying that jet or somebody who\u2019s on the deck of a Chinese naval ship. Something will happen and that\u2019s what, not just Australia is worried about, the Philippines, Japan, obviously the United States, many other countries in the region, who are very worried about these acts that continue to be provocative, and completely and utterly unnecessary.\u201d Previous contentious and potentially dangerous incidents between Australia and China include an encounter in waters near Japan last November when Australia said a Chinese warship used sonar waves to harass Australian Navy divers in the water trying to untangle fishing nets from the propellers of the frigate HMAS Toowoomba, resulting in minor injuries to the divers. According to Australian public broadcaster ABC, Australian Navy Vice Adm. Mark Hammond raised the Toowoomba incident in a meeting with Chinese navy Adm. Hu Zhongming at an international naval symposium in Qingdao. \u201cI sought his concurrence to prioritize the safety of our respective navy personnel and to  prevent a reoccurrence of this incident,\u201d ABC quoted Hammond as saying. In June 2022, a Chinese fighter jet released flares and chaff that entered at least one of the two engines on an Australian P-8A flying in international waters over the South China Sea, Australia said. Earlier in 2022, Australia said a Chinese warship used a laser to \u201cilluminate\u201d an Australian P-8A aircraft in waters north of Australia. Pilots targeted by laser attacks have reported disorienting flashes, pain, spasms and spots in their vision and even temporary blindness. China has denied wrongdoing in all incidents, saying its forces act in accordance with international law while protecting Chinese interests.

{"id": "climate_miami-ecoreef-artificial-reef-scn-c2e-spc-intl", "text": "Miami Beach, Florida is known for its art deco flair and turquoise waters. But just off the coast of this colorful city lies an underwater world in decline. Florida\u2019s coral reef spans nearly 563 kilometers (350 miles) and is home to some 40 species of corals that not only provide food and shelter for aquatic life, but also help protect coastal communities from storm damage. Like other coral reefs, over the last few decades, this vibrant ecosystem has been suffering from the effects of climate change, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently reporting a fourth global mass bleaching event \u2013 the second in the last decade. Bleaching happens when the corals become stressed due to changes in their environment and expel the colorful algae living on them. The corals turn white and begin to weaken. \u201cIf the bleaching goes on for an extended amount of time, the corals die,\u201d says Diego Lirman, associate professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami. Lirman runs the Rescue a Reef lab, which aims to help conserve and restore this valuable yet vulnerable habitat. \u201cCoastal ecosystems protect our shorelines against the impacts of storms and waves,\u201d Lirman says. \u201cThey\u2019re the speed bumps of the ocean.\u201d Off the coast of North Miami Beach, he leads an underwater experiment that combines natural corals with an artificial structure \u2013 creating a hybrid reef that he hopes will mimic the effects of a real one. \u201cSpeed bumps of the ocean\u201d Increasingly, artificial reefs are being implemented all over the world to help restore marine ecosystems \u2013 from 3D-printed tiles to sunken ships. Studies suggest that man-made structures can be effective, but factors like location, design and placement can influence the outcome. In 2009, the UN\u2019s International Maritime Organization produced guidelines around the placement of artificial reefs, noting that these reefs can have a negative impact \u201cespecially when waste, recycled or unsuitable materials are used.\u201d Lirman\u2019s hybrid ECoREEF project consists of a concrete foundation covered with corals transplanted from his nurseries. The experiment was born in the lab, where model versions went through many tests, including extensive simulations in a powerful wave generator capable of recreating category 5 hurricane conditions. Lirman says the base alone can reduce wave action by 60 to 70%, with corals further reducing it by another 15 to 20%. \u201cCombined, these two approaches can reduce wave energy and wave height by about 80 to 90%, which is what we want to protect our shorelines,\u201d Lirman tells CNN. In partnership with the city of Miami Beach, two hybrid reefs were deployed in March 2023. Over the last year, Emily Esplandiu, a research associate in Lirman\u2019s coral restoration lab, says they\u2019ve witnessed different fish species colonize the reef, along with turtles, sharks and rays. She tells CNN that they\u2019ve seen the corals they planted grow and flourish there, as well. \u201cSo now we can look at how different species and genotypes survive in these conditions and how resilient they are through high temperatures,\u201d she says. Coral gardening Lirman\u2019s team has been growing and testing coral colonies at the university for more than 15 years. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand why some corals survive while others in the same environment die,\u201d Lirman says. \u201cWe\u2019re learn[ing] from the survivors, what is it about their physiology, their genetics? And then we\u2019re using that information to create climate-resistant corals.\u201d The lab is also experimenting with \u201cstress hardening,\u201d where researchers expose corals to sub-lethal temperatures to prime their physiological response, making them less vulnerable to fluctuating ocean temperatures. The corals are then transplanted onto natural reefs or onto the hybrid structures. Every year, his team plants 10,000 to 15,000 corals onto the reefs of Miami-Dade, Lirman says. Over the next few years, Lirman and his team plan to expand the scale of the ECoREEF project significantly, deploying bigger structures around the Miami area, thanks to US Department of Defense funding. \u201cThey realized that the health of the coastal ecosystems becomes a national security issue when their coastal bases get impacted by storms, and then they are unable to do their job,\u201d Lirman tells CNN. A global problem Ocean ecosystems are declining and suffering around the world, Lirman says. The number one threat to corals globally is climate change, which is increasing sea temperature and leading to changes in storm patterns and ocean chemistry. Overfishing and dredging also play a role, Lirman says. As a result, coastal areas are becoming more exposed to waves and flooding. \u201cAfter every storm, the cost of rebuilding and the loss of property and lives, it is just huge,\u201d Lirman says. \u201cWe need to protect our shorelines and nature-based solutions [like] hybrid reefs are one effective, cost efficient way of doing that.\u201d While Lirman hopes his experiment can serve as an example for other seaboard cities around the world, he says we also need to curb climate-warming carbon emissions \u2013 \u201cif we don\u2019t do that, no amount of artificial reefs will save our coastlines.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/climate/miami-ecoreef-artificial-reef-scn-c2e-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_08_africa_from-anonymity-to-empowerment-the-journey-of-diary-of-a-naija-girl", "text": "In the bustling world of social media, where everyone strives to be heard, few voices rise above the noise to truly make an impact. One such voice is that of Ifedayo Agoro, the founder of Diary of a Naija Girl (DANG), a platform that started as a simple Instagram page and has since grown into a thriving community of nearly one million followers across social media sites. The journey for the Nigerian former oil and gas executive began with a simple idea in 2006 \u2013 to share her stories and opinions authentically and without fear or shame. \u201cI realized the culture of shame had grown so much and I thought to myself, \u2018This is not how I grew up\u2026 I\u2019m gonna tell my story, the good, the bad, and the ugly, and I will not be ashamed,\u2019\u201d Agoro recalled. Candid conversations Through candid conversations and shared narratives, members of the DANG community confront taboo topics such as gender-based violence, discrimination, body image, mental health, and reproductive rights. \u201cWhat drives the content is the platform\u2019s values; to live our best life, never be suppressed by shame and our experiences, and learn and unlearn everything. Whatever falls under these values is what we put out,\u201d she explained. Agoro, 40, champions the message of self-worth and autonomy, inspiring women to embrace their individuality and make decisions based on their desires, not societal expectations. \u201cWomen are beginning to understand that they are worthy anyway, with marriage or without it,\u201d she said. She is often accused of being anti-men and marriage and Agoro was keen to clarify her stance on relationships. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-marriage\u2026 I just know that my life is still full without it. \u201cHusbands would write to me that I\u2019m spoiling their wives and teaching them to be rude and not submissive. Men would throw jabs at me on Twitter\u2026 they were just not happy that I was expressing\u2026 what other women are too scared to say,\u201d she told CNN. Although she admits the vitriol has lessened considerably. \u201cI would attribute that to not backing down. I\u2019m a person that\u2019s just going to do what I want to do.\u201d Undeterred by detractors, Agoro continues to amplify women\u2019s voices and create a safe space for women to share without limits. This ultimately led Agoro to create the #DangAfterHours series, a no-holds-barred discussion on sex and sexuality, a real taboo subject in Nigeria, Agoro says. \u201cWomen in Nigeria are not really able to talk about sex without being labeled promiscuous. I want to talk about sex in a hilarious way, we can learn from it and bond on that topic. The response shows that the conversation needed to happen.\u201d Creating impact Over the years, Agoro has used the DANG platform to transform the lives of hundreds of women. A self-described \u201cempath\u201d she finds herself getting involved in the lives of the women who reach her for help and advice, often \u201cbawling her eyes out,\u201d over their triumphs and tribulations, she says. However, one moment stands out for her. \u201cA few years ago, there was a lady who was sick in the hospital in Lagos and at the time doctors were on strike. She sent me a message saying \u2018I\u2019m losing blood, pregnant and sick. There\u2019s no one to attend to me. Please help me I don\u2019t want to die.\u2019\u201d Angered, Agoro says she took to her social media and posted about the woman\u2019s predicament. \u201cAfter I posted that, the office of the then First Lady reached me and resolved the issue immediately and the lady was attended to quickly and her tests were done. That was the day I realized the power of what we were doing.\u201d When she started posting her story on Instagram, Agoro initially chose to remain anonymous, to avoid the pressure of public scrutiny. However, as her platform gained traction, she confronted a pivotal moment when her identity was threatened to be exposed. Rather than succumbing to fear, she decided to reveal herself. \u201cI initially didn\u2019t see the need to put my face\u2026 and when the platform became bigger\u2026 I realized that this may not be sustainable. I have ambitions to write a book, to create a company. Then, someone threatened to reveal my identity, so I outed myself and it has been a blessing in disguise, so thank you to the person,\u2019 she joked. Soon after, she launched her DANG Lifestyle and skincare business which has grown largely through word of mouth through the DANG community, Agoro says. \u201cWe started with candles and went into skincare and we haven\u2019t done any campaign at all but have sold over 400,000 units. I owe the trajectory of the DANG lifestyle to the community. But It\u2019s a business that has to leave our comfort zone in Nigeria. Dang Lifestyle is already in the UK, USA, Ghana, and Kenya and we want to take it to more countries,\u201d she said. Despite aiming her message squarely at women, Agoro doesn\u2019t discount a future where men would be integrated into the community. \u201cI now get men commenting and saying to me, \u2018We are DANG men too, include us in the conversation.\u2019 We are happy to have them in the conversation. I can see that some of them want to learn and do better. I believe we have to tell them kindly and gracefully what we want or we don\u2019t get the change we want,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/africa/from-anonymity-to-empowerment-the-journey-of-diary-of-a-naija-girl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

The brothers, Jake and Callum Robinson, and American friend Jack Carter Rhoad, were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana, when they went missing on April 29. Earlier this week, three bodies were found dumped in a well with gunshot wounds to the head. On Sunday, Mexican authorities confirmed their identities as the three missing friends with the help of relatives who flew out help investigators. \u201cOur hearts are broken and the world has become a darker place for us,\u201d said Debra Robinson, speaking from San Diego, where she and her husband had since flown to, according to Seven Network Australia. \u201cWe also mourn the loss of Carter Rhoad, a close friend. They were young men, enjoying their passion of surfing together,\u201d she said. She thanked the friends, family and supporters who have reached out, saying: \u201cWe know that they were truly loved and impacted many people\u2019s lives.\u201d Standing beside her husband Martin on the beach, the sound the Pacific waves crashing in the background, the Perth-based couple then paid tribute to the brothers: Callum, 33, who was based in San Diego and played for Australia\u2019s national lacrosse team, and Jake, a 30-year-old doctor who flew from Australia two weeks ago to join his brother in their travels, his parents previously told CNN affiliate Seven News. \u201cCallum was a lovable, larger-than-life character and considered the United States his second home. Known as the Big Koala, he played professional lacrosse in the PLL and represented Australia in the World Championships and always found time to coach the junior teams,\u201d said Debra. \u201cHis brother Jake was a happy, gentle and compassionate soul who\u00a0was pursuing a career in medicine. Jake\u2019s passion was surfing and it was no coincidence that many of his hospitals that he worked in were close to surfing beaches,\u201d she added \u2013 listing Jake\u2019s other hobbies and passions, including running, swimming, cricket and live music. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to bring them home to family and friends and the ocean waves in Australia,\u201d she said, speaking through tears. \u201cPlease live bigger, shine brighter and love harder in their memory.\u201d Jake and Callum\u2019s father, Martin, also spoke to extend his thanks to the Australian agencies that had helped in the search for their sons \u2013 including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Federal Police, and the Australian Embassy in Mexico. He also thanked Australia\u2019s Foreign Minister Penny Wong, saying she had\u00a0called\u00a0to express her support on Monday. Mexican authorities have vowed to investigate the murders, saying the surfers may have been attacked in an attempted vehicle robbery.\u00a0Baja California\u00a0has been plagued by cartel violence in recent years, though it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada. Dozens of people held a protest last week in Ensenada calling on authorities to do more to tackle violence facing tourists and locals alike. Many held up surfboards with slogans written on them in tribute to the three slain tourists. Drug cartels have terrorized Mexico with ever-increasing levels of violence, fueled in part by huge demand for drugs from US consumers and armed with an arsenal of weaponry from north of the border. While parts of Mexico are established tourist destinations, violent crime including kidnapping and human trafficking plague parts of the country, particularly in border areas. Mexico\u2019s\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is among the highest in the world, and\u00a0more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country. Studies show only around seven percent of murders in Mexico are ever solved.

{"id": "2024_05_08_europe_dice-snakes-fake-own-death-special-effects-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Awards season may be over for human actors this year, but there\u2019s no rest for some of nature\u2019s most audacious thespians. Dice snakes can fake their own death when being attacked by predators, putting on a theatrical display that includes smearing themselves with their own poop and letting blood ooze from their mouths.  And dice snakes that use these extra dramatic effects spend less time feigning their own deaths, and consequently less time in a dangerous situation, than their counterparts that don\u2019t use this strategy, a study published on Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters found. Many different animals fake their own death as a defense mechanism against predators, with examples seen among insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, but just how \u2013 and to what degree \u2013 it works is still unclear. \u201cThere are conflicting theories about the origin of death feigning,\u201d Vuka\u0161in Bjelica, a research associate at the University of Belgrade in Serbia and one of the study\u2019s authors, told CNN via email. \u201cSome say it is a conscious response while others are adamant it is not. One theory is that it is the \u2018most primitive\u2019 defense response, similar to freezing in a high stress situation,\u201d he said. Lying motionless and exposing vulnerable body parts to a predator is risky, and so researchers from the University of Belgrade hypothesized that the more dramatic the show, the less time snakes would have to spend in danger. To test this, the researchers traveled to Golem Grad, an island in a lake in North Macedonia, where the snakes are common. There, they grabbed hold of 263 of the nonvenomous dice snakes and pinched them with their fingers to simulate the actions of a predator, before releasing each snake and timing its subsequent behavior as it feigned death. They observed that some snakes played dead by leaving their mouth wide open, some  smeared themselves with poop and others oozed blood from their mouth, too. The 28 snakes that bled from the mouth spent two seconds less on average feigning their death, the study found, though some snakes that didn\u2019t unleash the full theatrics spent a shorter amount of time playing dead too, perhaps due to other factors like temperature, sex or size.  Overall, the snakes spent between about six and 24 seconds playing dead. Bleeding from the mouth was a relatively uncommon behavior and observed in only 28 of the snakes tested, while smearing occurred in 124 of the cases. Not all the snakes tested feigned their own death. Juvenile snakes captured faked death for a much shorter time period and bled from the mouth much less, and these behaviors were completely absent in newly hatched snakes from a similar species, the study said, perhaps because of the dangers associated with it. Antipredator behavior is dependent on many different things, like the sex of the individual, body temperature, size, age, presence of food in the gut, presence of eggs in females, previous experience with a predator and preexisting injuries, Bjelica said. \u201cIt is still not exactly clear how each individual \u2018tailors\u2019 their antipredator response and our observations are mainly limited as most of them come from interactions with human researchers and not observations of real life encounters with natural predators,\u201d he added. Smearing itself with poop makes the snake less appetizing for its predator, which researchers said explains why snakes that do this before playing dead then spend less time in this situation. While the snakes don\u2019t squirt blood directly at their predators, like horned lizards do, bleeding from the mouth signals their apparent death to the predator. Researchers believe the bleeding is caused by an increase in blood pressure, prompted by high levels of stress hormones, Bjelica said. The study\u2019s results now need to be replicated in other species and ecosystems, the researchers said, adding that future research should focus on the precise sequence of behaviors displayed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/europe/dice-snakes-fake-own-death-special-effects-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a statement to CNN, the airline said the scuffle began when a passenger was reportedly coughing and the man next to him tried to move into another seat to get away. However, the man\u2019s attempt to swap seats didn\u2019t work, as the seat he chose already belonged to another male passenger. Those two men then got into an argument over the seat, which the airline said turned physical. That\u2019s when three female flight attendants stepped in to handle the situation, says EVA. Flight BR08 was about three hours into its 12-hour journey from Taipei to San Francisco on Wednesday, May 8 when the incident took place. EVA, which is based in Taiwan, told CNN that the two brawling passengers were both foreigners but did not specify their countries of origin. Thanks to the quick actions of these flight attendants, with assistance from some concerned passengers, the airline said the two men were separated from each other and the rest of the flight continued as scheduled, successfully landing in San Francisco on time. \u201cThe company has always adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards incidents of passenger nuisance,\u201d EVA told CNN in the statement. \u201cThe company will provide appropriate rewards to [the three cabin crew members] later on.\u201d The plane\u2019s captain contacted San Francisco police mid-flight, and the two combative passengers were taken in for questioning on arrival, according to EVA. This isn\u2019t the first time that an in-air incident on EVA made headlines. In 2019, an obese male passenger reportedly forced female flight attendants to help him undress, use the bathroom and clean him afterward, saying he was physically unable to do so himself. Following the incident, EVA publicly expressed its \u201csincere gratitude\u201d to its employees and vowed to look into the incident further. That same year, EVA reversed its policy of only hiring women as flight attendants and said it would hire men as cabin crew members too.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/eva-air-flight-attendants-break-up-fight-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Cavaliers bounced back from a demoralizing Game 1 blowout to flip the script and steal home-court advantage away from Boston. All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell scored 29 points, grabbed seven rebounds and dished out eight assists to help Cleveland to its first win of the series. After a competitive first two quarters, the two sides entered the break locked at 54, before the fourth-seeded Cavs ran away with the game in the second half. Mitchell went off after the restart \u2013 scoring 23 of his 29 in the second half \u2013 as the Cavs offense began firing on all cylinders while the Celtics struggled to get anything going. \u201cI hadn\u2019t shot much, trying to find ways to get guys involved early and picking my spots. I was just continuing to find ways to apply pressure on them,\u201d said Mitchell after the game. \u201cIn the second half, it was scoring. Sometimes, it\u2019s assists. Sometimes, it\u2019s rebounds.Whatever it takes. And when it was time to go, it\u2019s time to go. I knew, at some point, I was going to have to start, obviously, shooting.\u201d When Mitchell banked in a triple in the fourth quarter to put Cleveland up by 15, he knew things were going his way. \u201cSometimes, you get lucky. Shooters shoot,\u201d he said. Six Cavaliers scored in double figures \u2013 including the entire starting line-up \u2013 and Cleveland shot almost 55% from the field as a team and over 46% from three. Evan Mobley \u2013 shifted over from power forward to center with Jarrett Allen still sidelined by injury \u2013 scored 21 points, with Caris LeVert matching him with 21 off the bench. It was a disappointing Game 2 for the Celtics, who are widely considered to be one of the favorites to win it all after cruising through the regular season with the NBA\u2019s best record. All-Star forward Jayson Tatum led his team in scoring with 25 points though Boston could not keep up with Cleveland\u2019s offensive output in the second half. The C\u2019s shot 36.1% from the field \u2013 and 11.1% from deep, making two of their 18 three-point attempts \u2013 after halftime. \u201cObviously, we didn\u2019t shoot the ball very well tonight, but defensively, it was an unacceptable performance, and I think that\u2019s where I\u2019m the most upset,\u201d said Celtics All-Star Jaylen Brown. \u201cDefensively, we gave up 118 points, and on top of that, we lost the rebound battle, so we didn\u2019t help ourselves tonight. \u201cYou take it on the chin, you learn from it, and you come out and put your best foot forward for the next game. We need to be ready to respond.\u201d \u201cYou treat it the same way you would a win,\u201d head coach Joe Mazzulla added, per the team. \u201cYou come in tomorrow, you watch film, and you get better for Game 3.\u201d The 17-time champions also suffered a Game 2 upset against the Miami Heat in the first round, though on that occasion, the defeat turned out to be no more than a momentary setback as Boston won the series in five games. Game 3 is in Ohio on Saturday night. Mavericks fight back to tie series against Thunder at 1-1 Slovenian superstar Luka Don\u010di\u0107 overcame a frustrating Game 1 as his Dallas Mavericks squad defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, 119-110. Don\u010di\u0107 \u2013 who finished third in MVP voting behind the Thunder\u2019s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and 2023-24 winner Nikola Joki\u0107 \u2013 had 29 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists, three steals and a block as the Mavericks picked up the victory. \u201cI think that was one of the hardest games I\u2019ve had to play,\u201d Don\u010di\u0107 said postgame.\u201cI\u2019m battling out there trying to do my best to help the team win. \u201cThey have great players. They have great chemistry, great team \u2013 and it\u2019s going to be tough. It\u2019s going to be a fight \u2018til the end, so just much respect to Oklahoma, but it\u2019s big time we won this game.\u201d PJ Washington added another 29 points and 11 rebounds for Dallas, while Gilgeous-Alexander led OKC with 33 points, 12 rebounds, eight assists and two blocks. This was the first defeat the top-seeded Thunder have tasted this postseason and Game 3 is on Saturday at American Airlines Center in Dallas.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/sport/cavaliers-celtics-game-2-nba-playoffs-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_03_europe_italy-bans-puppy-yoga-scli-intl", "text": "Italy\u2019s Ministry of Health has banned the popular wellness trend of \u201cpuppy yoga\u201d amid concerns that the puppies used in the practice could be exploited and mistreated. Typically, sessions involve puppies roaming around a yoga class and sometimes being incorporated in poses. Giovanni Leonardi, head of the One Health department of Italy\u2019s health ministry, ruled Tuesday that the use of dogs during exercise sessions falls under Italy\u2019s Animal Assisted Interventions act. This means that only adult dogs can now be used in yoga sessions to \u201cprotect the health and well-being of the animals, as well as the safety of users.\u201d The ruling comes following an investigation in March by the popular Italian news show \u201cStriscia la Notizia,\u201d which alleged that puppies were mistreated\u00a0at various yoga centers\u00a0and kept in pens between\u00a0sessions. Animal rights charity Lega Nazionale per la Difesa del Cane (National League for the Defense of Dogs) filed a complaint with the Italian health ministry after these allegations came to light, telling authorities in documents seen by CNN that the puppies were treated \u201cas if they were gymnastics tools.\u201d The puppies used in the sessions were transported in boxes or plastic bags, were used for long hours covering multiple sessions, and were not provided water or food to \u201cprevent the dogs from doing their business in the gym,\u201d LNDC alleged, noting that the Striscia la Notizia investigation found that many of the puppies were only 42 days old. \u201cGiven their age, it is highly likely that these puppies had not even completed their vaccination prophylaxis,\u201d the LNDC complaint suggested. CNN reached out to several Italian puppy yoga centers for comment with no success. The ruling does not have a legal arena for appeal, a spokesperson for Italy\u2019s health ministry said. \u201cIt is the same as any service animal. You would never expect to see a puppy as a sight dog,\u201d the spokesperson told CNN Friday. LNDC\u2019s President Piera Rosati called the practice \u201cexploitation for commercial purposes that takes no account of the well-being and psychophysical health of creatures who are still too fragile to be treated in this way.\u201d \u201cAt that age, puppies should not have to face travel and stress, but stay in a calm and protected environment under the guidance and care of their mother who can teach them to socialize correctly and to face the outside world with confidence,\u201d Rosati continued. Elisa Allen, vice president of programs and operations at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) UK, commended Italy for banning puppy yoga in a statement to CNN Friday. Allen called the practice \u201ca sales gimmick designed to promote the breeding of \u2018pedigree\u2019 dogs \u2013 who are prone to severe physical problems later in life \u2013 and which violates the fundamental principle of yoga: ahimsa, or doing no harm.\u201d \u201cWhile governments around the world should take heed, we must not wait to do the right thing: PETA urges yogis to stay away from this cheap ploy that uses sensitive animals as props to their detriment,\u201d Allen said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/europe/italy-bans-puppy-yoga-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_06_middleeast_palestinians-flee-rafah-gaza-fear-despair-intl-hnk", "text": "Palestinian civilians told to evacuate eastern Rafah by the Israeli military have described their fear and despair at being uprooted from their homes and shelters, as Israel airstrikes hit Gaza\u2019s southernmost city. There were hopes that the Rafah offensive would not go ahead after Hamas accepted a ceasefire proposal on Monday, but those were quickly dashed after Israel said the terms were \u201cfar from Israel\u2019s necessary requirements\u201d and it would continue \u201cin order to exert military pressure\u201d on the militant group. By Tuesday morning, Israeli airstrikes on Rafah had killed 23 people, including six children, according to hospital officials in southern Gaza. The Israeli military said it had \u201coperational control\u201d of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing, a vital entry point to transport desperately needed aid into the enclave from its southern border with Egypt. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said on Tuesday the military was undertaking \u201ca precise counterterrorism operation\u201d to \u201celiminate Hamas terrorists and dismantle Hamas terrorist infrastructure within specific areas in eastern Rafah.\u201d Hamas said the Israeli military\u2019s move on Rafah constituted a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d that posed \u201ca direct threat to more than 1.5 million displaced Palestinians.\u201d People fleeing the area have told of terrifying experiences while recounting their past 24 hours to CNN, after the Israeli military\u00a0ordered\u00a0an estimated 100,000 Palestinians to \u201cevacuate immediately\u201d on Monday. Residents were told to move to Al-Mawasi, a coastal town near the city of Khan Younis that aid groups say is not suitable for habitation. One man, Rabee Gharableh, told CNN that it was his family\u2019s seventh displacement. \u201cThe situation is very difficult\u2026 we left in fear, as civilian houses were being targeted, people we know. The shelling was arbitrary and random last night,\u201d he said. Another woman, who did not share her name, said she \u201cfled from death\u201d with her children. She said her family has been displaced over 10 times since the war broke out and had \u201cendured much suffering and humiliation.\u201d The current war began on October 7 when Hamas militants killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel and took more than 200 people hostage. In the almost seven months since, Israel\u2019s military bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 34,600 people, according to the Gaza health ministry, and\u00a0driven more than 1 million Palestinians to seek refuge in Rafah, a city that the medical NGO Medicines\u00a0San Frontieres said was absent of the \u201cnecessary conditions for survival.\u201d CNN witnessed people in eastern Rafah in a state of panic following Israel\u2019s evacuation announcement, which sparked a flurry of appeals from world leaders, the United Nations, and humanitarian groups urging\u00a0Israel\u00a0not to carry out its long-threatened assault. The\u00a0move was described as \u201cinhumane\u201d by United Nations human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk and \u201cbeyond alarming\u201d by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). Faisal Barbakh, who fled on his bicycle, said he is leaving a lifetime of memories behind \u201cfor the unknown.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m carrying all of my life here. My family is torn in seven places. I feel it\u2019s the end of life. I can\u2019t think anymore. I left 59 years of life behind, all of my memories, my children\u2019s pictures, the contract of my house.\u201d Video footage shows families arriving to the beach road of Deir el Balah, which is further north than the IDF-outlined humanitarian area, on overloaded trucks, donkey carts and cars. Their vehicles were piled with mattresses and personal belongings, as other people started setting up tents. Many of those leaving eastern Rafah have been previously displaced multiple times as Israel\u2019s focus has moved from city to city. \u201cThis is the fourth time I\u2019m being displaced. From Nuseirat to Khan Younis, then to Rafah, and now another one. I don\u2019t know where I am heading,\u201d one man told CNN. Israel takes \u2018operational control\u2019 of crossing After the Israeli military stormed the Rafah crossing, Palestinian flags were replaced with Israeli flags, which according to photos on social media, could be seen mounted outside the main building. IDF spokesperson Shoshani said intelligence indicated that the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing \u201cwas being used for terrorist purposes.\u201d The border crossing has been a key humanitarian aid portal, with as many as 300 trucks entering the strip through it each day, according to an announcement from Egypt last month. Wael Abu Omar, a spokesperson for the General Authority of Border and Crossing, told CNN that all movement and aid shipments through Rafah had stopped \u201cafter Israeli tanks captured the crossing facilities from the Palestinian side.\u201d Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Interior and National Security warned that Rafah\u2019s closure \u201cexacerbates the humanitarian crisis\u201d and \u201crepresents a policy of collective punishment against more than 2 million people.\u201d The ministry described the crossing as \u201ca main lifeline for citizens in the Gaza strip\u201d which \u201cdoes not represent any threat to the Israeli occupation.\u201d Aid groups quickly expressed concern that the Israeli operation there could bring humanitarian relief efforts across the Gaza Strip to a standstill. \u201cContinued interruption of the entry of aid and fuel supplies at the Rafah crossing will halt the critical humanitarian response across the Gaza Strip,\u201d the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said on X. It added that the \u201ccatastrophic hunger faced by people especially in northern Gaza will get much worse if these supply routes are interrupted.\u201d CNN has reached out to the IDF and COGAT on this and asked about any plans to keep aid getting into Gaza. In recent months, Israeli strikes have further deteriorated conditions for those living and sheltering in the city, including an estimated 600,000 children. Malnutrition is rapidly spreading and medical facilities are \u201crendered ineffective by the Israeli authorities\u2019 siege,\u201d Medicines\u00a0San Frontieres said. Two boys, Malek and Yousef, were making their own way of Rafah out on bicycles Monday, clinging to their bags. \u201cWe are running away from the Israelis. They warned us and ordered us to evacuate the eastern area. I have my clothes and food in the bag. We are going to our grandparents\u2019 house,\u201d one said. No \u2018safe zones\u2019 in Gaza, EU\u2019s top diplomat says There has been a chorus of condemnation over the situation facing many in Rafah and other places in the strip after Israel ignored international calls against proceeding with the operation. The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned Tuesday that there were \u201cno \u2018safe zones\u2019 in Gaza\u201d after criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He added that he was \u201cafraid\u201d the offensive would lead to many civilian casualties. Meanwhile, fuel shortages in Rafah have prevented people from fleeing and reaching the Israeli-designated \u201cexpanded humanitarian area\u201d in Al-Mawasi, Suze van Meegen, the NRC head of operations in Palestine told CNN by phone from Rafah on Tuesday. Several people in Rafah told CNN that they didn\u2019t know where to go. One man, Odeh Asaliyeh, said \u201cdeath is more dignified than this\u201d and that he \u201cprays to get hit and find rest from all of this.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know where to head to\u2026 there is no safe place in all of Gaza\u201d Asaliyeh added. Alaa Abu Ramadan said her family had been waiting for daylight to leave. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do. We are going into the unknown,\u201d Ramadan said. For those that are able to travel the many kilometers to Al-Mawasi, the coastal town near Khan Younis, they arrive to find it already crowded with displaced people, some of the new arrivals appearing confused and disorientated. The streets were packed with trucks and donkey carts, surrounded by huge piles of garbage. \u201cI came here from Rafah and didn\u2019t find any place to stay. People even say we should leave (here). I swear, I don\u2019t know where to go. They distributed leaflets, and people panicked and started running away,\u201d said Mohammad Abu Khamash. UNRWA previously warned that Al-Mawasi is not appropriate for habitation. \u201cIt\u2019s really not somewhere that\u2019s quite suitable for people to put up tents and to be able to sit and try to live and meet their basic necessities every day,\u201d Scott Anderson, director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza, told CNN Monday.

{"id": "travel_europes-best-long-distance-hiking-trails", "text": "The slow approach to travel has never been more important. From overtourism to taking multiple flights, rushing from A to B isn\u2019t just stressful, it can be environmentally damaging. Which is why, sometimes travel needs to be stripped back to basics \u2013 a pair of boots, a backpack and a map. These mind-loosening multi-day hikes on some of Europe\u2019s best long distance trails offer a chance to reconnect with the world, get some invigorating exercise and enjoy peaceful moments in some of the continent\u2019s most beautiful scenery. Hyssna Trail, Sweden West Sweden\u2019s quiet beauty is the star of the show on this 40-kilometer (25-mile), two-day hike. A circular route, it starts at Hyssna\u2019s 12th century church, which can be accessed by bus from Gothenburg in just 40 minutes. The trail passes through towering beech forests and offers the opportunity for a refreshing dip in Lilla H\u00e5lsj\u00f6n lake, where there\u2019s a dedicated swimming spot. The route is well signposted, with plenty of picnic spots and a well appointed camp site. For those in need of something a tad more luxurious, there\u2019s the\u00a0Hyssna Forest Resort, where five star cabins feature their own outdoor showers, vast picture windows and king size beds. Karhunkierros Trail, Finland Finnish Lapland is renowned as a winter destination, with magical displays of\u00a0aurora borealis\u00a0and a fascinating ancient\u00a0Sami\u00a0culture. It\u2019s also home to the 82-kilometer (51-mile) Karhunkierros Trail, the most well-known long-distance walk in Finland. It\u2019s a route best explored in summer, when the nights are bright and the forests verdant. The path begins in Hautaja\u0308rvi village in Lapland\u2019s Salla and ends at the Rukatunturi Fell in Kuusamo, taking four days, depending on the weather, which can change rapidly. Passing through\u00a0Oulanka National Park, there\u2019s a sense of being in a true wilderness, where trout leap from rivers and lynx and wolverines prowl through the pines. King Charles III England Coastal Path, England Covering a colossal 4,300 kilometers (2,672 miles), the\u00a0England Coast Path, named after the country\u2019s king since 2022, is a lifetime\u2019s undertaking for those who wish to cover every step. The good news is that it can be easily broken down into sections, with northwest, northeast, east, southeast and southwest regions to explore. Whether taking in the rugged, high cliffs and gorgeous bays of Cornwall or the vast skies and deep silence of Suffolk and Norfolk, just a few days on this epic route will leave anyone rejuvenated. Slovenian Mountain Trail, Slovenia It\u2019s no surprise that the\u00a0Slovenia Mountain Trail\u00a0has become so popular. This stunning route, covering some 616 kilometers (362 miles) runs from Maribor in the country\u2019s northeast, all the way to Ankaran, on the Adriatic Coast. And while doing it all in one go over 28 days might seem extreme, it can be broken into smaller sections. There are routes through the forests and primeval bogs of the Pohorje Hills or across the Julian Alps, much of which form part of the beautiful Triglav National Park. There are 49 different mountain huts to choose from and those opting to complete the entire trek will scale some 23 mountains in the process. John Muir Way, Scotland Known as the \u201cFather of the National Parks\u201d in the US, Muir\u2019s passion for the outdoors led him to set up the Sierra Club, arguably America\u2019s most important environmental organization, as well as ensuring that the Yosemite Valley gained protected status. It isn\u2019t just in the United States where Muir is memorialized. In his native Scotland, the\u00a0John Muir Way\u00a0stretches coast to coast, from Helensburgh on the Firth of Clyde to Dunbar, Muir\u2019s birthplace on the Firth of Forth. The 215-kilometer (134-mile) route takes around 10 days to complete, passing through Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park and through some of Scotland\u2019s most bucolic and underappreciated countryside. Vikos Gorge and Mount Gamila, Zagoria, Greece The remote and beautiful mountains of Zagoria are arguably Greece\u2019s best-kept secret. Tucked away in the northwest of the country, they offer spectacular hiking without the crowds. The highlight is undoubtedly the Vikos Gorge, which according to the Guinness Book of Records is the deepest gorge relative to its width in the world. In places, its cliffs tower 1,350 meters (4,429 feet). Wander its dry riverbed in summer and keep an eye out for rare wild chamois hopping across the cliff faces.\u00a0Trekking Hellas\u00a0offers a three-day trek including the gorge and the chance to head to a mountain refuge on nearby Mount Gamila. Apuseni Mountains, Romania The untamed Apuseni Mountains in western Romania, part of the wider Carpathian Range, offer an insight into a part of Europe where time still moves slowly and the way of life is steeped in tradition. Hiking through the majestic hills and seemingly endless forests, you can see peregrine falcons circling on thermals high above, while the footprints of wolves and European brown bears point to the presence of some of the continent\u2019s most elusive creatures.\u00a0Much Better Adventures\u00a0runs a four day snowshoeing trek through the region in winter, where guests stay with Romanian families and receive a proper local welcome. The Camino Frances, France and Spain The Camino de Santiago is Europe\u2019s most famous pilgrimage route, finishing in Santiago de Compostela in the Galicia region of northwest Spain. It is here where the remains of the apostle St James are said to be buried. Traditionally, pilgrims headed here from their homes from all across Europe, but now hikers have multiple ways to walk \u201cthe Camino,\u201d whether across Spain, from Portugal or France. The\u00a0Camino Frances\u00a0is the most popular route, starting in St. Jean in France before heading through Pamplona and Leon before arriving in Santiago. The full route can take seven weeks, or the final 100 kilometers, from Sarria, can be tackled in about six or seven days. Alta Via Uno, Dolomites, Italy Italy\u2019s Dolomites are one of the most rugged and awe-inspiring ranges on the continent. Those up for the challenge can hike from Dobbiaco in the north to Belluno in the south, a 120-kilometer (75-mile) jaunt that takes nine days. The route clambers over rocky outcrops as jagged snow covered peaks rear up all around. The region\u2019s hospitable mountain huts offer overnight places to rest and recuperate ahead of another tough day in the hills. It\u2019s worth taking time to explore around Passo Falzarego, where battles were fought during World War I. Some sections have cables to help walkers cross tough terrain. Trekkers will need to be in good shape, but it\u2019s an unforgettable experience. Engadine Panorama Trail, Switzerland Summers in Switzerland are the stuff of dreams for those who love to strap on their boots and set off on an adventure. With warm temperatures, wildflower meadows and looming Alps, it\u2019s a place for a proper escape from the day-to-day. While many routes head high into the mountains, the Engadine Panorama Trail is more sedate, ideal for beginners or those keen on something less strenuous. The 55-kilometer (34-miles) route in the southeast of the country starts in Zernez and takes in traditional villages and sparkling lakes, with spectacular Alpine views at every turn. Ibex can often be spotted climbing high above the paths, which are well signposted. Tour du Mont Blanc, France, Italy and Switzerland Few multi-day hikes in Europe fire the imagination like the Tour du Mont Blanc. This 11 day epic covers 170 kilometers (105 miles) over 11 days and takes in three countries - France, Italy and Switzerland - following a route around western Europe\u2019s highest mountain. The good news is that things are extremely well organized, with regular water fountains and refuges every few miles. However, don\u2019t show up thinking you can just bunk down for the night after a long day\u2019s walking: Huts and refuges require booking in advance during the busy summer months. Hiking anticlockwise from the village of Les Houches offers relentless views of Mont Blanc.\u00a0Tour du Mont Blanc Hike\u00a0offers bespoke guidance on getting the most from the trip. Rota Vicentina Fishermen\u2019s Trail, Portugal A network of single-day and multi-day paths in the Alentejo and Algarve regions in southern Portugal, the Rota Vicentina can be easily overlooked for the mountainous thrills of central Europe. But the Fisherman\u2019s Trail, a 225-kilometer (140-mile) path which cleaves to the Atlantic coastline, offers a wild and memorable alternative. Following routes used by fishermen to access the ocean, this trail makes its way along sandy paths and over high cliff tops, with walkers having to contend with the wind and changing weather. The reward comes in the form of azure waters and huge views, not to mention the sense of being reinvigorated by all that sea air. Laugavegur Hiking Trail, Iceland Inaccessible during winter, Iceland\u2019s ethereal Laugavegur Hiking Trail opens between July and September, drawing in committed hikers from across the globe. The reason? Its landscape is unlike anything else on Earth. Shaped by glaciers and the country\u2019s relentless volcanic activity, this is a place where it\u2019s impossible not to feel utterly infinitesimal. The 55-kilometer (34-mile) route is best done over four days, giving time to tackle the challenging terrain and take in the views. Highlights include bathing in the geothermal springs at Landmannalaugar, marveling at the colorful slopes of Brennisteinsalda and walking over the lush valley of Hvanngil. Six dedicated huts and adjacent campsites are available, but booking ahead or signing up for a guided adventure as advised as the path can get busy.\u00a0Much Better Adventures\u00a0has a range of options. Sheep\u2019s Head Way, Cork, Ireland Ireland doesn\u2019t lack when it comes to lush, windswept vistas. And few can match the\u00a0Sheep\u2019s Head Way, a 93-kilometer (57-mile route) in Cork, which takes in some of the county\u2019s, and the country\u2019s, most dramatic coastline. Starting in the town of Bantry, it heads out to the Sheep\u2019s Head peninsula and its titular lighthouse, with views\u00a0 across the raging, bright blue Atlantic to the Beara and Mizen peninsulas. The route itself takes six days, but there are options to cut it short or opt for less taxing day hikes if the weather gets a little wild. Which, in this magical part of the world, it often does.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/europes-best-long-distance-hiking-trails/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

Before you head to the shelter, take heed \u2013 not all cat breeds are in it for the long haul. While domestic cats regularly live to 18 years old, the hairless Sphynx breed has an average life expectancy of just 6.8 years, the lowest of any domestic breed of cat, according to new research. This could be due to \u201cseveral breed-predisposed diseases,\u201d researchers from the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) in the United Kingdom and the National Chung Hsing University (NCHU) in Taiwan wrote in a study published Wednesday in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery. Sphynx cats are a hairless breed that originated in Ontario, Canada, where a hairless male kitten named Prune was born in 1966, according to the Sphynx Cat Association. Their hairlessness, which is caused by a recessive gene, means they are better for those with a sensitivity to cat hair. However, they are not completely hypoallergenic because they still produce skin cells. In contrast, Burmese and Birman breeds were found to have the longest life expectancy, at 14.4 years, followed by crossbreed cats at 11.9 years and Siamese on 11.7 years. The team studied the clinical data of 7,936 cats that were registered with vets in the UK and died between January 1, 2019 and March 31, 2021. The team produced the first ever \u201clife tables\u201d for different breeds, which \u201cpredict the remaining life expectancy and probability of death across a range of age groups in any given population,\u201d according to the statement. Life tables have been widely used in human public health for years and have recently started to be used for dog and cat populations, according to the study. \u201cUnderstanding typical remaining lifespan can also support owners and veterinarians when making complex decisions about the best treatment option to protect a cat\u2019s overall wellbeing,\u201d the researchers added. They found that the average life expectancy for cats in the UK was 11.7 years, and female cats could expect to live 1.33 years longer than males. Researchers also found that purebred cats were likely to have shorter lives, as were those that were either too light or too heavy. Lead study author Kendy Teng, assistant professor of Animal Welfare Epidemiology at NCHU,\u00a0said these life tables are \u201ca significant milestone in understanding the life of cats.\u201d \u201cKnowing the expected lifespan of their cats, we\u2019re not just raising awareness, we\u2019re helping the owners to make \u2018pawsitive\u2019 decisions for their cats,\u201d she said in the statement.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/world/cat-life-expectancy-study-scli-intl-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

That\u2019s because five Boeing 747 passenger jets once operated by the South Korean flag carrier Korean Air have been purchased by the Sierra Nevada Corporation, the contractor for the replacements for the US Air Force\u2019s current fleet of strategic command and control military aircraft, more commonly known as \u201cDoomsday\u201d planes. Also known as the E-4B \u201cNightwatch,\u201d the Doomsday planes are designed to be command-and-control centers for the US military in the event of a national emergency that sees command facilities on the ground destroyed or incapacitated, such as nuclear war. They could become what amounts to a Pentagon in the sky, taking aboard the US president, secretary of defense and members of the Joint Chiefs among more than 100 other people with the ability to control US forces worldwide from the aircraft, according to an Air Force fact sheet on the E-4Bs. The Doomsday planes are built to withstand the effects of an electromagnetic pulse, the burst of energy released by a nuclear explosion that can \u201cdisrupt and permanently damage electrical components and entire systems within most critical infrastructure sectors and impact large-scale infrastructure,\u201d according to the US Department of Homeland Security. At least one Doomsday plane is on alert 24/7 at a US military base somewhere in the world, the Air Force says. On Friday, a spokesperson for the Colorado-based Sierra Nevada\u00a0confirmed the purchase of the Korean Air jets but would not give any further details. However, on April 26 the Air Force awarded Sierra Nevada a $13 billion contract to develop and produce the Survivable Airborne Operations Center, the official name of the new Doomsday plane. Work on the project is to be completed by 2036, according to a Defense Department release. On Friday, an Air Force spokeswoman confirmed the contract had been awarded in April. \u201cThe development of this critical national security weapon system ensures the Department\u2019s Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications capability is operationally relevant and secure for decades to come. To satisfy operational requirements, the weapon system will be comprised of a Commercial Derivative Aircraft that will be hardened and modified to meet military requirements,\u201d Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek told CNN. Last year, Sierra Nevada opened a 100,000-square-foot aircraft repair, maintenance and overhaul facility at Dayton International Airport in Ohio, and construction on a second hangar of similar size has begun. An artist\u2019s rendering of the Dayton facility showed a 747-800 inside. The 747-800s would be an upgrade on the older and smaller 747-200 airframes of the current Doomsday fleet, which entered Air Force service in the 1980s. Earlier this week, Korean Air announced the $675 million sale of five of its aircraft to Sierra Nevada. The decision to sell the jets was part of a \u201cmid- to long-term introduction plan for new aircraft,\u201d the airline said in a statement, adding it expects the deal to be completed by September 30, 2025. Korean Air had nine 747-800 passenger jets in its fleet as of October 2023, according to its website.

The atmosphere inside Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis belied the less important nature of a preseason game, the crowd whooping loudly as Clark made her first home bucket on a driving layup in the first half. Clark finished with 12 points, eight rebounds and six assists but had a difficult shooting night, going 4-of-12 from the field and 2-of-9 from deep. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was that effective, honestly,\u201d Clark told reporters after the game. \u201cI thought more than anything I did a really good job of passing the ball, finding my teammates. \u201cI think I got into the paint, obviously, I would have liked to make a couple more threes, but sometimes, that\u2019s how you shoot it. \u201cWe really responded after we kind of had a slow start. Obviously, we don\u2019t want to have slow starts, but it\u2019s good to see us be able to respond and take the lead back and grind it out until the end.\u201d NaLyssa Smith led the way for the Fever, scoring 21 points and grabbing six rebounds, as Indiana came back from a 15-point, second-quarter deficit to take the lead with 4:57 left in the third and never looked back.

{"id": "2024_04_27_style_rr-head-labs-denver-barbers-prison", "text": "\u201dThis is nerve-wracking,\u201d James Canody exclaimed \u2014 through an exhale \u2014 of his new job as an apprentice at the Denver-based business R&R Head Labs. When speaking with CNN, Canody had been working as an apprentice at the barbershop for 13 days. Fourteen days ago he had been released from prison, where he served 6 and a half years of an 18-year sentence. Canody is one of 650,000 people released from prison every year across the United States, according to the Department of Justice. That\u2019s a population of which nearly 75% are still unemployed a year after being released. According to the Brookings Institution, stable employment has been shown to reduce recidivism, but even for those who find a job, earning capacity is likely hindered: Based on a report released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, formerly incarcerated people who do find employment after their release tend to earn just 53% of the median US worker\u2019s wage. Canody is one of eight employees \u2014 apprentices, barbers and managers \u2014 at R&R Head Labs, a barbershop which opened its doors in February exclusively employing formerly incarcerated and justice-impacted individuals. It aims to address the financial, logistical and emotional inequities associated with their reentry into society. Fresh starts and fresh cuts R&R Head Labs\u2019 model creates a pathway to employment by utilizing skills \u2014 and sometimes a barbering license \u2014 its employees gained while in prison. (Prison programs offering barber/cosmetology licenses are not federally mandated, rather determined state-by-state based on a variety of factors.) Barbering skills aren\u2019t a requirement to work at R&R Head Labs, however, as its paid apprentice program shepherds employees through training, the 2,000 hours of working as an apprentice and 300 hours of classroom or in-shop time required to get a barber license in Colorado. \u201cThis opportunity feels surreal and overwhelming,\u201d said Canody. \u201cBut that\u2019s a good thing. I am getting comfortable with being uncomfortable and see how barbering can help me change my life.\u201d R&R Head Labs is the brainchild of James Repenning,\u00a0a former president of the national barber chain Floyd\u2019s 99. After learning about prison barbering programs, he saw potential in combining his professional experience with a greater purpose. Together with an advisory council \u2014 a group which includes formerly incarcerated people turned advocates \u2014 Repenning has also implemented mentorship programs and community outreach in Denver. \u201cWe started by asking ourselves how we find barbers who have really committed to change and then asking, what do they need?\u201d Repenning explained in a Zoom interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s about understanding how we support them in the work environment, because the pinnacle of what we want to do is give them hope and a path.\u201d Repenning and his team work with Colorado prisons to recruit individuals and get them into the apprenticeship program. According to Repenning, the support from the Colorado Department of Corrections has exceeded expectations, with parole officers facilitating barber tool starter sets and arranging job fairs. \u201cIt\u2019s important (for formerly incarcerated people) to make money \u2014 both because parole requires it and for basic survival,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe solution was to create apprenticeships, so someone can start working immediately and toward the hours they need to earn their barber license.\u201d Transformational opportunities In Denver specifically, R&R Head Labs recruitment and reentry efforts are steered by Charles Smith, a member of the company\u2019s advisory council. Smith served 24 years in prison; after his release, he became the director of advocacy and earned income strategies for CommunityWorks, a non-profit organization which provides job seekers with support service and job readiness instruction. Speaking about the main challenges formerly incarcerated individuals face, Smith lists housing and employment as the most crucial. \u201cEmployment is going to sustain you,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe idle mind is the devil\u2019s workshop. You start doing things, you start drifting. Employment keeps you stable and focused.\u201d \u201cThe model would be to have someone like Charles in every state we go to,\u201d added Repenning. \u201cMany of the people we talk to are people he served with, so there\u2019s a great deal of trust there.\u201d Smith aims to connect with inmates around 90 days before their release date, to start mentoring and prepping them to make their acclimation to life outside of prison easier and more tolerable. Understanding the \u201cpolitics of what happens in prison\u201d is something Smith considers a crucial aspect of his work, and one he believes offers an advantage in approaching and vetting prospective barbers. Several of the seven full-time and part-time barbers currently working at the first location are people Smith knew while serving his own sentence \u2014 including James Canody. \u201cPeople in prison are a forgotten population,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIt is a huge help to people coming out of prison to see and feel that someone finally believes in you. It makes you want to be better.\u201d In\u00a0keeping with its overarching ethos, even R&R\u2019s physical space was designed to best accommodate formerly incarcerated people. With guidance from the\u00a0advisory board, the space was specifically designed to minimize triggers for its employees,\u00a0down to its color palette and barber chair positioning. \u201cEverything by design has to do with connectedness,\u201d explained Repenning. \u201cA lot of barber shops are stainless steel\u2026 ours needs to be super welcoming and warm.\u201d Repenning and his team learned which colors and palettes to stay away from: Certain shades of orange, red, green and blue (which could serve as a reminder of jumpsuit colors) were out; brighter colors, embodying outdoor themes of woodlands and greenery were chosen instead to soften the environment and make it feel uplifting, energetic and approachable. Barber chairs are positioned so that no barber\u2019s back is to the door, another potential vulnerability for an employee who had previously served prison time. \u201cPrison can be a very dangerous place,\u201d said Repenning. \u201c\u2018Watching your back\u2019 takes on extra significance, thus our barbers tend to want to know who\u2019s behind them and who\u2019s walking into the space.\u201d A round bar where people are invited to sit and wait for their appointment was designed specifically to facilitate conversation and community. A barber\u2019s compensation includes floor earnings and commission comparable to other barbershops \u2014 but less commonly, barbers at R&R Head Labs are able to set (and raise) their own prices. Employees also receive health insurance and vacation pay. R&R Head Labs is looking to open an additional shop in Denver later this year, with future expansion into the Boston, Chicago, and New York markets planned.  In its first months of business, the R&R Head Labs location has attracted a diverse crowd, Repenning told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing every race, hair type, gender, income level and age. It\u2019s been a predictably slow start because our barbers typically don\u2019t come with a \u2018book\u2019 (of pre existing clients) as they would if they were transferring from another barbershop.\u00a0However, we are attracting 10+ new customers per day.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like bringing the \u2018hood and Beverly Hills together,\u201d added Smith. \u201cAnd creating this amazing beautiful space.

{"id": "2024_05_09_world_beethoven-lead-poisoning-scn", "text": "High levels of lead detected in authenticated locks of Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s hair suggest that the composer had lead poisoning, which may have contributed to ailments he endured over the course of his life, including deafness, according to new research. In addition to hearing loss, the famed classical composer had recurring gastrointestinal complaints throughout his life, experienced two attacks of jaundice and faced severe liver disease. It is believed that Beethoven died from liver and kidney disease at age 56. But the process of understanding what caused his many health problems has been a much more complicated puzzle, one that even Beethoven himself hoped doctors could eventually solve. The composer expressed his wish that his ailments be studied and shared so \u201cas far as possible at least the world will be reconciled to me after my death.\u201d An international team of researchers set out nearly a decade ago to partially fulfill Beethoven\u2019s wish by studying locks of his hair. Using DNA analysis, the team determined which ones truly belonged to the composer and which were fraudulent, and sequenced Beethoven\u2019s genome by analyzing his authenticated locks. The findings, published in a March 2023 report, revealed that Beethoven had significant genetic risk factors for liver disease and a hepatitis B infection before his death. But the results didn\u2019t provide any insights into the underlying causes of his deafness, which began in his 20s, or his gastrointestinal issues. Beethoven\u2019s genome was made publicly available, inviting researchers around the world to investigate lingering questions about Beethoven\u2019s health. Meanwhile, scientists continue to figuratively go over the authenticated locks of Beethoven\u2019s hair with a fine-tooth comb, teasing out surprising insights. In addition to high concentrations of lead, the latest findings showed arsenic and mercury that remain trapped in the composer\u2019s strands nearly 200 years after his death, according to a new letter published Monday in the journal Clinical Chemistry. And the insights could provide new windows not only into understanding Beethoven\u2019s chronic health ailments, but the complicated nuances of his life as a composer. A tangled web reveals lead Christian Reiter, now the retired deputy director of the Center of Forensic Medicine at the Medical University of Vienna, had previously studied the Hiller Lock, a sample of hair long attributed to Beethoven. He authored and published a 2007 paper after determining there were high levels of lead in the hair, and suggested the lead may have contributed to the composer\u2019s deafness, and potentially his death. In a twist, the 2023 genomic sequencing study uncovered that the Hiller Lock did not belong to Beethoven, and it was actually a hair sample from a woman. But at the time the researchers did not test Beethoven\u2019s newly authenticated hair samples for lead. So the question remained: Did Beethoven have lead poisoning? A separate research team used two different methods to search for evidence of lead in two authenticated locks of Beethoven\u2019s hair: the Bermann lock, estimated to have been cut between late 1820 and March 1827, and the Halm-Thayer lock, which Beethoven hand-delivered to pianist Anton Halm in April 1826. It was very common during Beethoven\u2019s lifetime for people to collect and keep locks of hair from loved ones or famous people, said William Meredith, Beethoven scholar and study coauthor of the 2023 genomic analysis and the latest study. The newer research detected incredibly high levels of lead in both samples: 64 times the expected level in the Bermann Lock, and 95 times the expected level in the Halm-Thayer lock. \u201cThese levels are considered as lead poisoning,\u201d said lead study author Nader Rifai, professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School and director of clinical chemistry at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cIf you walk into any emergency room in the United States with these levels, you will be admitted immediately and you will undergo chellation therapy.\u201d Diagnosing Beethoven Elevated lead levels such as those detected in Beethoven\u2019s hair \u201care commonly associated with gastrointestinal and renal ailments and decreased hearing but are not considered high enough to be the sole cause of death,\u201d the study authors wrote. Because the researchers don\u2019t have hair samples from earlier in Beethoven\u2019s life, it\u2019s impossible to understand when the lead poisoning started, Meredith said. The study authors do not believe the lead poisoning was solely responsible for Beethoven\u2019s death or deafness. But he experienced symptoms of lead poisoning throughout his life, including hearing loss, muscle cramps and renal abnormalities, Rifai said. Both locks also contained increased levels of arsenic and mercury, about 13 to 14 times the expected amount, according to the study. Study coauthor Paul Jannetto, associate professor in the department of laboratory medicine and pathology and laboratory director at the Mayo Clinic, carried out the analysis of the samples and said he\u2019d never seen such high lead levels. But Rifai said he saw comparable lead levels when he conducted research in two villages in Ecuador where the main trade is to glaze tiles with lead from batteries. The villagers experienced mental delays, hearing loss and hematological abnormalities, which are common in liver disease, he said. Lead exposure in Beethoven\u2019s lifetime Currently, there is no understanding of the average amount of lead in the bodies of people like Beethoven who were living in Vienna during the 19th century, Rifai said. He said he hopes to access old locks of hair people have from their families to determine the baseline level of the population at the time since there is no documentation. But how did Beethoven end up with so much lead, as well as arsenic and mercury, in his body? The substances likely accumulated over decades of the composer\u2019s life through food and drink, Rifai said. Beethoven was known to favor wine, sometimes drinking a bottle a day, and he drank plumbed wine. A common practice dating back at least 2,000 years, the creation of plumbed wine involves adding lead acetate as a sweetener and preservative, Rifai said. At the time, lead was also used in glassmaking to give glassware a more clear and appealing appearance. Beethoven also loved to eat fish, and at the time, the Danube River was a great source of industry, meaning waste ended up in the same river that was a source of fish caught for consumption \u2014 and that fish likely contained arsenic and mercury, Rifai said. The report marks the first time lead levels have been established for Beethoven and points to another possible cause for Beethoven\u2019s kidney failure in the months before his death and the liver failure he experienced at the end of his life, Meredith said. Lead poisoning appears to be the fourth factor that contributed to his liver failure, apart from genes that predisposed Beethoven toward liver disease, his hepatitis B infection and his penchant for drinking alcohol, Meredith said. Linking Beethoven\u2019s health and music The composer wrote a letter to his brothers in 1802 asking that his doctor, Johann Adam Schmidt, determine and share the nature of his \u201cillness\u201d once Beethoven died. The letter is known as the Heiligenstadt Testament. But the documents kept by Beethoven\u2019s favorite doctor, who died 18 years before his patient, have been lost. In the 1802 letter to his brothers, Beethoven admitted how hopeless he felt as a music composer struggling with hearing loss, but his work kept him from taking his own life. He said he didn\u2019t want to leave \u201cbefore I had produced all the works that I felt the urge to compose.\u201d \u201cPeople say, \u2018the music is the music, why do we need to know about any of this stuff?\u2019 But in Beethoven\u2019s life, there is a connection between his suffering and the music,\u201d Meredith said. May 7 marked the 200th anniversary of the first performance of Beethoven\u2019s famed Ninth Symphony, largely regarded as his greatest work and his final symphony. Completely deaf at the time, Beethoven was onstage as one of the conductors, but the orchestra was instructed to follow the conducting of Beethoven\u2019s friend, who was also onstage. The concert marked one of the most triumphant moments in Beethoven\u2019s life, and the female singers turned him to face the crowd as they clapped and waved their handkerchiefs at the beloved musician, Meredith said. But at the end of the night, Beethoven gathered with three of his friends who helped him organize the concert. What first seemed like a dinner to reward his friends actually resulted in Beethoven yelling and accusing them of cheating him out of money. The outburst was ironic, considering that Beethoven had been inspired as he worked on the Ninth Symphony in part by Friedrich Schiller\u2019s poem \u201cOde to Joy,\u201d and the concluding themes of the symphony include living in peace and harmony with one another, Meredith said. But above one sketch Beethoven did for the Ninth Symphony, he included the French word for despair. \u201cWhen you look back at his life, it\u2019s a life that is so full of despair. He went deaf. He never found a woman that he could settle down to love. He had terrible abdominal problems ever since he was a child. He really had a hard time sustaining relationships with people,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cIf you understand how much pain he was in and the paranoia he experienced from the deafness, it makes that whole story of the Ninth Symphony much more complex.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/world/beethoven-lead-poisoning-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

President Joe Biden will appear at the site in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, on Wednesday to highlight the administration\u2019s efforts to invest in job growth in America. The news comes six years after the Trump administration announced a $10 billion investment by tech manufacturer Foxconn \u2013 with the promise to bring 13,000 jobs to the area \u2013 on the same Wisconsin land, a plan that never materialized. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. Microsoft said it will use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state on generative AI by\u00a02030, thanks in part to a partnership with United Way Wisconsin, United Way Racine and other community partners. It also plans to open a lab on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to help companies and manufacturers infuse the technology into their businesses. Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella earned a master\u2019s degree in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, according to his company profile. In his remarks Wednesday, Biden plans to directly point his finger at Trump for the failed project, according to a White House official. In a statement sent to CNN, Foxconn parent company Hon Hai Technology Group said it \u201ccontinues to grow\u201d in Wisconsin and \u201csupports expansion of technology and innovation to the state.\u201d Foxconn, which said it has invested about $1 billion into the state, still has a major manufacturing site for data servers in Racine County with more than 1,000 employees. It has facilities in 205 locations across 24 countries. \u201cEmployment at Foxconn Wisconsin has grown at least 42% in the three years since 2020,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe have been Racine County\u2019s largest taxpayer in recent years.\u201d The president\u2019s visit to the key battleground state will also present an opportunity for the White House to try to highlight some of the Biden administration\u2019s key first term achievements \u2014 and specifically, funding from legislation like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the so called \u201cChips Act,\u201d which invests in semiconductor chip manufacturing in the United States, that will boost the Badger State. In a fact sheet released by the White House ahead of the president\u2019s visit, the administration says that 177,000 jobs have been added in Wisconsin \u2013 4,000 specifically in Racine \u2013 since the president took office in 2021. Last year, Biden signed an executive order on AI aimed to get entrepreneurs access to technical assistance and resources, help small businesses commercialize AI breakthroughs, and expand grants for AI research in areas such as healthcare and climate change. The White House also introduced an order in 2023 to require AI system developers to share results of their safety tests with the federal government before they are released to the public. Microsoft\u2019s move comes at a time when the government seeks to monitor and regulate the risks of artificial intelligence. In March, Biden urged Congress during his State of the Union address to pass legislation to regulate artificial intelligence, including banning \u201cAI voice impersonation and more.\u201d He said lawmakers need to \u201charness the promise of AI and protect us from its peril,\u201d warning of the technology\u2019s risks to Americans if left unchecked.

{"id": "2024_05_07_tech_tiktok-sues-us-app-ban", "text": "TikTok sued Tuesday to block a US law that could force a nationwide ban of the popular app, following through on legal threats the company issued after President Joe Biden signed the legislation last month. The court challenge sets up a historic legal battle, one that will determine whether US security concerns about TikTok\u2019s links to China can trump the First Amendment rights of TikTok\u2019s 170 million US users. The stakes of the case are existential for TikTok. If it loses, TikTok could be banned from US app stores unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells the app to a non-Chinese entity by mid-January 2025. In its\u00a0petition filed Tuesday at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, TikTok and Bytedance allege the law is unconstitutional because it stifles Americans\u2019 speech and prevents them from accessing lawful information. The petition claims the US government \u201chas taken the unprecedented step of expressly singling out and banning\u201d the short-form video app in an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power. \u201cFor the first time in history,\u201d the petition said, \u201cCongress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than 1 billion people worldwide.\u201d The White House referred questions about TikTok\u2019s legal challenge to the Justice Department, which didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit follows years of US allegations that TikTok\u2019s ties to China could potentially expose Americans\u2019 personal information to the Chinese government. Debate over data sharing TikTok has strongly denied that it has ever given Chinese government officials access to US user data and says it has taken steps to protect that information by hosting the data on servers owned by US tech giant Oracle. Those moves are part of a 90-page draft agreement before a government panel known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multiagency body that has been reviewing TikTok\u2019s US operations since 2019, the petition said. That same draft deal also includes the ability for the US government to shut down TikTok if it or ByteDance \u201cviolate certain obligations under the agreement,\u201d the petition said. But those assurances have not eased US officials\u2019 concerns, which include fears that China could use TikTok\u2019s data to identify intelligence targets, spread propaganda or engage in other forms of covert influence. The US government has not publicly presented any concrete evidence showing Chinese government access of TikTok data to date; US lawmakers have received classified briefings by national security officials behind closed doors, but they have not declassified any materials from those meetings. Reactions to the briefings have been mixed, with one House Republican saying there was \u201cno specific information \u2026 that was well-founded evidence\u201d and one House Democrat saying the issue comes down to a judgment call about curbing \u201cmalign influence\u201d from China. But Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, an advocate for the TikTok legislation, said in remarks on the Senate floor in April that the briefings provided critical insight into the risk TikTok poses. \u201cMany Americans, particularly young Americans, are rightfully skeptical\u201d of the legislation clamping down on TikTok, Warner said in his remarks. \u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019ve not seen what Congress has seen. They\u2019ve not been in the classified briefings that Congress has held, which have delved into more deeply some of the threat posed by the foreign control of TikTok.\u201d In March, those fears culminated in legislation giving TikTok roughly six months to sell or face a US ban. Passed by the House, it stalled in the Senate before an updated version of the bill was fast-tracked and attached to a major foreign aid package benefiting Israel and Ukraine. US policymakers have described the law at issue as a forced divestiture of TikTok, not an outright app ban. TikTok has insisted, however, that a ban would be the only probable outcome if the law is upheld. \u201cThe \u2018qualified divestiture\u2019 demanded by the Act to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States is simply not possible,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s petition said, \u201cnot commercially, not technologically, not legally.\u201d First Amendment implications TikTok and ByteDance called the national security fears at the heart of the TikTok legislation \u201cspeculative and analytically flawed,\u201d adding in the petition that the bill\u2019s swift passage reflects how its congressional authors relied on \u201cspeculation, not \u2018evidence,\u2019 as the First Amendment requires,\u201d to make their case. First Amendment scholars say TikTok\u2019s claims have some merit. The Supreme Court has held, for instance, that the US government cannot prohibit Americans from receiving foreign propaganda if they so choose. Underscoring the point, legislation known as the Berman amendment also forbids US presidents from blocking the free flow of media from foreign countries, even those considered hostile to the United States. \u201cNational security claims should not trump the First Amendment,\u201d said Evelyn Douek, an assistant law professor at Stanford University who studies online platform regulations. \u201cOtherwise, it would make the Constitution a paper tiger. At the very least, the government should be forced to provide evidence for its claims. That said, there is precedent of the [Supreme] Court neglecting these principles, especially in the context of counterterrorism and foreign speech.\u201d TikTok notched some early court victories last year as several US states tried to clamp down on the app, foreshadowing the battle to come over online speech. In Montana, the only state to have passed its own TikTok ban affecting personal devices, a federal judge temporarily blocked the legislation \u2014 saying the state law unconstitutionally \u201charmed [users\u2019] First Amendment rights and cut off a stream of income on which many rely.\u201d The bipartisan nature of the law Biden signed might convince\u00a0the courts of the seriousness of the national security concerns around TikTok, said Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic at Cornell University. Still, Hans said, \u201cwithout public discussion of what exactly the risks are \u2026 it\u2019s difficult to determine why the courts should validate such an unprecedented law.\u201d In addition to potentially infringing on US TikTok users\u2019 speech rights, the federal law TikTok is challenging also implicates the constitutional rights of Apple and Google, whose app stores would be prohibited from carrying TikTok if a ban went into effect. \u201cThis raises concerns about potentially unconstitutional government intrusion into the decisions of these platforms regarding what content to host,\u201d wrote Jennifer Huddleston, a research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, in an op-ed last month. \u201cFurther, it could set a dangerous precedent of government intervention in the online space that many would find anathema in the offline space.\u201d The US government and more than half of US states have restricted TikTok from government devices, however, reflecting the authority that governments have to manage their own property. Internationally, TikTok has been banned on government devices in Canada, the United Kingdom and at the European Commission. The app has been subject to a complete ban in the entire country of India since 2020. Some US officials have been trying to ban TikTok from the United States since 2020, when former President Donald Trump moved to block the app by executive order. (Trump has since reversed his position, saying a TikTok ban would only help Meta, a company Trump blames for his 2020 election defeat.) The outcome of the TikTok case is likely to have far-reaching consequences for how the US government regulates technology and other foreign speech, Douek said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to think of this not in terms of just TikTok, but in terms of all foreign platforms in the future,\u201d Douek said. \u201cIn a globalized world, this issue is going to come up again and again. And if the government is handed the power to simply ban a platform based on what seems at this stage mere concerns about potential for future harm, rather than actual clear and present dangers, that would be extremely worrying.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/tech/tiktok-sues-us-app-ban/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_africa_kenya-flooding-maasai-mara-intl", "text": "Staff and visitors have been left stranded and buildings submerged at Kenya\u2019s famous Maasai Mara nature reserve, as the death toll in catastrophic flooding in the country\u2019s southwest rose to at least 188 people. Local authorities ordered some tourist facilities in the National Reserve to close after River Talek, one of the tributaries of the Mara River, burst its banks and swept through more than a dozen riverside tourist lodges and camps. Videos on social media showed some buildings and vehicles fully submerged inside the popular park as tourists scrambled to leave affected areas. Weeks of heavy rain and flash flooding has ravaged parts of Kenya for days, leaving dozens of people missing around the capital, Nairobi, and causing a devastating mudslide in the town of Mai Mahiu. Two more bodies were retrieved from the site of the mudslide, bringing the total number of deaths there to 50, government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said on Thursday, revising down the earlier figure of 71 reported due to an error, Nakuru County governor Susan Kihika told CNN. In Maasai Mara, camp owners were told to leave the affected properties and \u201cmove to higher ground further away from River Talek,\u201d governor of Narok county Patrick Ole Ntutu said on Wednesday. But local administrators went even further in their warnings, threatening legal consequences for people still left behind, even accusing those who stay of attempting suicide. \u201cWe will forcefully evacuate anybody left in any homes or lodges along the river. We will take action against them because that is considered attempted suicide,\u201d Narok county commissioner Kipkech Lotiatia told reporters. Authorities said they had deployed two helicopters to rescue stranded tourists and local staff around the national reserve after receiving distress calls. The flooding was caused by swollen rivers after several days of continuous rainfall, the county said on X. A tour guide told CNN he was awoken by sounds of rushing water after 1 a.m. on Thursday. When he left his tent, flood waters rose to his waist and the entire Talek Bush Camp had been surrounded. \u201cMy driver and I were the first to wake up, so we woke up all the 14 international tourists and 25 staff and climbed ladders to some water tanks that are raised,\u201d 27-year-old James Apolloh Omenya told CNN via telephone. \u201cWe were being rained on from around 2 a.m. to 5.30 a.m. but we couldn\u2019t get out and the planes coming to rescue us couldn\u2019t get in one time.\u201d The\u00a0Kenya\u00a0Red Cross said it had rescued more than 90 people and at least 14 camps around River Talek had been closed. While parts of the Mara have flooded before in\u00a0Kenya\u2019s so-called long rains season, locals say the scale of this year\u2019s deluge has been unprecedented. The country has deployed \u201ccorps from the Paramilitary Academy\u201d of its National Youth Service to Narok to \u201cjoin the multi-agency team for search and rescue operations following the heavy downpour,\u201d a statement on X said. The Horn of\u00a0Africa, a region of East\u00a0Africa\u00a0that includes\u00a0Kenya, is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions in the world. Heavy rains have also affected Tanzania and Burundi. \u201cKenya is facing a worsening flood crisis due to the combined effects of El Ni\u00f1o and the ongoing March-May 2024 long rains,\u201d International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) CEO Jagan Chapagain\u00a0said in a post on X earlier this week, referring to the climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and impacts weather all over the world. \u201cThe unfolding devastation highlights the government\u2019s obligation to prepare for and promptly respond to the foreseeable impacts of climate change and natural disasters,\u201d said\u00a0Nyagoah Tut Pur, Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement Thursday. \u201cKenyan authorities should urgently ensure support to affected communities and protect populations facing high risk.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/africa/kenya-flooding-maasai-mara-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

Like hundreds of millions of other children in many parts of South and Southeast Asia, Sek Seila\u00a0has had to cope with unprecedented setbacks due to record-breaking heat \u2014 like sudden school closures, and having lessons and activities canceled or disrupted. School this year has been difficult, he says, adding that stifling heat and high humidity levels in poorly ventilated classrooms have been difficult to endure. \u201cMy classroom does not have air conditioning,\u201d Sek Seila\u00a0told CNN. His class of 43 students pass around mini hand-held fans during lessons on most days to keep cool. \u201cIt\u2019s very unpleasant and uncomfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cOn some days, it can even get so hot that it feels like your skin is burning.\u201d The hot weather has also been brutal in many South Asian countries where, science shows, climate change has brought stronger and more frequent extreme weather events, like life-threatening heatwaves \u2014 leaving nearly half a billion children exposed and vulnerable. A dangerous heatwave hit Bangladesh in April, shutting down schools across the country \u2014 many of which were poorly equipped and lacked essential cooling resources, such as fans and air-conditioning, to support and protect students from health risks like dehydration, migraines and heat stroke. More than 33 million children were impacted as a result of the heatwave, according to groups like Save the Children and UNICEF. The worst hit were poor children\u00a0in rural areas whose families couldn\u2019t afford devices like laptops and tablets to facilitate remote learning, UNICEF says. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy for many children in a country as hot as Bangladesh, where they have been facing blast-furnace heat almost every day,\u201d said Sheldon Yett, a UNICEF representative for the region. \u201cThis year was hotter than last year and we know that global warming is only going to get worse,\u201d Yett said. \u201cBesides serious health risks, we cannot ignore children\u2019s education needs, which have already been severely impacted after the Covid pandemic.\u201d Poorest countries suffer most The UN and its agencies say developing countries are at the forefront of the climate crisis and bear the brunt of prolonged extreme weather like heatwaves, tornadoes and cyclones, as well as severe storms and flooding. \u201cEvery child has a right to a safe and healthy environment,\u201d Yett said. \u201cWe want to see schools open for children to learn but everything needs to be done in a safe way.\u201d Experts and educators in Cambodia and the Philippines told CNN that\u00a0March and April have been extremely difficult for schools. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow children outside when temperatures get too hot,\u201d said Bong Samreth, who teaches at a public school in Phnom Penh. \u201cBut it can feel just as hot and uncomfortable indoors in classrooms without fans or air-conditioning,\u201d he says, adding that he often sees students \u201csweating through their uniforms\u201d at their desks. \u201cWe do our best to look after them, especially the young ones, and the past few months have been very trying.\u201d Climate change continues to impact poverty rates and schools in the Philippines, often ranked as one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change and where schools are still recovering from some of the longest pandemic closures. The educational gap between impoverished Philippine children and those in urban areas has been widening, said child welfare and advocacy group Save the Children Philippines, adding children in rural areas, unable to attend school, have been at a particular disadvantage. It also isn\u2019t uncommon to see groups of up to 70 students crammed into a single classroom with just one or two electric fans for cool air circulation and ventilation, the group says. Volunteers have also raised issues from students about insufficient clean drinking water at school, meaning they cannot keep hydrated during the day \u2014 as well as lacking shaded outdoor recreational areas. \u201cClasses have not been consistent,\u201d said Benjo Basas, a social sciences teacher in Manila, adding that \u201calmost the entire month of April\u201d had been disrupted by massive school closures after heat in many areas became unbearable \u2014 impacting around 7 million children. Students were unable to concentrate during class, Basas told CNN, an especially stressful issue given that important final-term examinations were just around the corner. Mirasol Mamaat, a high-school teacher in the country\u2019s northern Pangasinan province, said dozens of students had become sick after recent heat index levels \u2014 which measure how hot it really feels outside \u2014\u00a0hit alarming highs of more than 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit). \u201cFor some impoverished students, we will do home visits to check in on them and deliver study materials like we did during the pandemic,\u201d she said. Governments urged to act Governments in South and Southeast Asia have given practical advice on avoiding heat strokes and heat exhaustion, but few have come up with long term plans to address the worsening effects of the climate crisis. In a directive to all public schools in late-April, Cambodian education minister Hang Chuon Naron announced that school would be reduced by two hours during times of soaring daily temperatures. Students were advised \u201cto drink plenty of water\u201d and to avoid staying out in the sun for too long \u201cwithout sunshades or protection,\u201d he said. Loose, lightweight and light colored clothing was also advised for students to protect them from sunburns and heat exposure. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday said his administration is looking to revert the upcoming academic year to start in June and end in March, saying it \u201cwill be better for the kids.\u201d Much of South and Southeast Asia experiences the hottest temperatures in April, May and June before monsoon rains bring much needed relief. Nonethless, as extreme weather conditions become the norm, meeting the needs of children in poor and vulnerable countries is more important than ever, experts say. \u201cWe always say that children will inherit the world but what kind of world are they going to inherit if it\u2019s going up in ashes?\u201d said Joy Reyes, a climate justice lawyer from the Philippines. The impact of pollution driven by the burning of fossil fuels cannot be underestimated, climate experts say. There now needs to be \u201ca fundamental change\u201d among governments about how energy is generated. \u201cGovernments have the responsibility of providing clean energy and infrastructure \u2014 it should not be left to companies or individuals,\u201d said Glory Dolphin Hammes, CEO of IQ Air, an environmental research company that closely monitors global air quality, conditions and temperatures. \u201cCleaner air, keeping climate change at bay \u2014 this needs to be the future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/asia/southeast-asia-heatwaves-education-school-closures-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_middleeast_rafah-palestinians-refugees-fleeing-intl", "text": "Palestinians are fleeing Rafah\u2019s tent cities in large numbers as the threat of a potential major Israeli assault in the southern Gaza city looms, new satellite imagery from Planet Labs shows. CNN has identified several camps sheltering Gaza\u2019s vast refugee population \u2013 including the main camp in central Rafah that housed thousands of tents \u2013 which have significantly decreased in size between Tuesday and Wednesday. Although some camps in Rafah did see a decrease in population earlier in the week, the majority of camps identified by CNN saw their greatest declines since Tuesday. Some of the tent camps had been in United Nations schools, others in open fields, or along roadways for months.\u00a0Now, a significant number have vanished, but many remain in the camps despite orders from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to leave. At least 110,000 Palestinians have fled Rafah since Monday, after the IDF issued an evacuation order, according to the UN\u2019s agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA).  Streams of Palestinians made their way to Al-Mawasi earlier this week, following an Israeli relocation order. The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), Jan Egeland, warned that dire conditions there, including a lack of stable security, adequate accommodation or space, \u201cqualifies Israel\u2019s relocation directives as forcible transfer, amounting to a serious violation of international law.\u201d Rafah has become the central focus of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces\u00a0growing pressure\u00a0from the extreme wing of his coalition to launch a full-scale ground operation in the city to destroy Hamas, while the more moderate wing has urged him to prioritize securing a\u00a0ceasefire-for-hostages deal. Israel launched a military assault on Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people in Israel and abducted more than 250 others. Israel\u2019s offensive has since pulverized patches of the Gaza Strip and drastically diminished critical supplies, exposing the entire population of more than 2.2 million people to the risk of famine. Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed 34,904 Palestinians and injured another 78,514 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. International pressure is growing for Israel not to move in on the densely populated city bordering Egypt. During nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have taken refuge in Rafah. Hamas is also believed to have regrouped in the area, after Israel\u2019s destruction of much of the strip\u2019s north. On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden sent shockwaves through the US and Israel when he warned that the US would halt some shipments of American weapons should Netanyahu order a major invasion of the city. But Netanyahy responded defiantly saying in a speech \u201cif we need to stand alone, we will stand alone. I have said that, if necessary, we will fight with our fingernails.\u201d Gazans began fleeing Rafah on Monday, after Israel\u2019s military\u00a0issued a call\u00a0for residents in the east of Rafah to\u00a0\u201cevacuate immediately\u201d toward Al Mawasi and other areas north of Rafah. Many people have fled further north than Al-Mawasi, heading for areas in central Gaza that have more infrastructure. The IDF began conducting ground operations on Tuesday, after seizing the Gaza-side of the Rafah border crossing.\u00a0Those operations are ongoing, but are largely focused in the easternmost sections of Rafah \u2013 just over a mile away from the closest camp CNN identified. A full-scale Israeli ground attack on Rafah could lead to \u201cpotential mass atrocities,\u201d Egeland, the NRC chief, said on Monday. This story has been updated with new information.

{"id": "style_mmakgabo-helen-sebidi-lost-artworks-the-walking-house-south-africa-sweden-spc", "text": "It was a phone call that changed everything. \u201cWe have some good news.\u201d Mmakgabo Helen Sebidi had been waiting to hear those words for more than 30 years. It was May 2023, and the celebrated South African artist, by then 80 years old, could barely believe it. \u201cYour works in Sweden have been found.\u201d Sebidi let out a scream. \u201cMy babies, my babies,\u201d she said into the phone. She was referring to her artworks. Mysteriously lost in 1991, they were coming home at last. Origins of an artist Sebidi was born in 1943 near Hammanskraal, South Africa, north of Pretoria. Her mother had moved to Johannesburg to work as a domestic worker, leaving her daughter in the care of Sebidi\u2019s grandmother, whose traditional painting style would become a major influence on her future. \u201cShe taught me how to do it,\u201d Sebidi recently told CNN, adding she would sometimes surprise her grandmother with a piece she\u2019d done on her own. Sebidi left school after grade eight to take a job as a domestic worker while also learning dressmaking. Any money she made, she sent home to support her grandmother. It was not until 1970, in her late twenties, that Sebidi would take her first official art classes, learning painting and sculpting. Her instructor was John Koenakeefe Mohl, one of South Africa\u2019s pioneering Black professional artists and teachers. Under the umbrella of the Johannesburg Art Foundation, an organization aimed at supporting\u00a0 practicing artists who were not able to go to university, Sebidi would display her works under a tree, once a month, together with other artists in what was called \u201cArt in the park.\u201d \u201cPeople would go and look at mainly terrible stuff but very, very occasionally \u2013 almost never \u2013 an extraordinary artist would emerge,\u201d said Mark Read, chairman of the Everard Read Group of Galleries, which now represents Sebidi. \u201cHelen is the grand luminary figure who emerged from the Johannesburg Art Foundation.\u201d Her talent was evident from the beginning, Read recalled. \u201cThere was never any guiding needed with Helen Sebidi,\u201d he added. \u201cThe opposite was always the case. She now and then thought that we needed guiding, which is probably entirely correct.\u201d Against the backdrop of apartheid policies in South Africa throughout the 1970s, Sebidi continued to refine her craft and find her voice, often depicting traditional imagery from a time before colonialism would grip the continent. An invitation in 1985 to showcase her work at the Federated Union of Black Artists (FUBA) sparked widespread attention for her work. It was her first solo exhibition and a first for a Black female artist. It was a moment that would change the trajectory of her career. Four years later, Sebidi received a Fulbright Scholarship to travel to the US and continue her art at the prestigious Millary Colony for the Arts in New York state. \u201cMy child became my work\u201d Yet it was an opportunity in Sweden in 1991 that would result in a most unexpected turn of events. As part of a program designed to introduce the world to rising South African artists \u2013 who would in turn have an opportunity to meet and establish contacts with Swedish artists \u2013 Sebidi accepted an invitation to the Swedish city of Nyk\u00f6ping to exhibit a series of paintings. Her trip would involve a one month residency where she would share South African knowledge with students at Nyk\u00f6ping Folk High School \u2013 just as South Africa was on the brink of democracy. \u201cIt was a very vibrant time for the visual arts in South Africa,\u201d said Kim Berman, a professor of visual arts at the University of Johannesburg. \u201cPeople were really excited about imaging what a new democracy looked like; corporates and organizations wanted to buy young artists\u2019 work, put it on their wall, and take down the kind of impressionist European posters.\u201d Two years before her Nyk\u00f6ping trip, Sebidi was involved in a serious car accident where she almost lost her life. During the incident, she says she received instruction in the form of a vision with a woman\u2019s voice to paint the body of work that would become the collection she\u2019d exhibit in Sweden. \u201cI was dead in that car accident,\u201d Sebidi recalled. \u201cThe women, the voices came from deep green, very deep green and the road I wanted to go to my mother, was black, black, black, and the other side was this strong, beautiful forest.\u201d Sebedi worked tirelessly to produce work that would tell the story of her lived experience, and that of Black South Africans. Compelled by her grandmother\u2019s voice and that of her ancestors, she called the collection \u201cNtlo E Etsamayang (The Walking House).\u201d  Although Sebidi never had children of her own, her art filled her life. \u201cMy child became my work,\u201d she said. A devastating mystery unfolds The paintings were all made over the course of about a year, where she couldn\u2019t sleep. Sebidi was haunted by visions and continued to work, her ancestors speaking to her saying, \u201cyour work is not done, get back to your work,\u201d said Gabriel Baard, the curator of Sebidi\u2019s most recent exhibition in Johannesburg. \u201cBefore this kind of period between 1990 and 1991, (Sebidi) was working quite monochromatically. She worked in etchings and liner cuts, occasionally silk screens,\u201d he added. Contrary to her usual technique, these new paintings exposed \u201ca reflection on her emotional state at the time. They are frantic, and fast and you can see the hand movement throughout every single drawing; an expression and an outlet to deal with her trauma,\u201d Baard described. With her artworks unframed and wrapped in rolls, Sebidi traveled to Sweden in 1991. As another artist was currently exhibiting, the curator at the school behind the project\u00a0assured her to leave them in his care, and he\u2019d call when it was her turn. That call never came. After a year went by without any communication, Sebidi requested her work be returned. But she was told that it had gone missing \u2013 believed to have been stolen. Over the years, she exchanged numerous letters with the organizers, but it was all in vain. She says the pain of losing her \u201cchildren\u201d pushed her to \u201cwork harder and harder.\u201d She became a figurehead representing Black women as a mentor in South African arts. \u201cThere were textbooks written about her \u2013 she was included in the curricula for many of the schools,\u201d Berman said. Her other works were exhibited all over the world, including the Smithsonian in the US. In 2004, she was awarded the Order of Ikhamanga by former South African President Thabo Mbeki \u2013 among the country\u2019s highest honors, given to those considered \u201ca national treasure.\u201d But all the attention and accolades in the world still could not bring her missing paintings back home. The homecoming In May 2023, while cleaning out a cupboard in the attic of Nyk\u00f6ping Folk High School in Sweden, caretaker Jesper Osterberg discovered a large paper roll with Sebidi\u2019s name, and a marker that indicated it had traveled from Johannesburg to Stockholm, on Swiss Air Freight. It was the majority of Sebidi\u2019s missing \u201cNtlo E Etsamayang (The Walking House)\u201d collection, 32 years after it was lost. Baard traveled to the south of Sweden to collect the 28 found pieces and deliver them back to Sebidi. His first encounter with them was very emotional, he said, seeing this body of work that had been missing for over three decades. \u201cI saw the faces actually at the top of the triptych kind of peering out to me,\u201d Baard described. \u201cIt was transcendental and spiritual as I watched the work come to life.\u201d With great excitement and anticipation, Sebidi rallied her whole community, family and friends to welcome the pieces back home. As she unrolled her work for the first time in 32 years, onlookers gasped in amazement. \u201cThe work was truly timeless,\u201d said Read. \u201cLooking at it, one couldn\u2019t say with any degree of surety what era it was from; inevitably that will mean that in the future it\u2019ll also be just as fresh.\u201d A new generation On April 6, \u201cNtlo E Etsamayang (The Walking House)\u201d went on display to the public for the first time at the University of Johannesburg Art Gallery, in partnership with Everard Read Gallery and the Swedish Embassy in Pretoria. The paintings illustrate tumultuous groups of figures sometimes tumbling upon each other like a continuous dance. The colors feature shades of orange and deep reds, with thick paint on handmade paper that was sometimes torn and stuck on top of each other, adding texture and character. Though there are still four small oil paintings missing, Sebidi is content with having her \u201cchildren\u201d back home and accessible for a new generation. She says she believes that her work \u201cwas hidden by those ancestors wanting the current generation to prepare ourself for the bigger voice, bigger energy.\u201d Reflective of the \u201cNtlo E Etsamayang (The Walking House)\u201d shaped by her grandmother, Sebidi hopes her work will influence the university to teach its students about indigenous knowledge. \u201cAfrican knowledge systems need to be created and have to be launched and have to be in free places,\u201d Sebidi said. \u201cWe need those freedoms.\u201d Mmakgabo Helen Sebidi\u2019s exhibition is on display at the University of Johannesburg Art Gallery until May 17, 2024.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/mmakgabo-helen-sebidi-lost-artworks-the-walking-house-south-africa-sweden-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_03_europe_georgia-russia-foreign-agent-europe-intl", "text": "After spending his days making wine in the foothills of the Caucasus Mountains, Tsotne Jafaridze returns home to Tbilisi, Georgia\u2019s capital, and begins his new routine. He packs goggles, a gas mask and enough water and snacks to last several hours. He has another long night ahead. Jafaridze is among thousands of Georgians who have for the past month gathered each night outside the country\u2019s parliament, facing down tear gas and water cannons fired by increasingly brutal police, to protest a bill they fear will torpedo its bid to join the European Union and push it further into the Kremlin\u2019s orbit. \u201cThis has become my routine,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIf we don\u2019t protect our freedom right now \u2013 our European and Western future \u2013 tomorrow we\u2019re going to wake up in Russia. And that will be it.\u201d The ruling Georgian Dream party is trying to force through a \u201cforeign agent\u201d law, likened by critics to a measure introduced by Russian President Vladimir Putin to quash dissent. The draft law, which has passed the second of three votes, would require organizations in the former Soviet country that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cforeign agents\u201d or face crippling fines. Jafaridze, who also owns a travel business and says he receives 95% of his income from foreign sources, says he would \u201cimmediately\u201d be listed as a foreign agent under the broadly-written law. But critics say the intended target of the legislation is not business owners like him, but Georgia\u2019s independent media and civil society organizations, ahead of elections in October in which Georgian Dream, whose popularity is waning, is desperate to keep power. Georgia\u2019s government tried to pass the same law last year, but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after a week of intense protests, which saw citizens waving EU flags buffeted back by water cannons. In a move widely seen as an effort to reward Georgia\u2019s citizens \u2013 of whom about 80% support joining the bloc \u2013 and reverse the country\u2019s drift towards Russia, the EU granted it candidate status in December. \u201cThe pictures almost created a moral pressure on Brussels to reward these people, even though their government isn\u2019t doing great,\u201d Natalie Sabanadze, Georgia\u2019s former ambassador to the EU \u2013 at a time when candidacy was almost unimaginable \u2013 told CNN. But the government reintroduced the same bill in March and appears determined to force it through, despite protests that grow fiercer every week. With fiercer protests has come a fiercer police response. Levan Khabeishvili, chairman of the opposition United National Movement party, shared a photo of his swollen and blackened face after he said he was brutally beaten on Tuesday night. Khabeishvili told CNN he was giving an interview outside parliament when he saw a young man being detained by police, and tried to intervene. \u201cAt that moment they grabbed me, dragged me in and assaulted me,\u201d he said, in an ordeal that lasted around 15 minutes. \u201cThey were telling me that I talk too much and they\u2019d make sure I would not be able to any more.\u201d Khabeishvili was seen speaking in Parliament the next day with his face wrapped in bandages. Eto Buziashvili, a former adviser to Georgia\u2019s National Security Council who has attended most of the protests, said police on Tuesday night became \u201cexceptionally brutal.\u201d She told CNN she saw \u201cmany law enforcement officers who were not wearing identification marks. They were beating people, but we didn\u2019t know they were with the police. This is very dangerous.\u201d Several protesters told CNN that the tear gas used was noticeably more potent than before, making it harder to breathe and forcing protesters briefly to disperse and regroup. Many fled to the April 9 Park, named after a night in 1989 where the Soviet Army tried to crush a pro-independence protest, killing 21 people and injuring hundreds. Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union exactly two years later. \u2018This is not Belarus\u2019 Many Georgians feel deep hostility toward Russia, which invaded Georgia in 2008 and occupies about 20% of its internationally recognized territory \u2013 about the same proportion it occupies in Ukraine. Despite recent Russian aggression against Georgia, Georgian Dream has long been accused of harboring pro-Russian sympathies and its billionaire founder, Bidzina Ivanishvili, made his fortune in the Soviet Union. \u201cNot many people believe that a person who makes billions in Russia is just let out of Russia without any commitments,\u201d Buziashvili said. Many Georgians describe Ivanishvili as a \u201cpuppet master\u201d and believe elected officials mostly dance to his tune. Ivanishvili, once a frontline politician but now a reclusive figure, made a rare appearance Monday night, addressing a crowd of counter-protesters after thousands of people were bussed to Tbilisi from Georgia\u2019s rural regions, where Georgian Dream enjoys more support. His speech showed deep paranoia, conspiracism and had an autocratic streak. Ivanishvili claimed Georgia was being controlled by \u201ca pseudo-elite nurtured by a foreign country.\u201d He claimed the world was run by a \u201cGlobal War Party,\u201d which he suggested was responsible for Russia\u2019s 2008 invasion. And he pledged to persecute his political opponents after October\u2019s elections. \u201cThe Georgian government is clearly siding with the Putinist, anti-liberal forces of the world,\u201d Sabanandze, the former EU ambassador, said. \u201cIt\u2019s turning into an instrument in the hands of Russia. I cannot speculate. I have no idea whether they\u2019re working on Russia\u2019s instructions, but they certainly are fulfilling their interests.\u201d As protests swelled in Tbilisi, Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze also appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) annual gathering in Hungary. In his speech, Kobakhidze denounced the \u201cso-called liberals\u201d protesting outside parliament and said they were attacking \u201chomeland, language, and faith.\u201d Sabanadze noted the appeal that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Europe\u2019s longest-serving leader, has to governments seeking to hold onto power. The United States has criticized Georgia\u2019s recent shift. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the foreign agent legislation and Georgian Dream\u2019s \u201canti-Western rhetoric put Georgia on a precarious trajectory.\u201d Kobakhidze has hit back at the US criticism and on Friday accused Washington of attempting to stoke a revolution in Georgia \u201ccarried out through NGOs financed from external sources.\u201d Some have questioned why Georgian Dream reintroduced the foreign agent bill at this moment, almost exactly a year after it was first defeated. Ivanishvili explained in his speech that he had calculated the moment \u201cperfectly:\u201d by introducing the bill now, he hoped the energy of the protesters would be \u201cprematurely wasted\u201d and that their power would be \u201cdrained\u201d before October. In an interesting parallel, Ivanishvili said he was not like Viktor Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine toppled by the Maidan protests in 2014, when thousands of Ukrainians demanded a European future \u2013 in scenes similar to those in Tbilisi today. \u201cHe thinks that this situation here is different, that he\u2019s more in control, and that he will not allow the kind of Maidan to take place in Georgia,\u201d said Sabanadze. \u201cBut he might be underestimating the popular outrage.\u201d As the protests show no sign of slowing, some have questioned whether they could swell into something resembling a revolution. \u201cIf this government doesn\u2019t withdraw this bill now, when they still have the chance, it will be hard for them to get to the elections. It\u2019s a spiral at the moment,\u201d said Sabanadze. Jafaridze, the winemaker, says he has never seen the country so united. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to defeat these people. This is not Belarus. This is not Russia.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/europe/georgia-russia-foreign-agent-europe-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_16_style_emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest", "text": "While many celebrity homes look less than lived-in, ranging from spotless minimal to ostentatiously palatial, actor Emma Roberts\u2019 Hollywood Hills home is made for curling up with a good book \u2014 or several \u2014 with warm tones, comfortable couches, and antique curiosities in each room (also, a lagoon-style pool in the backyard for summer reads). Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_weather_storms-tennessee-wednesday-severe-weather-thursday", "text": "Violent storms were tracking through parts of the South Thursday, a day after deadly, destructive thunderstorms and tornadoes tore through the central and southern US, marking more chaotic weather amid a two-week streak of danger. Large hail \u2013 some the size of golf and tennis balls \u2013 pounded parts of the South Thursday, especially in Texas, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Strong winds also were reported from east Texas to South Carolina, leaving numerous reports of downed trees across the region, the prediction center said. The South still was dealing with substantial damage wrought by storms Wednesday. Tennessee was especially hard hit that day, with multiple tornadoes and water rescues amid flash flood emergencies in the state. At least one tornado has been reported in the US every day since April 25 \u2013 a streak of 15 days and counting - and there have been more than 300 reported tornadoes during that span. April and May are the most active months for tornadoes and severe weather, and that reputation continued Thursday, when more than 60 million people in the South and East were at risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. A tornado emergency unfolded Wednesday evening in Maury County, located about 25 miles south of Nashville. The National Weather Service warned of a \u201cconfirmed large and destructive tornado\u201d near the city of Spring Hill. The tornado killed one person and injured about a dozen others, according to county officials. In northern Alabama, a \u201clarge and destructive tornado\u201d prompted a tornado emergency late Wednesday in the area of Henagar, a city of a couple thousand people roughly 55 miles east of Huntsville, the National Weather Service said. The twister that moved through Henagar was an EF-2 tornado, with peak winds of 135 mph, and it injured seven people, the weather service\u2019s office in Huntsville said. Here\u2019s the latest on ongoing storms and destruction in the central and southern US: At least three dead in the South: One person was killed on Wednesday in Claiborne County, Tennessee, when a tree fell on their car amid intense storms, the county\u2019s emergency management office said. Another person died in Tennessee after a tornado touched down in Maury County Wednesday evening. In North Carolina, one person was killed in Gaston County near Charlotte when a tree fell on their vehicle, officials said. Tornado injures several, causes significant damage: About a dozen people were injured by the tornado in Maury County, Tennessee, officials confirmed in a press conference Thursday. At least one person is in serious condition, Maury Regional Medical Center spokesperson Rita Thompson told CNN. Video from the scene showed buildings torn to shreds, homes missing large sections of roofs and walls and large trees snapped in half. Water rescues amid flash flood emergencies: Up to 9 inches of rain triggered flash flood emergencies and water rescues in communities just north of Nashville, Tennessee, Wednesday evening. Flooding in Robertson County blocked roadways and forced water rescues, the county\u2019s emergency management agency told CNN. Emergency crews have also responded to water rescue calls and evacuated flooded homes in Sumner County, the county\u2019s emergency management director Ken Weidner said. Sumner County Schools are closed Thursday due to the flooding. Fallen trees damage cars and homes in North Carolina: About 1,200 weather-related calls for service were made in Gaston County Wednesday, Emergency Management and Fire Services Deputy Chief Lance Foulk said during a news conference Wednesday evening, including multiple calls for fallen trees on vehicles, homes and power lines. Schools in the county are closed Thursday, officials said.  Thousands of power outages: Amid the severe storms, several states have experienced power outages. More than 50,000 homes and businesses in Alabama, more than 44,000 in Texas, more than 16,000 in North Carolina and more than 13,000 in Tennessee were without power as of Thursday night, according to PowerOutage.us. Expansive storm threat again Thursday Strong storms moved through parts of the South on Thursday afternoon, unloading damaging winds and tornadoes. At least two tornadoes tracked through southern Georgia \u2013 one near Ellaville and the other near Alston \u2013 according to the National Weather Service. Severe thunderstorms also rumbled to life in northern Texas and southern Oklahoma early Thursday afternoon. Additional storms were expected to develop into the overnight hours. Very large hail and damaging wind gusts are the main threat with storms in the southern Plains, but tornadoes remain possible. Additional storms also were expected to develop in the Southeast into Thursday night. A Level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms was in place Thursday from Texas to Georgia and southern South Carolina. Damaging wind gusts, hail and tornadoes are possible within any storms. Powerful winds will be the main threat for areas closer to the coast. Heavy rainfall will raise the risk of flash flooding across much of the South. Areas from Texas to the Carolinas are under a Level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall Thursday, according to the Weather Prediction Center. On Friday, the severe weather threat peaks across northern Florida, southern Georgia and the southernmost corner of South Carolina. Those areas are under a Level 2 out of 5 risk, according to the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cIsolated to scattered severe thunderstorms appear possible Friday across parts of the Southeast. Damaging winds should be the main threat,\u201d the center said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/weather/storms-tennessee-wednesday-severe-weather-thursday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

Russia\u2019s annual May 9 Victory Day procession has long been a key event in Putin\u2019s calendar as a chance for him to rally public support and show off his country\u2019s military power. While there were even fewer soldiers and military gear on display than last year\u2019s already subdued event, Victory Day this year comes with Russia making advances on the frontlines in Ukraine. Putin\u00a0gave his speech after inspecting the traditional display of tanks and columns of troops parading through the capital. \u201cRussia will do everything in order to not let a global confrontation begin,\u201d\u00a0Putin said, adding: \u201cBut we will not let anyone threaten us, our strategic forces are always ready.\u201d \u201cDear friends, Russia is going through a difficult period,\u201d\u00a0the Russian leader\u00a0continued, saying the \u201cfight of our motherland depends on every one of us.\u201d \u201cToday, on the Victory Day, we realize this even more so,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0concluded, ending his speech with a minute of silence. Around 27 million people in the Soviet Union died in World War II, more than in any other country. Russia\u2019s defense minister, Army General Sergei Shoigu, said in a statement on Telegram that 9,000 people and 70 pieces of military equipment would participate in the main military parade on Red Square. This was less than last year, when Shoigu said more than 10,000 people and 125 items of military hardware would be involved. Several world leaders, mostly from ex-Soviet countries, were invited. Those scheduled to be there were Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev of Kazakhstan, Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan, Serdar Berdimuhamedow of Turkmenistan, Miguel Diaz-Canel of Cuba, Thongloun Sisoulith of Laos, and Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 of Guinea-Bissau. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova\u00a0told TASS in an interview that \u201cunfriendly countries\u201d were not invited for a third Victory Day since the war in Ukraine began. \u201cThey are pursuing an aggressive policy toward our country. They formulate it as inflicting strategic defeat,\u201d\u00a0Zakharova\u00a0said. Putin has portrayed his invasion of Ukraine in patriotic terms \u2014 as a response to a threat posed by the West, something flatly rejected by Kyiv and its allies. His Victory Day address comes just days after the Russian leader was inaugurated for a fifth term in office, in a carefully choreographed ceremony. The inauguration, held Tuesday in the Kremlin, was attended by Russia\u2019s top military and political brass, but the United States and many European nations declined to send a representative after dismissing Russia\u2019s elections as a sham. It further cemented Putin\u2019s grip on power in Russia, where he has served as either president or prime minister since his first inauguration in 2000, and tinkered with Russia\u2019s constitution to remove term limits and extend each term\u2019s length from four years to six.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/europe/putin-red-square-victory-day-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_middleeast_biden-weapons-deliveries-israel-reaction-intl", "text": "Israeli officials have slammed the United States and descended into a bout of infighting over US President Joe Biden\u2019s remarks that he would halt some shipments of American weapons to Israel if a full-scale ground operation is launched into the city of Rafah. After Biden made his remarks, in an interview with CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, Gilad Erdan, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, said he believed the decision \u201ccan encourage the enemies of the State of Israel and the Israeli nation,\u201d while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted to the announcement by posting a short clip of a speech he delivered a few days ago, in which he said: \u201cIf Israel is forced to stand alone, Israel will stand alone.\u201d Netanyahu reiterated the sentiment on Thursday, on the eve of the country\u2019s Independence Day, saying: \u201cIn the War of Independence 76 years ago, we were few against many. We had no weapons, there was an arms embargo on Israel, but with the greatness of spirit, bravery and unity among us - we won.\u201d The US president\u2019s announcement that he was prepared to condition American weaponry on Israel\u2019s actions is a turning point in the seven-month conflict between Israel and Hamas. And his acknowledgement that American bombs\u00a0had been used to kill civilians\u00a0in Gaza was a stark recognition of the United States\u2019 role in the war. The president has come under extraordinary pressure, including from members of his own party, to limit shipments of arms amid a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The comment from Biden to CNN is a major setback for Israel\u2019s war. The US is by far Israel\u2019s most important and most powerful ally, and without its support, Israel\u2019s firepower and ambitions in Gaza would be weakened. The Biden administration has for months been putting pressure on Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza and to ensure more humanitarian aid can be delivered there. The US has also repeatedly called on Netanyahu and his government to reconsider its plans for a full-scale invasion of Rafah, the southernmost city of Gaza where more than 1 million people are sheltering after fleeing from fighting elsewhere in the strip. Israel has, so far, carried out a limited operation around the city, taking control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing \u2014\u00a0a crucial entry point for aid into Gaza \u2014\u00a0and carrying out military strikes on the city\u2019s fringes. New satellite images obtained by CNN from Planet Labs show Israel\u2019s attack in Rafah has expanded from airstrikes to ground operations in recent days. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday told some people in eastern Rafah to \u201cevacuate immediately\u201d ahead of a military operation in the city. They were told to go to Al-Mawasi, a coastal town near the city of Khan Younis that aid groups have described as overcrowded and not appropriate for habitation. The UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA)\u00a0estimated that nearly 79,000 people have fled the city since Monday. Despite mounting international pressure, the Biden administration has stood firm with Israel until now, delivering weapons and other support. The threat on Wednesday came just a day after Biden used his speech at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum to remind people of the horrors of the October 7 attacks on Israel, when Hamas-led fighters killed around 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 250. Many of the hostages taken into Gaza on that day are still being held in the strip. \u201cToo many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 \u2014 including Hamas\u2019 appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews. It\u2019s absolutely despicable \u2013 and it must stop,\u201d he said on Tuesday, raising his voice. But the president struck a very different note on Wednesday. \u201cI made it clear that if they go into Rafah \u2013 they haven\u2019t gone in Rafah yet \u2013 if they go into Rafah, I\u2019m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities \u2013 that deal with that problem,\u201d Biden said, adding that the US would continue supplying defensive weapons to Israel. Netanyahu\u00a0said Biden had made a mistake in an interview with the American talk show host known as Dr. Phil, to be broadcast on Thursday night. Netanyahu\u00a0said Israeli forces are doing what they can to let the people leave Rafah, and that he hoped that the two leaders would find a way to overcome their differences. \u201cI\u2019ve known Joe Biden for many years, 40 years and more. We often had our agreements, but we\u2019ve had our disagreements. We\u2019ve been able to overcome them. I hope we can overcome them now,\u201d\u00a0Netanyahu\u00a0said. Biden\u2019s comments have sparked significant anger among some Israeli politicians. Speaking at an event honoring fallen Israeli soldiers and victims of terror attacks, Israel\u2019s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant said: \u201cI turn to Israel\u2019s enemies as well as to our best of friends and say - the State of Israel cannot be subdued, not the IDF, not the defense establishment, and not the State of Israel. We will stand strong, we will achieve our goals - we will hit Hamas, we will hit Hezbollah, and we will achieve security.\u201d Miki Zohar, a minister from Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, said it was \u201camazing to discover that the world has forgotten what happened in Israel on October 7.\u201d \u201cWe will not compromise our security, and we will never agree to submit to any demands that harm Israel\u2019s national security,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Asked Thursday whether the Israel military is ready for a major assault in Rafah without US weapons, IDF spokesperson spokesperson Daniel Hagari said weaponry would not be an issue. \u201cThe IDF has weapons for the missions it is planning. And also for the missions in Rafah, we have the weapons we require.\u201d The announcement has also exposed the deep divisions between Israel\u2019s various political parties. Israel\u2019s far-right Minister of National Security, Itamar Ben Gvir, criticized Biden on X, saying: \u201cHamas \u2764\ufe0f Biden.\u201d That statement had prompted a reaction from the country\u2019s President Isaac Herzog, who warned against \u201cbaseless, irresponsible and insulting statements and tweets\u201d during a speech marking the anniversary of the Victory Day. Other top Israeli officials also criticized Ben Gvir. Yair Lapid, from the centrist\u00a0Yesh Atid party, responded: \u201cIf Netanyahu does not fire Ben Gvir today, he is endangering every soldier in the IDF and every citizen in the State of Israel.\u201d The leader of the Israeli Labor Party, Merav Michaeli, said that \u201cNetanyahu and his government continue to make Israel\u2019s strategic situation worse.\u201d This story has been updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/middleeast/biden-weapons-deliveries-israel-reaction-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

The suspect was indicted on a charge of forced disappearance in the case involving the three tourists, whose bodies were found last week dumped in a 50-foot well with gunshot wounds to the head. The prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement Wednesday that it would also press charges of homicide. Brothers Jake and Callum Robinson and their friend Jack Carter Rhoad were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana when they went missing. Mexican authorities believe that at some point between the afternoon of April 27 and the following morning, several people approached the surfers intending to steal their vehicle, and \u201cdue to the reaction of the victims, they deprived them of their lives.\u201d Authorities said the suspect \u2013 one of three Mexican citizens who have been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping in the case \u2013 was captured a \u201cfew hours\u201d later. \u201cOther evidence was also collected, such as rods from tents, firearm casings, plastic gallon bottles, blood stains, and drag marks, in the place where they were presumably camping,\u201d authorities said.

{"id": "2024_05_08_world_lava-tube-stone-age-arabia-scn", "text": "People who lived in the Arabian Peninsula thousands of years ago went underground when they wanted to beat the heat. Possibly stopping there as they traveled between oases and pastures, they ducked into vast subterranean tunnels where molten lava had once flowed\u00a0millions of years earlier, according to a recent study. Beginning in the Stone Age, Neolithic herders descended into and occupied these vast tunnels, known as lava tubes, archaeologists have discovered. Cooler air underground would have provided a welcome respite from the sun and wind, and for thousands of years, humans sheltered with their livestock in the tunnels. The herders\u00a0left behind objects and even carved pictures on the rocky walls, researchers reported April 17 in the journal PLOS One. In the Harrat Khaybar lava field, about 78 miles (125 kilometers) to the north of Medina in Saudi Arabia is a tunnel system called Umm Jirsan, the longest in the region. Scientists haven\u2019t yet confirmed the age of the lava that formed this system, but a 2007 study suggested it was around 3 million years old.\u00a0Umm Jirsan spans nearly 1 mile (1.5 kilometers), with passages that are up to 39 feet (12 meters) tall and as much as 148 feet (45 meters) wide. Archaeologists at Umm Jirsan recently found animal bones dating from 400 years to more than 4,000 years ago, and human remains ranging from 150 years to about 6,000 years ago. The\u00a0research team\u00a0also found cloth fragments, pieces of carved wood and dozens of stone tools \u2014 the first evidence that humans were using the tunnels, starting at least 7,000 years ago. \u201cFrom earlier reports we knew that fossils were preserved at the site,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Mathew Stewart, a research fellow at the Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution at Griffith University in Australia. \u201cHowever, we were not expecting to find evidence for human occupation in the form of rock art, lithic artefacts, stone structures, and pottery,\u201d Stewart told CNN in an email. \u201cPeople made use of and occupied these lava tubes over millennia. While most research in Arabia is focused on surface sites, underground settings such as at Umm Jirsan offer tremendous potential to fill in some of the gaps in the data.\u201d This discovery highlights the significance of Umm Jirsan and other tunnels for understanding human dispersal in the region, said Guillaume Charloux, an archaeologist with the French National Centre for Scientific Research. In general, knowledge about ancient climate and humans in northwestern Arabia is limited, \u201cparticularly during the transitional phase between the Neolithic and the beginning of the 2nd millennium,\u201d said Charloux, who studies ancient sites in Saudi Arabia but was not involved in the new research.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0. Around this time, local people were settling around recently formed oases; the appearance of these desert refuges would shape human migration patterns in the region for millennia,\u00a0he\u00a0said via email. \u201cThe main contribution of this innovative and major research project seems to me to be that it brings to light the long-lasting use \u2014 probably ephemeral occupation \u2014 of this type of cave, which had remained unstudied, and their enormous potential, particularly for understanding paleoenvironmental contexts.\u201d \u2018Green Arabia\u2019 For nearly 15 years, Stewart and his colleagues have been piecing together evidence of ancient human life in Arabia, mostly from sites around lake deposits, Stewart\u00a0said. Beginning around 400,000 years ago, recurring periods of humidity saturated Arabian deserts with rainfall. During these \u201cGreen Arabia\u201d phases, lakes and ponds abounded and the landscape bloomed with lush vegetation, leading to waves of migrating humans who\u00a0dispersed into southwestern Asia, Stewart and other researchers previously reported in the journal Nature. But the last Green Arabia phase was around 55,000 years ago, and harsh desert environments aren\u2019t kind to archaeological evidence. While stone tools preserve well in dry deserts, bones and other organic materials are easily degraded and destroyed by erosion and extreme heat and cold, leaving little for researchers to interpret, Stewart noted. \u201cTo that end, in 2019 we decided to investigate underground settings where organics and sediments might be better preserved,\u201d he said. So the scientists turned their attention to Umm Jirsan. The site\u00a0had previously been mapped by the Saudi Geological Survey, and a report from 2009 described it as a refuge for wild animals such as foxes, wolves, birds and snakes. Caches of bones in the tunnels included human skull fragments estimated at the time to be about 4,000 years old. But until 2019, the tunnel system hadn\u2019t yet been closely investigated by archaeologists, Stewart said. \u201cWe were able to date the animal bones and sediments, which informed us that people began occupying the cave by 7,000 years ago and perhaps as early as 10,000 years ago,\u201d Stewart said. Compared with other sites where humans once lived, the amount of archaeological material at Umm Jirsan was \u201cquite scant,\u201d suggesting that people were visiting the tunnels as temporary refuges rather than living there permanently, the study authors reported. Animal carvings In another tunnel near Umm Jirsan, the researchers found 16 panels of engraved rock art. The carvings appeared to be herding scenes, with tool-wearing, stick-figure humans standing alongside domesticated animals such as dogs, cattle, goats and sheep. Other carvings showed animals with dramatically arching horns resembling those of an ibex; however, these horned animals could represent a different breed of domesticated goat, according to the study. The carvings\u2019 subjects and their varnish coating hint that they date to a regional period known as the Chalcolithic (around 4500 to 3500 BC), which preceded the rise of the Bronze Age. \u201cCollectively, the archaeological findings at the site and in the surrounding landscape paint a picture of recurrent use of the Umm Jirsan Lava Tube over millennia,\u201d Stewart said. The site \u2014 which lies along a known migratory route for Bronze Age herders \u2014 \u201cmay have served as a stopping off point, a place of refuge protected from the elements.\u201d This unprecedented evidence of human occupation in ancient Arabian lava tubes sheds light on how people adapted to live in arid landscapes, and further investigation of Umm Jirsan and other lava tubes promises to add even more details, Stewart added. \u201cThese sites have tremendous potential to fill in some of the gaps in the natural and cultural archives that persist in the Arabian archaeological record.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/world/lava-tube-stone-age-arabia-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

Rohrwacher was born in Tuscany and still lives in the same region where the tombaroli have long plied their illicit trade. She studied ancient literature, Greek and Latin at college, and her fourth feature was a chance to marry filmmaking with \u201ca passion that I\u2019ve always had.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a deep connection between archaeology and cinema \u2014 or at least in my way of making cinema, and my desire to be an archaeologist to some extent,\u201d Rohrwacher said. \u201cI feel that sometimes mankind, as far as White men go, behave as if they were the only thing that exists, without a past and without a future,\u201d she explained. \u201cMy job is very close to what an archaeologist does: giving meaning to things that happened in the past.\u201d In the 1980s grave robbing and antique trafficking was rife. As with her previous films, \u201cHeavenly Body,\u201d \u201cThe Wonders\u201d and \u201cHappy As Lazzaro,\u201d Rohrwacher combined local non-actors and established talent to form her merry band of tombaroli, who have little respect for the past, desecrating tombs and passing along their finds to a mysterious broker. We meet O\u2019Connor\u2019s Arthur as he returns from a prison stretch for doing just this. Though he has the gift of finding tombs, Arthur is conflicted about the business. He\u2019s in debt so he has no choice but to continue, but he\u2019s also drawn to these places because of their spiritual aura. For this strange foreigner is mourning the death of a lover; an Orpheus in search of his Eurydice among the realm of the dead. Isabella Rossellini plays the late woman\u2019s mother Flora, who has a soft spot for Arthur, who might be the last link to her daughter. \u201cI asked Alice, \u2018Is this film about death?\u2019\u201d recalled Rossellini, in an interview from her home in New York State. \u201cShe said to me, \u2018It\u2019s not about death, it\u2019s about the beyond.\u2019 And there is a difference. The beyond is a presence that we might still feel.\u201d One senses Rossellini believes this deeply. The actress, model and daughter of director Roberto Rossellini and actress Ingrid Bergman was something of a casting coup for Rohrwacher \u2013 the biggest name yet to feature in one of her films. O\u2019Connor, the ascending star of \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cChallengers,\u201d had to work a little harder to find his way to the project. The British actor had watched 2018\u2019s \u201cHappy as Lazzaro\u201d and decided to write her a letter. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t find my address,\u201d she said. \u201cSo he sent a number of letters to all kinds of random addresses and one of them reached my parents\u2019 house.\u201d \u201cI had imagined this film with a much older protagonist,\u201d the writer-director shared, but the letter was \u201cbeautiful.\u201d The two met and she decided the 33-year-old \u201chad such an old soul. I realized that he could tell the story of this character, who\u2019s a little scruffy, but a romantic hero, and also somewhat ridiculous.\u201d Arthur\u2019s crumpled linen suit and puppylike demeanor is the acceptable face of and Virgil-like guide into a murky world where the sacred is despoiled, and discovery and loss go hand in hand. In one scene, the tombaroli open an ornate, untouched tomb. The frescoes, vivid for thousands of years, fade before our eyes; their majesty obliterated by a waft of outside air. Even before one of the robbers delivers a horrifying coup de grace to a statue, Rohrwacher condemns them for their intrusion. In real life, the tombaroli operated quite brazenly for much of the 20th Century, even giving interviews to press. The turn of the century saw new laws restricting the illegal movement of Italian antiquities internationally, and in recent years substantial hauls of Etruscan artifacts have been returned. Today Italy has a robust taskforce for protecting and retrieving stolen cultural heritage at home and abroad, including the \u201cBlue Helmets for Culture,\u201d a collaboration between the Carabinieri and UNESCO. But there\u2019s a lot of damage to undo. Countless objects have passed from robbers to middlemen to international private collectors without ever receiving academic scrutiny. \u201cThe Etruscans were a very mysterious civilization,\u201d said Rossellini. \u201cMaybe there was a matriarchy \u2026 We don\u2019t know, because we never deciphered their writing.\u201d With each act of vandalism, such mysteries become harder to solve. Rohrwacher urges the audience to learn more, including a reading list in her film\u2019s end credits (\u201cone movie, interesting though it might be, is limiting,\u201d she said). Nevertheless, there\u2019s a paradox to Rohrwacher\u2019s work. She despairs that the past was put up for sale, at the cost of us better understanding it. Yet an air of mystery is integral to the story she is telling. To approach \u201cLa Chimera\u201d with dense history and sharp facts threatens to tear at its ethereal qualities \u2014 a hallmark of Rohrwacher\u2019s filmmaking. Broadly speaking, her signature style contains a subtle marriage of past and present \u2013 one that didn\u2019t go unnoticed by Rossellini. \u201cI see my father\u2019s influence, or (Federico) Fellini or (Pier Paolo) Pasolini,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me it was a moving moment to work with a young auteur who knew so much about cinema and was so moved by my father\u2019s work.\u201d \u201cHer father was such a maestro for me,\u201d said Rohrwacher of the director behind \u201cPaisan\u201d (1946) and \u201cRome, Open City\u201d (1945), on whose neorealist shoulders she stands, while offering a dose of magic and playfulness the late Italian master did not. \u201cI am fully aware of the importance of that heritage,\u201d she added. \u201cMy memory, my gaze \u2014 my outlook \u2014 was shaped not just by my real experiences, but also by the outlook or gaze that other filmmakers have provided me about reality. It\u2019s as if they trained my eye muscles and they\u2019ve transformed my experience of the world.\u201d \u201cAlice talks about the presence in Italy of this past that never really dies. There is always the pressure of this history,\u201d said Rossellini. \u201cYou live your present and your future, but the past, it shapes you.\u201d However, the past is a slippery thing, as Arthur\u2019s journey so vividly portrays. We stand atop its many layers, but sometimes we find ourselves buried by it. Even if, like \u201cLa Chimera\u2019s\u201d tombaroli, we fail to see its true value, it\u2019s always there. \u201cThe past is not dead,\u201d argued Rossellini. Through Rohrwacher\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s not even past. \u201cLa Chimera\u201d is released in UK cinemas on May 10 and is available to stream in the US.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/style/la-chimera-alice-rohrwacher-isabella-rossellini-interview/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_tech_us-export-licenses-china-huawei-hnk-intl", "text": "The United States has revoked licenses that allowed companies including Intel\u00a0and Qualcomm to ship chips used for laptops and handsets to sanctioned Chinese telecoms equipment maker\u00a0Huawei\u00a0Technologies, three people familiar with the matter said. A fourth person said some of the companies were notified on Tuesday that their licenses were revoked effective immediately. The U.S. Commerce Department earlier in the day confirmed it had revoked some licenses but stopped short of naming the companies. A spokesperson for Intel (INTC) declined to comment. Qualcomm (QCOM) did not respond to a request for comment, and\u00a0Huawei\u00a0did not immediately respond. The move comes after the release last month of\u00a0Huawei\u2019s first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro powered by Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra 9 processor. The laptop launch drew fire from Republican lawmakers, who said it suggested to them that the Commerce Department had given the green light to Intel to sell the chip to\u00a0Huawei. \u201cWe have revoked certain licenses for exports to\u00a0Huawei,\u201d the Commerce Department said in a statement, declining to specify which ones it had withdrawn. The Commerce Department\u2019s move, first reported by Reuters, comes after concerted pressure by Republican China hawks in Congress who have been urging the Biden administration to take tougher action to thwart\u00a0Huawei. \u201cThis action will bolster US national security, protect American ingenuity, and diminish Communist China\u2019s ability to advance its technology,\u201d Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik said in a statement. The move could hurt\u00a0Huawei,\u00a0which still relies on Intel chips to power its laptops, and could hurt US suppliers that do business with the company. Intel has also been facing weak demand for its traditional data center and PC chips. Last month, it lost $11 billion in stock market value after forecasting second-quarter revenue and profit\u00a0below market estimates. Licenses needed Huawei\u00a0was placed on a US trade restriction list in 2019 amid fears it could spy on Americans, part of a broader effort to handicap China\u2019s ability to bolster its military. Being added to the list means the company\u2019s suppliers have to seek a special, difficult-to-obtain license before shipping. Even so, suppliers to\u00a0Huawei\u00a0have received licenses\u00a0worth billions of dollars to sell goods and technology to the company, including one\u00a0particularly controversial authorization issued by the Trump administration, which has allowed Intel to ship central processors to\u00a0Huawei\u00a0for use in its laptops since 2020. Qualcomm has sold older 4G chips to handset makers since receiving a license from US officials in 2020. In a regulatory filing earlier this month, Qualcomm said it did not expect to receive more chip revenue from\u00a0Huawei\u00a0beyond this year. However, Qualcomm still licenses its portfolio of 5G technologies to\u00a0Huawei, which last year began using a 5G chip designed by its HiSilicon unit that most analysts believe is manufactured in violation of US sanctions. Qualcomm said in the filing this month that its patent deal with\u00a0Huawei\u00a0expires early in Qualcomm\u2019s fiscal 2025 and that it has started negotiations to renew the deal. Critics argue such licenses have contributed to the company\u2019s resurgence. Huawei shocked the industry last August with a new phone powered by a sophisticated chip manufactured by Chinese chipmaker SMIC, despite US export restrictions on both companies. The phone helped\u00a0Huawei\u00a0smartphone sales spike 64% year on year in the first six weeks of 2024, according to research firm Counterpoint. Its smart car component business has also contributed to\u00a0Huawei\u2019s resurgence, with the company notching its fastest revenue growth in four years in 2023.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/tech/us-export-licenses-china-huawei-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_asia_akiya-homes-problem-japan-intl-hnk", "text": "The number of vacant houses in Japan has surged to a record high of nine million \u2013 more than enough for each person in New York City \u2013 as the east Asian country continues to struggle with its ever-declining population. Abandoned houses are known in Japan as \u201cakiya\u201d \u2013 a term that usually refers to\u00a0derelict residential homes tucked away in rural areas. But more akiya are being seen in major cities, such as Tokyo and Kyoto, and that\u2019s a problem for a government that\u2019s already grappling with an aging population and an alarming fall in the number of children born each year. \u201cThis is a symptom of Japan\u2019s population decline,\u201d said Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Chiba. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a problem of building too many houses\u201d but \u201ca problem of not having enough people,\u201d he said. According to figures compiled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, 14% of all residential properties in Japan are vacant. The numbers include second homes and those left empty for other reasons, including properties temporarily vacated while their owners work overseas. They aren\u2019t all left to ruin, like traditional akiya, whose growing number present a range of other problems for the government and communities, experts told CNN. They include stifling attempts to rejuvenate decaying towns, becoming potential hazards due to the lack of maintenance, and raising the risks for rescuers in times of disaster in a country prone to earthquakes and tsunamis. The problem of too many homes Akiya are often passed down through generations. But with Japan\u2019s plummeting fertility rate, many are left with no heir to pass to, or are inherited by younger generations who have moved to the cities and see little value in returning to rural areas, experts told CNN. Some houses are also left in administrative limbo because local authorities don\u2019t know who the owners are due to poor record-keeping, they said. That makes it difficult for the\u00a0government\u00a0to rejuvenate fast-aging rural communities, hampering efforts to attract younger people interested in an alternative lifestyle or investors eyeing\u00a0a bargain. Under Japan\u2019s tax policies, some owners often find it cheaper to retain the home than to demolish it for redevelopment. And even if owners want to sell, they may have trouble finding buyers, said Hall, from Kanda University. \u201cMany of these houses are cut off from access to public transport, health care and even convenience stores,\u201d he said. Trending videos showing people - mainly foreigners - scooping up cheap Japanese houses and turning them into stylish guesthouses and cafes have garnered many followers on social media in recent years, but Hall warned it\u2019s not as easy as it seems. \u201cThe truth is most of these homes are not going to be sold to foreigners, or that the amount of administrative work and the rules behind it [are] not something easy for somebody who doesn\u2019t speak Japanese and read Japanese very well,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be able to get these houses for cheap.\u201d Too few people Japan\u2019s population has been in decline for several years \u2013 at the last count in 2022, the population had shrunk by more than 800,000 since the previous year, to 125.4 million. In 2023, the number of new births fell for the eighth consecutive year, reaching a record low, according to official data. Japan\u2019s birth rate has hovered around 1.3 for years, far from the 2.1 needed to maintain a stable population, and just last week Japan\u2019s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said the number of children under age 15 had dropped for the 43rd straight year to a record low of around 14 million, as of April 1. So, all that means the problem of too many homes and too few people looks set to continue for some time. Yuki Akiyama, a professor\u00a0from the faculty of architecture and urban design\u00a0at Tokyo City University, said vacant houses have caused issues in the past, for example, after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit the Noto Peninsula in the central prefecture of Ishikawa in January. The area where the quake struck was fraught with akiya, he said, and they posed both a danger to residents during the disaster and challenges for post-earthquake reconstruction. \u201cWhen an earthquake or a tsunami occurs, there is a possibility that vacant houses will block evacuation routes as they break down and get destroyed,\u201d he said. After the earthquake, authorities struggled to decide which damaged properties they could clean up because of unclear ownership, presenting \u201can obstacle for reconstruction,\u201d said Akiyama. In other rural areas with a high concentration of vacant houses, akiya have stalled development, the professor said. With these properties remaining untouched, he said, \u201cThe value of the area will be reduced because it is a place where you can\u2019t buy and sell it properly and you can\u2019t do large-scale development.\u201d \u201cPeople will think that this place has no value, and the real estate value of the entire area will gradually decrease.\u201d Akiyama\u00a0has devised an AI program to predict the areas most vulnerable to akiya, but he stressed the problem isn\u2019t unique to Japan - it has been seen in the US and some countries in Europe. However, he said Japan\u2019s architectural history and culture made the situation there particularly dire. Homes in Japan aren\u2019t valued for their longevity, he said, and unlike in the West, people don\u2019t typically see merit in living in historical buildings. \u201cIn Japan, the newer the house, the higher the price it sells for,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/asia/akiya-homes-problem-japan-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_weather_brazil-rain-floods-scli-intl", "text": "People in southern Brazil, already reeling from deadly floods, are bracing for more disruption as meteorologists warned of 12 straight hours of heavy rain Friday and more throughout the weekend. The death toll in the floods that have ravaged parts of the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul has inched up to 113, the state\u2019s civil defense agency said, as relentless downpours sweep the region and spread to parts of neighboring Uruguay. Officials are urging those who have been rescued from the floods not to return to their homes. Intense rain is expected to hit parts of the state\u2019s center and east on Friday to Sunday, with some areas expecting 150 mm over that time, the national meteorology institute INMET said. North of the state capital, Porto Alegre, 100 millimeters of rain is expected to fall in 24 hours. \u201cIt is important to highlight that the predicted volumes of rain may cause new disruptions in areas already affected previously,\u201d a statement from INMET read. The storms have affected more than 1.9 million people in Brazil, and displaced hundreds of thousands, many of whom are staying in temporary shelters. Over 140 people are still missing. Scenes of the devastating weather event have been beamed all over the world, including video footage of a horse that had to be rescued after being stranded for several days on a rooftop. The animal was rescued on Thursday by members of Sao Paulo\u2019s military. According to state run Agencia Brasil, the horse \u2013 which has been baptized on social media as Caramelo \u2013 was sedated prior to being placed on a boat as part of the rescue. It had been stuck on the roof for four days surrounded by flood water in the municipality of Canoas in the Brazilian state Rio Grande do Sul. Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva posted a video on X of the moment he learned of the horse\u2019s rescue. Agencia Brasil, the sate-run news agency, has reported the rescue of more than 2,000 animals since the floods impacted Rio Grande du Sol, including dogs, cats, chickens, and pigs. Uruguay has also been flooded by the storms. More than 1,300 people there have been displaced there, while thousands more are without electricity, the national emergency system said on Wednesday night, without specifying if there were casualties. There are growing concerns that gangs may take advantage of the abandoned homes and businesses. At least 47 people have been arrested for crimes related to the catastrophic floods, 41 of whom are suspected of looting establishments. Six were allged to have committed sexual abuse in shelters, Agencia Brasil reported. The record rainfall has been linked to El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate phenomenon that warms waters in the Pacific and tends to bring heavy rainfall to southern Brazil. Long-term global warming, caused primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, has also exacerbated extreme weather in the region. Rio Grande do Sul \u2014 Brazil\u2019s southernmost state, and until recently a tranquil agricultural region \u2014 has seen repeatedly extreme weather events in recent years. According to the state government, 19 billion Brazilians reals ($3.7 billion US dollars) will be needed for rebuilding.

{"id": "2024_05_08_asia_congressmen-letter-cnn-report-kabul-attack-intl", "text": "Nine Republican members of Congress have written to US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin urging him to explain discrepancies between CNN reporting last month about the ISIS-K attack that led to the deaths of 13 US servicemen and 170 Afghans outside Kabul airport in August 2021, and the conclusions of two Pentagon investigations into the incident. The CNN report revealed that there were many more episodes of gunfire than the Pentagon has ever admitted, in the wake of the suicide attack in the final days of the American evacuation of Kabul. The\u00a0reporting included a video obtained by CNN\u00a0captured by a Marine\u2019s GoPro camera that had not been seen publicly in full before. The letter was sent on Tuesday by congressmen on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and presented a series of pointed questions for the Pentagon about its investigations into what was the deadliest incident in Afghanistan for decades \u2013 a brutal, bloody end point to America\u2019s longest war. The eight congressmen, five of whom are veterans with experience in Afghanistan, urged Austin \u201cin the strongest possible terms to account for the discrepancy between the results of the (US Central Command) CENTCOM investigation and this new reporting,\u201d by CNN. Much of the controversy about the Pentagon\u2019s two investigations into the attack has focused on gunfire in the aftermath of the blast. Some Marines have told military investigators they felt they were being shot at or opened fire themselves, and 19 Afghan survivors told CNN in 2022 they were shot themselves or witnessed Afghans being shot. But the two Pentagon investigations \u2013 released in February 2022 and last month \u2013 concluded the only shooting in the aftermath came from US and UK troops in three bursts that were \u201cnearly simultaneous,\u201d and hit no one. In their letter, the members of Congress\u00a0said it is \u201cunclear what generated this CENTCOM data point of near-simultaneous gunfire\u201d in three bursts, which is \u201cdirectly contradicted by the video footage obtained by CNN, which shows 11 episodes of gunfire over nearly four minutes.\u201d They added that, after CNN published the GoPro footage, the Pentagon assured the House Foreign Affairs Committee that it had not seen the video prior to publication, but that the video did not contradict the findings of their investigations. \u201cWhile we appreciate CENTCOM\u2019s investigation into the Abbey Gate attack, nearly three years later we still have the same questions that the very US servicemembers captured in the CNN video had, including who was firing the rounds and whether it was the Taliban or another hostile force. We therefore ask you to clarify the volume, incidence, and sources of gunfire at the scene,\u201d the members of Congress wrote. The Congressmen \u2013 Mike Waltz, Darrell Issa, Tim Burchett, Brian Mast, Rich McCormick, Keith Self, Cory Mills and Chris Smith \u2013 requested further action by investigators. The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs committee, Rep. Michael McCaul, was added to the letter Wednesday, his office confirmed. CNN\u2019s most recent report included an interview with the former head of a major Kabul hospital, Dr. Sayed Ahmadi, who said he and his staff had pulled bullets out of patients from the incident and that over 70 of the dead at their hospital had gunshot wounds. The letter asks why the Pentagon\u2019s investigators did not speak to Dr. Ahmadi, or any other Afghans. The Pentagon has said all reports of gunshot wounds are mistaken, and that witnesses who recall extensive shooting \u2013 either at Marines or Afghan civilians \u2013 are suffering from the effects of blast concussion, or Traumatic Brain Injury. \u201cLastly, why do journalists have this video footage and the Department does not? Is there any more footage in the Department\u2019s possession that has not yet been made public? If so, please release such footage immediately and confirm that no more video recordings exist of which the Department is aware,\u201d they added. \u201cThe truth must come out.\u201d The Office of the Secretary of Defense told CNN in a statement that, as with all congressional correspondence, it would respond directly to the members who wrote the letter. \u201cWe honor the service and sacrifice of our thirteen service members who were killed at Abbey Gate and remain fully committed to ensuring our Gold Star families have the support and information they need. This will always be a sacred obligation for the Department of Defense,\u201d James Adams, a department spokesman, said. Parents accuse Pentagon of being misleading Growing Congressional scrutiny of the attack comes as the parents of seven Marines who died in the incident \u2013 Jared Schmitz, Humberto Sanchez, Taylor Hoover, Nicole Gee, Kareem Nikoui, Hunter Lopez and Rylee McCollum \u2013 accused the Pentagon of misleading them. \u201cAs parents, we have always had the suspicion that we were not told the entire truth of how our children were murdered at the Abbey Gate on 8/26/21. The recent discovery of new video released by CNN directly contradicts and exposes outright lies from our recent briefing last month from CENTCOM officials,\u201d the Gold Star families said in a statement they sent to CNN. \u201cWe are consumed with anger at the betrayal from the Biden Administration. This is only the beginning for us to expose the cover up that has and is still taking place. The Biden Administration wants us to go away silently, but we will not!\u201d they added. The new CENTCOM commander, Gen. Erik Kurilla, ordered in September last year a supplemental review of the military\u2019s 2022 investigation into the incident, and the families of dead servicemen were briefed last month on its results.\u00a0Its focus was mainly whether the ISIS-K suicide bomber could have been stopped and determined the attack \u201ccould not have been preventable at the tactical level.\u201d The families have long maintained more could have been done to stop the ISIS-K suicide bomber. The letter and statement emerged as CENTCOM released over a thousand pages of witness accounts and evidence from the supplemental review. The 1,214 pages offer a variety of accounts of the aftermath of the blast, some of which appear to support the supplemental review\u2019s conclusions. Yet others contain previously unseen witness testimony\u00a0of gunfire in the aftermath which\u00a0appears to\u00a0jar with\u00a0the two investigations\u2019\u00a0conclusions. Two apparent Marine accounts of the blast aftermath provide similar descriptions of a US personnel member being calmed down as he tried to load a .50-caliber heavy machine gun in a sniper tower that overlooked the blast site, and then apparently not firing the weapon. Names of the US personnel were redacted. One of the service members recalled: \u201cThe Marines on the ground were shooting towards the blast location. But I didn\u2019t see anyone shoot at us.\u201d He added the gunfire continued for \u201cprobably a few minutes,\u201d and then he recalled hearing: \u201csome Gy Sgt [Gunnery Sergeant] yelled up to the tower saying we were taking small arms fire and find them and f**king kill them. I\u2019m not sure of his name.\u201d Another eyewitness said he was inside the sniper tower above the blast site when two rounds hit the window in front of him and a third round narrowly missed him. The evidence also suggests the Pentagon may have more video footage than it has acknowledged in public. A service\u00a0member tells the review there were nine drones operational over the airport in the immediate aftermath of the blast, and that he watched feed from these drones for three hours. The Pentagon has released five edited minutes of footage from the aftermath. The account also says \u201cISR\u201d \u2013 likely a surveillance camera \u2013 was available at the scene shortly after the blast.

{"id": "2024_05_10_travel_oakland-airport-name-lawsuit-san-francisco", "text": "Oakland\u2019s airport has changed its name from \u201cMetropolitan Oakland International\u201d to \u201cSan Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport\u201d after a unanimous vote by the city\u2019s Board of Port Commissioners on Thursday \u2013 despite a trademark lawsuit from neighboring San Francisco. \u201cWith the new name, the Port aims to attract more nonstop destinations by boosting travelers\u2019 geographic awareness of the airport\u2019s location on the San Francisco Bay,\u201d the Port of Oakland said in a news release. \u201cThis renaming is important to the Port\u2019s broader efforts to strengthen and grow the airport as one of Oakland\u2019s important economic engines.\u201d While the Oakland airport is changing its\u00a0name, it will keep its three-letter code \u201cOAK,\u201d the release said. The board approved a plan to rename the airport on April 11. Following that vote, the City of San Francisco \u2013 which owns a trademark on \u201cSan Francisco International Airport\u201d \u2013 filed a lawsuit on April 18 to prevent the alleged infringement after it said it offered to work with Oakland on alternative names, the city attorney\u2019s office said. The federal suit alleges Oakland plans to \u201cintentionally and knowingly capitalize off of confusion.\u201d In Thursday\u2019s news release, Port Commission President Barbara Leslie said the board \u201ccame to these discussions with a shared love of Oakland and a desire to see our city and airport thrive.\u201d \u201cSince our initial vote, the Port has met with dozens of community leaders and stakeholders and heard their concerns. We are moving forward with a commitment to honoring our past while building a stronger, more inclusive future,\u201d Leslie said. On Tuesday, City Attorney of San Francisco David Chiu had urged the commissioners to reconsider the renaming, adding his office would otherwise move forward with the lawsuit. The city plans to seek a preliminary injunction, a news release from the City Attorney said, alleging the name change \u201cwill very likely cause widespread confusion, mishaps, and economic loss for travelers.\u201d \u201cThe renaming plan appears intentionally designed to divert travelers who may be unfamiliar with Bay Area geography and lead them to believe OAK has a business relationship with SFO, which it does not,\u201d the release said. Following Thursday\u2019s vote, City Attorney of San Francisco spokesperson Jen Kwart said in a statement, \u201cIt is disappointing that Oakland chose to ignore our multiple offers to collaborate on alternative names and avoid litigation. We have no choice but to move forward with next steps in our trademark lawsuit.\u201d The Port of Oakland said Thursday the name change aims to increase passenger growth as travelers may currently be unaware of the airport\u2019s proximity to the region\u2019s attractions, such as the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s universities, wine country, national laboratories and the cities of San Francisco and Berkeley. \u201cOAK is the closest major airport to 58 percent of the Bay Area population. The combined population of the counties closest to OAK is 4.1 million compared with 1.5 million in San Francisco and San Mateo counties,\u201d Interim Director of Aviation Craig Simon said in the release. \u201cThis designation will let the world know who we serve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/travel/oakland-airport-name-lawsuit-san-francisco/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_middleeast_israel-sde-teiman-detention-whistleblowers-intl-cmd", "text": "At a military base that now doubles as a detention center in Israel\u2019s Negev desert, an Israeli working at the facility snapped two photographs of a scene that he says continues to haunt him. Rows of men in gray tracksuits are seen sitting on paper-thin mattresses, ringfenced by barbed wire. All appear blindfolded, their heads hanging heavy under the glare of floodlights. A putrid stench filled the air and the room hummed with the men\u2019s murmurs, the Israeli who was at the facility told CNN. Forbidden from speaking to each other, the detainees mumbled to themselves. \u201cWe were told they were not allowed to move. They should sit upright. They\u2019re not allowed to talk. Not allowed to peek under their blindfold.\u201d Guards were instructed \u201cto scream uskot\u201d \u2013 shut up in Arabic \u2013 and told to \u201cpick people out that were problematic and punish them,\u201d the source added. CNN spoke to three Israeli whistleblowers who worked at the Sde Teiman desert camp, which holds Palestinians detained during Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza. All spoke out at risk of legal repercussions and reprisals from groups supportive of Israel\u2019s hardline policies in Gaza. They paint a picture of a facility where doctors sometimes amputated prisoners\u2019 limbs due to injuries sustained from constant handcuffing; of medical procedures sometimes performed by underqualified medics earning it a reputation for being \u201ca paradise for interns\u201d; and where the air is filled with the smell of neglected wounds left to rot. According to the accounts,\u00a0the facility some 18 miles from the Gaza frontier is split into two parts: enclosures where around 70 Palestinian detainees from Gaza\u00a0are placed under extreme physical restraint, and a field hospital where wounded detainees are strapped to their beds, wearing diapers\u00a0and fed through straws. \u201cThey stripped them down of anything that resembles human beings,\u201d said one whistleblower, who worked as a medic at the facility\u2019s field hospital. \u201c(The beatings) were not done to gather intelligence. They were done out of revenge,\u201d said another whistleblower. \u201cIt was punishment for what they (the Palestinians) did on October 7 and punishment for behavior in the camp.\u201d Responding to CNN\u2019s request for comment on all the allegations made in this report, the Israeli military, known as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said in a statement: \u201cThe IDF ensures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, MPCID (Military Police Criminal Investigation\u2019s Division) investigations are opened when there is suspicion of misconduct justifying such action.\u201d \u201cDetainees are handcuffed based on their risk level and health status. Incidents of unlawful handcuffing are not known to the authorities.\u201d The IDF did not directly deny accounts of people being stripped of their clothing or held in diapers. Instead, the Israeli military said that the detainees are given back their clothing once the IDF has determined that they pose no security risk. Reports of abuse\u00a0at Sde Teiman have already surfaced in Israeli and Arab media after an outcry from Israeli and Palestinian rights groups over conditions there. But this rare testimony from Israelis working at the facility sheds further light on Israel\u2019s conduct as it wages war in Gaza,\u00a0with fresh allegations of mistreatment.\u00a0It also casts more doubt on the Israeli government\u2019s repeated assertions that it acts in accordance with accepted international practices and law. CNN has requested permission from the Israeli military to access the Sde Teiman base. Last month, a CNN team covered a small protest outside its main gate staged by Israeli activists demanding the closure of the facility. Israeli security forces questioned the team for around 30 minutes there, demanding to see the footage taken by CNN\u2019s photojournalist. Israel often subjects reporters, even foreign journalists, to military censorship on security issues. Detained in the desert The Israeli military has acknowledged partially converting three different military facilities into detention camps for Palestinian detainees from Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel, in which Israeli authorities say about 1,200 were killed and over 250 were abducted, and the subsequent Israeli offensive in Gaza, killing nearly 35,000 people according to the strip\u2019s health ministry. These facilities are Sde Teiman in the Negev desert, as well as Anatot and Ofer military bases\u00a0in the occupied West Bank. The camps are part of the infrastructure of Israel\u2019s Unlawful Combatants Law, an amended legislation passed by the Knesset last December that expanded the military\u2019s authority to detain suspected militants. The law permits the military to detain people for 45 days without an arrest warrant, after which they must be transferred to Israel\u2019s formal prison system (IPS), where over 9,000 Palestinians are being held in conditions that rights groups say have drastically deteriorated since October 7. Two Palestinian prisoners associations said last week that 18 Palestinians \u2013 including leading Gaza surgeon Dr. Adnan al-Bursh \u2013 had died in Israeli custody over the course of the war. The military detention camps \u2013 where the number of inmates is unknown \u2013 serve as a filtration point during the arrest period mandated by the Unlawful Combatants Law. After their detention in the camps, those with suspected Hamas links are transferred to the IPS, while those whose militant ties have been ruled out are released back to Gaza. CNN interviewed over a dozen former Gazan detainees who appeared to have been released from those camps. They said they could not determine where they were held because they were blindfolded through most of their detention and cut off from the outside world. But the details of their accounts tally with those of the whistleblowers. \u201cWe looked forward to the night so we could sleep. Then we looked forward to the morning in hopes that our situation might change,\u201d said Dr. Mohammed al-Ran, recalling his detainment at a military facility where he said he endured desert temperatures, swinging from the heat of the day to the chill of night.\u00a0CNN interviewed him outside Gaza last month. Al-Ran, a Palestinian who holds Bosnian citizenship, headed the surgical unit at northern Gaza\u2019s Indonesian hospital, one of the first to be shut down and raided as Israel carried out its aerial, ground and naval offensive. He was arrested on December 18, he said, outside Gaza City\u2019s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, where he had been working for three days after fleeing his hospital in the heavily bombarded north. He was stripped down to his underwear, blindfolded and his wrists tied, then dumped in the back of a truck where, he said, the near-naked detainees were piled on top of one another as they were shuttled to a detention camp in the middle of the desert. The details in his account are consistent with those of dozens of others collected by CNN recounting the conditions of arrest in Gaza. His account is also supported by numerous images depicting mass arrests published on social media profiles belonging to Israeli soldiers. Many of those images show captive Gazans, their wrists or ankles tied by cables, in their underwear and blindfolded. Al-Ran was held in a military detention center for 44 days, he told CNN. \u201cOur days were filled with prayer, tears, and supplication. This eased our agony,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cWe cried and cried and cried. We cried for ourselves, cried for our nation, cried for our community, cried for our loved ones. We cried about everything that crossed our minds.\u201d A week into his imprisonment, the detention camp\u2019s authorities ordered him to act as an intermediary between the guards and the prisoners, a role known as Shawish, \u201csupervisor,\u201d in vernacular Arabic. According to the Israeli whistleblowers, a Shawish is normally a prisoner who has been cleared of suspected links to Hamas after interrogation. The Israeli military denied holding detainees unnecessarily, or using them for translation purposes. \u201cIf there is no reason for continued detention, the detainees are released back to Gaza,\u201d they said in a statement. However, whistleblower and detainee accounts \u2013 particularly pertaining to Shawish \u2013 cast doubt on the IDF\u2019s depiction of its clearing process. Al-Ran says that he served as Shawish for several weeks after he was cleared of Hamas links. Whistleblowers also said that the absolved Shawish served as intermediaries for some time. They are typically proficient in Hebrew, according to the eyewitnesses, enabling them to communicate the guards\u2019 orders to the rest of the prisoners in Arabic. For that, al-Ran said he was given a special privilege: his blindfold was removed. He said this was another kind of hell. \u201cPart of my torture was being able to see how people were being tortured,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first you couldn\u2019t see. You couldn\u2019t see the torture, the vengeance, the oppression. \u201cWhen they removed my blindfold, I could see the extent of the humiliation and abasement \u2026 I could see the extent to which they saw us not as human beings but as animals.\u201d Al-Ran\u2019s account of the forms of punishment he saw were corroborated by the whistleblowers who spoke with CNN. A prisoner who committed an offense such as speaking to another would be ordered to raise his arms above his head for up to an hour. The prisoner\u2019s hands would sometimes be zip-tied to a fence to ensure that he did not come out of the stress position. For those who repeatedly breached the prohibition on speaking and moving, the punishment became more severe. Israeli guards would sometimes take a prisoner to an area outside the enclosure and beat him aggressively, according to two whistleblowers and al-Ran. A whistleblower who worked as a guard said he saw a man emerge from a beating with his teeth, and some bones, apparently broken. That whistleblower and al-Ran also described a routine search when the guards would unleash large dogs on sleeping detainees, lobbing a sound grenade at the enclosure as troops barged in. Al-Ran called this \u201cthe nightly torture.\u201d \u201cWhile we were cabled, they unleashed the dogs that would move between us, and trample over us,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cYou\u2019d be lying on your belly, your face pressed against the ground. You can\u2019t move, and they\u2019re moving above you.\u201d The same whistleblower recounted the search in the same harrowing detail. \u201cIt was a special unit of the military police that did the so-called search,\u201d said the source. \u201cBut really it was an excuse to hit them. It was a terrifying situation.\u201d \u201cThere was a lot of screaming and dogs barking.\u201d Strapped to beds in a field hospital Whistleblower accounts portrayed a different kind of horror at the Sde Teiman field hospital. \u201cWhat I felt when I was dealing with those patients is an idea of total vulnerability,\u201d said one medic who worked at Sde Teiman. \u201cIf you imagine yourself being unable to move, being unable to see what\u2019s going on, and being completely naked, that leaves you completely exposed,\u201d the source said.\u00a0 \u201cI think that\u2019s something that borders on, if not crosses to, psychological torture.\u201d Another whistleblower said he was ordered to perform medical procedures on the Palestinian detainees for which he was not qualified. \u201cI was asked to learn how to do things on the patients, performing minor medical procedures that are totally outside my expertise,\u201d he said, adding that this was frequently done without anesthesia. \u201cIf they complained about pain, they would be given paracetamol,\u201d he said, using another name for acetaminophen. \u201cJust being there felt like being complicit in abuse.\u201d The same whistleblower also said he witnessed an amputation performed on a man who had sustained injuries caused by the constant zip-tying of his wrists. The account tallied with details of\u00a0a letter authored by a doctor\u00a0working at Sde Teiman published by Ha\u2019aretz in April. \u201cFrom the first days of the medical facility\u2019s operation until today, I have faced serious ethical dilemmas,\u201d said the letter addressed to Israel\u2019s attorney general, and its health and defense ministries, according to Ha\u2019aretz. \u201cMore than that, I am writing (this letter) to warn you that the facilities\u2019 operations do not comply with a single section among those dealing with health in the Incarceration of Unlawful Combatants Law.\u201d An IDF spokesperson denied the allegations reported by Ha\u2019aretz in a written statement to CNN at the time, saying that medical procedures were conducted with \u201cextreme care\u201d and in accordance with Israeli and international law. The spokesperson added that the handcuffing of the detainees was done in \u201caccordance with procedures, their health condition and the level of danger posed by them,\u201d and that any allegation of violence would be examined. Whistleblowers also said that medical team were told to refrain from signing medical documents, corroborating previous reporting by rights group Physicians for Human Rights in Israel (PHRI). The PHRI report released in April warned of \u201ca serious concern that anonymity is employed to prevent the possibility of investigations or complaints regarding breaches of medical ethics and professionalism.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t sign anything, and there is no verification of authority,\u201d said the same whistleblower who said he lacked the appropriate training for the treatment he was asked to administer. \u201cIt is a paradise for interns because it\u2019s like you do whatever you want.\u201d CNN also requested comment from the Israeli health ministry on the allegations in this report. The ministry referred CNN back to the IDF. Concealed from the outside world Sde Teiman and other military detention camps have been shrouded in secrecy since their inception. Israel has repeatedly refused requests to disclose the number of detainees held at the facilities, or to reveal the whereabouts of Gazan prisoners. Last Wednesday, the Israeli Supreme Court held a hearing in response to a petition brought forward by Israeli rights group, HaMoked, to reveal the location of a Palestinian X-Ray technician detained from Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza in February. It was the first court session of its kind since October 7. Israel\u2019s highest court had previously rejected writs of habeas corpus filed on behalf of dozens of Palestinians from Gaza held in unknown locations. The disappearances \u201callows for the atrocities that we\u2019ve been hearing about to happen,\u201d said Tal Steiner, an Israeli human rights lawyer and executive director of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel. \u201cPeople completely disconnected from the outside world are the most vulnerable to torture and mistreatment,\u201d Steiner said in an interview with CNN. Satellite images provide further insight into activities at Sde Teiman, revealing that in the months since the start of the\u00a0Israel-Hamas war on October 7, more than 100 new structures, including large tents and hangars, have been built at the desert camp. A comparison of aerial photographs from September 10, 2023 and March 1 this year also showed a significant increase in the number of vehicles at the facility, indicating an uptick in activity. Satellite imagery from two dates in early December showed construction work in progress. CNN also geolocated the two leaked photographs showing the enclosure holding the group of blindfolded men in gray tracksuits. The pattern of panels seen on the roof matched those of a large hangar visible in satellite imagery. The structure, which resembles an animal pen, is located in the central area of the Sde Teiman compound. It is an older structure seen among new buildings which have appeared since the war began. CNN reviewed satellite images from two other military detention camps \u2013 Ofer and Anatot bases in the occupied West Bank \u2013 and did not detect expansion in the grounds since October 7. Several rights groups and legal experts say they believe that Sde Teiman, which is the nearest to Gaza, likely hosts the largest number of detainees of the three military detention camps. \u201cI was there for 23 days. Twenty-three days that felt like 100 years,\u201d said 27-year-old Ibrahim Yassine on the day of his release from a military detention camp. He was lying in a crowded room with over a dozen newly freed men \u2013 they were still in the grey tracksuit prison uniforms. Some had deep flesh wounds from where the handcuffs had been removed. \u201cWe were handcuffed and blindfolded,\u201d said another man, 43-year-old Sufyan Abu Salah. \u201cToday is the first day I can see.\u201d Several had a glassy look in their eyes and were seemingly emaciated. One elderly man breathed through an oxygen machine as he lay on a stretcher. Outside the hospital, two freed men from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society embraced their colleagues. For Dr. Al-Ran, his reunion with his friends was anything but joyful. The experience, he said, rendered him mute for a month as he battled an \u201cemotional deadness.\u201d \u201cIt was very painful. When I was released, people expected me to miss them, to embrace them. But there was a gap,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cThe people who were with me at the detention facility became my family. Those friendships were the only things that belonged to us.\u201d Just before his release, a fellow prisoner had called out to him, his voice barely rising above a whisper, al-Ran said. He asked the doctor to find his wife and kids in Gaza. \u201cHe asked me to tell them that it is better for them to be martyrs,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cIt is better for them to die than to be captured and held here.\u201d CreditsExecutive producer: Barbara ArvanitidisSenior investigations writer: Tamara QiblawiChief global affairs correspondent: Matthew ChanceOSINT reporter: Allegra GoodwinPhotojournalist: Alex PlattReporters: Abeer Salman, Ami Kaufman, Kareem Khadder, Mohammad Al Sawalhi and Tareq Al HilouVisual and graphic editors: Carlotta Dotto, Lou Robinson and Mark Oliver3D designer: Tom JamesPhoto editor: Sarah TilottaVideo editors: Mark Baron, Julie Zink and Augusta AnthonyMotion designers: Patrick Gallagher and Yukari SchrickelDigital editors: Laura Smith-Spark and Eliza MackintoshExecutive editors: Dan Wright and Matt Wells ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/middleeast/israel-sde-teiman-detention-whistleblowers-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_africa_prince-harry-meghan-nigerian-visit-intl-scli", "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex landed in Nigeria on Friday, launching a three-day private visit to the West African nation, where they will meet with wounded soldiers and visit local charities, officials said. The Sussexes are visiting the country as it\u2019s now a \u201cpart of the Invictus community,\u201d Air Vice-Marshal Abidemi Marquis, director of sports for the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, said during a media briefing Thursday. Their first engagement was an event hosted at a school in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, where Meghan told students: \u201cI see myself in all of you.\u201d Outside the Lightway Academy, students lined up patiently to welcome the royal couple, alongside a troupe of dancers. They were there to kick off a two-day mental health summit run by the GEANCO Foundation, which supports girls and young women across the country with menstrual health products and education. \u201cWe\u2019re so honored to be with you. We have got to acknowledge those amazing dance moves! My husband was excited to jump up!\u201d Meghan told cheering students in the school\u2019s hall. Harry then jumped into the conversation, asking the children about their knowledge of mental health and reminding them to look after themselves and each other. \u201cWill you promise to us that after today, no more being scared, no more being unsure of mental health. If you are unsure, then ask. Ask your teachers. Ask your friends. Be there for one another,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see your friend in your class not smiling, what are you gonna do? You gonna check in with them? Are you gonna ask him if they\u2019re okay? \u2018cause it\u2019s okay not to be okay.\u201d As they were leaving, the couple were given a traditional wooden mask and a set of books about Nigerian heritage. \u201cI need to read these now,\u201d the duchess added. Prince Harry and Meghan were invited to Nigeria by the chief of defense staff, Christopher Musa, the country\u2019s highest-ranking military official. He formally welcomed them to Nigeria at a meeting Friday lunchtime at the defense headquarters in the heart of Abuja. The duke expressed gratitude to their hosts, commending Nigeria for recognizing the power of sport in the rehabilitation process for the injured or wounded. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first country to notice that it not only transforms lives but saves lives. I\u2019m eternally grateful to you all of you for joining the Invictus movement for Nigeria and for every single soul who\u2019s been injured protecting the freedoms of Nigeria,\u201d he said. Marquis said the duchess was keen to accompany her husband on the visit \u201cas part of her lineage and heritage.\u201d Meghan revealed in 2022 that she discovered she was 43% Nigerian from a genealogy test. The trip to Nigeria sparked a wave of excitement among the public when it was announced two weeks ago. Oyeyemi Aderibigbe, 38, a Lagos-based lawyer, told CNN, \u201cI have watched Harry\u2019s evolution and quest for personal expression\u2026 and I love how bold he is about living authentically. Meghan was my favorite character in the \u2018Suits\u2019 series. I love how she has spent so much time using her voice for good, openly sharing her experiences.\u201d \u201cTogether, they are using their influence to democratize opportunity and push causes for the advantage of underrepresented groups. I would love to see them at an event with young people in politics in Nigeria,\u201d she added. Entrepreneur Ife Durosinmi-Etti spoke of her joy that Meghan was \u201ccoming to a place that she\u2019s absolutely loved and welcomed.\u201d \u201cIt got me all giddy when I found out about her Nigerian heritage because Nigerian women are smart, resilient, multitalented, they go after what they want and that\u2019s exactly how I see her, so when I heard; I was like, \u2018Yup, that\u2019s it, it\u2019s the Nigerian Spirit in her,\u2019\u201d the 35-year-old said. A packed itinerary This is the Sussexes\u2019 first trip as a couple to Nigeria, where they will be heavily promoting Invictus as well as the themes of mental health and female empowerment.  Harry flew to Abuja after a quick visit to London, where he attended events marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games, a Paralympics-style event for wounded, injured and sick military personnel and veterans. Meghan flew in from Los Angeles, and together, they are following a busy schedule, which includes visiting a military rehabilitation center and local organizations dedicated to supporting veterans\u2019 welfare. On Saturday, the duke is also scheduled to join wounded veterans during a sitting volleyball game and later, his wife is expected to co-host a women\u2019s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director-general of the World Trade Organization. As it has been described as a private visit, the royal couple will not be meeting with Nigeria\u2019s president, Bola Tinubu. However, they will meet with the governors of Lagos and Kaduna State. The UK\u2019s high commissioner to Nigeria, Richard Montgomery, told local media that there wouldn\u2019t be a meeting with the Nigerian leader because \u201cthey are visiting in a private capacity, not an official one.\u201d Profound challenges Nigeria\u2019s military personnel face profound challenges, particularly as the country has been combating the Boko Haram insurgency since 2009. On Friday, Musa told the couple more about some of the issues \u2013 like terrorism and criminality \u2013 that the armed forces contend with, adding that IEDs present \u201cthe greatest challenge\u201d for them. In response, the duke shared that he was looking forward to visiting a hospital supporting military personnel in Kaduna, a city in the north of the country. The couple\u2019s hosts, the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, are eager to be involved further in the Invictus Games and to be part of the wider Invictus community. Recalling how the most recent games, which were held in Germany last year, saw Nigeria become the first African country to participate, Harry reminisced: \u201cThe team that turned up in D\u00fcsseldorf was small but mighty. They danced their way into the stage. They won medals and danced off the stage. They were the life and soul of those games. Our goal now is to help you grow that team and provide as much opportunity and resource here in Nigeria and for the games that are coming at the beginning of next year.\u201d Marquis said taking part in the Invictus Games recovery program has boosted the morale of Nigerian soldiers and Nigeria has expressed interest in hosting the games, which take place every two years. He added: \u201cEighty percent of our soldiers involved in these recovery programs have a better outlook in life and say it has given them the opportunity to improve their self-esteem and mental health.\u201d Cpl. Effiom Antigha, captain of Team Nigeria, told CNN last year that the games gave him a new lease on life. \u201cBefore now, I didn\u2019t think I could engage myself in any of these sporting activities.

In a televised address,\u00a0President Yoon Suk Yeol\u00a0said he would ask for parliament\u2019s cooperation to establish the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter-planning. \u201cWe will mobilize all of the nation\u2019s capabilities to overcome the low birth rate, which can be considered a national emergency,\u201d he said. Speaking later in his first news conference since August 2022, held to mark two years in office, Yoon admitted his administration had fallen short in its efforts to improve people\u2019s lives. He pledged to use the next three years of his term to improve the economy and address low births. South Korea has the world\u2019s lowest fertility rate, which indicates the average number of children a woman will have in her lifetime. It recorded a rate of just 0.72 in 2023 \u2013 down from 0.78 the previous year, the latest drop in a long string of yearly declines. Countries need a fertility\u00a0rate\u00a0of 2.1 to maintain a stable population, in the absence of immigration. The data underscores the demographic time bomb that South Korea and other East Asian nations are facing as their societies rapidly age just a few decades after their rapid industrialization. Many European nations also face aging populations, but the speed and impact of that change is mitigated by immigration. Countries like South Korea, Japan and China, however, have shied away from mass immigration to tackle the decline in their working age populations. Experts say the reasons for these demographic shifts across the region include demanding work cultures, stagnating wages, rising costs of living, changing attitudes toward marriage and gender equality, and rising disillusionment among younger generations. But despite the economic factors at play, throwing money at the problem has proved ineffective. In 2022, Yoon admitted that\u00a0more than $200 billion\u00a0has been spent trying to boost the population over the past 16 years. Initiatives like extending paid paternity leave, offering monetary \u201cbaby vouchers\u201d to new parents, and social campaigns encouraging men to contribute to childcare and housework, have so far failed to reverse the trend. Experts and residents have instead pointed to some deeper-rooted social issues \u2013 for instance, stigma against single parents, discrimination against non-traditional partnerships, and barriers for same-sex couples. The Japanese government has tried a similar playbook to encourage couples to have children, to no avail \u2013 prompting the country\u2019s leader to take urgent action in recent years. In January 2023, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warned that Japan was \u201con the brink of not being able to maintain social functions\u201d due to the falling birth rate, and announced plans for a new government agency to focus on the issue. That body, the Child and Families Agency, launched a few months later \u2013 intended to tackle a host of issues, from improving children\u2019s health and welfare to supporting families and parents, according to its website. These measures, ranging from boosting childcare services and providing places for children to play and live, aim to \u201covercome the declining birthrate\u201d and create a society where people \u201cfeel hopeful about getting married, having children, and raising them,\u201d the website says.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/asia/south-korea-government-population-birth-rate-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_04_uk_sadiq-khan-london-mayor-election-gbr-intl", "text": "Sadiq Khan has won a third term as London\u2019s mayor, capping a round of local elections across England that confirmed the political supremacy of the Labour Party and spelt misery for Britain\u2019s Conservative government. Khan won 43.7% of the vote, beating Conservative challenger Susan Hall by about 11 percentage points to extend his control of the capital that began in 2016. It follows a string of victories around England for Labour, who are firmly positioned to take power from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his Conservatives in a general election in the coming months. The Conservatives lost control of 10 local councils and nearly 500 councilors on Thursday, suffering an electoral drubbing at the hands of the public that virtually everyone \u2013 including those within the party \u2013 had expected. Labour leader Keir Starmer told reporters on Saturday: \u201cI am sorry, I don\u2019t care which political party you support, if you leave your country in a worse state than when you found it 14 years later, you do not deserve to be in Government for a moment longer.\u201d But Sunak likely found enough slender scraps of success to withstand a challenge to his leadership, which rebellious Tories had threatened depending on the outcome of Thursday\u2019s elections. The party was hoping to keep hold of the mayoral position in the West Midlands on Saturday, after previously holding the same position in the Tees Valley, giving the increasingly beleaguered Sunak something to seize onto as he looks to at least unify his lawmakers in Westminster. Thursday\u2019s polls marked a final dry run before the general election, which must take place by January. Sunak has resisted calls to outline when he will hold that vote, and Labour leads opinion polls by a huge margin. Starmer\u2019s opposition party won control of eight councils, and also stormed to victory on Thursday in a Westminster by-election in Blackpool. The results confirmed the conventional polling narrative that the group is on track to win power, though Labour could not quite pull off the barnstorming red wave that some in the party had hoped for, falling short in some of the trickiest contests it faced. And there were indications too that discontent among the party\u2019s position on Israel\u2019s war in Gaza hurt Labour among voters in areas with large Muslim populations. In particular the loss of Oldham council, a north-west English town, where around a quarter of the population is Muslim. \u201cWe do recognise the strength of feeling that there is and of course we will continue to work just as we do in every area across the country to earn votes back in future,\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, told the BBC. If his victory is confirmed, Khan would become the first mayor of London to serve a third term since the post was created in 2000. The city, home to nine million people, is more multicultural, liberal and pro-European than the UK as a whole, leading Khan to occasionally clash with successive Labour leaders, especially over the issue of Brexit. He has prioritised emissions-cutting policies in an effort to shed the city\u2019s reputation as a major polluter, and made international headlines during a long-running public spat with former US President Donald Trump during his administration. But critics have attacked Khan\u2019s record on knife crime and his recent expansion of a world-first low-emissions zone, which the Conservatives said would hit poorer families in outer London the hardest.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/04/uk/sadiq-khan-london-mayor-election-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

Polling station staff were forced to turn the former prime minister away as he tried to cast his ballot in South Oxfordshire on Thursday, PA media reported. Johnson returned later with the necessary ID and was able to vote. New rules requiring photo ID to vote were introduced by Johnson\u2019s Conservative government in the Elections Act 2022. The law was widely criticized when it was introduced. The UK\u2019s Electoral Commission warned in 2023 that the law could exclude hundreds of thousands of people from voting and particularly impact the unemployed or members of ethnic minorities.  A report by a cross-party group of members of Parliament warned in March that millions of voters face being disenfranchised at the next general election due to the country\u2019s electoral registration system. It said the voter ID requirement \u201cleft individuals without the right ID being prevented from voting and only a number of forms of ID being permitted.\u201d Among those turned away from polling stations Thursday was army veteran Adam Diver, who said he was \u201cgutted\u201d when he was unable to vote his veterans\u2019 ID card was not accepted. Veterans minister Johnny Mercer apologized to Diver. \u201cThe legislation on acceptable forms of ID came out before the veterans ID cards started coming out in January this year. I will do all I can to change it before the next one,\u201d Mercer said. Local elections were held across the country for more than 100 councils and several mayors Thursday. With around a third of the results declared, the loss of more than 100 seats on local councils and one parliamentary seat in a by-election suggest that national polls in which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his party trail by a distance are correct. The results also mean that if a general election were held tomorrow, the opposition Labour Party would almost certainly win power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/uk/uk-local-election-boris-johnson-id-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_08_middleeast_rafah-israel-idf-ground-operation-intl-latam", "text": "Israel\u2019s attack in the southern Gaza city of Rafah has expanded from airstrikes to ground operations, new satellite images obtained by CNN from Planet Labs show. The images, which bear a striking resemblance to the early stages of Israel\u2019s ground invasion of Gaza last year, show the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are active outside of the immediate border crossing area between Egypt and Gaza, which Israel took control of on Monday evening. The images, which span from May 5 to 7, suggest some buildings have been bulldozed and show what appear to be mustering areas for IDF vehicles. Some of the IDF forces have penetrated more than a mile inside the Palestinian enclave from the Rafah crossing gate, the images also show. The build-up comes despite intense international pressure on Israel not to move in on Rafah. On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden for the first time said he would halt some shipments of American weapons should Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu order a major invasion of the city. These Israeli ground operations follow a series of airstrikes on Rafah that have completely destroyed several buildings in the past 24 hours, and killed at least four people, according to a local hospital. Satellite images suggest these strikes are continuing, with one picture showing smoke still rising from one location. People could be seen running through the streets of Rafah in the aftermath of a strike on Wednesday in other footage obtained by CNN. Several carried children in their arms, some apparently bleeding and unconscious, towards Al Kuwaiti\u00a0hospital. CNN footage also showed panicked children arriving in ambulances without their parents and one barely responsive child with a heavily bandaged arm being carried on a stretcher. Two body bags were also visible outside the hospital. Four people were killed and around two dozen injured by Israeli airstrikes in the Tal Al Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah on Wednesday, the hospital said. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the incident. Tell-tale signs Rafah has become the central focus of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, as Netanyahu faces\u00a0growing pressure\u00a0from the extreme wing of his coalition to launch a full-scale ground operation in the city to destroy Hamas, while the more moderate wing has urged him to prioritize securing a\u00a0ceasefire-for-hostages deal. During nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel\u2019s destruction of much of the strip\u2019s north. Gazans began fleeing the densely populated city on Monday after Israel\u2019s military\u00a0issued a call\u00a0for residents in the east of Rafah to\u00a0\u201cevacuate immediately.\u201d In the satellite images, some areas in Rafah show the tell-tale signs of being razed by bulldozers and other heavy machinery \u2013 vehicle tracks and large swaths of disturbed earth. The new operations shown by the satellite images resemble the initial ground invasion of Gaza back in October 2023, and in other parts of the enclave since then: When the IDF moved into northern Gaza, it carried out a series of airstrikes shortly before moving ground forces in. Once IDF ground forces did move in, armored bulldozers worked with tanks and other military vehicles to bulldoze and raze buildings. The IDF said in a statement on Wednesday that it was conducting a \u201cprecise counterterrorism operation in specific areas of eastern Rafah,\u201d which included \u201ctargeted raids.\u201d It also claimed to have \u201celiminated terrorists and uncovered terrorist infrastructure, as well as underground shafts in several locations in the eastern Rafah area.\u201d The IDF has released footage of its 401st Brigade Combat team conducting \u201coperational raids on suspicious buildings\u201d near to where it said its soldiers had been fired on by Hamas militants. The IDF said that during the operation it \u201celiminated about 30 terrorists and destroyed large amounts of terrorist infrastructure in the region.\u201d CNN previously confirmed through hospital sources in Rafah that at least 35 people had died in Rafah since Monday evening, including seven women and nine children. More than 34,600 people have been killed in Gaza since October, according to Palestinian authorities in Gaza. Aid agencies have been warning Israel against launching a full-scale ground invasion of Rafah, saying \u201cany ground operation would mean more suffering and death\u201d for the 1.2 million displaced Palestinians sheltering in and around the city, OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke told journalists in Geneva. Northern Gaza is already experiencing a \u201cfull-blown famine\u201d which is rapidly spreading across the strip, the World Food Programme warned over the weekend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/middleeast/rafah-israel-idf-ground-operation-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_climate_direct-air-capture-plant-iceland-climate-intl", "text": "The \u201cworld\u2019s largest\u201d plant designed to suck planet-heating pollution out of the atmosphere like a giant vacuum began operating in Iceland on Wednesday. \u201cMammoth\u201d is the second commercial direct air capture plant opened by Swiss company Climeworks in the country, and is 10 times bigger than its predecessor, Orca, which started running in 2021. Direct air capture, or DAC, is a technology designed to suck in air and strip out the carbon using chemicals. The carbon can then be injected deep beneath the ground, reused or transformed into solid products. Climeworks plans to transport the carbon underground where it will be naturally transformed into stone, locking up the carbon permanently. It is partnering with Icelandic company Carbfix for this so-called sequestration process. The whole operation will be powered by Iceland\u2019s abundant, clean geothermal energy. Next-gen climate solutions like DAC are gaining more attention from governments and private industry as humans continue to burn fossil fuels. Concentrations of planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2023. As the planet continues to heat up \u2014 with devastating consequences for humans and nature \u2014 many scientists say the world needs to find ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere in addition to rapidly cutting fossil fuels. But carbon removal technologies such as DAC are still controversial. They have been criticized as expensive, energy-hungry and unproven at scale. Some climate advocates are also concerned they could distract from policies to cut fossil fuels. This technology \u201cis fraught with uncertainties and ecological risks,\u201d said Lili Fuhr, director of the fossil economy program at the Center for International Environmental Law, speaking about carbon capture generally. Climeworks started building Mammoth in June 2022, and the company says it is the world\u2019s largest such plant. It has a modular design with space for 72 \u201ccollector containers\u201d \u2014 the vacuum parts of the machine that capture carbon from the air \u2014 which can be stacked on top of each other and moved around easily. There are currently 12 of these in place with more due to be added over the next few months. Mammoth will be able to pull 36,000 tons of carbon from the atmosphere a year at full capacity, according to Climeworks. That\u2019s equivalent to taking around 7,800 gas-powered cars off the road for a year. Climeworks did not give an exact cost for each ton of carbon removed, but said it was closer to $1,000 a ton than $100 a ton \u2013 the latter of which is widely seen as a key threshold for making the technology affordable and viable. As the company scales up the size of its plants and bring costs down, the aim is to reach $300 to $350 a ton by 2030 before hitting $100 a ton around 2050, said Jan Wurzbacher, co-founder and co-CEO of Climeworks, on a call with reporters. The new plant is \u201can important step in the fight against climate change,\u201d said Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh. It will increase the size of equipment to capture carbon pollution. But, he cautioned, it\u2019s still a tiny fraction of what\u2019s needed. All the carbon removal equipment in the world is only capable of removing around 0.01 million metric tons of carbon a year, a far cry from the 70 million tons a year needed by 2030 to meet global climate goals, according to the International Energy Agency. There are already much bigger DAC plants in the works from other companies. Stratos, currently under construction in Texas, for example, is designed to remove 500,000 tons of carbon a year, according to Occidental, the oil company behind the plant. But there may be a catch. Occidental says the captured carbon will be stored in rock deep underground, but its website also refers to the company\u2019s use of captured carbon in a process called \u201cenhanced oil recovery.\u201d This involves pushing carbon into wells to force out the hard-to-reach remnants of oil \u2014 allowing fossil fuel companies to extract even more from aging oil fields. It\u2019s this kind of process that makes some critics concerned carbon removal technologies could be used to prolong production of fossil fuels. But for Climeworks, which is not connected to fossil fuel companies, the technology has huge potential, and the company says it has big ambitions. Jan Wurzbacher, the company\u2019s co-founder and co-CEO, said Mammoth is just the latest stage in Climeworks\u2019 plan to scale up to 1 million tons of carbon removal a year by 2030 and 1 billion tons by 2050. Plans include potential DAC plants in Kenya and the United States.

{"id": "2024_05_08_world_boeing-starliner-new-launch-date-scn", "text": "The long-awaited first crewed mission of Boeing\u2019s Starliner spacecraft will be delayed for more than a week after engineers identified an issue that halted launch preparations on Monday. Starliner\u2019s next opportunity to lift off on its maiden voyage from NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida is at 6:16 p.m. ET on May 17. Veteran NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore had already taken their seats aboard the Starliner capsule when the operations team called for a scrub Monday night about two hours before launch. The decision came after the United Launch Alliance team, which assembled the Atlas V rocket that Starliner will ride to space, identified an issue with a valve on the second stage, or upper portion, of the rocket. Occasionally, valves can get into a position where they start to \u201cbuzz\u201d by oscillating, or opening and closing rapidly, said Tory Bruno, CEO of United Launch Alliance. Some buzzing is OK, but too much could cause the valve to fail, Bruno added. After safely removing Williams and Wilmore from the Starliner capsule Monday night, the United Launch Alliance team experimented with opening and closing the source of the buzz, a pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank of the rocket\u2019s upper stage. More oscillations occurred during the process to remove fuel from the rocket. The team conducted a thorough review of the valve on Tuesday. \u201cAfter evaluating the valve history, data signatures from the launch attempt, and assessing the risks relative to continued use, the ULA team determined the valve exceeded its qualification and mission managers agreed to remove and replace the valve,\u201d according to an update NASA shared. The decision to replace the valve means that the rocket will need to be rolled back from the launchpad on Wednesday and into the Vertical Integration Facility at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. While replacing the valve, the team will also conduct leak checks and other functional checkouts to ensure the rocket is ready for a potential May 17 launch attempt. Meanwhile, Wilmore and Williams will stay in crew quarters at Kennedy Space Center and remain in quarantine before the launch to protect their health. Why this launch is so important Before the valve issue arose, Starliner \u2014 which Boeing designed to rival SpaceX\u2019s prolific Crew Dragon capsule \u2014 was set to take off for its inaugural crewed test run at 10:34 p.m. ET Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. This mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could be the final major milestone before NASA deems Boeing\u2019s spacecraft ready for routine operations as part of the federal agency\u2019s Commercial Crew Program. The Starliner would join SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon in NASA\u2019s push to collaborate with private industry partners, expanding US options for ferrying astronauts to the International Space Station. Williams and Wilmore have each ventured to space on two previous journeys aboard the NASA space shuttle and Russian Soyuz missions. \u201cThey\u2019re checking out a lot of the systems: the life support, the manual control,\u201d NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said during a Friday news conference. \u201cThat\u2019s why we put two test pilots on board \u2014 and of course the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of Butch and Suni are extensive.\u201d The launch would mark only the sixth maiden voyage of a crewed spacecraft in US history, Nelson noted: \u201cIt started with Mercury, then with Gemini, then with Apollo, the space shuttle, then (SpaceX\u2019s) Dragon \u2014 and now Starliner.\u201d Williams will also become the first woman to join such a mission. What to expect If all goes according to plan following the launch, the spacecraft \u2014 carrying the astronauts \u2014 will break away from the Atlas V rocket after reaching orbit and begin firing its own engines. The Starliner will then spend more than 24 hours gradually making its way to the space station. Williams and Wilmore are set to spend about a week aboard the orbiting laboratory, joining the seven astronauts and cosmonauts already on board, while the Starliner remains docked outside. The two will then return home aboard the same Starliner capsule, which is expected to parachute to a landing at one of several designated locations across the southwestern United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/world/boeing-starliner-new-launch-date-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_sport_bayer-leverkusen-unbeaten-record-europa-league-spt-intl", "text": "Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s remarkable season took another extraordinary turn on Thursday as a late 2-2 draw against AS Roma stretched the club\u2019s unbeaten run to 49 games. The 4-2 aggregate victory saw Leverkusen reach a first European final in 22 years, while Josip\u00a0Stani\u0161i\u0107\u2019s 97th-minute strike ensured that the recently-crowned German champion remains undefeated this season. It means that Leverkusen has now surpassed Portuguese team Benfica\u2019s record from 1963-65 for the longest unbeaten run across all top-level matches since the introduction of European competitions,\u00a0according to UEFA. Leverkusen had come into the second-leg match at the BayArena with a two-goal lead, though that advantage was cancelled out when Leandro Paredes converted two penalties for Roma either side of halftime. The home side dominated possession throughout but struggled to capitalize on several good chances, and it wasn\u2019t until the 82nd minute that Gianluca Mancini\u2019s unfortunate own goal offered hope of a comeback. Then in the dying moments, with the likelihood of a draw quickly fading, Stani\u0161i\u0107\u00a0made a brilliant run into the box and slotted the ball into the net with the final act of the game, sparking bedlam inside the sellout stadium. Late goals have become something of a habit for Leverkusen, and this was the 17th time this season that the Bundesliga team has scored in the 90th minute or later. \u201cTo show that personality, that reaction after the second goal, to keep going and after to come back \u2013 it means a lot for us,\u201d manager Xabi Alonso said after the game. \u201cIt says a lot about the team, the conviction that\u00a0we have and it\u2019s great to finally reach the final. Last year we were really close but this year we\u2019re happy (to be) in the final and now against another Italian team.\u201d Leverkusen will face Atalanta in the Europa League final on May 22 in Dublin, Ireland, and has four games remaining to complete the season without defeat. Having already ended a 31-year trophy drought by winning a first German league title, Leverkusen can still win two more pieces of silverware this season \u2013 the Europa League and the German Cup \u2013 against Atlanta and second-tier side FC Kaiserslautern. Completing an invincible treble while remaining undefeated would certainly go down as one of greatest achievements by a European soccer club, and Leverkusen could become the first team in Bundesliga history to go a whole season without a loss if it wins its final two league matches against VfL Bochum and Augsburg. According to UEFA, Scottish side Celtic\u2019s unbeaten run of 62 games between 1915 and 1917 is the outright record for a European club, although that only included domestic league matches. \u201cIt\u2019s pure goosebumps,\u201d said Leverkusen midfielder Granit Xhaka after Thursday\u2019s game. \u201cYou dream of an atmosphere like this. You dream of games like this. As a kid, you want to be in these games and then when you equalize just before the end and get to the final, it\u2019s incredible. We will definitely enjoy this night now.\u201d Leverkusen, which has won 40 games and drawn nine this season, resumes its incredible campaign away against Bochum on Sunday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/sport/bayer-leverkusen-unbeaten-record-europa-league-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

The installations are the latest in a series of portals built by Gylys, with the first pair opening in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius and the Polish city of Lublin in 2021. The Dublin portal will also connect with other installations in Lithuania and Poland from July onwards, said de R\u00f3iste in the statement. This is not the first time that an artist has brought New Yorkers closer to people across the Atlantic. In 2008, British artist Paul St. George linked the city with London via his Telectroscope, which similarly allowed people in New York to communicate visually with those in the British capital. However, in this case the device responsible was a Telectroscope, a brass and wood device which measured an 11.2-meter-(37 feet) long by 3.3-meter-(11 feet) tall.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/style/art-installation-dublin-new-york-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

The police probe comes as the world\u2019s most populous nation votes in a mammoth weeks-long election\u00a0in which Modi\u2019s Hindu-nationalist party is widely expected to secure a rare third consecutive term. The party has long denied being anti-Islam but opposition politicians and prominent Muslims have warned that its leaders have been deploying openly divisive rhetoric to turbo-charge their campaign. According to a police report seen by CNN on Tuesday, Karnataka state police are investigating whether local BJP leader\u00a0B. Y. Vijayendra and the unnamed holder of the party\u2019s official local X account \u201cpromoted enmity\u201d between religious groups\u00a0after the clip was posted online on May 4. The 17-second animation depicts leaders of India\u2019s main opposition Congress party giving benefits to Muslims, alongside a caption in the local Kannada language: \u201cBeware\u2026 Beware\u2026 Beware\u2026!\u201d It shows caricatures of Congress\u2019s national leader Rahul Gandhi and its Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah feeding\u00a0\u201cfunds\u201d to a large bird wearing a Muslim skullcap, while giving nothing to three smaller birds portraying other marginalized minorities. The large bird then kicks the other birds out of their nest as the Congress politicians laugh. The video was removed Wednesday after a request to X from India\u2019s Election Commission to take it down. CNN has reached out to Vijayendra, the BJP and X for comment. Critics said\u00a0Congress\u2019 manifesto makes no mention of redistributing wealth to Muslims, while Congress lawmaker Manickam Tagore said the video was a \u201cblatant demonization of minorities by ruling BJP,\u201d and urged the Election Commission to address its \u201cdivisive tactics.\u201d Many of India\u2019s more than 200 million Muslims have expressed fear at the prospect of Modi\u2019s re-election, and critics said the video fits a pattern of openly Islamophobic rhetoric during the BJP\u2019s campaign. Last month, the BJP\u2019s Instagram account published another animation that claimed the Congress planned to prioritize Muslims. \u201cIf you are a non-Muslim, Congress will snatch your wealth and distribute it to Muslims,\u201d said a voiceover in the clip, which has since been removed from Instagram. That video echoed similar comments by Modi, who sparked a row over hate speech last month while campaigning in BJP-ruled Rajasthan state, when he accused Muslims \u2013 who have been present in India for centuries \u2013 of being \u201cinfiltrators\u201d who deliberately have large families to outgrow the majority Hindu population. Modi\u2019s speech ignited widespread anger among Muslim leaders and opposition politicians and calls for election authorities to investigate. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking about undocumented migrants. The election commission has asked the BJP to respond to the allegations. In an interview with local broadcaster Times Now on Monday, Modi said the BJP is \u201cnot opposed to Islam and Muslims.\u201d But many Muslims\u00a0were skeptical. \u201cThis is not a dogwhistle, this is a targeted, direct, brazen hate speech against a community,\u201d prominent Muslim journalist Rana Ayyub said in response to the speech.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/india/india-bjp-muslim-video-police-investigation-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

Members of the Garrick Club, in London\u2019s West End, gathered Tuesday to debate admitting women to the club, the BBC and the Guardian reported. A vote among almost 1,000 members passed by 60% to 40%, according to the Guardian, which sparked discussion of the club\u2019s men-only policy when it published a list of dozens of members, including influential figures from the British establishment, on March 18. King Charles III is one notable member, according to the paper, as are dozens of lawmakers, leading lawyers and theater directors, producers and actors, the majority of whom are White and aged over 50. The publication of the list shone a spotlight on how women continued to be excluded, leading to the resignation of a handful of members and threats from others that they, too, would leave if women were not admitted. Despite the vote, it may be some time before the first woman joins: The admissions process involves nominations by existing members and discussions among committee members, who are able to blackball anyone considered unsuitable. CNN has contacted the Garrick Club for comment. Located in Covent Garden, the club is named after the celebrated 18th-century actor-manager David Garrick. \u201cAttracted by the combination of the traditions of the eighteenth century literary society with the advantages of a well-run dining and social club, the first members of the Garrick were a sophisticated and cosmopolitan group that included twenty-four peers of the realm as well as writers, actors, musicians and publishers,\u201d the club\u2019s website reads. The club, which has around 1,300 members, boasts a coffee room, morning room, card room, billiards room, reading room, members\u2019 computer room and roof terrace, as well as 17 bedrooms, a members\u2019 lounge and a number of private rooms that can be booked for group events. It is also home to a theatrical library of around 1,000 items. Men must wear jackets and collared shirts while in the club, with ties required if lunching or dining in the coffee room, apart from for those who arrive after 9.30 p.m. for after-theater supper, according to the website. \u201cLadies may wear trousers but not jeans,\u201d it adds. \u201cNo denim, trainers or gym shoes are allowed.\u201d According to its website, \u201cThe original assurance of the committee, \u2018that it would be better that ten unobjectionable men should be excluded than one terrible bore should be admitted,\u2019 ensures that the lively atmosphere for which the Club was so well-known in the nineteenth century continues to invigorate members of the Club in the twenty-first century.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/uk/garrick-club-votes-women-gbr-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_tech_apple-unveils-new-ipad-lineup", "text": "Apple is hoping its latest iPad lineup will breathe new life into its sluggish tablet market. In a pre-recorded live streamed event from its Cupertino, California headquarters, the company introduced the latest versions of its iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets, and an all-new Apple Pencil Pro. CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday\u2019s announcement marked \u201cthe biggest day for iPad since its introduction.\u201d At the heart of the new iPad Pro is Apple\u2019s new custom M4 processor, which delivers 4 times the performance as its existing iPad Pro models. Considering Apple\u2019s latest MacBook lineup currently runs on the M3 chip, this is, as Cook put it, an \u201coutrageously powerful chip for AI.\u201d The company is expected to show off its first batch of AI-tools for the iPhone and iPad at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. The latest iPad Pro comes in two sizes: 11 inches and 13 inches. Apple said the 11-inch model is its thinnest yet, at 5.1 mm, and less than a pound. The display combines two OLED panels to maximize brightness. The iPad Pro comes in two finishes, silver and space black. Meanwhile, the iPad Air, for the first time, comes in the same two sizes: an 11-inch ($599) and 13-inch ($799) design. The bigger size, inspired by the iPad Pro with a larger screen, has 30% more screen real estate than the 11-inch display. The iPad Air is powered by Apple\u2019s custom M2 processor with faster GPU and neural engine that\u2019s 50% faster than the previous iPad Air. The company said it better supports AI-powered software. It also features a front-facing landscape camera. Meanwhile, an upgraded Apple Pencil ($129) comes with a new squeeze function that allows users to bring up tools, customize drawing layers of what they\u2019re working on and includes haptic feedback. It also supports Find My to locate the pencil when it inevitably goes missing. Apple also showed off a redesigned Magic Keyboard with a haptic trackpad to make the iPad more like a laptop. Some key apps, including Final Cut, also received substantial upgrades, including the ability to add AI-based audio or edit with AI. The new iPad lineup is available for pre-order starting Tuesday and in stores next week. The event comes just days after Apple reported its iPad revenue of $5.6 billion for its latest quarter, down 17% year over year. However, the company said it expects its iPad business to grow in double digits for the June quarter. Apple also reported last week a first-quarter revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% year over year, as the tech giant continues to struggle with growth challenges, particularly in China, amid an uncertain economic environment. It announced a $110 billion share buyback \u2013 the largest in the company\u2019s history \u2013 as iPhones sales declined 10%. Ben Wood, a chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight, said the unexpected introduction of the iPad Pro\u2019s new M4 chip and its significant performance jumps may be enough to ignite some excitement among consumers. \u201cWhile these new iPads are unlikely to return the category to growth immediately, they represent a much-needed reason to upgrade for customers with aging products,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emphasis on artificial intelligence was palpable with Apple determined to seize back the initiative in this area given the huge focus on this topic by all its rivals over the last 18 months.\u201d On the earnings call last week, Cook teased that generative AI tools could be coming to Apple products in the \u201cweeks ahead,\u201d at a time when it\u2019s currently behind competitors. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/tech/apple-unveils-new-ipad-lineup/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

In April, the Palestinian Authority relaunched its membership request, and later that month, the US vetoed the Palestinian attempt to achieve membership status. The vote in the Security Council saw 12 members in favor and one against, in addition to the US veto.

In a statement on social platform X, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said the arson attack was the latest in a series of threats, harassment and violent incidents perpetrated by Israelis against the agency\u2019s staff over the past two months. \u201cThis evening, Israeli residents set fire twice to the perimeter of the UNRWA Headquarters in occupied East Jerusalem. This took place while UNRWA and other UN Agencies\u2019 staff were on the compound,\u201d Lazzarini said. \u201cIt is an outrageous development. Once again, the lives of UN staff were at a serious risk.\u201d The facility would be closed \u201cuntil proper security is restored,\u201d he added. Lazzarini posted a video of the compound showing staff trying to extinguish the flames while people chanted outside, and said that a crowd accompanied by armed men were witnessed outside the compound shouting, \u201cBurn down the United Nations.\u201d Several social media videos were also posted on Israeli Telegram platforms on Thursday showing the UNRWA compound on fire. In one video, the repeated chant \u201cUNWRA is Hamas, UNWRA is Hamas,\u201d could be heard. Lazzarini said\u00a0the fire caused \u201cextensive damage to the outdoor areas.\u201d There were no casualties among UN staff, he added. Israel\u2019s relations with the UN have sunk to a historic low in recent months, with senior UN officials highly critical of Israel\u2019s war conduct in Gaza. Israeli officials have long criticized UNRWA, which plays a central role in feeding and sheltering hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees. UNRWA has repeatedly\u00a0denied Israeli allegations\u00a0that its aid is being diverted to Hamas or that it teaches hatred in its schools, and has questioned \u201cthe motivation of those who make such claims.\u201d The agency has condemned the Hamas attack on October 7 as \u201cabhorrent.\u201d In March, UNRWA accused Israel of detaining and torturing some of its staffers, coercing them into making false confessions about the agency\u2019s ties to Hamas, two months after Israel accused at least 12 UNRWA staffers\u00a0of being involved in the October 7 terrorist attacks. Israel has also alleged that about 12% of UNRWA\u2019s 13,000 staffers are members of Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups, leading more than a dozen countries to suspend funding to the agency. UNRWA said it had fired 10 of the 12 accused staffers and that the other two are dead. CNN cannot confirm the allegations by Israel or UNRWA. On Thursday, Lazzarini said it was Israel\u2019s responsibility to ensure the safety of UN personnel. \u201cI call on all those who have influence to put an end to these attacks and hold all those responsible accountable,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThe perpetrators of these attacks must be investigated and those responsible must be held accountable.

Giffey, a former Berlin mayor, described the moment of the attack on Instagram, saying \u201cI suddenly felt a hard blow to my head and neck from behind.

{"id": "travel_ghost-tour-chance-encounters", "text": "Amelia Showalter was debating whether asking a stranger to join her on a ghost tour was a mad idea. She was sitting in a crowded bar in Edinburgh\u2019s Old Town, the last dregs of a glass of Scottish whisky in front of her. Also in front of her: Lucas Demaria. An Argentinian DJ she\u2019d just met. He was a fellow Edinburgh tourist and a self-confessed \u201cbig nerd.\u201d And he was someone Amelia was \u201cvery much liking talking with\u201d Amelia swallowed the last of her whisky, and in turn swallowed her reservations. She wanted to carry on her conversation with Lucas. And she was in a city she\u2019d never visited before. If he said no, it didn\u2019t matter. What did she have to lose? \u201cI\u2019m heading on this ghost tour soon,\u201d Amelia said. \u201cDo you want to come? It\u2019s supposed to be spooky.\u201d Lucas raised his eyebrow. \u201cNot that I actually believe in ghosts,\u201d Amelia added quickly. \u201cSure,\u201d said Lucas, laughing. \u201cWhy not.\u201d The next thing they knew, Amelia and Lucas were walking, shoulder to shoulder, down Edinburgh\u2019s cobbled streets. Dusk was falling and the city, with its stone spired buildings and hills and crags in the distance, had a dreamy atmosphere. The ghost tour focused on the city\u2019s bloody history, with the guide recounting the chilling tale of grave robbers Burke and Hare, stories of plague and taking the group into Edinburgh\u2019s eerie Blair Street underground vaults, a series of abandoned chambers beneath the city\u2019s South Bridge. \u201cYou\u2019d think it wouldn\u2019t be very romantic,\u201d Amelia tells CNN Travel today. \u201cBut it was, because you\u2019re kind of pretending to be scared.\u201d Amelia and Lucas stood closer and closer as the tour progressed. Their hands brushed against each other, but didn\u2019t quite touch. And then, tour over, the two ducked into a bar. They sat together, drinking and chatting into the night. \u201cAnd at some point I was like, \u2018We should make out,\u2019\u201d says Amelia. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d says Lucas, laughing. \u201cI feel like at that point we were both like, \u2018Come on, we\u2019re going to kiss,\u2019\u201d says Amelia. \u201cIt was going that way for sure,\u201d says Lucas. One day in Edinburgh Amelia and Lucas went on the spontaneous ghost tour on June 4, 2018, which just so happened to be Amelia\u2019s 35th birthday. Back then, Amelia lived and worked in Washington D.C., running a political data consultancy. She\u2019d previously worked on President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign in 2012. From time to time, Amelia\u2019s work led to interesting travel opportunities \u2013 and that\u2019s how she ended up visiting the UK in June 2018. She got invited to speak at a conference in London, and decided to tack on some extra days exploring the UK. \u201cI was like, \u2018Well, if I\u2019m going to be sort of traveling on my own, when I turn 35, I should do something fun \u2013 I should go celebrate somehow,\u2019\u201d says Amelia. Amelia decided to attend a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d convention in Manchester in the north of England (\u201cI love sci-fi, fantasy, all that stuff,\u201d she says). Then she headed up to Scotland to squeeze in a day of solo travel in Edinburgh. \u201cI just had the one day there,\u201d recalls Amelia. \u201cSo I went to the National Museum of Scotland. I ate some haggis. And then I wanted to have some Scotch.\u201d Amelia figured it would be fitting to sample a 35-year-old Scottish whisky on the day of her 35th birthday. She Googled Edinburgh\u2019s best whisky bars and the internet suggested Edinburgh institution Bow Bar, situated on the city\u2019s colorful, winding Victoria Street. Amelia headed in that direction, pushed open the blue door and grabbed a seat at the bar. She\u2019d just started sipping her drink when she spotted Lucas. He caught her eye because he was \u2013 unlike almost everyone else inside Bow Bar\u2013 drinking a beer. \u201cI just thought it was so strange that this person was drinking a beer in a whisky bar,\u201d says Amelia. \u201cI really wanted to know, \u2018What beer is so good that you\u2019re doing that instead of drinking some whisky?\u2019\u201d Without really thinking twice, Amelia turned to the stranger and asked the question. Connecting over whisky In June 2018, Lucas Demaria was 36 and starting to \u201cgive up on trying to find the one,\u201d as he puts it. Disillusioned with romance, Lucas decided to focus on exploring the world. \u201cI started traveling late in my life,\u201d Lucas tells CNN Travel. \u201cAnd it just blew my mind.\u201d He arrived in Edinburgh for the first time on the morning of June 4, 2018. He\u2019d heard the city was scenic, but he couldn\u2019t quite believe how spectacular it really was. \u201cI made it there and was like, \u2018Oh my God, this is a beautiful city,\u2019\u201d recalls Lucas. \u201cI had in my mind eating haggis, so I dropped the bag in the hostel, started walking, ate haggis, and then I told myself, \u2018Okay, I need to drink some scotch\u2019 But I\u2019m very into beer. And I know really nothing about scotch.\u201d Lucas stumbled across the Bow Bar while wandering around on foot. It looked like the place to go to satisfy his whisky quest. But once inside, the range of options was pretty intimidating. Lucas stared at the bottles, mystified. In the end he ordered a beer to enjoy while he mulled over the whisky options. When Amelia struck up conversation, questioning his drink choice, Lucas told her a truncated version of this explanation. He\u2019d actually been debating how to strike up conversation with Amelia before she got in there first \u2013 he\u2019d noticed her almost right away: \u201cSitting at the end of the bar, a beautiful lady,\u201d as he recalls it. Drink orders explained, the conversation moved on. Lucas was wearing a \u201cStar Wars\u201d T-shirt, and Amelia commented on it, saying she was also a fan. \u201cI showed her my \u2018Star Wars\u2019 tattoos,\u201d says Lucas. At the time, Amelia was into cosplay \u2013 recreating and wearing the costumes of fictional characters. So after she\u2019d admired the tattoos, she got out her phone, and showed Lucas some photos of her hand-sewn \u201cStar Wars\u201d costumes. \u201cIt was a nerd meeting,\u201d says Lucas, laughing. From there, the two talked a bit about their impressions of the UK, realizing along the way that they shared the same favorite British band: The Beatles. The conversation flowed in a way that surprised them both \u2013 neither Lucas or Amelia usually spoke to strangers in bars. \u201cIt\u2019s not in my nature,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cBut I would do that while traveling.\u201d \u201cYeah, I would never just go start talking to a random person in a bar in D.C., which is where I lived at the time,\u201d agrees Amelia. \u201cBut when I travel, I\u2019m just a much more open-minded person.\u201d It was this outlook that prompted Amelia to invite Lucas to join her on the ghost tour \u2013 and prompted Lucas to say yes. After the evening of whisky drinking, ghost stories and growing closer, Amelia and Lucas had to say their goodbyes. Amelia was heading down to London for her conference, while Lucas still had a few more days exploring Edinburgh. The two exchanged contact details, and started communicating via messaging app WhatsApp. \u201cFirst it was just text, for a couple of weeks, with some photos,\u201d recalls Amelia. And then, one day when she was back home in Washington D.C., Amelia saw a voice recording from Lucas pop up on her phone. Voice notes are pretty commonplace in the US now, but in 2018, Amelia had never come across the concept. In contrast, Lucas regularly sent voice notes to his friends in Argentina. Amelia clicked play, and Lucas\u2019 voice echoed around her bedroom. Her heart started racing. \u201cTo hear his voice and everything, I was just so excited,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAnd it made me realize, \u2018Oh, I really like this guy.\u2019 Because when I was hearing his voice again, it was just so wonderful.\u201d Before long, Amelia and Lucas were video calling regularly. \u201cWe\u2019d be talking for an hour, a couple of hours,\u201d recalls Amelia. \u201cSeveral times a week,\u201d says Lucas. Statistics of love Amelia\u2019s a data scientist by trade, and even while caught up in the heady emotions of falling for Lucas, she tried to think things through logically. \u201cWhen we met, I started making a little spreadsheet of how certain I felt that he was the love of my life,\u201d recalls Amelia. \u201cI wasn\u2019t being overly romantic \u2013 the first entry was 10% \u2013 a 10% chance Lucas was the love of my life. Which is actually really high if you think about it, just because what are the odds that any person is the love of your life?\u201d As she spent more and more time WhatsApping Lucas, Amelia added more data to the spreadsheet. \u201cIt went up to 20%,\u201d she says. \u201cI kept plotting it out.\u201d But Amelia knew the only way of securing a higher score would be to see Lucas again. The prospect had been raised on their video calls \u2013 but they had to figure out the logistics. Lucas\u2019 DJ job was always busier during his Argentinian summer months, starting November through to January. If he was going to embark on another vacation, it needed to be before then. Amelia considered visiting Lucas, and Lucas debated visiting Amelia, but ultimately the two decided meeting in a third country was the best plan. \u201cSo in October of 2018, we scheduled a 10-day trip to Peru together,\u201d recalls Amelia. \u201cOur second date.\u201d On their respective flights to Peru, Amelia and Lucas played back their months of video conversations in their head. They were both excited, but also apprehensive. \u201cI think my biggest fear, going to Peru, was, \u2018What if I get there, and all of a sudden, it just feels wrong? Like I\u2019ve built this whole thing up in my head,\u2019\u201d recalls Amelia. \u201cBecause you can kind of do that with long distance.\u201d But as soon as Amelia saw Lucas, her fears dissolved. \u201cImmediately, I was like, \u2018Oh, no, this is great,\u2019\u201d Amelia says. \u201cWithin the first two days, when we were walking around Lima, it was like, \u2018This feels really serious.\u2019 And it felt good.\u201d In between hiking the Inca Trail, marveling at Machu Picchu and eating mountains of delicious Peruvian food, Amelia and Lucas started talking about marriage. \u201cBy the end of the trip, we were not exactly engaged. But we were sort of engaged to be engaged,\u201d says Amelia. She updated her spreadsheet: the percentage was steadily climbing. The idea of marrying someone you\u2019d only met twice seemed bizarre, but both Amelia and Lucas felt calm and excited when they considered their future together \u2013 with just a dash of surprise at the whole thing. After all, their lives were taking a direction neither of them had anticipated \u2013 it was a happy shift, but a shift all the same. \u201cI never thought about getting married either until I met her, basically,\u201d says Lucas. Amelia echoes this. \u201cI had really gotten fine with the idea of being single,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Well, maybe I\u2019m just going to be one of those people that doesn\u2019t meet anybody. And that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just going to have a life on my own.\u2019\u201d The future suddenly looked very different for both of them. In February 2019, Lucas came to D.C. to visit Amelia. He met her parents, friends and loved ones. Not long after, Amelia visited Lucas in Argentina. It was during that trip that the couple officially got engaged. They picked out the ring together, making official something both of them knew was on the cards from pretty much day one. Explaining this feeling to loved ones was sometimes a little \u201cstrange,\u201d says Amelia. She recalls saying: \u201cI met this guy in Scotland, but he\u2019s from Argentina. And I think we might get married\u201d and fielding disbelieving responses, and some concerns. \u201cIt was just definitely a strange thing to explain to people,\u201d Amelia reflects today. \u201cBut I think also, it\u2019s such a different thing when you\u2019re in your 30s \u2013 because you know yourself better. I think it would be ill advised to do that when you\u2019re 20, because you don\u2019t really know yourself and it\u2019s easy to get kind of caught up. But I think after 15, 20 years of dating, you know yourself \u2013 and you have had enough other relationships to know what doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Getting married Amelia and Lucas were married at a small courthouse ceremony in Washington D.C. in the summer of 2019. Then, four months later, the couple threw a big D.C. celebration for family and friends. As a DJ, Lucas had worked hundreds of weddings. He\u2019d seen stuff he liked, stuff he didn\u2019t like \u2013 and all in all, knew what added up to a great evening. Amelia was on the same page. The couple wanted the evening to feel like, \u201ca night at the bar with all your friends,\u201d as Amelia puts it. Amelia and Lucas rented a cafe-bar called Emissary in D.C. for the evening. \u201cWe had endless appetizers,\u201d recalls Amelia. \u201cSo there wasn\u2019t a sit down dinner. It was just food whenever you want, open bar, with all the usual stuff that\u2019s on the menu, and espresso when you want because it was also a cafe.\u201d Lucas mixed the music in advance, while Amelia made her own wedding dress using the sewing skills she\u2019d perfected from her years of cosplay. And when she was planning her speech and considering what to say, Amelia dug out the spreadsheets she\u2019d compiled when she first met Lucas. \u201cI printed signs with the graphs I made,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone thought it was very funny.\u201d Meanwhile Lucas\u2019 best friend from Argentina made a speech in which he recounted the moment Lucas first told him he\u2019d met Amelia \u2013 and how he\u2019d known she was someone special based on the excited, heartfelt tone of Lucas\u2019 voice. The wedding also nodded to Amelia and Lucas\u2019 first conversation in Bow Bar about their shared love of \u201cStar Wars.\u201d Midway through their first dance \u2013 to The Beatles\u2019 \u201cIn My Life\u201d \u2013 the couple interrupted proceedings to have a mini lightsaber battle. \u201cSecretly, we had hidden some lightsabers with a couple of our friends,\u201d explains Amelia, laughing. \u201cSo halfway through the dance. We did a little lightsaber action, little tiny dance fight, and then back to dancing.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t think that lightsabers would work with the Beatles in my life. When I say it out loud, it sounds like a really weird combination, but it was really fun.\u201d A month or so later, Lucas and Amelia relocated from D.C. to Seattle, Washington, where Amelia had grown up and where her parents still lived. She was ready to leave the US capital, and figured if she and Lucas might have a kid, it\u2019d be nice to be closer to family. As for Lucas, serendipitously, Seattle happened to be a perfect fit. He loved grunge music (\u201cI was a kid in the \u201890s,\u201d he shrugs), IPA beers and black coffee. He was instantly \u201cso happy\u201d there. Life in Seattle Cut to today and Lucas and Amelia still live in Seattle. Lucas set up his own successful Seattle-based DJ business, while Amelia\u2019s still working in political data analysis. The couple are also kept busy by their three-year-old son Jude. He\u2019s named \u2013 of course \u2013 for The Beatles song, \u201cHey Jude.\u201d The name seemed appropriate, given Lucas and Amelia both love The Beatles and talked about the band that first night in Edinburgh. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny because those things \u2013 the fact that we both love \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and The Beatles \u2013 it mattered a lot at the beginning because it was like, \u2018Oh, we have these things in common,\u2019\u201d reflects Amelia. \u201cAnd now I don\u2019t think about them so much, because we just have a whole life together.\u201d \u201cI think shared values are, in the end, way more important than a shared taste for movies,\u201d agrees Lucas. It\u2019s their similar\u00a0 approach to life, Lucas suggests, that\u2019s led him and Amelia to the happiness they continue to enjoy today. Plus, while they still enjoy watching the same TV and movies, Amelia and Lucas\u2019 tastes do occasionally diverge. Amelia loves a Broadway musical, for example, which isn\u2019t Lucas\u2019 vibe. Meanwhile Amelia\u2019s never quite got her head around Lucas\u2019 passion for heavy metal. The pandemic, and then the birth of Jude, put a pause on Lucas and Amelia\u2019s desire to travel the world together post-wedding. But in 2023, the couple embarked on a long-awaited \u201camazing\u201d Honeymoon to Japan, leaving Jude in the care of his grandparents. Also on the travel agenda is one day returning to Edinburgh, this time with Jude in tow. Amelia and Lucas want to show their son where they met, and retrace the steps of their first evening together. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take Jude to the bar,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cPut him on the bar,\u201d adds Amelia, laughing. \u201cAnd say, \u2018This is your fault.\u2019\u201d \u201cFree drinks for us,\u201d jokes Lucas. In reality, they\u2019ll probably hold off on returning to Edinburgh until Jude\u2019s old enough to enjoy the trip in his own right. \u201cMaybe on our 10 year anniversary, or something,\u201d says Amelia. \u201cThere\u2019s so much of Scotland I\u2019ve never seen, so we definitely want to go back there someday.\u201d Something Lucas and Amelia still marvel at is the idea that they\u2019re so compatible, despite the fact they grew up thousands of miles from each other \u2013 and only happened to be in the same bar, in the same city, in the same country by happenstance. \u201cIt\u2019s so weird, he\u2019s just a random guy in a bar,\u201d says Amelia. \u201cFrom a different country,\u201d adds Lucas. Neither are who the other envisaged when they imagined a prospective life partner. Lucas \u2013 who recalls breaking up with an ex who lived 15 minutes away from him because he felt like they were from \u201cdifferent worlds\u201d \u2013 finds it incongruous yet incredible that he ended up marrying someone he met on vacation. As for Amelia, she always figured she\u2019d end up with a fellow Ivy League graduate, who also worked in the D.C. politics world. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, \u2018Oh I must be with that kind of person,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut you just get an idea of, \u2018This is probably who I will end up with.\u2019 I never would have assumed it would be a DJ from Argentina.\u201d All this suggests, says Amelia and Lucas, that compatibility has little to do with shared backgrounds. It goes back to that shared values thing and being on the same wavelength, they say \u2013 and the idea of being open, of willingly embarking on adventures. \u201cI mean, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to absolutely find the love of your life from traveling,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cYou could find the love of one night, and that can be fun too,\u201d says Amelia. Amelia and Lucas are also grateful that their relationship continues to develop as they grow together. \u201cWe were in love,\u201d says Lucas of their 2018 selves. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t know each other 100% as we do know.\u201d \u201cI always felt certain about you,\u201d says Amelia to Lucas. \u201cBut I\u2019m more in love with you all the time. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/ghost-tour-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_world_solar-flares-storms-cme-auroras-scn", "text": "A series of solar flares and coronal mass ejections from the sun have the potential to create dazzling auroras that may be seen as far south as Alabama and Northern California but also disrupt communications on Earth tonight and over the weekend, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center. The center, which is a division of the National Weather Service, issued a severe geomagnetic storm watch for Friday evening. It\u2019s the first such watch issued since January 2005. As the sun nears the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle, known as solar maximum, later this year, researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb. Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth\u2019s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky. The Space Weather Prediction Center tracked multiple strong flares emitting from a large cluster of sunspots on the solar surface since Wednesday. The cluster is 16 times the diameter of Earth. Scientists observed at least five coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, releasing from the sun in the direction of Earth. These significant outburts are expected to arrive as early as midday Friday and continue through Sunday. The peak of the geomagnetic storm activity for Earth will be between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. ET on Saturday, according to the center\u2019s forecast. The center referred to this as \u201can unusual event.\u201d Geomagnetic storms driven by the sun in recent months have caused auroras to be visible in places where they are rarely seen, including as far south as New Mexico, Missouri, North Carolina and California in the United States, and the southeast of England and other parts of the United Kingdom. Depending on the location, the auroras may not always be visible overhead, but keep an eye on the horizon, experts say, because they may create a colorful display there as well. The effects of geomagnetic storms When directed at Earth, these ejections can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of Earth\u2019s magnetic field. \u201cGeomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth\u2019s surface, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operations,\u201d according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201c(The center) has notified the operators of these systems so they can take protective action.\u201d Solar storms generated by the sun can also cause radio blackouts and even pose risks for crewed space missions. The center warned that additional solar activity could cause geomagnetic storm conditions to be ongoing through the weekend. So far, researchers have obseverd only three severe geomagnetic storms during the current solar cycle, which began in December 2019, according to the center. Previously, a G5, or extreme geomagnetic storm, occurred on October 23, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, according to the center. Tracking space weather Every 11 years or so, the sun experiences periods of low and high solar activity, which is associated with the amount of sunspots on its surface. The sun\u2019s strong and constantly shifting magnetic fields drive these dark regions, some of which can reach the size of Earth or larger. Over the course of a solar cycle, the sun will transition from a calm to an intense and active period. During the peak of activity, called solar maximum, the sun\u2019s magnetic poles flip. Then, the sun will grow quiet again during a solar minimum. Solar maximum is expected to peak through mid- to late 2024, but the sun will remain active for a couple of years afterward. Teams at the Space Weather Prediction Center use data from ground and space-based observatories, magnetic maps of the solar surface, and ultraviolet observations of the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere to determine when the sun is most likely to send out solar flares, coronal mass ejections and other space weather that could affect Earth. Solar flares can affect communications and GPS almost immediately because they disrupt Earth\u2019s ionosphere, or part of the upper atmosphere. Energetic particles released by the sun can also disrupt electronics on spacecraft and affect astronauts without proper protection within 20 minutes to several hours. The material sent speeding away from the sun during coronal mass ejections can arrive at Earth between 30 and 72 hours afterward, causing geomagnetic storms that affect satellites and create electrical currents in the upper atmosphere that travel through the ground and can have an impact on electric power grids. The storms also affect flight patterns of commercial airlines, which are instructed to stay away from Earth\u2019s poles during geomagnetic storms due to loss of communication or navigation capabilities. Extreme storms have occurred before, such as one that knocked out the power grid in Quebec in 1989 and the Carrington Event of 1859.The latter remains the most intense geomagnetic storm ever recorded, causing telegraph stations to spark and catch fire. If such an event were to occur today, it could cause trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage and bring down some power grids for a substantial amount of time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/world/solar-flares-storms-cme-auroras-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_europe_missing-woman-henao-spain-husband-arrest-cec", "text": "About 9:30 p.m. on February 2, a man in a helmet entered Ana Maria  Knezevich Henao\u2019s apartment building in an exclusive neighborhood in Madrid. Henao, who was on vacation in Spain from south Florida, was in the building at the time and planning a trip to Barcelona with her friends in three days. A surveillance camera captured the man fastening the building\u2019s lock with duct tape to disable it. He looked straight into the camera as he spray-painted the lens, partially obscuring it. After about an hour in the building, he emerged from the elevator with a suitcase. Henao was reported missing soon after, and no one has seen her since. But the FBI said this week they\u2019ve arrested the mystery man who entered her Madrid apartment building that night: her estranged husband. David Knezevich, 36, was detained at Miami International Airport on Saturday for his alleged involvement in her kidnapping, the latest in an international mystery involving law enforcement officials from two continents. A can of spray paint, security camera footage, stolen license plates and rental car records helped tie him to the crime, according to a criminal complaint obtained by CNN. So did his messages to a woman he\u2019d met on a dating app \u2014 and a Google search by the woman\u2019s mother. Knezevich\u2019s attorney, Kenneth Padowitz, told CNN in February that his client is innocent and \u201chas never been to Spain.\u201d Padowitz declined to comment Wednesday after Knezevich\u2019s arrest.  The couple owned properties in Florida but had separated Knezevich and Henao lived in Florida, where records show they own several properties in Fort Lauderdale.\u00a0They are also listed as CEO and project manager of EOX Technology Solutions Inc., which provides computer support for businesses in south Florida. CNN contacted the company this week but did not immediately get a response. The couple was planning to divorce amid a separation that was contentious because Knezevich did not want to evenly split marital assets, court documents said. But Knezevich\u2019s attorney told CNN in February that their separation was amicable, \u201cwith anticipation of a divorce.\u201d Henao, 40, boarded a flight from Miami to Spain the day after Christmas, court records show. At the time of her disappearance six weeks later, her husband was in his native Serbia and had nothing to do with it, Padowitz said in February. Knezevich had spoken to Spanish police, provided his credit card details and other information and was cooperating in the investigation, the attorney said then. Padowitz is based in Florida. But federal officials said records show Knezevich flew from Miami to Turkey in January and then went to Belgrade, Serbia, where he rented a small Peugeot on January 29. The owner of the rental car agency told investigators that when the car was returned in mid-March, someone had tinted its windows and added a new license plate frame, and it had traveled nearly 4,800 miles, the criminal complaint said. Toll booth cameras captured images of the same model Peugeot, with tinted windows, near Madrid in the late night and early morning of February 2 and 3. It had license plates stolen from another vehicle on the Madrid street where Henao was living, the complaint said. FBI spokesperson James Marshall declined to answer questions this week, citing an ongoing investigation. \u201cWe appreciate the public\u2019s attention to our case and continue to encourage those with information, even if they\u2019re not certain of its value, to come forward,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cTo preserve the integrity and capabilities of the investigation, I cannot share details of the ongoing process.\u201d Her friend received puzzling texts from her phone Henao was last seen on camera entering her building in Madrid\u2019s upscale Salamanca neighborhood on the afternoon of February 2. At 9:27 p.m. that evening, records show the man in the helmet entered the building and tampered with the surveillance camera. He had \u201cphysical characteristics\u201d that resembled her husband, court documents said. Henao, a US citizen originally from Colombia, was in constant communication with her loved ones while overseas. She was planning a trip to Barcelona with her friends on February 5, her brother told CNN, making her sudden lack of contact more concerning. Two days before the trip, her friend Sanna Rameau received a puzzling WhatsApp message from Henao indicating she was running off for a few days with a man she\u2019d just met. The message, seen by CNN, read: \u201cI met someone wonderful!! He has a summer house about 2h (hours) from Madrid. We are going there now and I will spend a few days there. Signal is spotty. I\u2019ll call you when I get back.\u201d The man had approached Henao on the street a day earlier while she was walking, the message said, adding: \u201cAmazing connection. Like I never had before.\u201d Rameau said she\u2019d spoken with Henao by phone hours before she went missing and she had not mentioned meeting a man. Concern grew when Henao did not show up at a Madrid train station for the trip as planned. Spanish firefighters entered her apartment for a welfare check and she was nowhere to be found, court documents said. Her phone, laptop and chargers were also missing. Now federal officials allege the text messages sent from her phone actually came from her husband.\u00a0And they were written with the help of another Colombian woman Knezevich had met on a dating app months earlier, court documents said. On February 3 \u2014 the day after Henao was last seen alive \u2014 Knezevich sent the woman several English sentences to translate into \u201cperfect Colombian,\u201d according to the criminal complaint. He told her it was for a friend in Serbia writing a script that had a Colombian character. The message he sent to the unidentified Colombian woman to translate was the same one sent from Henao\u2019s phone saying she\u2019d met a new guy, court documents said. Investigators also identified other clues Investigators on both sides of the Atlantic searched for clues on what happened to the missing woman and who entered her building that day \u2014 and who might have abducted her. Then everything started coming together. Spanish investigators identified the brand of spray paint used to tamper with the camera and learned that a Madrid retailer had sold the same paint, along with two rolls of duct tape, to a man who resembled Knezevich the same day Henao was last seen, the criminal complaint said. And in a twist of fate, the woman Knezevich met on a dating app told her mother in Bogota about her new suitor, leading to yet another revelation. The woman\u2019s mother Googled his name and saw news reports about his missing wife.

People have been forced to consume \u201cgrass and peanut shells,\u201d the regional director for Eastern Africa of the World Food Programme\u00a0(WFP) said on Friday. \u201cIf assistance doesn\u2019t reach them soon, we risk witnessing widespread starvation and death in Darfur and across other conflict-affected areas in\u00a0Sudan,\u201d Michael Dunford added. Sudan has been gripped by civil war since April 2023, when fighting erupted between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). It quickly descended into a brutal conflict\u00a0characterized by reports\u00a0of sexual and genocidal violence and civilian casualties, triggering an exodus of refugees. On Thursday, two International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) drivers were killed by gunmen in\u00a0South Darfur, in an attack that\u00a0left three other staff members injured, according to\u00a0the humanitarian organization. The ICRC team was attacked en route to assess the crisis among communities affected by armed violence in the region,\u00a0the organization said. The latest surge in violence comes as the RSF encircles North Darfur\u2019s capital, El Fasher. In the city and its surrounding localities, there have been \u201cincreasing arbitrary killings,\u201d systematic \u201cburning of entire villages\u201d and \u201cescalating air bombardments,\u201d the UN deputy humanitarian coordinator for\u00a0Sudan,\u00a0Toby Hayward, said on Thursday. Hayward added that El Fasher is the only city in Darfur that has not been captured by the RSF and hosts thousands of people who have been displaced by the war. At least 500,000 of those sheltering in the city have been displaced from violence elsewhere in Sudan, according to the UN\u2019s children\u2019s agency (UNICEF). More than 36,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in El Fasher in recent weeks, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported. At least 43 people have been killed in and around the city since the escalation of fighting a little over two weeks ago, UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said on Thursday. \u201cRecent attacks on more than a dozen villages in western El Fasher have resulted in horrific reports of violence, including sexual violence, children injured and killed, homes set on fire, and destruction of critical civilian supplies and infrastructure,\u201d Russell detailed. Meanwhile, deliveries of food assistance in Darfur \u201chave been intermittent due to fighting and endless bureaucratic hurdles\u201d and at least 1.7 million people within the region are experiencing emergency levels of hunger, according to the World Food Programme. \u201cThe latest escalation of violence around El Fasher has halted aid convoys coming from Chad\u2019s Tine border crossing \u2013 a recently opened humanitarian corridor that passes through North Darfur\u2019s capital,\u201d the WFP added. Restrictions imposed by authorities in the coastal town of Port Sudan have hindered aid deliveries, the WFP said, preventing the transportation of relief via Adr\u00e9, a town in neighboring Chad. More than 8.7 million people, including 4.6 million children, have been displaced by the war in Sudan and 24.8 million need assistance, according to OCHA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/03/africa/people-eating-grass-sudan-hunger/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_05_europe_ukrainian-civilians-detained-russian-prisons-intl-cmd", "text": "\u201cDear mom and dad, I am alive and well. I am doing well. Dima.\u201d Handwritten on a small piece of paper, this\u00a0is the only message Halyna and Vasyl Khyliuk have received from their son Dmytro Khyliuk, known as\u00a0Dima, since he was taken by\u00a0Russian troops\u00a0more than two years ago. The Ukrainian journalist was detained in March 2022 during the occupation of his village, Kozarovychi, north of Kyiv. As far as his parents know, the 49-year-old correspondent for the Ukrainian Independent Information Agency was transferred to Russia, where he is still being held despite \u2013 according to his lawyer \u2013 having never been convicted or charged. The Ukrainian government says there are thousands of people like Dima, civilians arrested by Russia\u00a0who have been held in arbitrary detention for years. Kyiv has officially confirmed around 1,700 cases, but human rights researchers estimate the real number is five to seven times higher.\u00a0In all, some 37,000 Ukrainians \u2013 civilian adults and children, and military members \u2013 are unaccounted for, according to the Ukrainian ombudsman\u2019s office, which says that people are still being seized in areas under Russian occupation. CNN cannot independently verify the number of detainees. Many of those detained have been moved to prisons deep inside Russia, kept alongside criminals and prisoners of war, in breach of international humanitarian law. Human rights groups have identified some 100 detention facilities across Russia and occupied areas of Ukraine where civilians are being held, including several that have been opened or expanded specifically to accommodate them. \u201cThe Russians want to recognize a lot of them as military combatants and give them prisoner of war status \u2026 the main reason being (to build) a bank of POWs for exchanges,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s human rights commissioner, Dmytro Lubinets, told CNN in Kyiv. Lubinets said that recognizing Ukrainian civilians as\u00a0prisoners of war\u00a0would be both illegal and dangerous, because it would put Ukrainians in occupied areas at higher risk of being detained to be used as bargaining chips. \u201cThese people are not prisoners of war; they are civilian hostages. I use that word to emphasize what the Russian Federation is doing \u2013 they are holding civilians as hostages,\u201d he said. Under the Geneva Conventions, that regulate the conduct of armed conflict, hostage-taking is explicitly banned. Warring parties can intern people, including civilians. But the rules on who can be detained, why and for how long are strict. \u201cThe rule is that it is not a punishment,\u201d Achille Despr\u00e9s from the Kyiv branch of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told CNN, adding that civilians can only be held if it\u2019s\u00a0\u201cnecessary\u201d for \u201cimperative reasons of security.\u201d The Ukrainian government and several international organizations say Russia is committing war crimes by holding people like Dima. Concerns over Russia\u2019s arbitrary detentions of Ukrainian civilians are so grave that 45 members of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) launched a special\u00a0investigation\u00a0into the issue in February with the aim of finding ways to hold Russia accountable. Desperate search Speaking to CNN at their home in Kozarovychi, which has since been liberated and partially repaired by Ukrainian volunteers, the Khyliuks recalled the horror of their son\u2019s capture and the uncertainty of his continued detention. In the early\u00a0weeks of the war, Russian troops took over their home, parking their tank in the garden and stealing anything of value. The Khyliuks were sheltering at a neighbor\u2019s house, only occasionally venturing outside to get supplies. It was during one of these outings that Dima and Vasyl found themselves surrounded by a group of Russian soldiers armed with machine guns. \u201cThey put some kind of jackets over our heads and taped our eyes, so we couldn\u2019t see anything. Dima and I were separated. Then a week later, they took us to Dymer. We spent two nights there together. It was cold, the floor was cement, it was not heated. I was wearing a winter jacket, but Dima was wearing a light jacket and wellies,\u201d Vasyl, who was released after eight days, said. When they didn\u2019t come home, Halyna said she was beside herself, realizing the Russians must have captured them. \u201cThey grabbed a lot of people back then, they grabbed whomever they saw. Those they did not need, they tortured a little and let them go. But Dima and six other people have been in prison for two years,\u201d she said, tears in her eyes. Russia has become such a black hole for information that many Ukrainian families, authorities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) must rely on word of mouth from former prisoners to learn about people who are still detained. Anastasiia Pantielieieva, a researcher and journalist who documents cases of civilian detentions and enforced disappearances for the\u00a0Media Initiative for Human Rights (MIHR), a Ukrainian NGO, said that, based on eyewitness testimonies, Dima was briefly held in two makeshift detention centers in occupied Ukraine before being moved to a pre-trial detention center in Novozybkov, in Russia\u2019s Bryansk region. She said the last documented sighting of Dima by a witness was at Penal Colony Number 7 in Russia\u2019s Vladimir region. At one point, MIHR received indication that he might be transported to another facility in Mordovia, a Russian region southeast of Moscow, but Pantielieieva said Russian authorities did not confirm this information. Moscow has repeatedly denied holding Dima, despite numerous accounts placing him in detention facilities in Russia. The Russian Investigative Committee and the Russian Prison Service in Bryansk both officially informed the Khyliuks\u2019 lawyer in December 2022 and January 2023 that he was not in Russia and that they had no information about him. Dima\u2019s handwritten note was dated April 2022, although his parents did not receive it until August that year. Then in May 2023, the Khyliuks said the ICRC called them to confirm their son was alive. But it wasn\u2019t until this March, two years after his arrest, that the Russian Ministry of Defense admitted Dima had been detained and was being held in Russia, in a letter to his parents. They did not provide any information on his location or status. \u201cWe\u2019ve had cases where even people who are put on trials, public trials, where we have seen photos from the courtroom, even in these cases, the relatives would have no official documents, nothing that would officially confirm that the people are on the territory of Russian Federation,\u201d Pantielieieva said. Under international humanitarian law, in times of conflict, the\u00a0ICRC\u00a0must be given regular access to detainees to verify they are being treated humanely and to reconnect them with their families. The person must also be told why they are being interned and be able to appeal the decision. Ukrainian Defense Intelligence officials told CNN that they believe the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Russian National Guard are the primary drivers behind the arrests and detentions of Ukrainian civilians. Neither responded to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. CNN also made multiple requests to the Russian ministries of defense and interior, the Russian ombudsman\u2019s office, the Directorate of Special Programs of the President of the Russian Federation and the Main Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) for information about the specific cases mentioned in this story. They have not replied. Held secretly for months For the families of detainees, trying to navigate Russia\u2019s security apparatus is a part of their nightmare. Yulia Khrypun has spent more than two years reaching out to every Russian authority she could think of, desperately trying to find information about her father Serhii. When she did receive official replies, they often included conflicting information. \u201cOne institution officially informed me that he was detained for resisting the \u2018special military operation,\u2019 while others said that he never crossed the border into Russia,\u201d she said. CNN has seen some of the documents sent to her. Serhii Khrypun was detained in Nove, a village near Tokmak, in southern Ukraine, where he was working as a security guard at a farm. The area had been under occupation for about two weeks when, one morning in March 2022, Serhii called Yulia to tell her that a new group of Russian soldiers had arrived in two trucks. \u201cAnd that was our last phone conversation. After that we had no information about him for two days,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems to me that at that moment he already knew that he would be taken away. He called everyone: me, his mother and sister, and his friend.\u201d Yulia was able to piece together what happened because Serhii\u2019s arrest was filmed on a security camera at the farm; she said it looked a lot like kidnapping. When the Russian soldiers arrived, they searched him and his colleague before proceeding to undress them, the video showed. \u201cAfter that, they put a bag over his head and took him away,\u201d she said. Yulia was told by Ukrainians taken to the same facility as her father\u00a0\u2013 a government building in Tokmak \u2013 that he was held there for about two weeks. They also said they were beaten by Russian troops. \u201cHe was then taken to Melitopol, where they kept him for three weeks, then to Olenivka, and from there to Kursk (in Russia), then to Crimea,\u201d she said, citing what she has heard from various eyewitnesses who were held with her father. One of them contacted her after his release, knowing only her name and place of work from Serhii. Others were interviewed by NGOs or Ukrainian authorities. Based on these accounts, she believes her father is now\u00a0being\u00a0held in a detention facility in Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, a city in Russia\u2019s Rostov region near the Ukrainian border. Russia is holding so many Ukrainian detainees that it has had to extend several existing prisons and pre-trial detention facilities to accommodate them. According to the Ukrainian ombudsman\u2019s office, one such facility has been created in Chonhar, at the Russian-occupied southernmost tip of the Kherson region, next to a bridge to the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula. The FSB and other Russian security agencies have conducted a\u00a0large-scale campaign of arrests and enforced disappearances\u00a0in Crimea since Russia illegally annexed the peninsula in 2014, targeting political opponents, pro-Ukrainian and pro-democracy activists, human rights defenders, journalists and Crimean Tatars. Those detained include people with no links to opposition or activism. The pre-trial detention center, or SIZO, in Simferopol, has become synonymous with the Russian campaign of terror in Crimea. According to Crimean human rights organizations including Zmina, the Crimean Human Rights Group and Crimea SOS, hundreds of people have been held in the facility for months, without anyone knowing where they were. Following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia opened a second pre-trial detention facility in Simferopol, SIZO No. 2. But that was apparently not enough to hold all detainees. Satellite images from Maxar Technologies taken in July 2021 and November 2023 reveal the transformation of a school campus in Chonhar from an ordinary building to a\u00a0high-security detention center. A new security perimeter with high walls has been erected around the compound, with a controlled access point visible in the more recent images. MIHR has compiled a database of facilities where Ukrainian civilians are being detained, confirmed through eyewitness testimonies from people held at the same locations and, in some cases, official documents. They include prisons, penal colonies and pre-trial detention centers as far away as Russia\u2019s Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk regions, thousands of miles from Ukraine in Siberia. \u2018She was essentially kidnapped\u2019 The family of former police officer Mariana Checheliuk has been trying to track the 24-year-old\u2019s movements across Russia and occupied Ukraine for the past two years. Since her detention, she is believed to have been relocated at least six times. Mariana and her younger sister were among the hundreds of civilians who spent weeks sheltering in the\u00a0Azovstal steelworks plant\u00a0in Mariupol during Russia\u2019s siege of the southern port city. They were finally allowed to leave in May 2022, when Russia and Ukraine agreed to open a humanitarian corridor into the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia. On the way, Mariana was detained at a Russian \u201cfiltration point\u201d in the occupied village of Bezimenne, according to her mother, Natalia Checheliuk. The\u00a0Bezimenne facility\u00a0became notorious in the early months of the war. Tens of thousands of evacuees from Mariupol were forced to go through a \u201csecurity\u201d screening there. Many never made it out. \u201cShe was essentially kidnapped,\u201d Natalia told CNN. \u201cThere were no court hearings, she has not been charged with anything and we even received an email from the (self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic) prosecutor saying that they have absolutely no claims against Mariana, that she is not accused of anything and that they \u2018will check and release her,\u2019\u201d Natalia said. \u201cBut this was eight months ago, and nothing has happened.\u201d According to eyewitnesses who were held alongside Mariana and who spoke to her family, she was first taken to a detention facility in Donetsk, in occupied eastern Ukraine. She was then transferred to Olenivka, the detention center where\u00a0more than 50 prisoners of war died\u00a0in a mysterious explosion in July 2022. From Olenivka she was taken to a detention facility in Taganrog, in southwestern Russia, and then to Kamyshin, in Russia\u2019s Volgograd region. From there, she was sent back to Taganrog and then to a detention facility in Mariupol, where \u2013 as far as the family knows, and as human rights groups and Ukrainian officials have reported\u00a0\u2013 she remains to this day. \u201cMy daughter went through a lot of grief,\u201d Natalia said. \u201cIn a letter in December 2023, she wrote that she was giving up, that she had lost her faith \u2026 Every day, all day, all I think about is her.\u201d Before the war, Mariana \u2013 or Marianochka, as her family calls her \u2013 was an animal welfare volunteer, who would often get up early to prepare and deliver food for vulnerable dogs before heading to work with the police. She adopted a rescue dog called Mila, who is now staying with her family. Eyewitnesses have told her family that the detention has taken a great toll on her. One\u00a0Ukrainian woman who was held\u00a0in the pre-trial detention center in Taganrog in May 2023 told CNN that Mariana had lost weight and was in poor health the last time she saw her. She said Mariana had problems with her knee following an injury in Olenivka and that conditions in the prison were dire. \u201cThe food was terrible, as was the attitude of the guards, who (inflicted) psychological and physical abuse on us. We were often forced to do push-ups, sit in splits, do squats and other physical exercises,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes we could do physical exercises, sing Russian songs and the national anthem of the Russian Federation all day, (the guards) were threatening to send us to Siberia or other places \u2026 telling us that Ukraine no longer exists, that Ukraine does not want to take prisoners of war back, that no one wants us.\u201d The prisoner, who has since been released, asked CNN not to disclose her name for fear of retribution. According to the ICRC, Russia considers Mariana to be a prisoner of war because she was formerly a police officer, Natalia said. However, the Ukrainian government told the family she is considered a civilian and, as such, cannot be exchanged. Pantielieieva, the MIHR researcher, said she believes Russia would take advantage of any decision to recognize civilians as prisoners of war and detain even more. \u201cThe number of people they are taking is already great, they are doing it every day,\u201d she said, adding that the latest case of a \u201cdisappeared\u201d civilian had landed on her desk just a few days earlier. Volunteers, journalists and teachers are among those Russia has appeared interested in detaining, according to the human rights groups monitoring the arrests, but often there is no discernable reason why someone has been scooped up. \u201cSome people were taken because their house was not far from Russian positions. Or maybe they had a video of (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky on their phones. Or the Russians were interested in their relatives and took them hostage,\u201d Pantielieieva said. \u201cWe have examples where a person is detained by one soldier and after a month, another soldier comes in on rotation and becomes responsible for the detainees and he doesn\u2019t know why people were detained and he goes and asks the detainees why they were being held.\u201d \u2018I don\u2019t know how to change this\u2019 Ukraine has managed to bring hundreds of soldiers home in prisoner swaps with Russia and has even had some success repatriating Ukrainian children who were forcibly deported \u2013 leaning on Qatar and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) to help mediate the process. Detained civilians, however, are stuck in limbo. Only a few dozen have been released so far, Lubinets, Ukraine\u2019s human rights commissioner,\u00a0told CNN. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a legal mechanism, we don\u2019t have a partner, we don\u2019t have international laws, international norms \u2026 I don\u2019t know how to change this situation,\u201d he said. Ukraine\u2019s government has admitted it was not prepared to handle the situation of civilians being held without end, but that they now have some systems in place to support families. Yulia, whose father Serhii is still missing, said she realized early on that the international legal system was not set up to deal with cases like his. \u201cThe process was clear with POWs, because for them there is a military unit, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Ukraine\u2019s Coordination Headquarters (for the Treatment of Prisoners of War). But with civilians, there were different phone numbers, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the hotline of the National Information Bureau, the ombudsman, the Ministry of Reintegration \u2026 it was a circle of hell,\u201d she said. After months of reaching dead-ends, Yulia and another relative of a Ukrainian detainee set up the civic organization \u201cCivilians in Captivity\u201d to give them more authority when speaking to officials. The group \u2013 which has united the families of some 400 detained civilians \u2013 has become a key player in raising awareness and holds regular meetings with the Coordination Headquarters and the ombudsman\u2019s office. \u201cEveryone knows about the POWs, but few people talk about civilians in captivity,\u201d Yulia said, adding that she sometimes feels frustrated about the Ukrainian government\u2019s decision not to acknowledge civilian detainees as prisoners of war, as Russia has demanded. \u201cAs a daughter who has been waiting for her father for two years, I do not understand why my father should pay with his life and health,\u201d she said. Lubinets said he understands that frustration. \u201cBut what can you do with (a) country that does not respect international humanitarian law and is not held responsible for it? The Geneva Conventions say that no side in international armed conflict can detain the civilian population. But Russia? They did it and they continue doing it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/05/europe/ukrainian-civilians-detained-russian-prisons-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_tech_roblox-earnings-2024", "text": "Roblox shares slid more than 20% in early trading, as the gaming giant dialed back its forecasts for growth and first-quarter earnings showed player spending is slowing. Average daily active users (DAUs) were 77.7 million, up 17% year-over-year. But analysts said Roblox needs to prove to Wall Street there\u2019s new sources of revenue growth, up ahead. Its devoted fan base is mostly teens, so the company is taking aggressive steps to attract both younger and older players. \u201cOur teams have been hard at work identifying opportunities to drive DAUs, hours, and bookings growth rates back to 20% year-over-year, said\u00a0David Baszucki, founder and CEO of\u00a0Roblox, in a statement. \u201cBased on results since the middle of April, we believe that these steps are yielding positive results.\u201d In mid-morning trading shares stand at about $23. The stock had shuffled between $25 and $45 for many months after hitting a peak, just above $130 in 2021, the year the company went public. \u201cThe company has faced high operational costs and it needs to sustain rapid growth at the same time,\u201d said Matilda Beinat, an AR/VR analyst at tech intelligence firm ABI Research. \u201cInvestors have wondered if that can be feasible.\u201d Still, some analysts and investors remain moderately optimistic. Here are three reasons why. New revenue streams Roblox has evolved since its 2006 launch and so has its growth strategy. The platform allows users to both play user-created games and create their own games and it also blends elements of a social media network, so people can make friends and talk to developers as they explore virtual worlds. Last year, its Baszucki shared visions of Roblox becoming a place where people can date and form \u201creal-life relationships\u201d within the next five years. In February, the company said 19.7 million new \u201cfriendships\u201d are formed every day on the site. The company\u2019s vision has long been for Roblox to be everywhere, and in many ways, it\u2019s succeeding. The platform\u2019s active daily users are using the platform for an average of 2.5 hours a day \u2013 and those numbers continue to grow. About half of US youth, ages 12 to 17, use Roblox in the US monthly; and it continues to experience growth overseas, especially in Asia. Its biggest hits include Adopt me! (a pet simulator), Brookhaven RP (a functioning virtual town) and Tower of Hell. Although many of the games are geared toward teens, the company seeks to grow and monetize the number of older players. Just last week, the company announced it will show immersive video ads to players over the age of 13. Roblox\u2019s stock price has moved up a bit since that announcement. A new developer subscription offer allows developers to create monetary subscriptions to unlock certain experiences, a feature some analysts expect could help the platform grow even more among other generations. Brand interest and risks Brands have growing interest in Roblox, too. The company said it experienced the strongest brand engagements on its platforms during the fourth quarter of 2023, with more than 300 brand activations on the site including those from Ralph Lauren, Nike, Crocs and Lego. Walmart has even joined the Roblox metaverse, adding an experience that allows users to buy physical items and receive them in the mail. Although more brand involvement will likely continue this year, the company will need to ensure users don\u2019t suffer from ad fatigue, according to Mike Proulx, a research director at market research firm Forrester. \u201cAs the company doubles down on advertising as a way to lure in more brands, it needs to balance what might be seen as \u2018easy revenue\u2019 with user experience,\u201d he said. \u201cToo many ads risk user backlash. Brands that want to effectively reach Roblox\u2019s young user base should prioritize creating a value exchange. Programmatic ads alone won\u2019t cut it,\u201d Proulx said. Good timing Roblox\u2019s user growth and emergence as a public company possibly aligns with budding interest in two buzzy industries: artificial intelligence and extended reality (XR), a term that covers virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality. In February, Roblox introduced an AI chatbot that allows users to communicate with each other in real time, regardless of what language they speak. The tool works in 16 languages. The company also previously shared its vision for the expansion of AI on the platform with tools that will \u201cenable every user to become a creator.\u201d At the same time, major tech companies continue to invest in XR, with increased interest due in part to the launch of Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset. The metaverse is attracting renewed interest. \u201cWe can already start to see the performance of the company going up with these new strategy implementations, and I do believe that with the right advertising and the right timings, Roblox will soon be the communication and collaboration platform it is striving to be,\u201d Beinat said. Facing rivals But Roblox also faces challenges from its chief competitor, Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite, and that platform\u2019s Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), a tool that enables creators to build experiences and publish them directly into Fortnite. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely pushing hard to eat Roblox\u2019s lunch, even though the Fortnite player base tends to be older,\u201d said Lewis Ward, director of gaming at market research firm IDC. Epic has also been taking steps to creep in on Roblox\u2019s core user base. In February, the publisher announced it is teaming up with Disney to create open games and entertainment connected to Fortnite, offering users the ability to play, watch, shop and engage with content and characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar and other franchises. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that [Fortnite] intends to go after younger gamers in 2024 and 2025,\u201d Ward said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/tech/roblox-earnings-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

With over 90% of the total vote counted, Mulino secured about 34% of the ballots. His next closest rival, Ricardo Lombana, took second place with about 25%. Mulino has pledged to return the country to its economic heyday and to tackle high unemployment with a plan to incentivize private hiring with government funds. The Central American nation of 4.4 million people, once a GDP leader in the region, is at the crossroads international trade and migration in the region but faces a range of pressing issues from high inflation and unemployment to corruption and water access. \u201cI receive with joy these results, which are the will of the majority of the Panamanian people in our democracy, which I assume with great responsibility and humility as a Panamanian,\u201d Mulino said during his victory speech. He originally ran as the vice-presidential candidate of former President Ricardo Martinelli. After a court sentenced Martinelli to 11 years in prison for money laundering, Mulino moved to the top of the ticket. Martinelli has been holed up in the Nicaraguan embassy in Panama\u2019s capital after he sought asylum following his sentencing. The former leader continued to play a role in the race by endorsing and supporting his former vice-presidential pick. Mulino, who is widely seen as having inherited Martinelli\u2019s popular support, thanked the former president in his victory speech. \u201cTo Ricardo Martinelli: my friend, mission accomplished Ricardo. When you invited me to be vice president, I did not imagine this scenario, but it was my turn, and I took it on with enormous responsibility and humility,\u201d he said. Political pundits have dubbed the election \u201cthe most important since after the US invasion\u201d in 1989. Mulino will take over a country that is polarized and fraught with politician tension and uncertainties. Panama\u2019s economy has slowed dramatically in recent years, with the IMF forecasting GDP growth of only 2.5 percent this year, down from 7.3 percent last year. In March, credit agency Fitch downgraded Panama\u2019s rating to junk status citing \u201cfiscal and governance challenges\u201d after the country closed its largest mine last year. Mulino has also vowed to shut down the Dari\u00e9n Gap, the treacherous stretch of jungle beginning in Panama that\u2019s become a main highway for migrants making their way to the US. More than half a million migrants, mostly from Venezuela, crossed through the Dari\u00e9n Gap in 2023, according to the Panamanian government, doubling the amount recorded in 2022. The US has been working for months with officials in Panama and Colombia, where the jungle ends, to attempt to shut down the route. But Mulino has not said how he would carry out a closure of the jungle to migrants. Water access also topped voter\u2019s minds during the vote, analysts say.

A whirling tendril of air descended from a roiling sky above a southwest suburb of Salt Lake City, punctuating the horizon. It was a tornado \u2013 the first of many over the course of weeks. A tornado frenzy is ongoing in the United States. At least one has been reported every day since the morning of April 25 in Salt Lake City \u2013 a more than two-week streak \u2013 and there have been hundreds. April and May are typically the busiest months for tornadoes in the US, Earth\u2019s tornado epicenter, but the pace since April has been exceptional. The US was behind the typical tornado pace before the streak started, but after more than 300 tornado reports, it is now above it. Meteorologists and engineers sifting through the reports and damage to accurately reconstruct one of Mother Nature\u2019s most violent phenomena have confirmed 200 tornadoes so far during the streak. A prolific tornado outbreak accelerated matters on April 26. A third of the streak\u2019s reported tornadoes happened on that day in the Plains. Sixty-two have been confirmed, including powerful EF3s that carved a path through entire neighborhoods and businesses in Nebraska and decimated the tiny Iowa town of Minden, killing one person there. More than 100 tornadoes hit the Heartland as the streak began at the end of April, a $1 billion disaster on its own, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\u00a0It capped off an April with 300 tornadoes that tore into the earth in more than a dozen states east of the Rockies, the second-most ever recorded in the typically tornadic month. There have been so many tornadoes that a handful of places have been hit or threatened to be hit twice, including Minden. Barnsdall, Oklahoma, is the most devastating example of this dangerous d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. An EF1 tornado hit the town on April 1. A month later, an EF4 tornado with winds of 165 to 175 mph cut through the core of the small town, upending homes and livelihoods. At least one person died. Tornadoes as strong as the one in Barnsdall are exceptionally rare and deadly. Only 2% of tornadoes reach the so-called \u201cviolent\u201d status of EF4 or EF5. This streak has had two. The first hit Marietta, Oklahoma, on April 27, killing one person. It was the first EF4 tornado in the US in more than a year. May only brought more of the same: A rare Level 5 of 5 high risk for severe weather on May 6 spawned the Barnsdall EF4 and the first of four tornado emergencies this week, including the first-ever one in Michigan. The streak continued for a 15th consecutive day Thursday when a tornado was spotted in southern Georgia in the early afternoon. A Level 3 of 5 risk for severe thunderstorms stripes more than 21 million people across the South Thursday, presenting more chances for tornadoes. Tornado chances drop Friday and Saturday, but similar threat levels have still managed to spawn tornadoes during the streak, which carries on.

{"id": "2024_05_06_middleeast_hamas-ceasefire-offer-gaza-war-mime-intl", "text": "When Hamas declared on Monday evening that it has \u201cagreed\u201d to a ceasefire deal, it caught many off guard. Israel was evidently not expecting it, and it was not even immediately clear what Hamas had agreed to. Hamas\u2019 announcement was initially met with jubilation in Gaza and cautious optimism by regional leaders after it was presented as an acceptance of an Israeli proposal. But Israel issued what looked like a holding position, saying that Hamas\u2019 position was \u201cfar from\u201d meeting its demands. And it pressed on with a controversial military operation in Rafah, southern Gaza, conducting air strikes on Monday and seizing control of the Palestinian side of a border crossing with Egypt on Tuesday morning amid intense pressure from his hardline coalition go all-in. At the same time, Israel said that it would send a delegation to Cairo to assess Hamas\u2019 position. The CIA director, Bill Burns, traveled to Cairo on Tuesday and was expected to hold a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv on Wednesday. So what\u2019s going on? What we know about what Hamas is offering Hamas said on Monday that it\u00a0has accepted an Egyptian-Qatari proposal for a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza, which includes a ceasefire, a complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, an exchange of captives, reconstruction of the territory, and the lifting of Israel\u2019s blockade of the enclave. The offer by Hamas would start with the release of 33 hostages from Israel in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners over a 42-day period, and end with the rebuilding of Gaza during \u201ca period of sustainable calm,\u201d according to a document shared with CNN by a regional source familiar with negotiations. A diplomatic source familiar with the talks told CNN earlier that the reference to sustainable calm was \u201ca way to agree to a permanent ceasefire without calling it that.\u201d The deal would be divided into three-phases, each lasting 42 days. It would include an eventual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in the second phase, according to the document seen by CNN. US officials have pushed back on Hamas\u2019 claim that it had \u201cagreed\u201d to a ceasefire deal, instead characterizing the response as a counterproposal with changes. That counterproposal will need further negotiation, they said, and is being treated as a communication tactic to publicly demonstrate that Hamas is willing to make an agreement. Still, the White House said Tuesday that a close reading of Israel and Hamas\u2019 separate negotiating positions indicates the two sides should be able to strike an agreement. What has the response been from Israel and others? Israel says the deal offered by Hamas isn\u2019t what Israel helped craft with Egypt last week, with war cabinet member Benny Gantz saying Monday that Hamas\u2019 version \u201cdoes not correspond to the dialogue that has taken place so far with the mediators and has significant gaps.\u201d Netanyahu said the war cabinet \u201cunanimously determined\u201d that Hamas\u2019 offer was \u201cvery far from Israel\u2019s core demands.\u201d Israel did however send a working-level delegation to Cairo to better understand the Hamas offer and determine whether a deal can be forged. The biggest sticking point is the question of a permanent ceasefire and how to address it in the deal. The Hamas proposal calls for an end to the war, which is a red line for Netanyahu, a senior American official told CNN. Frank Lowenstein, who worked as Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations under US President Barack Obama during the 2014 Israel-Gaza war,\u00a0told CNN that this may be \u201cthe moment of truth for the blame-game both sides have been playing with the ceasefire negotiations.\u201d \u201cHamas has apparently accepted the constructive ambiguity about duration that the mediators have been proposing, along with \u2018guarantees\u2019 of a permanent ceasefire that are obviously not enforceable,\u201d Lowenstein said, adding that it is now up to Netanyahu \u2014 \u201che would much rather invade Rafah for his extremist coalition politics than have a ceasefire that could end the war and likely bring elections.\u201d How are the talks linked to Israel\u2019s Rafah operation? Israel argues that Rafah is Hamas last bastion in Gaza, and last week Netanyahu vowed to launch a ground operation there irrespective of a deal with Hamas and in defiance of US pressure not to go ahead. On Monday evening, the Israeli military conducted air strikes against what it said were Hamas targets in eastern Rafah. By Tuesday morning, it had seized control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, replacing Palestinian flags there with Israeli ones in a show of control. The move followed an order by the Israeli military to about 100,000 residents of northern Rafah to evacuate immediately. The Hamas ceasefire offer was designed to \u201ctorpedo\u201d the Rafah operation, Netanyahu said, and \u201cthat did not happen.\u201d The Rafah crossing is a \u201cstrategic site\u201d for Hamas, Barak Ravid, CNN political and global affairs analyst, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, adding that it is seen as a symbol of Hamas\u2019s continued control of Gaza. Israel\u2019s seizure of the crossing may have damaged Hamas\u2019 image before the Palestinian people in Gaza, and it acts as leverage to make Hamas \u201cmore flexible in hostage talks,\u201d he said. The Rafah operation wasn\u2019t on the scale of a major ground incursion the Biden administration had been warning Israel against, but it may have been designed to appease some of the extremist ministers in Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet who have been pressuring him to press on with an invasion of the city and threatening to collapse his coalition if he doesn\u2019t comply. US officials told CNN Tuesday that the Biden administration doesn\u2019t believe Israeli military activity in Rafah is the beginning of a major operation into southern Gaza and a source familiar with Israeli plans said that a limited incursion into Rafah was intended to keep pressure on Hamas to agree a deal that would bring about a ceasefire and a hostage release. A military operation in Rafah may be in the interest of both Israel and Hamas, said Lowenstein, the former US negotiator. \u201cBibi (Netanyahu) wants to show how tough he is by standing up to us (the US) and the world to defend Israel. And Hamas thinks he\u2019s walking into a trap in Rafah that will leave Israel even more isolated, including from the US, and subject to even greater international condemnation.\u201d What\u2019s at stake for Netanyahu and Hamas? Hamas and Israel have accused each other of obstructing an agreement and prolonging the war. Experts say both sides are pushing for maximalist demands because their political survival depends on it. Netanyahu finds himself in a tough spot. He faces intense pressure from his closest international allies and the families of Israeli hostages to agree to a ceasefire deal and avoid a full-scale invasion of Rafah, as well as the need to oblige hardliners in his fragile coalition who don\u2019t want him to stop until Hamas is eliminated. Hamas may also be wary of its fate if the war ends without a guarantee of a permanent ceasefire. Since the short ceasefire deal in November, Hamas has not been interested in a deal with Israel that doesn\u2019t include a permanent end to hostilities, Lowenstein said, as the group believes that is the only scenario that ensures its survival. \u201cBoth sides only want a ceasefire deal that ensures their political survival,\u201d Lowenstein said. \u201cFor Hamas, that\u2019s a permanent ceasefire that allows them to retain some military capabilities. For Bibi, it\u2019s only a temporary pause on the path to \u2018total victory\u2019.\u201d Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, DC, says that even though both Hamas and Netanyahu believe they have benefited politically from the continuation of the conflict, pressure has been mounting domestically for both to end hostilities. \u201cHamas is under tremendous pressure, including to some extent from its own leaders living outside of Gaza, to accept cease-fire proposals from Egypt and Qatar in order to gain some respite for the organization\u201d and relief for the Palestinians in Gaza, Ibish told CNN. But Hamas may be aware that it has better chances of survival than Netanyahu, even if the group re-emerges in a different form, he says. \u201cHamas will survive. It is a political organization and a brand-name. It is not a list of individuals who can be killed or infrastructure and equipment that can be destroyed,\u201d Ibish said.\u00a0\u201cNetanyahu, on the other hand, both personally and politically will not survive forever.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/middleeast/hamas-ceasefire-offer-gaza-war-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_world_gods-hand-cometary-globule-image-scn", "text": "What appears to be a ghostly hand reaching across the universe toward a defenseless spiral galaxy in a new telescope image is a rarely seen cosmic phenomenon, according to astronomers. The Dark Energy Camera captured a stunning image of \u201cGod\u2019s Hand,\u201d a cometary globule 1,300 light-years from Earth in the Puppis constellation. The camera is mounted on the V\u00edctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. Cometary globules are a type of Bok globule, or dark nebula. These isolated cosmic clouds are filled with dense gas and dust, which are surrounded by hot, energetic material. Cometary globules are unique because they have extended tails, like those seen on comets \u2014 but that\u2019s the only cometlike thing about them. Astronomers still don\u2019t know how cometary globules come to exist in such distinctive structures. Historically, it\u2019s also been hard for scientists to detect the faint clouds. The new image of the glowing red hand-like feature showcases CG 4, one of many cometary globules found across the Milky Way galaxy. The twisting cloud appears to be reaching for a spiral galaxy known as ESO 257-19 (PGC 21338). But the galaxy is more than 100 million light-years away from the cometary globule. CG 4 has a main dusty head, which resembles a hand, that measures 1.5 light-years across, and it has a long tail that stretches for 8 light-years. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, which is 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). A surprising celestial discovery Astronomers first discovered cometary globules by chance in 1976 while looking at images captured by the UK Schmidt Telescope in Australia. These cosmic phenomena are hard to spot because they\u2019re incredibly faint, and the tails of globules are typically blocked from view by stellar dust. But the Dark Energy Camera has a special filter that can detect the incredibly dim red glow emitted by ionized hydrogen, which is present in the outer rim and head of CG 4. Hydrogen only produces such a telltale red glow after being hit with radiation from nearby hot, massive stars. While stellar radiation enables the cometary globule to be visible, it is also destroying the globule\u2019s head over time. However, there is enough gas and dust within the globule to aid in the birth of several stars the size of our sun. Cometary globules can be found across our galaxy, but most are in the Gum Nebula, a glowing cloud of gas believed to be the slowly expanding remains of a stellar explosion from about 1 million years ago. The Gum Nebula is believed to contain 31 cometary globules in addition to CG 4. Astronomers think there are a couple of ways that the globules may form their distinctive, cometlike shapes. The globules might have once been round-shaped nebulas, such as the iconic Ring Nebula, that were disrupted over time by a supernova \u2014 maybe even the one that formed the Gum Nebula. But the cosmic phenomena may also be the result of the winds and radiation released from nearby hot, massive stars. Astronomers believe stars might be the underlying cause because all the cometary globules found in the Gum Nebula have tails pointing away from the nebula\u2019s center. And at the center of the nebula is the supernova remnant as well as a pulsar, or a rapidly spinning neutron star that formed when a much larger star collapsed and exploded.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/world/gods-hand-cometary-globule-image-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
