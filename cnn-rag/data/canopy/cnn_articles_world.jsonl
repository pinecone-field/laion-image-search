The 311-foot-long frigate Sahand was at a dock in the port of Bandar Abbas when it \u201clost its balance\u201d after water leaked into its tanks, according to a report from the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). A photo from the semi-official Tasnim News Agency showed the warship, with a displacement of about 2,000 tons, resting on its left side in the Bandar Abbas port. The ship, which Tasnim\u00a0said entered service in December 2018, is one of the bigger vessels in Iran\u2019s fleet, equipped with antiship cruise missiles and an electronic warfare system. Naval analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, said it would take Iran four to six months to repair the ship once it can be refloated. \u201cSeawater severely damages electronics and gets into everything. So, all electronics will have to be removed and chemically cleaned to remove the salt,\u201d he said. It also affects mechanical parts, which could lead to engine failure if the parts are not thoroughly cleaned, he added. \u201cSalt encrustation destroys piston linings and turbine blades and interferes with combustion so if they take short cuts to get that ship back into service, they will pay a heavy price for doing so,\u201d Schuster said. Ships like the Sahand tend to have a lot of \u201ctop hamper,\u201d weight from electronics and weapons above their center of gravity, Schuster said. If lower fuel tanks are emptied, something prudent during a repair process, the higher up weight should have been removed to keep the ship in balance, he said. \u201cOtherwise, you risk capsizing the ship, particularly if there are high winds,\u201d he said. Capsizing, not sinking Schuster said the photo released by Tasnim suggests the ship rolled over quickly, rather than sinking and settling on the relatively shallow harbor bottom at Bandar Abbas. \u201cIts motion (was) stopped only by the mast and stack encountering the harbor bottom,\u201d he said. Several people sustained minor injuries in the incident and were taken to a hospital, IRNA reported. The Iranian news agency reports said the warship was \u201cbeing returned to balance.\u201d That\u2019s a process likely to take a week or more, according to Schuster, with cranes, floatation bladders and portable pumps needed. The Sahand is the most recent ship to carry that name for the Iranian navy. The previous Sahand was sunk by the US Navy in 1988 during Operation Praying Mantis, which launched after a US frigate was crippled by an Iranian mine in the Persian Gulf.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/middleeast/iranian-warship-sahand-capsizes-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

It said that under the memorandum of understanding the US would also support Panama with \u201cequipment, transportation and logistics\u201d regarding foreigners found \u201cin violation of the immigration laws of Panama.\u201d Panama agreed to \u201ccomply with all international agreements and conventions on the rights of immigrants and those in refugee status,\u201d it added. Panama is home to the Dari\u00e9n Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, that has seen an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. News of the agreement comes after Panama\u2019s new President Jose Raul Mulino vowed on Monday that the Central American nation would no longer be a country of transit for migrants. \u201cI will not allow Panama to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,\u201d Mulino said at his swearing-in ceremony. \u201cPanama will no longer be a transit country for illegals,\u201d he said amid cheers from those present. \u201cThe numbers of illegal immigrants passing through the Dari\u00e9n are shocking,\u201d Mulino said, adding that he intends to \u201cappeal to international solidarity regarding the cause that generates the problem and will seek solutions with the countries involved, especially with the United States, which is the final destination of such immigrants.\u201d Mulino said that he\u2019s seen first-hand \u201cthe magnitude of the problem and the dimension of the humanitarian and environmental crisis\u201d that migration causes to the Dari\u00e9n Gap. \u201cThe Dari\u00e9n must continue to be a great green lung, not only for us but for the entire region.

{"id": "2024_07_09_sport_netherlands-joost-luiten-to-miss-olympics", "text": "Dutch golfer Joost Luiten will not be competing in this month\u2019s Olympic Games after the International Olympic Committee ruled it would not expand the field to include him, despite qualifying and winning a court case that seemed set to send him to Paris. Luiten announced last month that the Dutch Olympic Committee would not allow him to take a place on the country\u2019s team that is competing in the golf competition, despite the fact that he met the International Golf Federation\u2019s criteria for entry. In an Instagram post last month, Luiten wrote that the Dutch Olympic Committee had its own criteria \u2013 a good chance to finish in the top eight of the competition \u2013 and denied him because it did not feel he would be able to finish that strongly. Luiten went to court to challenge the decision, calling it \u201cmindblowing\u201d and \u201cso sad and painful.\u201d And last week, it seemed as if his ticket was punched \u2013 a Dutch court handed him a victory, requiring him to be added to the Dutch team going to the Olympics. But on Tuesday, Luiten\u2019s Olympic dreams appeared to die once again. The International Golf Federation said in a statement that the spot Luiten had earned had been given to another player because of the Dutch Olympic Committee\u2019s original decision to exclude him from competing. \u201cThe IGF was not a party to the legal action brought forth by Luiten in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, in an effort to support Luiten, the IGF sought an exception from the IOC to increase the field size of the men\u2019s Olympic golf competition from 60 to 61 competitors to include Luiten, however the request was denied by the IOC today,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe IGF has advised Luiten of the IOC\u2019s decision, and he has not informed the IGF whether he intends to pursue this matter further.\u201d In a statement, the Dutch Olympic Committee said Luiten\u2019s description of why he was initially left off the team was accurate, saying he was not selected because he didn\u2019t meet national performance requirements. The committee recognized that it had amended its national requirements halfway through the qualification process for the golf competition, which Luiten found unfair and a judge agreed. The statement said the Dutch committee immediately complied with the court\u2019s ruling, but the International committee made the final decision to exclude Luiten from competition. The Dutch Olympic Committee \u201cunderstands very well how\u00a0extremely disappointing and frustrating\u00a0it must be\u00a0for golfer Joost Luiten that he cannot participate in the Olympic Games in Paris,\u201d the statement read. According to the International Golf Federation, Luiten had finished 40th in the final men\u2019s Olympic Golf Ranking. That would have comfortably put him in the 60-man field for the competition, which is set to take place from on August 1-4 at Le Golf National in Guyancourt, France, southwest of Paris. Luiten, a 38-year-old who went pro in 2006, said last week that he was excited to play in the Olympics despite the ordeal. \u201cI love sports and the Olympics is the biggest sport event in the world. Golfers understand majors but people that don\u2019t play golf, they don\u2019t understand the majors they understand the Olympics, and it\u2019s just something that I want to be a part of,\u201d Luiten told the European Tour\u2019s website. He noted that he played in the Olympics in 2016 during the Rio de Janeiro Games, and was ready to represent his country once again. \u201cIt\u2019s very painful when basically one or two people say you\u2019re not good enough when you\u2019ve met the criteria,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t fair, and it was great that the judge saw that as well and that it shows that they can\u2019t do whatever they want. They still need to explain why they are making certain decisions, and I think that\u2019s the good thing about this.\u201d Luiten has not immediately commented on the IOC\u2019s decision.

{"id": "2024_07_08_europe_france-election-what-next-explainer-intl", "text": "On Sunday night, joy: French voters had, once again, kept the far right out of power. On Monday morning, uncertainty: A hung parliament, shaky alliances and the threat of turbulent years ahead. President Emmanuel Macron called France\u2019s snap parliamentary election to \u201cclarify\u201d the political situation. But after the shock second-round results, the waters are more muddied than they have been in decades. While a surge in support for the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition foiled Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party, French politics is now more disordered than it was before the vote. So, what did we learn last night, who might be France\u2019s next prime minister, and has Macron\u2019s gamble \u201cpaid off?\u201d A shock victory, but not a decisive one After leading the first round of voting last Sunday, the RN was closer to the gates of power than ever before, and was on the cusp of forming France\u2019s first far-right government since the collaborationist Vichy regime of World War II. But after a week of political bargaining, in which more than 200 left-wing and centrist candidates withdrew from the second round in a bid to avoid splitting the vote, the NFP \u2013 a cluster of several parties from the extreme left to the more moderate \u2013 emerged with the most seats in the decisive second round. The NFP won 182 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest group in the 577-seat parliament. Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance, which trailed in a distant third in the first round, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. And the RN and its allies, despite leading the first round, won 143 seats. Does that mean the NFP \u201cwon\u201d the election? Not quite. Although the coalition has the most seats, it fell well short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, meaning France now has a hung parliament. If this was a victory for anything, it was the \u201ccordon sanitaire,\u201d the principle that mainstream parties must unite to prevent the extreme right from taking office. The far right kept at bay, but more potent than ever It was meant to be a coronation. Crowds of supporters had crammed into election night events at the RN party HQ in Paris and at outposts all over the country, to watch the moment many felt had been decades in the making: Confirmation that their party, and its long-taboo brand of anti-immigrant politics, had won the most seats in the French parliament. That wasn\u2019t to be. The fervent atmosphere soured as supporters saw the RN had slumped to third place. Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old leader handpicked by Le Pen to freshen the party\u2019s image and purge it of its racist and antisemitic roots, was dyspeptic. He railed against the \u201cdangerous electoral deals\u201d made between the NFP and Ensemble which had \u201cdeprived the French people\u201d of an RN-led government. \u201cBy deciding to deliberately paralyze our institutions, Emmanuel Macron has now pushed the country towards uncertainty and instability,\u201d Bardella said, dismissing the NFP as an \u201calliance of dishonor.\u201d Still, the RN\u2019s success should not be underestimated. In the 2017 elections, when Macron swept to power, the RN won just eight seats. In 2022, it surged to 89 seats. In Sunday\u2019s vote, it won 125 \u2013 making it the largest individual party. That unity means it will likely remain a potent force in the next parliament, while the solidity of the leftist coalition remains untested. Will the left remain united? A month ago, the NFP did not exist. Now, it is the largest bloc in the French parliament and could provide France with its next prime minister. It chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. Sunday\u2019s results mean it has done so again. But while it achieved its founding purpose, it is unclear whether this capacious \u2013 and potential fractious \u2013 coalition will hold. The hastily assembled bloc comprises several parties: the far-left France Unbowed party; the Socialists; the green Ecologists; the center-left Place Publique and others. This many-headed hydra does not speak with a single voice. Each party celebrated the results at their own campaign events, rather than together. Two of its most prominent figures \u2013 Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the populist France Unbowed leader, and Raphael Glucksmann, the more moderate leader of Place Publique \u2013 are barely on speaking terms. Disagreements over economic and foreign policies could spill over, as the NFP\u2019s expansive spending plans \u2013 which include raising the minimum wage, capping the price of certain foods and energy and scrapping Macron\u2019s pension reforms \u2013 collide with the European Union\u2019s restrictive fiscal rules and France\u2019s need to rein in its ballooning deficit. A better night for Macron than expected, but he emerges weakened Macron once said his thoughts are \u201ctoo complex\u201d for journalists. Still, his decision to call a snap election \u2013 three years earlier than necessary, and with his party way behind in the polls \u2013 baffled the sharpest of political analysts, caught even his closest allies off guard and left many French voters confused. He called the vote minutes after his party was trounced by the RN in last month\u2019s European Parliament elections. Although European results need have no bearing on domestic politics, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent to him by voters and wanted to clarify the situation. But Sunday\u2019s results suggest he has achieved the opposite. \u00c9duoard Philippe, France\u2019s former prime minister and an ally of Macron, said what was \u201cintended as a clarification has instead led to great vagueness.\u201d Although Macron\u2019s party recovered from the first round, it lost around 100 seats compared to the 2022 election. Where does France go from here? Macron\u2019s first decision is to appoint a new prime minister. He has already delayed this process by declining Gabriel Attal\u2019s resignation, asking him to stay in office for now. Typically, the French president appoints a prime minister from the largest bloc in parliament. But it is unclear from which party within the NFP this will be. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s party won the most seats within the NFP, but Macron\u2019s allies have repeatedly refused to work with France Unbowed, saying it is just as extreme \u2013 and therefore as unfit to govern \u2013 as the RN. In order to reach the majority needed to pass laws, the NFP will likely have to enter into alliances with Ensemble \u2013 as two coalitions enter an even larger coalition, straddling vast ideological ground. Finding common ground will be a fraught task, meaning gridlock is likely. Without a clear majority, a minority government faces the risk of no-confidence votes as soon as this month, which could lead to several governments replacing each other. One way out could be a \u201ctechnocratic\u201d government, which would involve Macron appointing ministers with no party affiliation to manage day-to-day matters. But these can come to seem undemocratic and can further fan the flames of populism. Just look at Italy: after the premiership of Mario Draghi, the technocrat par excellence, the country elected its most far-right government since Benito Mussolini. While France avoided a far-right government for now, the RN threat is likely to remain strong.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/europe/france-election-what-next-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_asia_india-narendra-modi-russia-visit-intl", "text": "India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Russia on Monday for his first visit to the country since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a sign that the two nations remain close despite the Kremlin\u2019s deepening dependence on China. During his two-day visit, Modi is expected to attend a private dinner hosted by Vladimir Putin and hold talks with the Russian president, according to India\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. The summit will \u201cprovide an opportunity to the two leaders to review the whole range of bilateral issues,\u201d Jaiswal told reporters in New Delhi last week, adding that Modi and Putin will \u201calso share perspectives on regional and global developments of mutual interest.\u201d India remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment and has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin\u2019s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces isolation from the West. Trade between the two countries was worth nearly $65 billion in 2023-24, primarily due to strong energy cooperation,\u00a0but most of that total flowed toward Russia, Jaiswal said. Reducing the trade imbalance would be a \u201cmatter of priority\u201d in Modi\u2019s discussions with Putin, he added. Modi last met with Putin on the sidelines of the 2022 SCO meeting in Uzbekistan, when he told the Russian leader: \u201cNow is not the time for war.\u201d But while India has called for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and restoration of peace, it has also abstained from all resolutions on Ukraine at the United Nations and stopped short of condemning Russia\u2019s invasion. \u201cI look forward to reviewing all aspects of bilateral cooperation with my friend President Vladimir Putin and sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues,\u201d Modi said in a statement from his office before departing for Russia. \u201cWe seek to play a supportive role for a peaceful and stable region.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking in the wake of Russia\u2019s deadly attacks on Ukraine Monday, said it was a \u201chuge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\u201d Following Modi\u2019s arrival, Putin showed the Indian leader around his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo in the Moscow region. They greeted each other with a hug, chatted over tea and rode around in an electric vehicle. Putin also showed Modi the stables and they watched a horse show. The trip is Modi\u2019s first bilateral visit since winning a third consecutive term in a massive general election last month and is seen as a rare break in convention for an Indian leader who typically travels to neighboring countries such as Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The visit also comes as Russia draws ever closer to China, potentially making New Delhi uncomfortable due to its longstanding Himalayan border dispute with Beijing, which has simmered in recent years. Modi\u2019s trip follows Putin\u2019s return from Kazakhstan, where the Russian leader last week attended the annual leaders\u2019 meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a bloc of Eurasian countries spearheaded by China and Russia, at which he claimed\u00a0Moscow-Beijing relations were experiencing \u201cthe best period in their history.\u201d For India, that burgeoning relationship is \u201ca matter of deep concern,\u201d\u00a0said Nandan Unnikrishnan, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. \u201cThat is one of the reasons that Mr. Modi is undertaking this trip because traditionally, the Soviet Union and then subsequently Russia, has been a balancer in our relationship with China, which has been not the best since the late \u201950s of the last century,\u201d he said. Despite India being an SCO member, Modi was visibly absent from the meeting in Kazakhstan, indicating to some analysts that the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy does not view the bloc as an effective channel through which New Delhi can pursue its interests. Modi\u2019s visit to Russia is also widely seen as the latest dent in efforts by Western leaders to cast Putin aside. Despite undermining Western sanctions by purchasing large quantities of Russian oil, New Delhi has remained close with the United States, a key partner as both countries share concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi met with US President Joe Biden during a\u00a0state visit to Washington\u00a0in June last year, in a trip further cementing their defense, trade and technology partnership. The Indian leader also addressed Congress during that trip, an honor typically reserved for close US allies and partners, and attended a lavish state dinner. India is a member of the Quad security grouping with the US, Japan and Australia. Later that year, Putin did not attend the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in New Delhi, during which leaders delivered a consensus statement criticizing his invasion of Ukraine. Following his Russia trip, Modi will visit Austria in the Indian leader\u2019s first visit to the European nation, according to his office.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/asia/india-narendra-modi-russia-visit-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_canada-dream-supersonic-bomber-avro-arrow", "text": "It was meant to be one of the most advanced aircraft of its era, dispatching the threat of Soviet nuclear bombers and making Canada a world leader in military aviation and engineering. The Avro Arrow, also known as the CF-105, had a lot resting on its wings. However, the dream turned into a nightmare when the program was canceled less than a year after the plane\u2019s first flight, and well before it entered into service. To this day, 65 years later, the Avro Arrow remains one of Canada\u2019s biggest collective regrets and still fuels public discourse, as recently unveiled documents have shed some light on exactly what happened to the doomed project. \u201cThis aircraft was completely Canadian,\u201d says Richard Mayne, chief historian of the Royal Canadian Air Force, \u201cand the performance markers during its development very much showed that it was at least on par with the most advanced designs of the time.\u201d \u201cWhen it got canceled, that was one of Canada\u2019s \u2019what if\u2019 moments,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe Arrow has still got a grip on our national psyche.\u201d Cold War threat The Avro Arrow was a direct response to the perceived threat from the Soviet Union, following the end of World War II, of bombers capable of flying over the Arctic and reaching North America with a nuclear payload. \u201cThe Royal Canadian Air Force put out a requirement in 1952 for an interceptor capable of Mach 2 speed and an altitude of 50,000 feet,\u201d Mayne tells CNN. \u201cThey needed something fast that had the range and the altitude to intercept these Soviet bombers as far north as possible, before they reached Canada.\u201d Aircraft manufacturer Avro Canada had just successfully put into service the CF-100 Canuck, a versatile twinjet fighter designed and built in Canada, and was tasked with developing a vastly more advanced version of it. It was an ambitious plan that came at a significant moment for Canada. \u201cThe country had emerged from the Second World War as a major player,\u201d says Mayne. \u201cWe had the third largest navy in the world, the fourth largest air force. But Canadian citizenship didn\u2019t actually exist until 1947 \u2013 Canada had just come of age.\u201d Development started in 1955, and in record time the first Arrow was rolled out to the public, on October 4, 1957 \u2013 the same day as the launch of the Sputnik I, the world\u2019s first artificial satellite, which marked the start of the space age. \u201cIt was a coincidence,\u201d says Mayne, \u201cbut a horrible one, because Sputnik demonstrated that you could put a nuclear payload on the rocket that sent it into orbit. And the Arrow wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything about intercontinental ballistic missiles.\u201d Dead on arrival Designed for a crew of two and sporting a \u201cdelta\u201d wing design and a white livery that gave it an elegant look, the Arrow was just under 78 feet long with a wingspan of 50 feet, making it comparatively larger than both its predecessor, the CF-100 Canuck, and the Phantom F4, a dominant American fighter plane that would enter service in 1961. It first flew on March 25, 1958, but by that time, Mayne says, strategic thinkers, senior military personnel and politicians already believed the world had entered a \u201cpush button\u201d warfare scenario, where the nuclear threat was restricted to long-range missiles, with interceptors and bombers no longer playing a dominant role. \u201cThat turned out to be false, because the bomber threat continued and it continues to this day, but that was the thinking at the time,\u201d says Mayne. The plane had lost relevance, and the ballooning costs of the project and the changing political climate did the rest. On February 29, 1959, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker canceled the program, and within weeks the five planes that had been built, along with most of the assembly line, were destroyed for fear that they could be the subject of Soviet espionage. As a result, thousands of jobs were lost and Avro Canada eventually collapsed entirely. \u201cIf the United Kingdom had bought some Arrows, that actually might have saved the program,\u201d says Mayne. \u201cBut with no foreign contracts, our country was too small to support such an advanced technology. We were shooting for the stars, which is ironic because a lot of Avro engineers later went down to NASA and helped with the Apollo program.\u201d A life of its own Rumors and myths immediately began to swirl around the reasons for the abrupt cancellation of the program, some of which persist to this day. \u201cThe aircraft has taken on almost a mythological standing in Canada,\u201d says Alan Barnes, a senior fellow at Ottawa\u2019s Carleton University who has looked at the role played by intelligence in the decision to stop the plane\u2019s development. One set of myths, according to Barnes, essentially blames the United States for misleading Canada on the shifting Soviet threat, supposedly because they didn\u2019t want Canada to produce an aircraft that would have been better than American ones. Another says Canadian intelligence analysts deliberately misconstrued information to support a decision that the government had essentially made, providing an excuse for it. \u201cBut all of this was speculation, as nobody had actually seen the intelligence reports,\u201d he says. But in 2023, Barnes published a paper on those reports, after retrieving archival documents that show a clear link between the intelligence and how it was used by those in charge at the time. \u201cAt the beginning, the air force really didn\u2019t pay any attention to intelligence,\u201d he tells CNN. \u201cThey decided they wanted a big new fancy plane, so they came up with all the operational requirements largely in isolation, without really paying attention to what the reports were saying.\u201d By the late 1950s, he adds, the Arrow arrow was getting very expensive and quite delayed. \u201cCanadian intelligence produced a very high quality assessment in early 1958, saying the bomber threat was nowhere near as serious as previously thought, and that the Soviets weren\u2019t building up a massive bomber force, and were likely to shift their production and research into missiles,\u201d says Barnes. The policy implication was that if a threat was being reduced, there was very little reason to be spending so much money on an aircraft that wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with the ballistic missiles. \u201cBy the summer of 1958, the Chiefs of Staff Committee had come to the conclusion that they could no longer recommend continuing with the program, but didn\u2019t want to cancel it right then because of the political impact,\u201d says Barnes. \u201cThey sort of delayed things into early 1959, when it was still seen publicly as a disaster for Canadian industry as well as a political scandal. The government did what they needed to do, but it blew up in their face. They lost the election a couple of years later, to a certain extent on these defense issues.\u201d According to Barnes, the aircraft was never as good as people made it out to be. \u201cIt was canceled at just the right time to maintain this kind of mythology,\u201d he says. \u201cIt never flew with any of its armaments and the actual engines that it was designed to use. Everything was potential, so many Canadians can still pretend that this would have been the best aircraft in the world.\u201d Enduring impact In 1997, the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) commissioned a TV miniseries about the plane titled \u201cThe Arrow\u201d starring Dan Aykroyd as Crawford Gordon, president of Avro Canada. A full-size wooden model of the aircraft was built for the production and is currently in the archives of the Reynolds Museum in Wetaskiwin, Alberta. Another model, made of aircraft-grade aluminum, is on display at the Edenvale Aerodrome in Stayner, Ontario. A third model, about two-thirds the size of a real Arrow, is under construction at Springbank Airport in Calgary \u2013 but this one is meant to actually fly. It\u2019s the passion project of a group of engineers who are hoping to take it to the skies by 2026. Although none of the actual Arrows have survived intact, the original cockpit and nose gear of one of them as well as parts of the wings of another are on display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. Perhaps the strongest indication of Canada\u2019s obsession with the Arrow came in 2018, when after a year of searching, sunken Arrow models were recovered from the bottom of Lake Ontario. The models were fired across the lake as part of flight tests in the mid-1950s, and numerous groups had been looking for them before without success. The endeavor was funded out of pocket by John Burzynski, a Canadian mining businessman. \u201cThe significance of finding the models lies in reminding Canadians of the great effort that went into designing, testing, building and flying an advanced technological aircraft, all done in a short six-year timeframe,\u201d Burzynski says, adding that among the pieces discovered was one of the very first test models, substantially intact, which is now on display at the Canadian Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. Speaking of the importance and role of the Arrow in Canadian history, Burzynski says that everything was possible to the generation that followed World War II, and the world was changing quickly. \u201cThe massive effort that went into the Arrow program was essentially a live exercise, showing that anything is possible when enough effort and ingenuity is applied to a problem,\u201d he says. \u201cTo many it seems that this would have been an inflection point for Canada to develop both a vigorous air and possibly even space program, had it not been abruptly canceled.\u201d CORRECTION: An earlier headline on this story mischaracterized the Avro Arrow. It was an interceptor aircraft.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc", "text": "During a visit to a local farm while working with development agency USAID, Ugandan entrepreneur Juliet Tumusiime realized that a huge amount of banana stems are left over from banana cultivation and simply discarded. Looking for a way to use the waste, she struck upon an innovative business idea. Almost a decade later, now aged 42, Tumusiime is the chief executive and co-founder of Cheveux Organique, which manufactures hair made from banana fibers as an alternative to synthetic extensions. Fashion trends among the younger population and growing purchasing power have boosted the market for hair extensions and wigs in the Africa and the Middle East, which could be worth $710 million by 2028, according to Research and Markets. Extensions are typically made from human hair, or synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, acrylic and PVC. Synthetics are popular in Uganda because they\u2019re much cheaper, but they\u2019re not biodegradable or easy to recycle. Some people complain that synthetic hair can irritate their scalp and a study of synthetic hair in Nigeria found the presence of potentially harmful heavy metals and chemicals. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to friends, colleagues, both men and women and asked them how they dispose of their hair when they take it out,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cA lot of the time it is just thrown in the trash. The level of awareness is really low - most people don\u2019t realize that they are wearing plastic on their head which can irritate the skin and cause pollution. \u201cOur mission is to transform the beauty industry by providing alternatives that benefit their health and the environment. We want to empower women to make informed decisions about what hair they use and what\u2019s best for them.\u201d Tumusiime says that, unlike synthetic hair, her product is biodegradable, durable and can be easily styled, treated and colored. It can also be rewashed with warm water and conditioned with detangling cream. When dry, the hypoallergenic hair can be oiled and can withstand dryers and heat up to 400 degrees, lasting weeks longer than synthetic alternatives, according to Tumusiime. Since it\u2019s made from discarded banana stems, she adds, it\u2019s also a way to help curb that waste. Uganda is Africa\u2019s largest producer and consumer of bananas, producing about 10 million metric tons of bananas per day. Ugandans consume almost one kilogram of the fruit per person, per day, with more than 75% of the population relying on bananas as a staple food, according to the World Economic Forum. Cheveux Organique works closely with local banana farmers, buying stems that would otherwise be discarded. The stems are split and the fibers extracted by machine. The extracted fibers are then dried and treated, before being combed out, resulting in the hair-like texture. The \u201chair\u201d is dyed into three shades: Cheveux Black, Cheveux Brown and Cheveux Blonde. Tumusiime says it has a natural sheen, is soft to the touch and can be used for braiding and styling. It\u2019s also suitable for warm and humid climates, she notes. The company isn\u2019t unique in creating plant-based hair. In the US, St.Louis-based Rebundle also sells hair extensions made from banana fibers, while Nourie Hair offers a hair alternative for braiding made from Ginseng root extract and rosemary. However, turning banana waste into a premium product does not come without challenges for Cheveux Organique. \u201cThe labor-intensive process, from picking the stems, transporting them to the facility, extracting the stems, treating them and the power needed to use this \u2013 it causes the product to become pricey,\u201d Tumusiime says. Cheveux Organique sells its plant-based hair in Uganda, and as fair afield as the US, France and the UK. It retails for $50 for 150 grams (5.3 ounces), which Tumusiime says is cheaper than a typical $185 for a similar amount of human hair. But synthetic hair can be bought for as little as $1 for a bundle. \u201cThis is something that we are hugely concerned about, and we are trying to find ways to mechanize the business and produce volumes of hair whilst continuing to break even,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cThe people paying these prices are getting a premium product at the end of it \u2013 and it\u2019s about the long-term benefits that this product brings.\u201d Tumusiime says her startup, which currently employs 25 permanent staff members and 100 part-time workers for waste gathering, is in the process of creating regional hubs, which will function as extraction centers, as well as an education point for young people. The hubs will train future generations on the positive impacts of waste management, as well as giving young people skillsets \u2013 such as extraction and machine operation \u2013 that will equip them for future careers. \u201cWe want to make sure that this brand is a household name,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cWe want to become leaders in this industry despite challenges. But I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not about to give up. I do everything possible to make sure that I achieve my objectives and achieve the vision for which I started this organization.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_05_uk_labour-gaza-israel-vote-uk-election-gbr-intl", "text": "Despite Labour\u2019s landslide win in the UK general election, the party lost several seats after a strong showing from pro-Palestinian independent candidates, in a sign of anger towards Keir Starmer over Labour\u2019s position on Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Five independent candidates who have been vocal in their support for Gaza won parliamentary seats, while a surge in votes for independents elsewhere denied Labour a victory in areas they were expected to win, leaving a small dent in its otherwise huge majority but raising questions about its foreign policy positions. In Leicester South, a seat in an industrial city in the English Midlands, Labour shadow cabinet member Jonathan Ashworth lost his seat by 979 votes to Shockat Adam, an independent candidate who made his support for Gaza a key part of his electoral pledge to voters. \u201cThis is for Gaza,\u201d Adam declared in his victory speech. Ashworth\u2019s defeat comes as a huge shock. At the last general election, when Labour slumped to its worst defeat since 1935 under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, Ashworth still won the seat with a huge majority, receiving 67% of the vote. In Islington North, Corbyn was reelected to the seat he has held since 1983 \u2013 but this time as an independent, rather than for Labour. Corbyn, who was Labour leader between 2015 and 2020, was expelled from the party after the UK\u2019s human rights watchdog found Labour to be responsible for \u201cunlawful\u201d acts of harassment and discrimination under his leadership, when complaints of antisemitism proliferated. Corbyn won 49.2% of the vote, while the Labour candidate came in second with 34.4%. Corbyn said the voters of Islington North were \u201clooking for a government that on the world stage will search for peace, not war, and not allow the terrible conditions to go on that are happening in Gaza at the present time.\u201d In Blackburn, Labour incumbent Kate Hollern \u2013 who won a majority of 18,304 at the 2019 general election \u2013 lost by just 132 votes to independent candidate Adnan Hussain. In Dewsbury and Batley, the independent Iqbal Mohamed also defeated Labour incumbent Heather Iqbal. And in Birmingham Perry Barr, independent Ayoub Khan defeated Labour incumbent Khalid Mahmood by 507 votes. Meanwhile, in Chingford and Woodford Green, a constituency in east London, the left-wing vote was split between Labour and Faiza Shaheen \u2013 a candidate who stood as an independent after being ousted by Labour during the campaign \u2013 allowing the Conservative incumbent Iain Duncan Smith to retain his seat by about 5,000 votes. \u201cOur vote was a combination of those appalled by how I was treated, those who took issue with having an imposed candidate who didn\u2019t know us, those who were never going to vote Labour after Starmer\u2019s stance on Gaza, and those that have never voted before,\u201d Shaheen wrote on X after the result. \u201cLabour split the vote the moment they deselected me.\u201d Anger over Labour\u2019s Gaza position Labour had feared that it could lose votes over Gaza since Starmer drew criticism in some quarters over comments made last year, shortly after Hamas launched its October 7 attack on Israel and Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza. Speaking to UK radio station LBC in October, Starmer \u2013 a former human rights lawyer \u2013 said Israel \u201chas the right\u201d to withhold power and water from Palestinian civilians in Gaza, but added: \u201cObviously, everything should be done within international law.\u201d The comment caused outrage among many left-wing and Muslim voters, leading to furious protests outside the constituency offices of several Labour Members of Parliament (MPs) and complaints of harassment. The anger was compounded after the party refused to back a Scottish National Party (SNP) motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. Labour did, however, pass its own similar motion shortly afterwards. Many of these seats where Labour appears to have lost votes over its position on Gaza have sizable Muslim populations. According to the 2021 census, the populations of Leicester, Birmingham, Ilford and Blackburn are all more than 20% Muslim. Labour lawmakers cling on Wes Streeting, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary set to play a leading role in Starmer\u2019s next government, clung onto his seat in Ilford North by just 528 votes, ahead of the independent candidate Leanne Mohamad in second. On a visit to the constituency before the election, CNN spoke to Mohamad while she was door-knocking in search of votes. She said, after Streeting abstained from a vote on a Gaza ceasefire, she decided to enter politics and abdicate from Labour. \u201cAs a Palestinian, that place is no longer for me\u2026 The Labour party does not represent us,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cMy family were expelled and forced out of Palestine in 1948. My grandparents never thought they\u2019d see something worse than that.\u201d \u201cAll they wanted was their politician to vote for a ceasefire. No to killing, no to more violence. No to more bombs, and they couldn\u2019t even bring themselves to do that,\u201d she said. Meanwhile Jess Phillips, also a prominent Labour figure, won her Birmingham Yardley seat by just 693 votes. Her closest opponent, Jody McIntyre, stood not as an independent but for the Workers Party of Britain, a fringe party that \u201cmakes no apology for our support for Palestine and the people of Gaza.\u201d As her victory speech was met with loud boos and chants of \u201cShame\u201d and \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d a visibly angry Phillips described the harassment she and her staff had faced during the campaign. \u201cThis election has been the worst election I have ever stood in. Today, a brilliant community activist who puts on events for every single part of our community, came out to campaign with me, and people filmed her on the street and then slashed her tires,\u201d Phillips said. Phillips broke party rank in November by voting for the SNP motion calling for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d in Gaza, but she has continued to face abuse \u2013 like many female candidates, she said. \u201cThe women in this election campaign have fared considerably worse than any of the men in our city with regard to the threat and aggression,\u201d Phillips later told ITV.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/labour-gaza-israel-vote-uk-election-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

The guns were sold at French auction house Osenat in Fontainebleau, just outside Paris, on Sunday. They were originally valued at an estimated \u20ac1.2 million-\u20ac1.5 million ($1.3 million- $1.63 million). According to the auctioneer, they were given to Napoleon\u2019s friend and squire Armand de Caulaincourt just after the emperor attempted suicide in April 1814. Leading up to this date, Napoleon had fought a series of battles against a coalition of European states formed in response to his invasion of Russia. Despite Napoleon winning a number of these battles, Paris fell to the allied coalition on March 31, 1814. In the days before the suicide attempt, Caulaincourt said, \u201cNapoleon had been talking about how to kill himself for days,\u201d according to Osenat. The emperor \u201chad frequently examined his pistols, removing bullets from his n\u00e9cessaire\u201d during this time, Osenat reports Caulaincourt as saying. Eventually, Osenat says, Napoleon tried to kill himself using poison after signing the Treaty of Fontainebleau.

{"id": "2024_07_09_middleeast_gaza-city-idf-israel-evacuation-intl-latam", "text": "Yet again, tens of thousands of people in Gaza are on the move, as the Israeli military issues fresh evacuation orders for a number of areas in Gaza City. Over the past 10 days, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has issued instructions for hundreds of thousands of people in Khan Younis in the south, Shujaya in central Gaza and\u00a0the several neighborhoods of Gaza City to leave. The effect has been to increase the total number of displaced people in Gaza, from 1.7 million in May to an estimated 1.9 million now, according to the UN. Approximately nine out of 10 people in Gaza are now estimated to be internally displaced, many of them multiple times. \u201cMass displacement has been predominantly driven by evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military, extensive destruction of both private and public infrastructure, restricted access to essential services, and the persistent fear of ongoing hostilities,\u201d according to the most recent assessment by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). It\u2019s unclear how many people in Gaza City have heeded the latest evacuation order. Many civilians are wary of leaving whatever shelter they have for an uncertain journey to an even more uncertain fate living on the streets or in the overcrowded, unsanitary tent villages that pop up with each evacuation order. The IDF has said that evacuation orders are necessary so that civilians don\u2019t get caught up in its renewed operations in areas where Hamas is seeking to re-establish a presence. The IDF insists it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. Hamas has said the evacuations threaten to return negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage deal to \u201cpoint zero.\u201d Khader Al Za\u2019anoun, a journalist with Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, told CNN that late on Sunday people in the Tuffah, Old City and Daraj neighborhoods had been instructed to move to \u201cknown shelters in the west of Gaza City.\u201d But he said the large-scale evacuation came amid drone- and air-strikes. \u201cIt was terrifying, people were running, some were in wheelchairs, everyone in panic not knowing where to go. The heavy bombardments were close, and the smoke was filling the skies,\u201d Al Za\u2019anoun told CNN after reaching the port area. A journey full of danger The strikes continued all night, along with repeated gunfire in areas where people were sheltering. \u201cI decided to wait until the morning and not move due to the dangerous situation,\u201d Al Za\u2019anoun said. But at dawn airstrikes targeted a high-rise building close to where he and his family and many other displaced people were taking shelter. \u201cAt that moment, to protect the lives of my family, I decided to leave the place and evacuate to the port area in the west of the city in a journey full of danger.\u201d Al Za\u2019anoun send photographs of his family walking through ruined streets as he dragged a pushchair with their remaining possessions. The IDF confirmed to CNN that the evacuation order for parts of Gaza City was the third in the past 10 days. OCHA estimates that about 80,000 people were living in the Shujaya area when the order to evacuate came on June 27. A further 250,000 people living in eastern Khan Younis and Rafah were placed under an evacuation order by the Israeli authorities on July 1. On that day, the IDF said that people in 71 residential blocs in eastern Khan Younis and Rafah must immediately evacuate westwards to what it defines as a \u201chumanitarian zone\u201d in Al Mawasi. OCHA said the area included medical points, primary health centers and 14 field kitchens, as well as a sewage treatment center. It said the internally displaced \u201cmoved toward western Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah, which are already overcrowded and lack basic services, critical infrastructure, shelter materials and spaces to accommodate the new influx of IDPs.\u201d No patients, no equipment, no longer functional OCHA and other agencies say the evacuation orders have had a major impact on the few operational hospitals in Gaza. On July 2, the Israeli authorities clarified that the European Hospital in Khan Younis was not included in the evacuation order. It was too late. Most medical staff and patients had left. A UN staffer \u2013 Jonathan Whittall \u2013 reported from the hospital: \u201cThere are no patients, there\u2019s no equipment, and it\u2019s no longer functional.\u201d The director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Ghebreyesus, said on X it was \u201cdevastating to see the 650-bed-capacity hospital out of service at a time when access to health care is urgently needed.\u201d The International Red Cross team at the hospital \u2013 which has carried out more than 3,000 surgeries there since the conflict began \u2013 also left. Many of those who left the European hospital crowded into the nearby Nasser Medical Complex, which reached full capacity. The WHO and other agencies were able to move much of the equipment from the European Hospital to Nasser, including ventilators and anaesthesia machines.\u00a0But medical staff were left wondering if and when they would have to move yet again. Now, one of the main hospitals in Gaza City \u2013 the Al Ahli Baptist \u2013 has also closed its doors. The Episcopal Church in Jerusalem, which runs Al Ahli, said that after several drone strikes in the immediate area on Sunday, the hospital was included in the \u201cred zone\u201d for evacuation. \u201cAs a result,\u201d the church said on Facebook on Monday, \u201call vulnerable people sheltering in the grounds, the staff and all patients had to leave the safety of the grounds \u2026 Our hospital is now out of operation at a time when its services are in very significant demand.\u201d Archbishop Hosam Naoum said the diocese protested the closure in the strongest possible terms and appealed to Israeli authorities to allow it to reopen. CNN has reached out to the IDF for an update on the hospital\u2019s status. OCHA said that \u201cAt present, only 15 of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals remain functional, albeit partially, and most are only partially accessible to patients.\u201d After the latest evacuation order, CNN filmed in the main route out of Gaza City \u2013 al-Rasheed street \u2013 toward what the IDF has described as \u201csafe areas.\u201d It was virtually empty. A CNN stringer in Gaza City, himself now displaced, said that many people had taken backstreets for fear of being targeted on the main road. Saleh was one young man who was trying to go in the opposite direction, into Gaza City, describing himself as \u201cfed up with this war, fed up with everything.\u201d But he and a few others with him encountered Israeli tanks and infantry. \u201cWe ran away from them, but there was a sniper who started shooting at us. The soldiers dismounted from the tank, and we kept running while the tanks pursued us.\u201d Saleh received a gunshot wound to the stomach but escaped to the coast where he said he took cover until the tanks left the area. \u2018What are we going to eat today?\u2019 Besides the obvious dangers in moving from one part of Gaza to another, the constant displacements make it harder for aid agencies to target the provision of food. The World Food Programme said Monday that\u00a0\u201calmost half a million people in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0face catastrophic levels of hunger. Due to unreliable access and limited stocks, families often don\u2019t receive the full rations and frequency they need.\u201d OCHA said that the evacuation orders complicate the logistical challenge of distributing aid. It said that between July 1 and 4, only one of 13 planned humanitarian assistance missions coordinated with the Israeli authorities to northern Gaza was facilitated, with the others impeded or cancelled. The situation in the south was better, with 43 out of 55 missions facilitated by the Israeli authorities. The Norwegian Refugee Council says that as people fled Khan Younis last week many spent the first night sleeping in the open, next to their belongings. \u201cOthers walked very long distances, carrying their children and anything they could bring with them,\u201d said\u00a0Maysa Saleh, an NRC Education Officer in Deir al-Balah. \u201cEverything is tightening around them \u2026 the first question every morning is the same: what are we going to eat today?\u201d \u201cTents have also virtually run out,\u201d Saleh said. \u201cThe other day, I saw a\u00a0tent\u00a0made out of empty fabric rice sacks sewn together.\u201d \u201cThere are so many children scattered around the streets, you walk around and see children living there because that\u2019s their home now.\u201d The NRC echoes OCHA\u2019s estimate that some 250,000 people have fled Khan Younis \u201cmainly to overcrowded western areas and Deir al-Balah.\u201d It said evacuation orders \u201clack assurances of safety, adequate accommodation, or return once hostilities end for those forced to relocate.\u201d UNRWA\u2019s senior communications officer Louise Wateridge described her journey through Khan Younis on Monday in a post on X. \u201cMakeshift shelters as far as you can see, families collecting water, children searching through trash for things to eat, sell or burn to cook on,\u201d she wrote.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/middleeast/gaza-city-idf-israel-evacuation-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

Advocates hope the new legislation will better protect girls in Sierra Leone, around a third of whom are married before they turn 18, increasing the maternal death rate due to the physical risks they face from pregnancy, according to the health ministry. Under the law, any man who marries a girl under the age of 18 could face at least 15 years in prison and a fine of around $4,000.

{"id": "2024_07_07_weather_west-coast-heat-wave-california-nevada-oregon", "text": "Hundreds of new temperature records could be broken into next week as sweltering heat drags on across the country, impacting millions of Americans in the Western and Eastern US. Nearly 70 million people are under heat alerts Sunday, after over three dozen high-temperature records were either set or tied on Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. Highs in the upper 90s to 110s are expected up and down the West Coast and parts of the Great Basin. \u201cIn the West, intense widespread dangerous heat will continue through early next week,\u201d the weather service said. \u201cAll-time heat records may be possible in a few locations.\u201d By Wednesday, over 250 warm high and low temperature records could be set. And nearly 40 million people in the contiguous US are forecast to see temperatures over 100 degrees over the next seven days. A slew of daily temperature records were broken this Fourth of July weekend. On Saturday, Death Valley reached 128 degrees, breaking the daily record of 127 set on July 6, 2007. Las Vegas reached 115 degrees, tying with records in 2007 and 1989. Kingman, Arizona, reached 109 degrees, breaking the previous record of 108. On Sunday, temperatures in Las Vegas hit 120 degrees for the first time in recorded history, according to preliminary data from the weather service.\u00a0In more than 32,000 days of records, the temperature had never climbed above 117 degrees prior to Sunday. The city\u2019s heat is not just a record for its peak temperature, but also for its longevity. Las Vegas temperatures have exceeded 110 degrees each day since July 3 and are forecast to do so every day until at least next Sunday. That will mark a stretch of prolonged extreme heat longer than any ever experienced in the city, with 11 days or more above 110 degrees. In California, Daggett broke its daily temperature record, reaching 117 degrees. Bishop reached 108 degrees, setting another record for the state. Several record highs were also set in the Sacramento area, including in Redding, where it reached 119 degrees and beat the all-time high temperature record of 118, according to the weather service in Sacramento. Extremely dangerous heat is expected to persist in the West, with excessive heat watches, warnings and heat advisories in effect for much of the region. Heat warnings are active in California and Nevada due to the increased risk of heat-related illnesses there. \u201cIntense, widespread, and long duration heat building in the West will be extremely dangerous and potentially deadly if not taken seriously,\u201d the weather service said. An excessive heat warning is in effect until late Wednesday evening for Death Valley, California, where temperatures are expected to be between 122 to 129 degrees. Elsewhere in the state, Owens Valley could reach 111 degrees, and Barstow could reach 118. In Nevada, Las Vegas and Pahrump could also reach 118 degrees. \u201cHot temperatures overnight will mean little relief from the daytime heat, especially in Las Vegas and Death Valley, where low temperatures may not fall below 90 degrees for several days,\u201d the National Weather Service said. Death Valley \u2013 the driest national park in the US \u2013 could hit a sizzling 130 degrees by Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service in Las Vegas. For people without adequate cooling and hydration, the multi-day nature of the heat and record warm overnight temperatures could cause heat stress to build. Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the\u00a0weather service. Oregon and Washington have both also seen record heat and temperatures are expected to remain in the triple digits through early next week. \u201cLook for more records to fall in the coming days as temperatures in the inland valleys are likely to climb near or above 100 degrees each day through Tuesday, July 9,\u201d the weather service in Portland said. Meanwhile, heat and humidity in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast is forecast to gradually subside into next week, lingering longest along the Gulf Coast and into the Carolinas, the weather service said. Heat index values approaching 110 degrees on Saturday in the mid-Atlantic region will be lowered to near 100 degrees on Sunday. Heat advisories currently stretch from upstate New York down the East Coast to Alabama. In the West, the heat wave is expected to expand into the Great Basin and eventually the northern High Plains into next week. It\u2019s likely to remain into mid-July, according to the weather service. Wildfire threat is fueled by unrelenting heat Intense heat, paired with dry windy conditions, is bringing a critical risk of wildfires to parts of the upper Great Basin toward the Four Corners for the rest of the weekend. Portions of southern Idaho and southern Utah are particularly at risk. Sweltering heat on the West Coast could continue to fuel large wildfires in California. More than 3,000 wildfires across the state have burned over 150,000 acres so far in 2024, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.   Cal Fire spokesperson Nick Schuler says triple-digit temperatures and critical fire weather conditions have proven to be a challenge for\u00a0the more than 3,500\u00a0firefighters battling fires across the state. \u201cChallenges are immense. We\u2019re dealing with the increased temperatures, very steep and remote terrain,\u201d Schuler told CNN\u2019s Fredricka Whitfield, adding \u201cthe ability for rapid growth from the amount of vegetation that\u2019s across the state is a challenge.\u201d The Basin Fire, which is the largest active wildfire in the state, burned over 14,000 acres in Fresno County and was 60% contained Saturday evening, according to the Cal Fire. Another large wildfire, the Lake Fire, ignited Friday afternoon in Santa Barbara County and has already scorched over 13,200 acres. The Santa Barbara Sheriff\u2019s Office issued evacuation warnings in nearby areas and several roads were closed. The Thompson Fire, for which California Gov. Gavin Newsom had issued an emergency declaration, was 79% contained as of Saturday night. After starting Tuesday, it has burned through nearly 4,000 acres in Butte County. Two firefighters were injured, 26 structures were destroyed and eight were damaged by the fire, according to Cal Fire. \u201cDangerously hot and dry conditions were observed across the incident,\u201d according to Cal Fire. The French Fire in Mariposa County was 35% contained and had burned through over 900 acres after it started on the fourth of July. Due to the fire, evacuation orders and warnings were issued, four firefighters were injured and four structures were destroyed, according to Cal Fire. Meanwhile, the Mccain Fire in San Diego County had burned about 1,500 acres and was 95% contained. \u201cWe are happy to report that we are seeing an increase in the percentage of containment,\u201d Schuler said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to lift some of the evacuation orders and warnings allowing people to start to cautiously make way back to their homes.\u201d But\u00a0crews still have to contend with\u00a0several\u00a0days\u00a0ahead\u00a0of\u00a0continued\u00a0heat, Schuler said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/weather/west-coast-heat-wave-california-nevada-oregon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "style_mousganistan-mous-lamrabat-book-spc", "text": "There\u2019s a story that artist Mous Lamrabat likes to tell, about when he first became obsessed with brands. He was 14, a teenager born in Morocco and living with his family in Belgium. Lamrabat and his eight siblings were working class kids who wore plain clothes, long before plain clothes were adopted by the quiet luxury crowd and thus became cool. Back then, the cool kids, they were covered in logos; symbols of a club he desperately wanted to be a part of. \u201cAs a kid, you just want to belong,\u201d he remembered. So the teenager took a hat his father wore to mosque and embroidered it with a Nike swoosh. With needle and thread and a logo born 5,000 miles away, the people\u2019s republic of Mousganistan was founded. \u201cMousganistan,\u201d a manifesto, an exhibition title, and now the name of Lamrabat\u2019s first book, is a \u201cutopia of multiculturalism and unconditional belonging.\u201d It is, as all utopias are, more an idea than a place. It acknowledges all the identities we wear through life, and says, \u201cit\u2019s ok to not be one person,\u201d explained Lamrabat, now 41. We think we have to decide which person to be in any given moment, he added; \u201cAmerican\u201d outside the home, Arab inside, for example. Mousganistan says, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s be both.\u201d This idea has guided Lamrabat\u2019s photography for years, manifested in sign and symbol. Lamrabat rose to prominence by melding Western iconography \u2014 especially its symbols of consumerism \u2014 with people and places from Africa and the Middle East. His work combines gauche branding with fine-art sensibilities, operating as a cultural melting pot ripe with playful contrast. In Mousganistan, a Tuareg tagelmust (headscarf) is made from Ikea bag straps, women sport henna Wu-Tang Clan logos, and niqabs look like Lakers and Bulls jerseys. Because why not? They are, at their core, heightened reflections of the cultural osmosis and lived experience of millions of people every day. The mischievousness is the point. But as his profile has risen, has Lamrabat run into any issues with the companies his artworks co-opt? \u201cNever,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the time, I\u2019m contacted by these brands or creative directors to congratulate me. They\u2019re a big fan.\u201d \u201cIn a way, I\u2019m still thinking, \u2018Hey, hire me,\u2019\u201d he added, laughing. Some have. The Belgian Moroccan artist shot a campaign for WhatsApp, has had work appear on the cover of Vogue and Esquire, and been profiled by GQ. But there have also been lean periods, he admits, and a year when he didn\u2019t pick up a camera. He\u2019s hustled and hustled, he explained, using friends as models and never working with big budgets (\u201cthis actually made my work stronger\u201d). His debut monograph spans eight years of work \u2014 a long time, and a long time coming, as he admits he put off the project for years. \u201cIt felt like so much work \u2026 Now that I\u2019ve made the book, I realized that was true,\u201d Lamrabat joked. But he recognizes it as a big moment: \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve done so far led me to the point I\u2019m at now.\u201d Unsurprisingly, one word has followed Lamrabat around: iconoclastic. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what iconoclastic means,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019ve always lived in a bubble and created in a bubble. It was only when I started doing interviews that people started (mentioning this).\u201d Lamrabat concedes he\u2019s no art connoisseur, though he is a lover of fashion, where \u201csymbols are so important lately.\u201d He describes influencers proudly displaying even the most throwaway items adorned with brand logos on social media. \u201cI almost feel like (fashion has) become a kind of religion by itself. Like a cult.\u201d His art hasn\u2019t shied away from religion, particularly the flowing fabrics of Islamic womenswear. Bright and bold (in part, a result of an eye condition limiting Lamrabat\u2019s color sight), these playful interpretations nevertheless read as respectful of his heritage. (Perhaps his most provocative work, of a veiled model wearing a Make America Great Again cap, titled \u201cI Just Did,\u201d was not intended to be read as explicitly religious, he noted.) More recently, Lamrabat has taken to draping fabrics over models for a more secular interpretation that focuses on silhouette and the quality of the textile. He explained he wanted to remove the attracting but distracting presence of faces from his work. The idea came to him after a tough period in which he wasn\u2019t proud of much of his output. \u201cMe and my girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9) were driving through the desert and it was so beautiful,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI wanted to make it so simple; something pure. We shot one photo and it looked amazing.\u201d He began singling out more interesting fabrics and giving them focus, \u201ccreating fashion without fashion.\u201d Doing so rekindled childhood memories. \u201cWhen I was little, my parents gifted fabrics, which I never understood,\u201d Lamrabat said. \u201cWhy would you not at least give them a dress or something, you know?\u201d But he grew to learn of their significance, and the stories these fabrics tell, and how cherished they were by his own culture and others. Lamrabat has found other ways to manifest the personal in his work. He is Amazigh, North African tribespeople with a flag comprised of three horizontal stripes: blue top, green middle, yellow bottom, representing sky, mountains and desert. Over the stripes is a red letter in the Tifinagh language, symbolizing resistance, that also looks like a human figure, head in the sky, feet in the sand. \u201cIf you look at all of my photos, almost all of them, there\u2019s blue behind the head,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s why I like shooting outside.\u201d Despite all these throughlines in his work, Lamrabat\u2019s book possibly closes a chapter of his life. \u201cMaybe everything until now was Mousganistan,\u201d he said, \u201cme trying to find solutions for different worlds we live in.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m at a crossroads,\u201d he shared, \u201cand I need to make a decision (about) what\u2019s next.\u201d As daunting as that may sound, he has some ideas \u2014 none of which involve photography. \u201cI\u2019m not a photographer,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThe camera is just a creative output for my ideas \u2026 I want to try to not always think in photography, if that makes sense.\u201d He\u2019s wary of any endeavor that limits his creative freedom. \u201cThere should be no rules when it comes to the creative industry,\u201d he argued, and bemoaned artists \u201closing our rawness\u201d in commercial work, rife as it is with polish and compromise. He floats getting into sculpture, although he\u2019s not sure where to begin. Let the practical details follow; Lamrabat has always been an ideas guy anyway, and that\u2019s not going to change any time soon. \u201cWhat Mousganistan is, is a big construction of bridges,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love to keep doing that, because I truly feel that if we focus on the things that we have in common instead of the differences, it can bring a lot of people closer together.\u201d \u201cMousganistan\u201d is available to buy now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/mousganistan-mous-lamrabat-book-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_09_weather_beryl-storm-texas-power-outages-heat", "text": "Restoring power to millions of Texans slammed by the deadly and destructive storm Beryl could take days or even weeks, posing a dangerous scenario for residents without air conditioning as triple-digit heat index temperatures hit the state. Beryl slammed into southern Texas as a Category 1 hurricane Monday, knocking out power to more than 2.5 million homes and leaving at least eight people dead in Texas and Louisiana. Just under 2 million customers, mostly in Galveston up through Houston, are still without power Tuesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us. At least 34 utilities are experiencing outages. The storm unleashed flooding rains and winds that transformed roads into rushing rivers, ripped through power lines and tossed trees onto homes, roads and cars. President Biden granted a federal emergency disaster declaration for parts of Texas due to Beryl\u2019s destruction, acting Texas Gov. Dan Patrick announced Tuesday. \u201cFEMA\u2019s assistance with these costs will expedite the recovery process and help ensure the safety of Texans impacted by Hurricane Beryl,\u201d Patrick said. The emergency declaration will grant 75% reimbursement for debris cleanup for all 121 impacted Texas counties, Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief W. Nim Kidd said at a Tuesday news conference. What\u2019s left of Beryl is hurtling into the Midwest. Despite having lost strength and its core, it still threatens to trigger more flooding and tornadoes along its path. As difficult recovery and cleanup efforts are underway in southeast Texas, including the Houston area, extreme heat is bearing down on the region Tuesday and will continue for much of the week, creating hazardous conditions for those working outdoors, the elderly, people with chronic medical conditions, children and those without adequate cooling. The heat index in Houston passed 100 degrees on Tuesday. The heat index measures how the body feels under both heat and humidity. Both Houston\u2019s George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P. Hobby Airport reported a heat index of 103 degrees by early Tuesday afternoon. Air temperatures in the region will climb into the 90s through at least early next week. When a person is unable to cool their body down amid prolonged heat, they are at risk for damage to the brain and other vital organs, as well as other heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and stroke. Heat is the deadliest form of extreme weather in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. With some residents opting for generators in the wake of outages, Kidd noted at least two carbon monoxide poisoning deaths have been reported in Harris County, home to Houston. \u201cIf you have a generator that you\u2019re running, please make sure it is far away from the area that you are living and sleeping,\u201d Kidd explained, adding such deaths are preventable. But restoring power to hard-hit communities will be a multi-day undertaking, according to Thomas Gleeson, the chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas. And in the coastal city of Galveston, city officials have estimated it could be as many as two weeks before electricity is restored. Utility company says damage was more severe than expected Texas utility CenterPoint Energy has borne the brunt of the outages, and though the company had braced for Beryl\u2019s impact, it said the damage was more severe than it had expected. As of Tuesday afternoon, CenterPoint still had more than 1.5 million customers without service. \u201cThe storm veered off the originally expected course and more heavily impacted the company\u2019s customers, systems and infrastructure than previously anticipated, resulting in outages to more than 2.26 million customers at its peak,\u201d the utility said. That amounts to 80% of CenterPoint\u2019s Houston region customers, company representative Paul Lock said during a Tuesday evening news conference. Earlier Tuesday, Patrick said he has repeatedly urged CenterPoint Energy to \u201cwork as quickly as they can\u201d to restore power. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be in the heat. It\u2019s tough now to be able to refrigerate anything and tough not being able to go out and get food,\u201d he added. The utility had said they expected to restore power to 1 million customers by Wednesday night. CenterPoint also hopes to complete full damage assessments by the end of the Tuesday, company spokesperson Logan Anderson told CNN Tuesday afternoon. In the evening news conference, Lock said he couldn\u2019t give a timeline for power restoration, \u201cbut it is not going to be tomorrow.\u201d He said the utility will provide a system-wide restoration timeline after the damage assessments are complete. Houston Mayor John Whitmire, whose home was also without power Monday, said CenterPoint and the city are \u201cfully aware\u201d of how pressing electricity restoration is. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of every community. No community is favored over another community. Every Houstonian is important to us. We\u2019ll get your power on as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. In Katy, Texas, just west of Houston, resident Lizzette Varela said her home lost power Monday morning and hasn\u2019t regained it since. Her family is trying to find access to lodging, internet and food storage on a day-to-day basis, she told CNN. \u201cThere is no clear word from CenterPoint. They expect that by Wednesday there will be 1 million more people with electricity, but there\u2019s 2 million people without power. How do you know if you\u2019re part of the 50% with power? It\u2019s like a game,\u201d she said. Mayor Gregg Bisso of Surfside Beach, Texas \u2013 located 60 miles south of Houston \u2013 said he is \u201cmad as hell\u201d at CenterPoint, as 90% of the Gulf Coast destination is without power. \u201cWe are the first to get hit\u2014and hit the hardest\u2014but because we are over the bridge, we are the last ones to get service back,\u201d Bisso said. Bisso said most residents thankfully heeded a voluntary evacuation order, as Beryl brought sustained winds of well-over 90 mph that damaged countless homes \u2013 with some missing whole roofs. Houston residents working through aftermath The Houston Zoo is also working to clean up damage and flooding from Beryl, Jackie Wallace, assistant vice president of communications and public affairs, told CNN Tuesday. All the animals are safe and fared well throughout the hurricane and power outage, Wallace said, as the zoo used generators until power was restored late Tuesday morning. A team of staff spent Sunday and Monday overnight at the zoo to ensure the safety of the animals and take care of any emergency issues on the grounds. The animals spent the nights, as usual, safely in their barns, Wallace said. In recent years, the zoo has undergone extensive upgrades with hurricanes and freezes in mind, which included an office garage being built on campus for staff to ride out storms. The zoo will remain closed until Thursday. Some other businesses are staying open, however. For Crystal Petty, the manager of a Baskin-Robbins in southwestern Houston, business is busier than usual as people clamor for relief from the high temperatures and humidity. \u201cI have a phone call coming in about every 30 minutes with someone asking if we\u2019re open or not,\u201d Petty told CNN. Petty\u2019s store regained power at 7 a.m. Tuesday with most of their products still good to sell \u2013 save the ice cream cake display, which had melted from being in the front window. Scoops were being served a cool four hours later. From her correspondence with other local stores, Petty believes her Baskin-Robbins might be the only one in the city still with power. Beryl\u2019s path through the US At its peak, Beryl was a record-shattering Category 5 storm but has since been reduced to a far less powerful system with winds of 30 mph. Still, what\u2019s left of Beryl will produce flooding and tornadoes in the US as it moves inland through mid-week. Beryl became the first storm in the Atlantic hurricane season to make landfall in the US after tearing a devastating path through the Caribbean, where it caused at least nine other deaths. The storm marks the start to a hurricane season experts say will be far from normal, as fossil fuel pollution contributes to abnormally warm water and rapidly intensifying storms. The center of the storm will continue through Illinois by the end of Tuesday. It is then expected to blow into Indiana on\u00a0Wednesday morning and race through Ohio and Michigan and into Canada by the end of the week. The threat of tornadoes linked to Beryl increased Tuesday, prompting the Storm Prediction Center to upgrade the risk of severe thunderstorms\u00a0to a level 3 of 5 for western Kentucky and southern Indiana. Parts of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys are under a level 2 of 5 severe thunderstorm threat, primarily for tornadoes associated with the storms, according to the\u00a0center. Fourteen tornadoes from Beryl were reported Monday in Texas, Louisiana and southern Arkansas. About 23.4 million people are under flood watches Tuesday. Flash flood warnings were issued along the storm\u2019s path Tuesday morning. Heat sprawls across the West Heat alerts have been issued\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0for about half of the US population, spanning both coasts, but the West coast being hit particularly hard. An oppressive heat wave is blanketing the West and will hover over the region for several more days, likely bringing high temperatures between 10 to 30 degrees above average to some areas. Human-caused climate change is driving far more frequent and intense heat waves across the globe, exposing communities to increasingly dangerous temperatures. Excessive heat warnings, watches and heat advisories are in effect for nearly all of Washington state, Oregon, California, Idaho, Nevada and southwest Arizona. Parts of western Nevada and northeastern California won\u2019t see high temperatures below 100 degrees until next weekend,\u00a0the National Weather Service office in Reno said. In Oregon, four people died of suspected heat-related illnesses over the weekend, and another suspected heat-related death was reported Monday, according to\u00a0news releases\u00a0from Multnomah County. A motorcyclist also died from heat exposure in California\u2019s Death Valley on Saturday, when the high temperature was 128 degrees. In Arizona, a 50-year-old hiker died amid searing temperatures Sunday on the Grand Canyon\u2019s Bright Angel Trail, according to the National Park Service.

{"id": "2024_07_08_china_china-hungary-orban-xi-visit-intl-hnk", "text": "Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing Monday, days after a controversial visit to Moscow and another to Kyiv that the far-right European leader described as a \u201cpeace mission.\u201d Orban, who has been widely criticized in the West for his Russia-friendly positioning amid Moscow\u2019s onslaught on Ukraine, posted a photo of his arrival at a Beijing airport with the caption \u201cPeace mission 3.0\u201d on social media platform X. Talks between the two leaders at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing focused on \u201cin-depth communication\u201d on the war in Ukraine, according to a readout published by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. Orban\u2019s\u00a0previously unannounced\u00a0visit comes a day before the start of a NATO summit in Washington, where US President Joe Biden will host leaders from the bloc, which includes Hungary, and rally continued support for Ukraine\u2019s defense. Orban\u2019s spokesperson on Monday said Washington would be the leader\u2019s next stop after Beijing. China, Russia\u2019s most important diplomatic ally, is also expected to be on the agenda of that gathering. NATO leaders have become increasingly alarmed about what they say is its backing for Moscow\u2019s war effort through the provision of dual-use goods and other economic and diplomatic support. Beijing has said it has not provided weapons to either side of the conflict and defended what it calls its strict controls on dual-use exports. China claims neutrality in the war and has also sought to posit itself as a potential peace broker in the conflict, even as Xi has deepened his allegiance with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the more than two years since Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The two most recently hailed their close ties during a meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit last week in Kazakhstan. During talks with Orban Monday, Xi reiterated Beijing\u2019s call for a ceasefire in Ukraine, according to CCTV. That longstanding call from Beijing has been criticized in the West as positioned to help Russia consolidate illegal territorial gains as it comes without first stipulating that Moscow\u2019s troops withdraw from Ukrainian territory. Orban, widely seen as Putin\u2019s greatest ally in Europe, has also been campaigning for a ceasefire as opposed to military support for Ukraine. China is a \u201ckey power in creating the conditions for peace\u201d in the war, Orban wrote in an X post Monday. \u201cThis is why I came to meet with President Xi in Beijing, just two months after his official visit to Budapest,\u201d he added. During the meeting, Xi claimed that China and Hungary have the \u201csame basic propositions and directions of efforts\u201d on Ukraine and appeared to allude to Beijing\u2019s accusations that the United States and its allies are \u201cfanning\u201d the conflict by providing Kyiv with weapons for its defense. \u201cOnly when all major powers exert positive energy rather than negative energy can the conflict see the dawn of a ceasefire as soon as possible,\u201d Xi said, according to CCTV. Orban\u2019s diplomatic tour Orban\u2019s visit to Beijing and his stops last week in Russia and Ukraine come just a week after Budapest assumed the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union \u2013 a position that has been looked on skeptically by many leaders across the bloc, where Orban is widely seen as illiberal outlier. It also comes amid ongoing concern \u2013 and deep divisions \u2013 about how and when the war in Ukraine will be resolved, nearly two and half years after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion began. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was among European leaders to criticize Orban\u2019s decision to travel to Moscow and meet with Putin last week \u2013 the first such visit from an EU leader since April 2022 \u2013 saying \u201cappeasement will not stop\u201d Putin. \u201cOnly unity and determination will pave the path to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine,\u201d she added. Orban and Putin last week said they discussed ways to end the conflict in Ukraine, with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg later telling reporters that Orban would likely brief other NATO leaders on those talks in Washington. Orban\u2019s visit to Moscow followed his stop in Kyiv earlier last week, when the Hungarian leader said he had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to think about a ceasefire \u201cfirst\u201d to \u201cspeed up peace talks\u201d \u2013 a proposal dismissed by Zelensky\u2019s office. The embattled country has called for a restoration of its territory as a condition of peace. Orban and Xi\u00a0last met in May, when the Chinese leader was welcomed with fanfare for a state visit to Hungary. Then, Orban defied a mood of mounting European concern about a security threat posed by Beijing to\u00a0upgrade the countries\u2019 ties to an \u201call-weather comprehensive strategic partnership.\u201d Xi hailed that \u201csuccessful\u201d outcome during Monday\u2019s meeting and reiterated his wish that Hungary during its EU Council presidency would play an \u201cactive role\u201d in promoting the \u201chealthy and stable development\u201d of China-EU relations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/china/china-hungary-orban-xi-visit-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_europe_france-election-second-round-result-intl", "text": "A left-wing alliance has won the most seats in the French parliament after tactical voting in Sunday\u2019s second round election thwarted Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party, but France will be left in political limbo after no party came close to winning an absolute majority. In a surprise result, the New Popular Front (NFP) \u2013 a cluster of several parties ranging from the far-left France Unbowed party to the more moderate Socialists and the Ecologists \u2013 won 182 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest group but short of the 289 required for an absolute majority, according to the French Interior Ministry. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance, which had slumped to a dismal third in the first round of voting last Sunday, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. Despite leading after the first round of votes, Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party and its allies won 143 seats. The RN\u2019s strong showing in the first round stirred fears that France could be on the cusp of electing its first far-right government since the collaborationist Vichy regime of World War II. But Sunday\u2019s results come as a huge upset and show French voters\u2019 overwhelming desire to keep the far right from gaining power \u2013 even at the cost of a hung parliament. After the first round, an unprecedented number of seats \u2013 over 300 \u2013 went to a three-way runoff between Ensemble, the NFP and the RN. By Tuesday, more than 200 centrist and left-wing candidates withdrew from the second round, in a bid to avoid splitting the vote. Cheers rang out on the streets of Paris as the projection was published. Speaking to a crowd of his ecstatic supporters near Stalingrad square, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the firebrand leader of France Unbowed, said the results came as a \u201chuge relief for the overwhelming majority of people in our country.\u201d \u201cOur people have clearly rejected the worst-case scenario,\u201d M\u00e9lenchon said. \u201cA magnificent surge of civic mobilization has taken hold!\u201d Gabriel Attal, Macron\u2019s protege, announced he would resign as prime minister Monday morning. He seemed to take a swipe at Macron\u2019s decision to call the snap vote, saying he \u201cdidn\u2019t choose\u201d for France\u2019s parliament to be dissolved. Elsewhere in Paris, the buoyant atmosphere at a RN campaign event in Bois de Vincennes took a nosedive an hour before the polls closed. After the projection was announced, Jordan Bardella, the party\u2019s 28-year-old leader, said France had been thrown into \u201cuncertainty and instability.\u201d Handpicked as leader by Marine Le Pen in an effort to purge the party of its racist and antisemitic roots, Bardella had taken the party closer to the gates of power than ever before. Visibly disappointed by the results, he slammed the NFP as an \u201calliance of dishonor.\u201d \u201cAs from tomorrow, our deputies will take up their places to make sure we counter the migration policies and other policies of the far left. We will not enter into any kind of coalition or compromise, we will be the side of the French people,\u201d he said. A hastily assembled coalition In a brief statement, the Elysee said Macron is awaiting the full results of all 577 constituencies \u201cbefore taking the necessary decisions.\u201d \u201cIn his role as guarantor of our institutions, the president will ensure that the sovereign choice of the French people is respected,\u201d it said. After parliamentary elections, the French president appoints a prime minister from the party that won the most seats. Ordinarily, this means a candidate from the president\u2019s own party. However, Sunday\u2019s results mean Macron faces the prospect of having to appoint a figure from the left-wing coalition, in a rare arrangement known as a \u201ccohabitation.\u201d Speaking to supporters near Stalingrad square, M\u00e9lenchon said Macron \u201chas the duty to call the New Popular Front to govern.\u201d But it is not clear from which party within the coalition that Macron will appoint a prime minister. France Unbowed won 74 seats, making it the largest single party within the NFP, ahead of the Socialists with 59. But Macron and his allies had repeatedly stressed that they would refuse to enter into coalition with M\u00e9lenchon. Speaking after last Sunday\u2019s first round, outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal \u2013 Macron\u2019s protege, said France Unbowed was preventing the formation of a \u201ccredible alternative\u201d to the far right. The NFP formed less than a month ago, after Macron called the snap vote following his party\u2019s disastrous loss to the RN in last month\u2019s European Parliament election. The capacious \u2013 and potentially fractious \u2013 coalition chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. Sunday\u2019s results mean the NFP has managed to do this again. It campaigned on a platform to raise the minimum monthly wage to 1,600 euros (more than $1,700), to cap the price of essential foods, electricity, fuel and gas, and to scrap Macron\u2019s deeply unpopular pension reform, which raised the French retirement age \u2013 already one of the lowest in the Western world \u2013 from 62 to 64. A mess of Macron\u2019s making? Sunday\u2019s vote represents a victory for the French \u201ccordon sanitaire,\u201d the principle that mainstream parties must unite to block the far right from taking office. But the RN\u2019s success should not be underestimated. In the 2017 elections, when Macron swept to power, the RN won just eight seats. In 2022, it surged to 89 seats. In Sunday\u2019s vote, it won 125 \u2013 making it the largest individual party in parliament. While the risk of a far-right government has been avoided for now, these elections have plunged France into political uncertainty. Macron called the election three years earlier than necessary, just minutes after his party was trounced by the far right in the EU election. Although EU election results need have no bearing on domestic politics, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent to him by voters and wanted to clarify the situation. But Sunday\u2019s results may further muddy the French political picture. Unable to call a new election for at least another year, and with three years left on his presidential term, Macron looks set to preside over an unruly parliament, as problems mount at home and abroad. \u00c9douard Philippe, France\u2019s former prime minister and an ally of Macron, said Macron\u2019s gamble had further complicated the situation. \u201cThe truth is that none of the political blocs in the assembly has a majority on its own to govern. The dissolution of the assembly, which was intended as a clarification, has instead led to great vagueness,\u201d he said Sunday evening. \u201cThe central political forces therefore have a responsibility to stay. They must, without compromise, promote the creation of an agreement that will stabilize the political situation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/europe/france-election-second-round-result-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_europe_how-macron-lost-france-intl-cmd", "text": "It feels like a lifetime ago. Emmanuel Macron marched on to the stage in 2017, a boyish spring in his step and a breathless excitement in his victory speech: The grand entrance to his presidency. He\u00a0promised\u00a0to be France\u2019s centrist hope after decades of division, the great reformer who would jolt France to the forefront of global business.\u00a0He\u2019s now staring at what will certainly be his real legacy: Macron opened the door to the far right in France. After a shattering defeat in May\u2019s European Parliament election, his decision to call a snap election has, at least partially, backfired. In a surprise result, the New Popular Front (NFP), a cluster of left-wing parties, won 182 seats in the National Assembly, short of a majority but ahead of both Macron\u2019s centrist bloc and the far right. The far-right bloc was widely expected to come first, but a country-wide effort to hold it back, with both leftists and centrist candidates standing down to concentrate the anti-far-right vote, succeeded. A relief for Macron, who should be saved from forced cooperation with a far-right prime minister. But the political chaos of a hung parliament awaits: A far-cry from the landslide he won in 2017. Bold is how many distilled his rocketing ascent into the French presidency; arrogant is how many now view his Icarus-like fall from grace. Macron demolished the architecture of French politics in his meteoric rise to the Elysee Palace. Carving out a new, centrist party from the political right and left, his landslide victory in 2017 \u2013 after just a short stint as a government minister - set him up to suffocate the political landscape, trying to satisfy anti-immigrant border policies with fiscally loose environmental and social protections. With Macron dominating the middle ground, political oxygen was sucked to the extremes. That\u2019s seen a polarization of policy proposals \u2013 from neutering France\u2019s sacrosanct secularism on the left to hounding out \u201cIslamist ideologies\u201d on the right \u2013 and a deepening, painful division in French society. His political star has burnt bright but is already collapsing on itself. This is an end of his own making. Love or hate relationship Never afraid to chart a difficult course, early in his presidency he plowed into his project of reform: slashing taxes for the rich and hiking diesel prices. The proposals were typically Macronian: Fiscally sound, business-minded and poorly marketed. The public reaction too\u00a0became\u00a0classic for Macron: Fiery outrage on the streets of France. The diesel tax sparked the worst protests France \u2013 perhaps the spiritual home of street anger \u2013 had seen in decades. The\u00a0\u201cyellow vest\u201d movement swept the country\u00a0in 2018, bringing hundreds of thousands of everyday French people on to the streets, braving harsh policing and succeeding in holding the country\u2019s political agenda hostage. \u201cI think that no country moves forward if it does not also hear this part of the legitimate anger of our people,\u201d he said, a couple of months after protests began. \u201cI think that they\u2019re reconcilable and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d It took the longest street protest in 50 years, but Macron eventually\u00a0did\u00a0listen to the anger of the yellow vests, or gilets jaunes. For a former banker-turned-economy minister, with little relatable experience of everyday France, his solution was a bold stroke of PR: A nationwide tour of town halls, a chance to hear and be heard. A man never far from accusations of being an ivory-tower politician\u00a0offered a humble face. Political stormtrooper Then came Covid-19. Macron deployed the all-or-nothing approach he favored, with one of the strictest lockdown regimes in Europe, in repeated waves, and a rigid vaccination protocol. \u201cWe are at war,\u201d he told the nation in March 2020. \u201cDay and night, nothing must distract us from it.\u201d He embraced a similar philosophy post-pandemic, as the global economy struggled to rebound and tensions over Ukraine threatened to throttle economic growth. Macron spent big, shielding French businesses and consumers from the worst of energy prices hikes, just months after massive post-Covid spending. By 2024, France was running one of the highest deficits in the Eurozone but the former economy minister had got what he paid for. French growth is\u00a0projected to be 0.7%\u00a0in 2024, and gain momentum next year, showing\u00a0striking resilience\u00a0since the pandemic. Inflation is\u00a0also\u00a0set to\u00a0fall significantly. Macron and his supporters point to his economic record as reason enough to vote for him.\u00a0But\u00a0the French are rarely so generous with their sitting presidents \u2013 gratitude is in short supply. Today, Macron\u2019s approval ratings\u00a0sit at 30%, down from nearly 50% when he stepped into office but his disapproval ratings (now at 65%) have not dropped below 50% since his first months in office, according to Ipsos-Le Point polling. The French love to hate their politicians and Macron is no different. The country\u2019s two-term\u00a0constitutional\u00a0limit means Macron can\u2019t run again for president in 2027. One lawmaker from Macron\u2019s party said that the public disappointment in the French president stemmed from how publicly invested he had been in the country\u2019s direction, making it clear that his four prime ministers were strictly following his lead. \u201cHe was ultimately very active in his two five-year terms, unlike other presidents who took a back seat and let their prime minister take the hits,\u201d the member of parliament said, requesting anonymity to speak frankly. \u201cWe felt (the PMs) were very dependent on him,\u201d they added. Under pressure at home,\u00a0he\u2019s enjoyed playing the statesman, whether rallying forces behind the European project or going head to head with combative counterparts, be they Putin or Trump. He was a crusader for European military and industrial sovereignty from American patronage long before the war in Ukraine made them fashionable. And he has been a critical ally to Kyiv in the face of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion, leading the charge with supplies of light tanks, then long-range missiles and French-made fighter jets, while keeping European allies in lockstep with Ukraine. In the invasion\u2019s early days, critics slammed him for his efforts with Putin \u2013 later revealed to be at Kyiv\u2019s request. But later, he looked to outmanoeuvre Putin with force, raising the issue of NATO-member troop deployments and cementing the West\u2019s unwavering support for Ukraine. Unheeded warnings? With the (arguably haughty) self-assuredness that has come to define his image,  Macron issued warnings time and again over the menace of the far-right. \u201cI don\u2019t want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers, I don\u2019t want to belong to a generation that\u2019s forgotten its own past or that refuses to see the torments of its own present,\u201d he told the European Parliament in 2018. Finally, after years of inching far-right advances, the 2024 European Parliament elections saw his centrist politics submerged by a call from the far\u00a0right. As Marine Le Pen and her lieutenant Jordan Bardella of National Rally hammer home, too many French voters \u2013 struggling with economic pressures and anti-immigration narratives - felt ignored or unheard, those that in his own inauguration speech Macron had called the \u201cFrench men and French women who feel forgotten by this vast global movement.\u201d Unheard and ignored was how many working French citizens felt in 2023, as anger at a hike in the retirement age sparked months of protests. It was a gordian knot of Macron\u2019s own making. Solving pensions\u2019\u00a0fatal funding dilemma was sound policy on paper but woefully sold to the public. It was finally driven into law without lawmakers\u2019 consent: The government ruling by decree. Stripped of his parliamentary majority in 2022 and stung by a rejection of his vision at the 2024 European elections, he gambled on his faith in the French electorate. \u201cIt is above all, an act of trust,\u201d Macron said as he called snap parliamentary elections, \u201cin the capacity of the French people to make the most just decision.\u201d Many in France wondered why.\u00a0Among MPs of Macron\u2019s party, there was \u201clots of incomprehension,\u201d the lawmaker told CNN. Struggling with unfavorable parliamentary arithmetic, \u201cit was going to happen in any case,\u201d the MP said. \u201cI think what made it harder for me compared to the others is that the person who pressed the button is the president, so obviously it\u2019s him who is at fault.\u201d The result was\u00a0effectively\u00a0a referendum on Macron himself.\u00a0His centrist Ensemble alliance now holds 163 seats, far fewer than the 245 seats it took in 2022, and he presents a weakened figure abroad and at home. The far right argue they pose no threat to France. \u201cWe don\u2019t represent any danger, apart from making (Macron) lose power,\u201d Marine Le Pen told CNN last week. But there is a real fear of a return to power of identity politics in many parts of today\u2019s culturally rich, but complicated, France. Now that the far right have stormed to legislative power \u2013 and have their sights set on the Elysee Palace in 2027\u00a0\u2013 the threat posed by the National Rally\u2019s victories is not limited to Macron\u2019s ego. For countless communities in France - French or\u00a0immigrant\u00a0- the legacy of one man\u2019s gamble, and the uncertainty that is his legacy, will exact a far higher price.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/europe/how-macron-lost-france-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_08_china_china-maths-student-controversy-hnk-intl", "text": "A fashion major from a vocational high school in rural China has amazed the nation by outshining elite students in a global math contest \u2013 but the teenager\u2019s underdog story has now been mired by controversy. Jiang Ping, born in a poor village in eastern China\u2019s Jiangsu province, ranked 12th out of 802 shortlisted competitors \u2013 mostly from prestigious institutions such as Harvard, Oxford, and MIT \u2013 in first-round results released on June 13 by DAMO Academy, the organizer of the Alibaba Global Mathematics Competition. Launched in 2018 by Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba, the free online contest is open to math enthusiasts worldwide, though Chinese math majors typically dominate the top places. This year\u2019s top 85 finishers will win prizes from $2,000 to $30,000. Jiang\u2019s high placement \u2013 in the first of the contest\u2019s two rounds \u2013 was a remarkable achievement for a student from one of the country\u2019s vocational schools, which suffer deep-seated social prejudices and whose graduates occupy the lowest rungs of China\u2019s educational hierarchy. Her success initially garnered nationwide acclaim, with multiple Chinese state media outlets jumping on the story and a deluge of online commentary buoyed by seeing a vocational student do so well in an international math competition. But doubts about the 17-year-old\u2019s math skills have gained momentum online since the end of last month, ahead of the release next month of results from the much more challenging second round. The organizing committee has yet to address them. Suspicions cast Jiang\u2019s gift for math came to the fore in junior high, where her scores far outstripped those of her peers, state-run news agency Xinhua\u00a0reported. She was later trained by math teacher Wang Runqiu at Lianshu Secondary Vocational School, where she studies fashion design. Wang, a three-time finalist in the contest, helped Jiang to teach herself advanced math over the past two years, according to Xinhua. Since Jiang\u2019s top-20 finish in the first round was announced, a related hashtag topped searches on X-like platform Weibo, amassing more than 650 million views so far. In her hometown, her image beamed from television screens at local malls. Jiang finished the final round on June 22, and the results will be released in August. However, just a day after the final, Richard Xu from Harvard Business School, who placed 190th in the first round, announced on China\u2019s Quora-type site Zhihu that he, along with 38 other contestants, had filed a joint letter to the organizing committee asking for an independent investigation into Jiang and Wang\u2019s answer sheets from the qualifying round. The letter cites \u201cevidence\u201d of alleged fraud, including a theory of \u201ccollaborative cheating\u201d headed by Wang, who came 125th. Four days before the final round, Yin Wotao, a member of the organizing committee, had defended Jiang in a soon-deleted response to a skeptic on X. \u201cSome math amateurs have indeed placed well in the qualifying rounds in past years,\u201d given the moderate difficulty and generous 48-hour time limit, Yin argued. Blocked from accessing Yin\u2019s short-lived comments by Chinese internet restrictions, users posted on the Lianshui county government\u2019s website, demanding an official investigation into Jiang and Wang. On June 27, the local government confirmed what until that point had been an online rumor that Jiang scored only 83 out of 150 in a school math exam held after the qualifying round. The next day, it provided a formulaic response to further related queries, saying \u201cthe investigation is underway.\u201d Soon after, all the posts relating to Jiang were taken down and there\u2019s been no update since. In response to CNN\u2019s inquiries on June 28, organizing committee member Yin declined to comment without the green light from DAMO Academy, his employer. CNN has reached out to the academy for comment and could not reach Jiang and her teacher Wang. Social stigma for vocational students Among the cacophony of commentary, some suspect the harsh public scrutiny of Jiang is rooted in social prejudice against vocational students. \u201cThe fact that Jiang, the vocational student, has garnered so much public attention per se mirrors social discontent with China\u2019s education system,\u201d Zhao Yong, distinguished professor in educational psychology at the University of Kansas, told CNN. These students make up the bottom 40% in China\u2019s senior high school entrance exam, or \u201czhongkao.\u201d They do not qualify to enter regular high schools, where students cram for \u201cgaokao,\u201d China\u2019s notoriously daunting college entrance exam. In a society where poor academic performance is often equated with moral failings, \u201clazy bones,\u201d \u201csmall-timers,\u201d and \u201cdelinquents\u201d have become bywords for the cohort who perform poorly on the zhongkao at 15 and are generally resigned to toil in factories for the rest of their lives. This represents a stark reversal from the 1980s and 90s when vocational schooling was respected as a sought-after path to \u201ciron rice bowls,\u201d a popular term for secure jobs, amid the country\u2019s urgent need for technical workers. However, the boom soon died down as higher education expanded in 1999. As China races to meet its ambitious \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d goal to become \u201ca world manufacturing power,\u201d Beijing has been strengthening vocational education in recent years. But structural discrimination in China\u2019s schools, universities and workplaces means society still favors academic degrees over trades. Another \u2018disappeared Einstein\u2019? In an interview with The Beijing News, a Communist Party-owned newspaper, Jiang said she wanted to go college and that her dream school was Zhejiang University, a top academy in the e-commerce hub Hangzhou. But that could still be difficult despite her apparent maths proficiency. Jiang\u2019s mentor Wang told the state-run Xinhua Daily that due to restrictions on\u00a0major choices for future vocational education, she can only apply to three colleges in Jiangsu province, with her best option being a second-tier public university. \u201cChina selects and categorizes talents way too early and too rigidly. This has greatly limited individuals\u2019 future options and paths,\u201d said Zhao, citing Germany and Finland as better examples of dual-track schooling with greater flexibility for students to shift between vocational and academic tracks. Beijing\u2019s attempt to emulate those European nations by encouraging resource exchanges between the two types of schools over the past decade has met a lukewarm response from high schools busy coaching students to score higher in the \u201cgaokao\u201d university entrance exam. According to Zhao, Jiang is already \u201ca lucky rarity if she\u2019s truly gifted in math.\u201d But he warned she may become a \u201cdisappeared Einstein\u201d \u2013 one of the many buried talents in China\u2019s education system. The jury is still out, with second-round results due next month. Jiang considers math her \u201cPlan B,\u201d prioritizing fashion design for future study, according to The Beijing News. Zhao said working in a factory is a \u201creasonable choice\u201d for the 17-year-old village girl, who as a vocational student has limited options for higher education. \u201cAfter all, she has a mouth to feed,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/china/china-maths-student-controversy-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_europe_new-popular-front-france-election-explainer-intl", "text": "A month ago, the New Popular Front (NFP) did not exist. Now, it has won the most seats in the French parliament and could provide France with its next prime minister. The left-wing coalition chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. Official results released early Monday show the NFP has done so again \u2014 winning 182 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest bloc but short of an absolute majority, according to the French Interior Ministry. But the hastily assembled coalition comprises disparate political parties that have not always played nice. And it has campaigned on a platform of high public spending that has spooked financial markets and could tip France into economic chaos. So, what is the NFP, what does it stand for, and who are its key players? Who are the NFP? The NFP is made up of several parties: the far-left France Unbowed party; the more moderate Socialist Party; the green Ecologist party; the French Communist Party; the center-left Place Publique, and other small parties. It formed just days after President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election, in the wake of his centrist party\u2019s embarrassing defeat to Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party in last month\u2019s European Parliament election. \u201cFollowing his side\u2019s defeat at the European elections, Emmanuel Macron has opted for a gamble at a time when the far right is at its most powerful, running the risk of seeing it come to power for the first time since Vichy,\u201d Socialist leader Olivier Faure said last month, referring to the French government that collaborated with Nazi occupiers during World War II. \u201cOnly a united left can stand in its way,\u201d he said. Who\u2019s in charge of the NFP? It\u2019s hard to say. Each party celebrated the results at their own headquarters and separate campaign events, rather than together. Going into the second round, it was not clear who the coalition would nominate to be its prime minister. Its most prominent \u2013 and divisive \u2013 figure is Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, a 72-year-old populist firebrand and longtime leader of the France Unbowed party. France Unbowed is the largest single party within the coalition, winning 74 seats in Sunday\u2019s vote ahead of the Socialists on 59 seats. With France now facing a hung parliament it remains unclear who the next prime minister will be. Figures in Macron\u2019s Ensemble party have repeatedly said they would refuse to work with France Unbowed, saying it is just as extreme \u2013 and therefore as unfit to govern \u2013 as the RN. Announcing his intention to resign Monday as prime minister, Gabriel Attal said, in an apparent swipe to France Unbowed: \u201cNo absolute majority can be led by the extremes. We owe it to the French spirit, so deeply attached to the Republic and its values.\u201d M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s three presidential campaigns have been beset by accusations of antisemitism. In a recent survey of French Jewish voters by Ifop, 57% said they would leave France if M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s party were to govern. A more acceptable face of the coalition could be the Socialist Faure, or Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, the moderate leader of Place Publique and a member of the European Parliament. What are the NFP\u2019s policies? On foreign policy, the NFP has pledged to \u201cimmediately recognize\u201d a Palestinian state, and will push for Israel and Hamas to cease fire in Gaza. The NFP campaigned on an expansive economic platform, promising to raise the minimum monthly wage to 1,600 euros (more than $1,700) and to cap the price of essential foods, electricity, fuel and gas. It also pledged to scrap Macron\u2019s pension reform, a deeply unpopular policy that raised the French retirement age \u2013 one of the lowest in the Western world \u2013 from 62 to 64. While these pledges have proved popular, they have been made at a time when France could be heading for a period of austerity. France is running one of the highest deficits in the Eurozone and now risks falling foul of the European Commission\u2019s new fiscal rules, which were suspended to help countries recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and energy crisis. Since Macron called the election, financial markets have taken fright \u2013 first at the prospect of an extremist government, then at the economic policies of the hard left and right, with the RN also promising an expansive fiscal program. Because the NFP did not win enough seats to form an absolute majority, it will have to enter into another coalition \u2013 likely with Ensemble, which may try to dilute some of its more radical spending policies \u2013 in order to pass laws. This process is likely to be frustrating, as several parties \u2013 straddling huge ideological divides \u2013 try to find common ground.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/europe/new-popular-front-france-election-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

The quarter-plate daguerreotype of former First Lady Dolley Madison, wife of fourth US president James Madison, dates from around 1846. It joins a host of other early photographic portraits in the NPG\u2019s collection, including what is believed to be the earliest photograph of a US president, an 1843 daguerreotype of John Quincy Adams by Philip Haas, which was acquired by the museum in 2017. The Dolley Madison daguerreotype, made by artist and entrepreneur John Plumbe Jr., shows the trailblazing first lady when she was in her late seventies. Plumbe, an English immigrant who came to America in 1821, picked up photography professionally around 20 years after his arrival, establishing studios in more than a dozen cities before selling his business in 1847. In addition to his portrait of Madison, he created the earliest extant image of the US Capitol. The NPG bought the Madison photograph for $456,000 at a Sotheby\u2019s auction of books, manuscripts and Americana on June 28, more than six times the lot\u2019s high estimate of $70,000. The funds were provided in part by the Secretary of the Smithsonian, Lonnie G. Bunch III, and the Joseph L. and Emily K. Gidwitz Memorial Foundation Endowment, in addition to private support. Sotheby\u2019s auction catalog described the piece as \u201cone of exceedingly few surviving photographs of the woman who has defined for two centuries what it means to be the first lady of the United States of America\u201d. \u201cThis artifact will provide the Smithsonian another opportunity to tell a more robust American story and illuminate the vital role women like Madison have played in the nation\u2019s progress,\u201d Bunch said in a statement. Dolley Payne Todd Madison, who was raised by a Quaker family in Philadelphia, is considered by many to have invented the role of first lady. Her extroversion, intelligence and prowess as a hostess helped her husband create strategic political friendships and position the White House at the center of Washington society. Her Wednesday night soirees became the stuff of legend during her tenure as first lady, and the US House of Representatives granted her an honorary seat whenever she wanted to attend sessions at the Capitol. At her funeral, President Zachary Taylor characterized Madison as \u201cthe first lady of the land for half a century,\u201d marking the first ever use of the phrase \u201cfirst lady.\u201d The daguerreotype was the first widely available photographic process, invented by its namesake, Louis Daguerre, in 1839. The process involves polishing a sheet of silver-plated copper and treating it with light-sensitive fumes before exposing it to a camera, and then drawing the latent image forth with mercury vapor and chemical treatments. It was the most popular and accessible form of photographic image-making in the 1840s and \u201850s.

The Basmanny District Court in Moscow accused Navalnaya of \u201cparticipation in an extremist organization,\u201d her spokesperson Kira Yarmysh said in a post on social media. She has also been added to an international wanted list, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. In addition, the court granted a request by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation to detain Navalnaya. The period of detention would be calculated from the moment of possible extradition to Russian territory or from her detention on Russian territory, according to a press release. Navalnaya does not live in Russia. Alexey Navalny died on February 16 in the penal colony in Siberia where he was serving a 19-year sentence after being found guilty of creating an extremist community, financing extremist activists and various other crimes in August. He was already serving sentences of 11-and-a-half years in a maximum security facility on fraud and other charges he had always denied and claimed were politically motivated. Navalny was Russia\u2019s highest-profile opposition leader and spent years criticizing Putin, who has been in power for nearly a quarter of a century, at great personal risk. His death came weeks before the country\u2019s\u00a0presidential elections\u00a0scheduled to begin nationwide on March 15, which is widely seen by the international community as little more than a formality that will secure Putin a fifth term in power. \u2018Putin is a murderer\u2019 Navalny\u2019s death was met with grief and anger across the world as well as inside Russia, where the smallest acts of political dissent carry huge risks. He returned to Russia in 2021 from Germany, where he had been treated after being poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent. On arrival Navalny was swiftly arrested \u2013 on charges he dismissed as politically motivated \u2013 and spent the rest of his life in prison. His wife, Yulia\u00a0Navalnaya, accused Russian President Vladimir Putin in February of being\u00a0responsible for his death\u00a0and indicated she would pick up her husband\u2019s mantle,\u00a0for a \u201chappy, beautiful Russia.\u201d Navalnaya posted an eight-minute video on her dead\u00a0husband\u2019s\u00a0social media outlets, saying Putin \u201ckilled the father of my children, Putin took away the most precious thing that was my closest and most beloved person.\u201d She said Russian authorities were \u201chiding\u201d Navalny\u2019s body in an attempt to disguise the cause of his death \u2013 \u201clying pathetically\u201d and waiting for \u201ctraces of another of Putin\u2019s Novichoks to disappear.\u201d The Kremlin rejected any allegations of involvement in\u00a0Navalny\u2019s death. Reacting to the court\u2019s decision on Tuesday, Navalnaya reiterated claims of Putin\u2019s involvement in the death of her husband. \u201cHis place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cozy cell with a TV, but in Russia \u2013 in the same colony and the same 2 by 3 meter cell in which he killed Alexey,\u201d she said in a social media post. \u201cOh, won\u2019t there be the usual procedure? A foreign agent, then the opening of a criminal case, then an arrest?!

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

Their peaceful green campaigns have been championed by climate activist Greta Thunberg and in 2015, they successfully fought against a plan for a hydroelectric dam they claim would have damaged a pristine rainforest valley. But this week, the Southeast Asian nation sentenced 10 activists from the group Mother Nature Cambodia to up to six years in prison each on charges of conspiring against the state.

Though his eldest son, Hun Manet, succeeded him as prime minister last year, Hun Sen is still widely seen as the ruling party\u2019s center of power. \u201cLike what we are seeing with dictators in other countries, Cambodia is becoming more repressed,\u201d said Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson, a Spaniard who co-founded Mother Nature Cambodia over a decade ago, alongside local Cambodian activists. Climate activism in the country is at a \u201crougher, grassroots level,\u201d he added, with the conversation centering more on \u201cextremely rich and powerful tycoons and corrupt government officials trying to exploit and privatize,\u201d the environment. \u201cThis is Cambodia now \u2013 logging, poaching, mineral extraction, turning lakes into land and destroying rivers, as well as exporting massive amounts of sands. There are systems in place where (officials) exploit the environment for profit and our group has been doing as much as we can to stop these unethical projects and protect the environment \u2013 and that is why we are a threat in the regime\u2019s eyes.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Cambodian government for comment on the court ruling and allegations in this story. Outside the court ahead of Tuesday\u2019s ruling, a government spokesperson denied that the charges against the activists were politically motivated. \u201cThe government has never taken action against those who criticize. We only take action against those who commit crimes,\u201d spokesperson Pen Bona told Reuters. Award-winning campaigners Founded in 2012, Mother Nature Cambodia has campaigned against environmental destruction and exposed alleged corruption in state management of precious mineral resources, and their savvy use of social media has resonated with young Cambodians. In 2023, the group was awarded the Right Livelihood Award, often called the \u201calternative Nobel Prize.\u201d \u201cMother Nature Cambodia is a group of fearless young activists fighting for environmental rights and democracy in the face of repression by the Cambodian regime,\u201d the jury said in a speech at the time, describing them as \u201ca powerful voice for environmental preservation and democracy in Cambodia.\u201d Several activists were unable to receive the award in person as Cambodian courts denied their requests to travel to Sweden to collect the prize. \u201cThey have successfully helped local communities stop environmental violations,\u201d Right Livelihood\u2019s executive director Ole von Uexkuell said last year. \u201cThrough innovative and often humorous protests, their activism defends nature and livelihoods while upholding communities\u2019 voices against corrupt and damaging products.\u201d The group has strongly leveraged social media, saying it helps get their message across to young supporters. They have more than 450,000 followers on Facebook, the most widely used social platform in the country. But it\u2019s on TikTok that their videos really make an impression on young Cambodian users like Run Bunry, a high-school student from the capital Phnom Penh and his friends. \u201cThey are positive and lighthearted and also teach us a lot about the environment,\u201d he said. One video, highlighting an investigation into the alleged illegal export of rare silica sand, showed three members buried up to their heads in sand and was shared more than 1,000 times. Another viral video taken along a beach in the coastal city Sihanoukville showed the extent of alleged illegal construction by hotels and casinos on the shore. \u201cFollower numbers have grown especially in the last five years and a lot of our old content regularly resurfaces on TikTok and goes viral,\u201d said founding member Gonzalez-Davidson, who was expelled from Cambodia in 2015 after the group\u2019s successful campaign to stop a Chinese-funded hydropower dam from being built over the Areng Valley, an area of pristine rainforest in southwest Cambodia. Members of the group say they have faced increasing threats, harassment and criminal charges for years. Under scorching heat on Tuesday, members of the group \u2013 dressed in white and accompanied by a crowd of supporters \u2013 staged a mock funeral procession in the streets leading to the Phnom Penh Municipal Court. But peaceful scenes descended into chaos after the sentencing was announced. Video footage showed activists Mother Nature Cambodia activists Ly Chandaravuth, Long Kunthea, Thun Ratha, Phuon Keoraksmey and Yim Leanghy surrounded by dozens of armed police officers and dragged away into waiting cars, bound for prisons across the country. Rights activist Pilorge Naly of NGO the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights was at the scene and told CNN the arrests were immediate and violent. Journalists and supporters were also pushed and shoved by security officers, she said. Arrest warrants have been issued for five other members of the group, including Gonzalez-Davidson, who was sentenced to eight years in prison Tuesday on the conspiracy charge and insulting Cambodia\u2019s king. \u201cThe increasing use by Cambodian authorities of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 and other articles of Cambodia\u2019s criminal code to penalise the exercise of human rights is deeply worrying,\u201d United Nations Human Rights spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said in a statement following the ruling. Gonzalez-Davidson, however, said the ruling would backfire against the authorities and inspire a new cohort of environmental campaigners. \u201cThis week, a new generation of Cambodian activists was born \u2013 one that did not exist back in 2012,\u201d he said. \u201cMany young Cambodians are very engaged in the next steps and public campaigning must continue. There have been (arrests and jailings) before and each time, we come out stronger. \u201cThey won\u2019t break our spirits. We are not going to be shut down.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/asia/mother-nature-cambodia-climate-youth-activists-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_asia_korea-ac130j-ghostrider-gunship-biggest-gun-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "As the US Air Force AC-130J flies over South Korea\u2019s towering apartment blocks, its powerful cameras can almost see inside\u00a0windows on the highest floors. Aiming farther afield, the weapons officers on the four-engine aircraft, nicknamed Ghostrider, can pick out objects at 50,000 feet, almost 10 miles away \u2013 all potential targets for the biggest gun ever mounted on a fixed-wing plane. CNN got an exclusive look inside the aircraft, assigned to Air Force Special Operations Command, in early June after it flew from its home base in Hurlburt Field, Florida, for joint drills in South Korea. In a live-fire exercise, the 105-millimeter howitzer pumped out 43-pound shells, into a firing range east of Seoul, the force of each blast so powerful that it pushed the tail of the 80-ton plane six feet to the right. About eight seconds after firing, the shells hit the range 10,000 feet below, sending smoke billowing skyward as the controllers of the big gun watched the results of their handiwork on large video screens in the middle of the aircraft. \u201cAssess two tanks destroyed,\u201d a scratchy voice confirms in the radio headsets of the AC-130 crew. Pilot Capt. John Ikenberry said the AC-130\u2019s presence for drills in South Korea was designed to send a simple message to its belligerent neighbors and their leaderKim Jong Un to the north \u2013 deterrence. \u201cIt shows we are ready,\u201d Ikenberry said. Tensions have been simmering on the peninsula in recent months. The North has been sending balloons filled with trash to areas in and near Seoul and testing missiles, and South Korean troops have fired warning shots as North Korean soldiers from the North have crossed the military demarcation line in the middle of the demilitarized zone. Just this week, North Korea criticized live-fire exercises in the South in late June and early July as an \u201c\u2018inexcusable and explicit provocation.\u201d Meanwhile, Washington has kept a steady stream of hardware heading to the South for land, air and sea exercises leading up to one of their biggest yearly exercises, Ulchi Freedom Shield, set to begin later this summer. Experience they can\u2019t get stateside The AC-130J, the newest version of the US Air Force Hercules gunships, is testing its mettle in Korea for the second year in a row. Maj. Heath Curtis, combat systems officer on the Hercules, says it\u2019s important for the gunship to make the flight across the Pacific because it offers experience training where a conflict could be fought with conditions that can\u2019t be duplicated on firing ranges in Florida or New Mexico that the gunship would use in the United States. The mountain ranges and ridges of the Korean Peninsula present wind conditions not found elsewhere, he says, and that can make a difference even to a projectile traveling more than 800 mph. It also gives the chance for Curtis and a second officer seated at AC-130\u2019s weapons control center the chance to practice alongside South Korean allies they may need to protect in the event of a ground war on the peninsula. The huge television monitors bring the battlefield below up close in both regular and infrared definition. The cameras mounted outside the plane can zoom in on details to ensure weapons fire is accurate. \u201cThe unique thing about the AC-130 is the amount of fire that we bring, the amount of munitions \u2013 the diverse amount of them \u2013 and the amount of loiter time we can provide,\u201d says the mission commander for this gunship, Maj. Justin Burris. Besides the 105-millimeter howitzer, the AC-130J carries a 30-millimeter cannon and can launch precision-guided missiles and bombs from pylons on its wings. With the weapons\u2019 near-pinpoint accuracy, it can fire on enemy positions within shouting distance of friendly troops, earning the aircraft the title of \u201cthe infantryman\u2019s best friend\u201d in some circles. And with air-to-air refueling, it can, in theory, stay on station supporting ground forces as long as the crew and ammunition can last. \u2018Spooky\u2019 history US Air Force gunships trace their lineage back to the Vietnam War, when the service set up 7.62 mm guns to fire out one side of a C-47 transport aircraft. With that configuration, the aircraft could circle a single point and deliver massive, continuous firepower on it, from its guns that could fire 6,000 rounds in a minute, according to Air Force fact sheets. The firepower and the flares they used to light up targets during night missions earned them the nicknames \u201cSpooky\u201d and \u201cPuff the Magic Dragon.\u201d As the war went on, the Air Force looked for a heavier airframe for the gunship role and turned to C-130 Hercules transports. The first conversion of a C-130 to an AC-130 saw action over Southeast Asia in 1967, according to the National Museum of the US Air Force. With their ability to support troops in close combat, AC-130 gunships in different variations have seen action in conflicts including Grenada, Panama, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan and have saved an untold number of lives, according to the Air Force. With the AC-130J model, introduced in 2017, the Air Force removed the machine guns in favor of the more precision-guided munitions. But there have been problems, too, including a 2015 attack on a Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, that killed left 42 patients, staff and caretakersdead. Despite the formidable firepower it carries, the AC-130 flies low and slow, making it vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. And seven AC-130 gunships have been lost over the years, the last being on January 31, 1991, when an Iraqi surface-to-air missile brought down a AC-130H during Operation Desert Storm, according to Air Force news releases. The plane crashed into the Persian Gulf while supporting US Marines during a battle in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, killing all 14 crew aboard. The AC-130\u2019s crew acknowledges the dangers of ground fire to their aircraft, and some analysts question its usefulness in any potential conflict with North Korea. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t be operated within say 100 nautical miles of the border as they\u2019re too vulnerable to North Korean border air defenses,\u201d says Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and former Royal Australian Air Force officer. But Layton says the gunships could be helpful supporting allied troops who might be trying to round up North Korean special forces units that had managed to infiltrate deeper into southern territory. Still, he cautioned, \u201cif a war starts there, try not to be on an AC-130 unless it\u2019s heading out of theater.\u201d Maj. Christopher Mesnard, Special Operations Command Korea public affairs director, said the AC-130J is a suitable weapon system for the Korean Peninisula. \u201cWe have the utmost confidence in our ability to operate weapons systems\u00a0\u200blike the AC-130J in times and places of our choosing and in a way that adequately considers risks, regardless of the region,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_05_asia_japan-us-fighter-jets-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "The US military will send dozens of its newest fighter jets to Japan as part of a $10 billion upgrade of its forces in the country, the Defense Department announced Wednesday. In a news release, the Pentagon said the effort would be carried out \u201cover the next several years\u201d to \u201cenhance the US-Japan Alliance, bolster regional deterrence, and strengthen peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\u201d The modernization plan will see 48 fifth-generation F-35A fighters replace 36 F-16s at Misawa Air Base in northern Japan, and 36 brand-new F-15EX jets deploy to Kadena Air Base on the southern island of Okinawa, replacing 48 older F-15C/D models that have been pulled from the region in the past year, the Pentagon release said. At Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, just south of Hiroshima on the main island of Honshu, the number of deployed F-35B aircraft will be modified, the Pentagon said, without giving specific numbers. \u201cThe Department\u2019s plan to station the Joint Force\u2019s most advanced tactical aircraft in Japan demonstrates the ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan and both countries\u2019 shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region,\u201d the news release said. Japan said basing the new fighter aircraft in the country would enhance US capabilities there. \u201cIn the face of the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II, and amidst the increased military activities of neighboring countries, the United States is maintaining and strengthening the presence of U.S. forces in Japan to further enhance the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. alliance,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, the government\u2019s top spokesman, said at a regular briefing Thursday. Japan\u2019s alliance with the US has become increasingly important in a region that is seeing China, Russia and North Korea all pose threats that Tokyo seeks to counter. Japan has festering territorial disputes in the north with Russia and with China over islands in the East China Sea. Meanwhile, North Korea\u2019s growing missile program, which has seen Pyongyang send missiles over Japanese territory in recent years, draws condemnation from Tokyo with every projectile test. Japan also keeps a wary eye on the situation surrounding Taiwan, the self-ruled democratic island that the Chinese Communist Party has vowed to bring under Beijing\u2019s control, by force if necessary. As much as 90% of Japan\u2019s energy supplies come via sea lanes near Taiwan, according to Tokyo, which sees the status quo around the island as key to its security. Okinawa is only about 450 miles (725 kilometers) from Taiwan, and both the US and Japan maintain key air bases on the island. US air power in Japan The US Air Force calls the Kadena Air Base, home of the 18th Wing, its \u201cKeystone of the Pacific,\u201d and for more than four decades the older model F-15s based there were central to US deterrence in the region. But from 2022, as the twin-engine fighters neared the end of their service life, the US Air Force began pulling them from Kadena. While the service has rotated other assets through the air base since, to cover the absence of the older F-15s, the permanent presence of the F-15EXs will bring stability to the force structure. The F-15EX is a leap above the older models. Manufacturer Boeing says the jet has \u201cunparalleled weapons capacity,\u201d with an ability to carry 12 advanced medium-range, air-to-air missiles (AMRAAM) and\u00a0to fire them from a range \u201cfarther than any other fighter in the US Air Force arsenal.\u201d Although not a stealth fighter like the F-35, Boeing says the F-15EX has next-generation survivability. \u201cIt serves as a long-range standoff weapons system that is also capable of penetrating and surviving in highly contested environments,\u201d the company says on its website. Military aviation analyst Peter Layton said the F-15EXs would be a worry for China in the event of any conflict. The jet can be fitted with stealthy long-range cruise missiles with a range of more than 500 miles (800 kilometers) that could strike inside the Chinese mainland, he said. Newer missiles under development could double that distance, he added. \u201cThat will hold at risk even more Chinese mainland military bases and offer a very quick attack option,\u201d Layton said. The F-15EX is the Air Force\u2019s newest fighter jet, with the first operational plane delivered to the Oregon Air National Guard in early June. The F-35As that will be stationed at Misawa Air Base are the Air Force\u2019s newest stealth fighters. They\u2019ve long been designated as the replacement for F-16s in the USAF inventory. F-35s deliver \u201can enhanced capability to survive in the advanced threat environment in which it was designed to operate,\u201d an Air Force fact sheet says. Layton said the F-15EXs and F-35As complement each other well in a combat scenario. \u201cThe F-35 is an excellent low-observable sensor platform that could operate forward in stealth mode relaying data back to patrolling F-15EXs with their supersonic cruise and large air-to-air missile load outs,\u201d said Layton, a fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and former Royal Australian Air Force officer. The aircraft deployments add to other improvements Washington has been making to its force structure in Japan, where the US has more than 50,000 troops. Okinawa houses more than 25,000 US military personnel and more than two dozen military installations. Roughly 70% of the US military bases in Japan are on Okinawa. The US and Japan announced last year that a newly redesignated Marine unit with advanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and the ability to fire anti-ship missiles would be based in Japan.

{"id": "2024_07_09_australia_australia-envoys-antisemitism-islamophobia-intl-hnk", "text": "The Australian government is appointing the country\u2019s first envoys to fight antisemitism and Islamophobia in an attempt to prevent further fraying of social cohesion over the war in Gaza. Announcing the positions on Tuesday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East had caused \u201ca great deal of grief\u201d for Jewish and Islamic communities in Australia. \u201cAustralians overwhelmingly do not want conflict brought here. What they want here is harmony and for people to be able to get on with each other,\u201d he said. The appointments come amid protests in Australia and dissent within the ranks of Albanese\u2019s ruling Labor Party over a war that has cost tens of thousands of lives and displaced more than 2 million people in Gaza. More than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 7, when Israel launched a devastating response to an attack by Hamas militants that killed more than 1,100 Israelis and saw hundreds of others kidnapped\u00a0to Gaza. The two sides remain locked in conflict amid deeply polarized protests around the world over how Israel is fighting the conflict in Gaza where millions of Palestinians are facing famine and Hamas continues to hold hostages. Albanese said Tuesday that Jewish lawyer Jillian Segal had been appointed to consult Jewish Australians, experts and the wider community about ways to best address antisemitism. \u201cOne of the things that I have found quite shocking is the lack of knowledge and experience about antisemitism and about where it leads,\u201d Albanese said from the Jewish Museum in Sydney where he made the announcement. \u201cI have spoken with members of the Jewish community here, in Melbourne, right around Australia, who have not felt safe, members of the Jewish community whose children are worried about wearing their school uniform in our capital cities. That\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d he said. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ), which represents the Jewish community, recorded a spike in antisemitic incidents from October to November 2023. The group said Tuesday reports of antisemitic incidents in Australia are still running 400-500% higher than before the conflict. In some of the most high-profile incidents in Melbourne this year, windows were smashed on the office of a Jewish lawmaker and antisemitic slogans were written on a Jewish school. The Australian government supports a two-state solution to the conflict in the Middle East and has backed calls for a ceasefire, the safe passage of humanitarian aid, and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Albanese said\u00a0a \u201cspecial envoy for Islamophobia\u201d\u00a0will be appointed \u201cshortly\u201d in a similar role to work with the Muslim community to promote social cohesion. Most countries recognize Palestinian statehood, and in May a United Nations resolution on Palestinian membership passed with the support of 143 nations, including Australia. In recent weeks the government\u2019s own cohesion has been tested by the resignation of a West Australian senator, who crossed the floor to vote with a rival party on the issue of Palestinian statehood. \u201cWith a heavy heart but a clear conscience, I announce my resignation from the Australian Labor Party,\u201d Sen. Fatima Payman announced last Thursday. Payman, Labor\u2019s first Muslim senator, voted\u00a0with the Greens Party on a motion to recognize Palestinian statehood and threatened to do it again, breaking party rules. She was indefinitely suspended from Labor\u2019s parliamentary caucus and later resigned to serve as an independent, accusing her former colleagues of attempting to intimidate her \u2013 claims the party denied. Protests against Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza are continuing in Australia with four people arrested for climbing onto the roof of Parliament House last week.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

The robot dog, which is currently being field-tested, is able to navigate its physical environment via cameras and sensors, including recognizing traffic light signals, which traditional guide dogs are unable to do. Roughly the size of an English Bulldog but a bit wider, it can communicate by listening and speaking with a visually impaired operator with AI-technology incorporated in its voice recognition, route planning capabilities and traffic light recognition. It also has six legs, which the researchers say help it walk smoothly and with maximum stability. \u201cWhen three legs are lifted, there are still three legs \u2026 like the tripod of a camera. It is the most stable shape,\u201d said Professor Gao Feng, the head of the research team at Jiao Tong University\u2019s School of Mechanical Engineering in Shanghai. Married couple Li Fei, 41, and Zhu Sibin, 42, are among the visually impaired people helping the Jiao Tong University team test the robot using Chinese-language commands. Li is completely blind and Zhu sees only a little, normally using a cane to assist him in getting around. \u201cIf this robot guide dog comes onto the market and I could use it, at least it could solve some of my problems in traveling alone,\u201d Li said. \u201cFor example, if I want to go to work, the hospital or the supermarket (now) I cannot go out alone and must be accompanied by my family or volunteers.\u201d Robot guide dogs are under development in other countries, including Australia and Britain, but China has a drastic shortage of traditional guide dogs. In China, there are just over 400 guide dogs for almost 20 million blind people, Gao said. Pet ownership and service animals are also relatively new concepts in the country, meaning many workplaces, restaurants and other public areas wouldn\u2019t welcome a more traditional helper like a Labrador. Unlike those dogs, which will always be limited in supply due to the natural limitations of breeding and the intense training required, Gao said the production of robot guide dogs could be scaled, especially in a major manufacturing hub like China. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like cars. I can mass-produce them in the same way as cars, so it will become more affordable,\u201d Gao said. \u201cI think this could be a very large market, because there might be tens of millions of people in the world who need guide dogs.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/china/chinese-robot-guide-dog-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_09_americas_american-mountaineer-body-found-peru-intl-latam", "text": "The body of an American mountaineer has been discovered by a pair of fellow US climbers 22 years after he went missing following an avalanche in the Peruvian Andes. American\u00a0brothers\u00a0Ryan Cooper and Wesley Waren found the body of Bill Stampfl on June 27 on Mount Huascaran,\u00a0according to Joseph Stampfl, Bill\u2019s son. The climbers had been descending the mountain in Peru\u2019s Cordillera Blanca after an unsuccessful attempt to reach its 22,000 ft summit when they found the body, at about 16,500 ft. Cooper told CNN Tuesday they noticed an object that didn\u2019t quite blend into the landscape and decided to investigate. He said the ice had preserved the body and its belongings and Stampfl\u2019s wedding ring, helmet, mountain climbing boots, and jacket were all intact. The brothers managed to identify Stampfl by finding a bag attached to his body, inside which they found his identification card, a camera, passport, wallet, and glasses \u2013 all of which were also intact, Cooper explained. \u201cSomeone loved him and someone wanted him to come home,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAs soon as I found out he was an American climber I knew we had a responsibility to track down the family and give them the news,\u201d Cooper said. Stampfl and two of his fellow climbers and\u00a0friends, Steve Erskine\u00a0and Matthew Richardson, were all killed by an avalanche on Mount Huascaran on June 24, 2002, his daughter Jennifer Stampfl told CNN on Tuesday. Their bodies were never discovered, except for Erskine\u2019s, she said. Stampfl was 58-years-old at the time. His body was retrieved and brought down the mountain on July 5 by the Peruvian Mountain Rescue Association and Peruvian National Police after coordination with Cooper and Stampfl\u2019s family. His body was taken to a morgue in the town of Yungay for an autopsy, Peru\u2019s National Police posted on X on Tuesday. Finding Bill\u2019s family Cooper, a native of Las Vegas, Nevada, called his wife and informed her of his discovery the same day he came across Stampfl\u2019s\u00a0body. He\u00a0asked her for help in finding Stampfl\u2019s\u00a0family, as he was still on Mount Huascaran with limited cellular service. After much online research, Cooper\u2019s wife was able to locate Joseph and called him on June 29. \u201cI told him I know the location of his dad. I told him about the ring and personal items,\u201d Cooper said. His motive was to help the family find closure, Cooper explained. With \u201cno body, there\u2019s no way to find peace with that,\u201d Cooper said. Cooper also spoke to Jennifer and Stampfl\u2019s wife Janet on the phone before sending photos of Stampfl\u2019s ID and other belongings to the family. \u2018My heart just sank\u2019 After so many years, the news came as an emotional shock to Stampfl\u2019s family. \u201cMy heart just sank. After 22 years I had been okay with the fact that he\u2019s there. He\u2019s part of the mountain. Like we\u2019re never going to get him back. The fact that they found him, it opened up all the wounds,\u201d Jennifer told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cThere is no preparation for having your husband killed instantaneously,\u201d Janet said, adding that she never thought her husband\u2019s body would be discovered. \u201cIt\u2019s an answer to so many prayers by so many people.\u201d Janet said her husband loved climbing mountains. \u201cHe enjoyed it so much. He said he always felt closest to God when he got to the top of the mountain,\u201d Janet said. \u201cAfter 22 years\u2026I was a little shocked, it took me a while to process everything,\u201d Joseph said, adding \u201cnow it\u2019s time to bring him home hopefully.\u201d Following an autopsy in Yungay, Stampfl\u2019s body was transferred to the city of Juarez, Joseph explained. Stampfl will be taken to a funeral home in Lima where he will be cremated, and the ashes will be sent to the family in the United States. \u2018A dangerous landscape\u2019 While Cooper is grateful to have finally been able to bring closure to the Stampfl family, the discovery was also tinged with sadness. He had hoped that Richardson\u2019s body might have been attached to Stampfl by a rope, but that was not the case and \u201che\u2019s still missing as of today.\u201d He also fears that global warming may have played a role in his discovery, by thawing the ice on what is considered the world\u2019s highest tropical mountain range. \u201cHe was fully exposed and not in ice anymore. The thawing process happened,\u201d Cooper said. Since the 1950s, almost all of the world\u2019s glaciers have been retreating, according to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. On average, the glaciers in the Andean region \u2013 Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru \u2013 have lost over 50 per cent of their coverage since the 1960s. \u201cThe Andes is deteriorating more than any other mountain range in the region,\u201d Cooper said, adding that the changing conditions were part of what had prevented him from summiting Mount Huascaran. \u201cGlaciers are melting away, the landscape has changed. It poses a dangerous landscape now,\u201d he said.

The organization, founded by 2011 CNN Hero Yuval Roth, had grown to 1,300 volunteers and was helping about 140 patients a day before the war. On October 7, during Hamas\u2019 brutal attacks on Israel, several of the group\u2019s volunteers were killed. Others were taken hostage. Today, Road to Recovery\u2019s work continues, and Roth feels that it is as crucial as ever. \u201cWe \u2026 believe that patient transportation has far greater value than just humanitarian assistance,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt is an opportunity for us to show our Palestinian neighbors a different face than what they know in their reality. It is a chance for encounters that break down barriers and stigmas.\u201d On October 8, volunteers were waiting at checkpoints at the West Bank to pick up Palestinian patients and their families. The organization currently transports between 40 to 50 patients a day between the checkpoints and Israeli hospitals and medical providers. Roth started this work in 2006 as a way to cope with personal tragedy. In 1993, his brother Udi was kidnapped and killed by members of Hamas. After his loss, Roth channeled his anger into peace. The organization says it has since provided transportation to more than 50,000 sick Palestinians. \u201cEach trip is an opportunity to make a \u2018small hour of peace.\u2019\u201d Roth said. \u201cEspecially now, just to show compassion and love. \u2026 This is the medicine for the hostility and for the hateness.\u201d Sometimes, the Israeli volunteer drivers and Palestinian passengers are able to communicate in Arabic, Hebrew, or English. When there\u2019s no shared spoken language, they communicate through gestures, which Roth finds to be more powerful than words. \u201cIf we really want one day normal life for us and for the Palestinians, we should make effort to achieve it,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that you sit and you wait that something will happen. You have to do something. In the Bible, there is a phrase \u2026 that you ask for peace, and you have to run after the peace in order that it will happen.

{"id": "2024_07_08_europe_china-belarus-military-exercises-poland-intl", "text": "Belarus and China kicked off 11-day joint military training exercises Monday, Belarus\u2019 defense ministry said \u2013 with activities taking place just miles from the border of Poland, a NATO and European Union member. The joint anti-terrorist training \u201cAttacking Falcon\u201d exercises in Belarus would see military personnel from both countries \u201cact together\u201d as one unit in certain stages, Major General Vadim Denisenko of the Belarusian military said in a Telegram post. \u201cEvents in the world are complex, the situation is complex, therefore, having studied new forms and methods of conducting warfare, here we will work out all these moments considering all that is new that has been learnt in the past two years,\u201d Denisenko said. The joint exercises are being held at a training ground\u00a0near the\u00a0city of Brest on the\u00a0Belarus-Poland border and some 40 miles from Minsk\u2019s border with Ukraine. They come as Russia\u2019s invasion of that country more than two years has hardened geopolitical divisions and continues to threaten broader regional security. Beijing and Minsk have been tightening their ties in recent years under Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, both autocrats and strong allies of Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. The start of the anti-terrorism exercises coincided with a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Warsaw, where he signed a security agreement with Polish Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. They also began on the eve of NATO\u2019s 75th\u00a0anniversary\u00a0summit in Washington \u2013 a gathering where leaders will look to shore up support for Ukraine nearly two and a half years since Russia\u2019s invasion. NATO and the EU have long accused Belarus of weaponizing the border by pushing asylum-seekers from third countries to its\u00a0borders, and the joint exercises will no doubt be seen by some as a further provocation. CNN has reached out to NATO for comment. Belarus has been a critical Russian ally in the Kremlin\u2019s war on Ukraine. Moscow partly used Belarus as a launching pad for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 after amassing troops on the Ukrainian border during what it said were joint military exercises. Last year Putin also announced Russia would place tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. China has emerged as a key diplomatic and economic lifeline for Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, and been accused by Western leaders of bolstering Moscow\u2019s war effort through the provision of dual use goods \u2013 a charge Beijing denies. Belarus\u2019 Ministry of Defense said troops from China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army arrived in\u00a0Belarus\u00a0over the weekend. It published a series of photographs showing Chinese troops offloading equipment from a military cargo aircraft and said the drills will last until July 19. China\u2019s Ministry of Defense said on Sunday that the drills will include \u201chostage rescue operations and counter-terrorism missions.\u201d \u201cThe training aims to enhance the training levels and coordination capabilities of the participating troops, as well as deepen practical cooperation between the armies of the two countries,\u201d it added. Over the weekend, a delegations from China\u2019s Central Military Commission also held talks with counterparts in Minsk where the two sides discussed \u201cprospects for Belarusian-Chinese cooperation on military personnel training\u201d and outlined new areas of cooperation, according to Belarus\u2019 defense ministry. This latest showing of their security cooperation comes\u00a0just days after Belarus joined the Beijing and Moscow-backed Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on Thursday. Founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO has grown in recent years as Beijing and Moscow drive a transformation of the bloc from a regional security club with a focus on Central Asia to a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the United States and its allies. Belarus\u2019 entry in the bloc \u2013 hailed by Xi and Lukashenko in a meeting on the sidelines of an SCO summit in Kazakhstan last week \u2013 was widely seen by observers as another mark of that transformation. Then, Xi hailed the \u201cgreat strides\u201d in the relationship between the two countries \u2013\u00a0a sentiment echoed in a meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his newly appointed Belarusian counterpart Maksim Ryzhenkov on Monday in Beijing. Wang and Ryzhenkov agreed that the two sides would \u201cfirmly support each other\u201d on issues concerning their core interests and major concerns, according to a readout from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, which also noted their ambition to \u201creject unilateral hegemony\u201d \u2013 a reference to their shared opposition to a world order they see as dominated by the United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/europe/china-belarus-military-exercises-poland-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_weather_hurricane-beryl-south-texas-coast-weekend-sunday-monday", "text": "Tropical Storm Beryl is expected to strengthen into a hurricane again before it reaches the South Texas coast on Monday, bringing damaging winds, life-threatening storm surge and dangerous flooding beginning late Sunday. It\u2019s expected to mark the first US landfall storm of the 2024 Atlantic season. Here\u2019s the latest: \u2022 Beryl to hit Texas as a hurricane: Beryl is forecast to make landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas, as a Category 1 hurricane Monday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center. Currently a tropical storm, Beryl is in the Gulf of Mexico about 245 miles southeast of Corpus Christi, fanning maximum winds of 60 mph as of 5 a.m. ET Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. The state is likely to start seeing the effects of Beryl starting Sunday and several counties have already announced evacuation orders. \u2022\u00a0Hurricane and storm surge alerts: Hurricane warnings are in effect for the Texas coast from Baffin Bay to Sargent, while the stretches south of Baffin Bay to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, and north of Sargent to San Luis Pass, are under hurricane watches. A tropical storm warning is also in place for the area north of Sargent to High Island, and the Mexican coast from Barra el Mezquital to the Rio Grande. Storm surge warnings are in effect from the north entrance of the Padre Island National Seashore to High Island, including Corpus Christi Bay, Matagorda Bay and Galveston Bay. The Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande River northward to North Entrance of the Padre Island National Seashore, as well as San Luis Pass to Sabine Pass are under storm surge watch. \u2022\u00a0Dangerous storm surge along US Gulf Coast: Tropical storm conditions will begin to be felt along the western Gulf Coast on Sunday, with hurricane conditions expected later in the day. Storm surge up to 6 feet is forecast for parts of the Texas coast late Sunday night into Monday as rising waters push inland from the shoreline. Rip currents will also cause life-threatening beach conditions through Monday across much of the Gulf Coast. \u2022\u00a0Flooding and damaging winds expected: Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with localized amounts of 15 inches, is forecast across the Texas Gulf Coast and East Texas late Sunday through the middle of next week, the National Hurricane Center said. It\u2019s expected to produce flash and urban flooding. Hurricane-force winds will hit the lower and middle Texas coast Sunday night and Monday. A few tornadoes could also occur along the Texas Coast Sunday afternoon and evening. \u201cPreparations should be rushed to completion before tropical storm conditions begin late today,\u201d the hurricane center said Sunday morning. \u2022 At least nine dead due to Beryl: Beryl became the earliest Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic on record earlier this week. The storm killed at least nine people in the Caribbean, including two in Jamaica, three in Venezuela, three in Grenada and one person in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. After hammering several Caribbean islands, the storm unloaded strong winds, torrential rainfall and dangerous storm surge over much of Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. \u2022 Beryl worsened by climate change: The\u00a0abnormally warm ocean waters\u00a0fueling Beryl\u2019s intensification show this hurricane season will be far from normal. Beryl\u2019s blow to Jamaica was worsened by climate change,\u00a0a new rapid attribution analysis from ClimaMeter found. Modern storms like Beryl tracking close to Jamaica are capable of unloading 30% more rain and 10% stronger winds compared to the similar storms from 1979 to 2001 because of human-caused climate change, the study found. \u2022 How to help those affected: Jamaican residents are assessing the damage after Beryl pounded the Caribbean island with destructive winds and storm surge. The storm killed two people in the country and left hundreds of thousands of homes without power. Beryl was the strongest storm to impact the country in more than 15 years. Beryl also caused major damage\u00a0across the region, including in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados and Grenada. Several charities are\u00a0actively distributing aid\u00a0throughout the region. Contribute to relief efforts here. Texas officials ask coastal residents to be prepared to leave Texas officials are urging residents to prepare before Beryl\u2019s expected hit to coastal areas later this weekend. \u201cEveryone along the coast should be paying attention to this storm,\u201d Texas\u00a0Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said during a briefing on Friday. \u201cWe pray and we hope for nothing more than a rain event, but even a rain event may be very heavy,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cWe prepare at the state for the worst-case scenario.\u201d Already, several counties have asked residents to evacuate due to the potentially dangerous conditions Beryl could bring. Gov. Greg Abbott has also issued severe weather disaster declarations for 40 counties, as the state contends with \u201cheavy rainfall, flooding conditions, and strong tropical wind.\u201d Matagorda County issued a voluntary evacuation order ahead of Beryl\u2019s arrival, the county\u2019s Emergency Operation Center said on social media. The order calls for people to voluntarily evacuate coastal areas in the county, including Sargent, Matagorda and Palacios. Aransas County issued an evacuation order for residents of \u201clow-lying areas and flood-prone areas and persons with special needs requirements\u201d at 6 p.m. local time. There are no emergency shelter facilities in the county, according to the county\u2019s Facebook announcement, and \u201cmedical and emergency services will likely be affected by the effects of the predicted landfall of Hurricane Beryl.\u201d A mandatory evacuation was ordered Saturday afternoon for all residents of Refugio County, County Judge Jhiela Poynter announced in a\u00a0Facebook post. The county has a population of more than 6,600 people. Poynter said that they know how quickly things can escalate, given that they are still rebuilding infrastructure from when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas in 2017. \u201cI would rather be cautious and let Tropical Storm Beryl come crawling in with a little bit of rain and a little bit of wind to an empty\u00a0Refugio\u00a0County than the alternative if it were to strengthen more than the predictions, which we know has happened with several storms in the past,\u201d Poynter said. During the storm, the county\u2019s local hospital will be rerouting emergency patients, city water will eventually be turned off and city ambulances and fire trucks will no longer be able to mobilize, Poynter said. City officials will provide bus transportation to an out-of-town emergency shelter for residents who are unable to evacuate on their own, Poynter said. The City of Port Aransas, on Mustang Island,\u00a0issued\u00a0a mandatory visitor evacuation by noon Sunday, which does not include residents and property owners, according to the city. In Kleberg\u00a0County, Judge Rudy Madrid issued a \u201cVoluntary Evacuation for Baffin Bay, Loyola Beach and all low lying areas,\u201d according to a social media post from the city of Kingsville. Nueces\u00a0County\u00a0Judge Connie Scott asked citizens on the coast in low-lying areas or who need assistance to evacuate due to the possibility of the storm making landfall in the\u00a0area\u00a0as a hurricane, the county posted on social media. The National Weather Service in Corpus Christi is warning residents, \u201cnow would be the time to prepare\u201d for Beryl as its track forecast is trending farther north along the Texas coast. \u201cResidents should really be aware that the earliest \u2026 arrival of the tropical storm force winds is predicted for Sunday afternoon,\u201d Mayor Paulette Guajardo said on Friday. The mayor declared a local state of disaster Saturday afternoon, taking effect immediately. Guajardo asked those visiting the city for the Fourth of July weekend to \u201cplease consider returning at an earlier time if it\u2019s what you feel you need to do.\u201d In Houston, the weather service is likewise asking people to stay vigilant. \u201cAt this time, the main impacts for SE TX will remain increased rainfall (Mon/Tues) and the potential for tropical storm force winds (34kts) as early as Sun morning. Stay tuned and stay informed,\u201d the weather service\u00a0posted on X. The city of Rockport issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents in low-lying areas and local officials are in touch with the state to place their residents on the registry for evacuations if necessary, police spokesperson Lee Brown told CNN on Saturday. While no local hurricane shelter had been established in the area, charter buses will be ready to evacuate residents at the Aransas County Airport on Saturday evening, Brown said. Rockport, 30 miles northeast of Corpus Christi, suffered major damage\u00a0from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Voluntary evacuations have been announced for some low-lying areas in Port Lavaca, northeast of Rockport. City spokesperson Tania French said about 1,000 people, mostly in beach areas, may be affected.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/weather/hurricane-beryl-south-texas-coast-weekend-sunday-monday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

According to data published by the French Interior Ministry, 59.71% of French voters cast their vote by 5 p.m. Sunday (11 a.m. ET) - a level unseen since 1981. It marks a 20-point increase compared to the same time in 2022. After taking the lead in the first round of voting last Sunday, the far-right National Rally (RN) \u2013 led by the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella under the watchful eye of party doyenne Marine Le Pen \u2013 is closer to power than ever before. The RN, whose once-taboo brand of anti-immigrant politics has been given a fresh and more acceptable face by Bardella, won 33% of the popular vote in the first round. The newly-formed left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP), came second with 28%, while Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance trailed in a distant third with 21%. But the prospect of a far-right government \u2013 which would be France\u2019s first since the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II \u2013 has spurred Ensemble and the NFP into action. After a week of political bargaining, hundreds of candidates stood down in particular seats to try to deny the RN an absolute majority. Voting began at 8 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), as France began the process of electing the 577 members of its National Assembly, in which 289 seats are needed for a party to hold an absolute majority. In the outgoing parliament, Macron\u2019s alliance had only 250 seats, and so needed support from other parties to pass laws. Only those who win more than 12.5% of the votes of registered votes in the first round can stand in the second, meaning it is often fought between two candidates. But this time a record number of seats \u2013 more than 300 \u2013 produced a three-way run-off, in a measure of France\u2019s polarization. In an attempt not to split the anti-far right vote, more than 200 candidates from Macron\u2019s alliance and the NFP agreed to stand down in the second round. While RN\u2019s strong showing in the first round means it could more than triple the 88 seats it had in the outgoing parliament, it is not clear if it will be able to reach an absolute majority. Although it is customary for the president to appoint a prime minister from the largest party, Bardella has repeatedly said he will refuse to form a minority government. In that case, Macron might have to search for a prime minister on the hard left or, to form a technocratic government, somewhere else entirely. Whatever the result of Sunday\u2019s vote, France seems set to endure a period of political chaos, with Macron unable to call another parliamentary election for at least a year. The campaign has already been marred with violence. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Friday that 51 candidates and campaigners had been assaulted on the campaign trail, leading to some being hospitalized. The vote is being held three years earlier than necessary. France was not due to hold parliamentary elections until 2027, but Macron called the snap vote \u2013 the first time a French leader has done so since 1997 \u2013 after his party was trounced by the RN at last month\u2019s European Parliament elections. Although the European election results need have no bearing on domestic politics, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent to him by voters and wanted to clarify the situation. Some have argued that, with the possibility of the RN winning both the presidency and the parliament in 2027, Macron was keen to expose it to government beforehand, in the hope that it would lose its appeal once in office. If the RN refuses to form a minority government, Macron\u2019s gamble could backfire. An RN-led government would have huge implications for France and the rest of Europe. Its spending plans \u2013 which include cutting value-added tax on electricity, fuel and other energy products \u2013 have alarmed financial markets and could put France on a collision course with Brussels\u2019 restrictive spending laws. On the continental stage, an RN-led government would further Europe\u2019s rightward shift, at a time when the center is trying to remain united on issues like support for Ukraine, migration and climate change. Standing between the RN and an absolute majority is the NFP, comprising more radical figures like Jean-Luc Melenchon, a three-time presidential candidate and leader of the France Unbowed party, as well as moderate leaders like Place Publique\u2019s Raphael Gluckmann. While Macron\u2019s Ensemble allies said they will do everything in their power to stop the RN coming to power, it has refused to collaborate with or endorse candidates from France Unbowed. Gabriel Attal, Macron\u2019s protege and the outgoing prime minister, has vowed never to enter into alliance with Melenchon. Polls will close at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday, with the full results expected early Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/europe/france-second-round-parliament-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 28-year-old Paolini, who had never won a match at Wimbledon until 10 days ago, needed just 58 minutes to convincingly dispatch Navarro and become the first Italian woman in history to reach the last four in SW19 in the Open era. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable, just unbelievable,\u201d Paolini said in her on-court interview. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to get the win on this court, on this special court. I\u2019m so happy to be in the semifinals, I don\u2019t know what to say at the moment. Grazie. \u201cIt\u2019s so special, it\u2019s a dream to be here in this position to be in the semifinal. I was watching finals when I was a kid on this court and it\u2019s strange to be here to get the win and get to the semifinals in Wimbledon. \u201cI feel so happy and I have to say I played a really good match. She\u2019s a tough opponent, I lost with her three time in the last year,\u201d added Paolini, who will play Donna Vekic in the semifinals. Navarro broke Paolini in only her second service game to open an early 2-1 lead after some tight opening exchanges. However, that was as good as it got for the 23-year-old American. From 1-2 down, Paolini rattled off five straight games to take the first set. The Italian was equally ruthless in the second set. With the score at 1-1, Paolini once again powered through to win the next five games to secure victory in some style. Navarro was full of praise for Paolini, reflecting that the Italian was \u201ca totally different player\u201d from their previous meetings. \u201cTough to feel like I was playing such good tennis for a while there, made a run, then I just faced a really, really tough opponent today that played lights out and didn\u2019t give me anything,\u201d Navarro told reporters. Until this year, Paolini had never even won a WTA match on grass, but 2024 has been a season like no other for the 28-year-old. She reached the fourth round of the Australian Open in January - then her career best performance in a grand slam - before going on to reach the French Open final last month, where she was beaten by Iga \u015awi\u0105tek. Despite the defeat, Navarro will be buoyed by her Wimbledon campaign. The 23-year-old beat reigning US Open champion Coco Gauff - her teammate in the upcoming Paris Olympics - in straight sets in the fourth round to cement her best run at a grand slam. \u201cI played the best tennis I\u2019ve ever played in my life this tournament,\u201d Navarro told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to know I have that level inside of me. I know I\u2019ll keep improving on it. I know this isn\u2019t the last time I\u2019m going to be in the quarterfinals of a grand slam.\u201d Navarro\u2019s form at this year\u2019s Wimbledon follows what has already been an impressive season for a player who only turned her full attention to professional tennis in 2022. The American reached the third round of the Australian Open earlier this year, before progressing to the fourth round at the French Open. Navarro claimed her first WTA title at the Hobart International in January and has risen from 149th in the world at the start of last season to her current position as No. 17 in the WTA rankings.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/sport/emma-navarro-wimbledon-quarterfinals-jasmine-paolini-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_uk-election-europe-populist-surge-intl", "text": "The United Kingdom\u2019s decision to hand the center-left Labour Party a parliamentary majority comes at the same time Europe is broadly in the grip of what some call a right-wing populist surge. Last month\u2019s\u00a0European elections\u00a0saw a historic number of lawmakers from hard-right and far-right parties elected to the European Parliament. The results caused such chaos that French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election in his own country, the first round of which the far-right National Rally\u00a0won last week. A government composed of far-right figures was formed in the Netherlands this week. Italy is led by the most right-wing leader since the rule of fascist wartime leader Benito Mussolini. These electoral victories and the prospect of populist right-wingers in power is no longer a surprise in European countries. There are many reasons for this rise in populism, often unique to individual countries. But broadly speaking, a number of European countries are suffering from sluggish economies, high immigration and higher energy prices, due in part to the drive for carbon net zero. The European Union is often blamed for national woes by populist politicians and breathes oxygen into an increasingly Euroskeptic national discourse. So why is Britain, the only country where Euroskepticism led to a referendum on EU membership, bucking this trend? Despite the scale of the Labour victory, it is clear from the results that the British right is far from dead. The Conservative Party, despite its undeniably disappointing night,\u00a0has outperformed against\u00a0the\u00a0expectations of a number of opinion polls during the campaign, some of which predicted it would win fewer than 100 seats \u2013 which would have been a truly epic wipeout. Another party that exceeded polling expectations\u00a0is the populist right-wing Reform UK, led by long-term scourge of the Conservatives Nigel Farage, who is perhaps best known these days for his friendship with former US President Donald Trump. Before this, he was credited with making Brexit possible after decades of campaigning against the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. On his eighth attempt, Farage has now been elected as a member of parliament (MP). The Conservatives may have been reduced to only 121 seats and Reform may have only secured four, as of Friday morning, but the overall vote share for these two parties combined is larger than that of Labour \u2013 which has secured more than 400 seats. This will doubtless have a major impact on what happens next to the right of British politics. Ahead of the election, the existence of Reform and pressure from Farage on issues like tax and migration had already forced the Conservatives further to the right. Farage identified that irregular migration, particularly people crossing the English Channel in small boats from France, could become a major factor in an election campaign. His relentless campaigning on the issue forced the Conservatives to introduce the highly controversial Rwanda policy, which would see asylum seekers sent overseas for their claims to be processed. The Conservative Party now needs to find a new leader. The debate over who takes over from Sunak will focus largely on what values the party should embrace. Many Conservatives will believe that by leaning to the right they can steal Farage\u2019s votes. Many will believe that some kind of pact should be done with Farage. Others will want absolutely nothing to do with a man who has spent decades attempting to destroy the Conservative Party. Regardless, it is likely that Farage will play a starring role in the Conservative leadership campaign. Even if he isn\u2019t in the party himself, Farage thrives as an outsider. The majority of his political success to date has all come without him holding a UK parliamentary seat. Now he has not only won a seat himself, but will have a small band of colleagues ready to hurl grenades at Labour leader and new Prime Minister Keir Starmer. That said, it is probably quite a long time before there is any kind of coherently united right. It is possible that Farage\u2019s splitting of the right has actually helped Starmer on his way to such a huge victory. An odd quirk of British politics is that the percentage of votes a party gets doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to seats. Every seat is decided individually, the winner being the candidate with the most votes, which is often less than 50%. And with Reform performing well in many of the seats that Labour won, the hard-right will not only be impossible to ignore in this parliament, but it could easily see its influence grow further. Britain suffers from many of the same problems as other European countries. If Starmer falters as prime minister, there is every chance that the popular right could continue to capture the public\u2019s imagination, as it has elsewhere\u00a0in Europe.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/uk-election-europe-populist-surge-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_style_olympic-mascot-design-history", "text": "For more than fifty years, athletes competing in the Olympic Games have often been cheered on by either a furry, feathered or slimy friend. The Olympic mascot \u2013 a cartoonish encapsulation of the host city\u2019s culture and history \u2013 is so important, designs are often selected and finalized years before the Games take place. According to the International Olympic Committee, the role of these quirky caricatures is to help spread a \u201cfestive atmosphere\u201d and embody the exuberant spirit of the event. Over the decades, the world has welcomed snowmen, sasquatches, cowboy-hat-wearing bears and aliens to the Olympic stage. This year, the mascot will take the form of a hat \u2014 specifically the distinctive red Phrygian cap worn by emancipated Roman slaves which became a symbol of freedom during the French Revolution. The first mascot was created in 1968 by designer Aline Lafargue for the Grenoble Winter Games in France. Affectionately named \u201cShuss,\u201d the character consists of a two-toned head and lightning-bolt shaped leg attached to skis. Despite holding the esteemed title of first ever mascot, Lafargue created and submitted her design for Shuss in just one night. To find a worthy representative, each host country will typically organize a submission call-out or contest. In 2014, a competition held by Russia in anticipation for the Sochi Winter Games received more than 24,000 drawings. The winners, a trio of arctic mammals intended to represent the three spots on the Olympic podium, were selected by a public vote with the results broadcast on Russian TV. But this hasn\u2019t always been the case: for the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, one of the first Olympic events to be heavily subsidized by corporate financing, Disney won the private bid for mascot design. Since these creatures are also pivotal to official merchandise, cute and cuddly have long been key metrics for any mascot\u2019s success. Merchandise of Beijing\u2019s\u00a0rotund panda mascot Bing Dwen Dwen\u00a0for the\u00a02022 Winter Games\u00a0sold \u201clike hotcakes,\u201d while Disney\u2019s bald eagle, Sam, was meticulously constructed to appear short, stubby and soft as opposed to realistic, pointed and ominous in order to appeal to children. And when illustrators have deviated, viewers have let them know. Ten years ago, Iris design agency produced two silver cyclops extra-terrestrials to usher in the London Games. \u201cIf these things had been in a \u201950\u2019s horror movie it would now be considered a classic,\u201d wrote one CNN reader in 2012. One mascot, the bear Misha, even went extra-terrestrial in 1978 when it went to space on the \u201cSoyuz\u201d rocket two years before the 1980 Moscow Games. Character design becomes especially important when the Games coincide with a unique moment in history. For example Sydney, Australia, the host country of the first Olympics of the millennium, commissioned three mascots for the first time in the Games\u2019 history. The three anime-style cartoons, Syd, Olly and Millie, were named in reference to Sydney, Olympics and Millennium \u2013 and t-shirts from this landmark Games are still circulating second-hand resale sites now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/style/olympic-mascot-design-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

A woman and man were \u201ckilled on the spot\u201d in the Golan Heights when a projectile directly hit their vehicle, according to Israeli police. \u201cSeveral projectiles were identified falling in the area,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) added in a statement following sirens in the Golan Heights. \u201cTonight what we had been warning and talked about for three months happened; We lost lives of residents from the Golan community,\u201d head of the Golan Regional Council\u00a0Ori Kallner\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cWe call on the government of Israel and the IDF on this difficult evening to protect the residents of the Golan, to stop the policy of restraint, attack our enemies with force and restore security to the residents of the north and the Golan.\u201d \u201cWe will not allow the Golan to be turned into Israel\u2019s security zone. The offensive must be moved into the other side of the border, into enemy territory,\u201d Kallner added. Israel\u2019s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds a position in the country\u2019s Defense Ministry, also called on the Israeli military to \u201cstrike Hezbollah and Lebanon mercilessly.\u201d The Golan Heights is under Israeli government control and is considered to be occupied territory by the international community. Earlier, Magen David Adom paramedics had described responding to a \u201cdifficult\u201d scene at the site of the hit on the vehicle. \u201cWe saw a vehicle that suffered a direct hit, and in its front were an unconscious man and woman who were critically injured. During the medical treatment, additional sirens were activated,\u201d the medics said in a statement. \u201cWe ran to protect ourselves and handled the incident as sirens went off. Military personnel assisted on the scene.\u201d Firefighters said they were responding to at least eight fires following the projectile hits. In a statement, Hezbollah said that they had fired dozens of Katyusha rockets on the Golan Heights \u201cin response\u201d to an alleged Israeli attack in Syria targeting a Hezbollah key member earlier on Tuesday. Hezbollah member Yasser Nemr Qranbish was killed\u00a0in an attack targeting him in an area west of the capital, Damascus, on the old Damascus-Beirut road, the group added, without providing further details. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the strike. The Israeli military said in a statement Tuesday that the Israeli Air Force \u201cstruck Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in the area of Qabrikha from which the projectiles were launched toward the area of the Golan Heights.\u201d \u201cIn addition, the IAF struck Hezbollah military structures in the area of Kfarkela in southern Lebanon,\u201d the IDF statement added. Cross-border fire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah has been an almost daily occurrence since the war in Gaza began. But it has been gradually intensifying, raising fears it could escalate into a full-blown conflict. Hezbollah is one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, with tens of thousands of fighters and a vast missile arsenal. The group has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support Palestinians in Gaza. Smotrich extended condolences to the families of those killed and said the Israeli military and government should \u201crestore security\u201d for residents of the Golan Heights. \u201cThe time has come for courage and valor also from the leadership of the IDF and the state of Israel, and as I have been demanding for a long time, to strike Hezbollah and Lebanon mercilessly and restore security to the residents of the North,\u201d said Smotrich, who also holds a position in the Defense Ministry, in a statement on Tuesday night. Former Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz also commented on the attack, saying it was \u201conce again a difficult and sad evening.\u201d \u201cThe operative effort should have been transferred to the North in March, as we demanded. Prime Minister Netanyahu hesitated, and refused to add the return of the residents of the north to their homes by September 1 to the objectives of the war \u2013 and we are paying the price. And that price is heavy,\u201d said Gantz, who resigned from Netanyahu\u2019s government in June.

A spokesperson for the Tate brothers called the ruling a \u201csignificant victory and a major step forward\u201d in their ongoing case. \u201cWe embrace and applaud the decision of the court today, I consider it a reflection of the exemplary behaviour and assistance of my clients.

The ministry said in a statement that Israel targeted \u201cthe gate of a school housing displaced people in the town of Abasan, east of the city of Khan Younis,\u201d calling it \u201ca heinous massacre against displaced citizens.\u201d A further 53 people were injured, including some who have \u201cserious and critical cases,\u201d the ministry added. The death toll is expected to increase as casualties are still being transferred to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, the ministry said. The Israeli military said it conducted a strike \u201cnear\u201d Al-Awda school on Tuesday, targeting \u201ca terrorist\u201d who took part in the October 7 attacks. \u201cEarlier this evening, using precise munition, the IAF struck a terrorist from Hamas\u2019 military wing\u00a0who took part, among other terrorist activities, in the October 7 brutal massacre carried out by the Hamas terrorist organization in southern Israel,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. \u201cThe IDF is looking into the reports that civilians were harmed, adjacent to the Al-Awda School\u00a0in the south of Khan Younis, which is located near the location of the strike. The incident is\u00a0under\u00a0review,\u201d the IDF added. The Government Media Office in Gaza condemned the attack, calling it a \u201cmassacre against civilians\u201d by Israel. The government statement also called on the international communities, the United Nations, and international NGOs to put pressure on Israel and the United States to stop the war in Gaza. Hamas also condemned it in a statement, saying the strike on the school represents \u201ca continuation of the genocidal war and horrific massacres against our defenseless people.\u201d Hamas called for people around the world to \u201cimmediately take to the streets and squares in massive demonstrations and rallies\u201d in support of people in Gaza, as well as called for people in the West Bank to support Gaza and clash with Israeli forces. This comes days after an\u00a0Israeli\u00a0attack killed at least 16 Palestinians and injured dozens more at a school run by the United Nations\u2019 agency for Palestinian refugees in central Gaza, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Saturday. UNRWA\u2019s Al-Jaouni school was sheltering displaced people in al-Nuseirat camp, according to the ministry. The Israeli military said in a statement Saturday that militants were operating in structures in the school area. CNN cannot independently verify the Israeli military\u2019s claim. On July 1, the IDF issued instructions for hundreds of thousands of people in Khan Younis in the south, Shujaya in central Gaza and\u00a0the several neighborhoods of Gaza City to leave. The effect has been to increase the total number of displaced people in Gaza, from 1.7 million in May to an estimated 1.9 million now, according to the UN. Approximately nine out of 10 people in Gaza are now estimated to be internally displaced, many of them multiple times. The IDF has said that evacuation orders are necessary so that civilians don\u2019t get caught up in its renewed operations in areas where Hamas is seeking to re-establish a presence. The IDF insists it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. Hamas has said the evacuations threaten to return negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage deal to \u201cpoint zero.\u201d Humanitarian agencies say the evacuation orders have had a major impact on the few operational hospitals in Gaza.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_09_weather_hurricane-season-forecast-beryl-climate", "text": "Beryl just smashed all expectations of what an early season hurricane could become, and it has experts concerned for what could be coming next. Typically, early season storms aren\u2019t indicative of what\u2019s\u00a0to come later in the season because the necessary atmospheric conditions for powerful storms aren\u2019t yet in place. But Beryl broke the mold. \u201cNormally, early-season storm activity doesn\u2019t tell us much about what is going to happen the rest of the time,\u201d Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University, told CNN. \u201cBut when storms are strong in the tropical Atlantic and eastern Caribbean, it tends to be a harbinger of a very busy season.\u201d The busiest part of Atlantic hurricane season doesn\u2019t typically begin until mid-August and peaks in September, but Beryl \u2013 which initially formed in late June \u2013 behaved like it already arrived.\u00a0The water Beryl raced through was as warm as it should be in September, so it behaved like a September hurricane. It\u2019s something forecasters warned could happen even before the season got underway. \u201cBeryl confirms what we thought about (this) season, that given the extremely warm (water) temperatures that we currently have, we could experience mid-season-type storms earlier than normal,\u201d Klotzbach said. Ocean temperatures in the Atlantic basin remain historically warm and have been for more than a year, particularly where Beryl first became a hurricane. Warm oceans are a major consequence of a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution and provide the fuel for tropical systems to explode in strength at a breakneck pace. Beryl rapidly intensified faster than any other storm on record this early in the season when its winds increased by 65 mph in just 24 hours, according to Klotzbach. Rapid intensification is becoming more likely as the climate crisis advances. \u201cBeryl\u2019s early and rapid intensification is indicative of the types of extreme weather events we may see more frequently in a warming world,\u201d according to Mona Hemmati, a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University\u2019s Climate School. Beryl \u201cencapsulates many of the fears scientists have for this hurricane season,\u201d Hemmati told CNN. The storm took advantage of extremely warm waters and eventually strengthened into the Atlantic\u2019s earliest Category 5 hurricane on record \u2013 one of several milestones no other early July hurricane has reached. Forecasters increase hurricane season predictions after Beryl Beryl\u2019s unprecedented performance only solidified a chorus of expert voices \u2013 including Klotzbach\u2019s team at Colorado State \u2013 who called for a hyperactive hurricane season well before the first three named storms \u2013 Alberto, Beryl and Chris \u2013 formed. \u201cThis early season activity is a likely warning sign that things are going to be very busy once we move closer to the peak of the season,\u201d Klotzbach cautioned. Klotzbach\u2019s group of forecasters at Colorado State increased the number of named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes expected this season in an update to their hurricane season forecast Tuesday. They now predict the Atlantic season will have 25 named storms including 12 hurricanes, half of which will become major hurricanes of at least Category 3 strength. The forecast also relies on a burgeoning La Ni\u00f1a that should ease wind shear \u2013 the change in wind speed or direction at different heights in the atmosphere \u2013 over the Atlantic. High levels of wind shear can tear apart an active storm or prevent one from forming in the first place. Without it, more storms could form and strengthen. But extremely warm water will stick around through the peak of hurricane season and storms could take full advantage of it to overcome wind shear, just like Beryl did. The extremely warm water kept Beryl incredibly strong, even in the face of disruptive wind shear that should have weakened it considerably. This also happened during last year\u2019s hurricane season when El Ni\u00f1o brought increased wind shear but incredibly warm water still helped 20 named storms form. For now, a brief pause in Atlantic tropical activity is expected over the next week or two due in part to a large area of dry, dusty air and some bouts of moderately disruptive wind shear. Plumes of dry air filled with Saharan dust traveling across the Atlantic from Africa are typical around this time of year. It can sometimes even reach the United States and help produce stunning sunsets. But dry, dusty air isn\u2019t\u00a0a friend to tropical systems. It cuts off the moisture a system needs to survive, so the National Hurricane Center isn\u2019t highlighting any areas to watch for tropical development over the next week. When the break will end and the busiest part of hurricane season will get underway is the \u201cmillion dollar question,\u201d according to Klotzbach. Tropical activity could ramp up again later in July or hold off until August depending on how several atmospheric factors play out in the next couple of weeks, he told CNN. Either way, with such an extreme ocean heat to tap into, Beryl proved the door is wide open for a prolific season.

{"id": "2024_07_05_uk_victoria-starmer-profile-gbr-scli-intl", "text": "The British public has elected a new government, and with that a new family will be moving into 10 Downing Street. Unlike some other countries, such as the United States, when a new British prime minister comes to power, the transition into both the new role and home happens almost immediately. That means, not only will Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, be settling into his home down the road from the Houses of Parliament, but so will his wife, Victoria, and their two teenage children. So, who is Victoria Starmer, and what do we know about the new occupants of 10 Downing Street? Starmer\u2019s wife, whom he usually refers to as Vic, kept a relatively low profile during the election campaign. Both lawyers by training, they married in 2007 \u2013 the year before Starmer became Director of Public Prosecutions. Their relationship grew out of an unlikely first meeting at work, as the Labour leader told Piers Morgan in 2021. Then a barrister, he was preparing for a court case and demanded to speak to the lawyer who had drawn up documents relating to the case. That was Victoria. He asked if they were accurate, and once the conversation was over, he heard her say, \u201cWho the bleep does he think he is?\u201d before hanging up on him. He told Morgan he pursued her for months after that, and they have been together ever since. \u201cVic is beautiful, she is grounded, we share values and we laugh together,\u201d Starmer said. Victoria, whose parents are Jewish, now works in occupational health in the NHS. \u201cHalf of the family are Jewish, they\u2019re either here or in Israel,\u201d he told The Guardian last month, adding that he and his wife are \u201cvery keen\u201d for their children to understand their heritage. Meanwhile, the prime minister has spoken about his children\u2019s concerns about the house move. \u201cDeep down they\u2019re worried that this (their lives) could change, which is why we will fiercely protect their privacy.\u201d So determined is Starmer, that he refers to them in interviews as \u201cmy boy\u201d and \u201cmy girl.\u201d \u201cFrom the very start we took the decision that we would keep them as protected as we possibly can, so we won\u2019t have any photo shoots with the children and we don\u2019t name them in public,\u201d he told British broadcaster ITV\u2019s \u201cThis Morning\u201d show. Starmer told The Guardian he is \u201cacutely aware\u201d how his job impacts his family, saying of his children, \u201cthese are formative years. We keep life as ordinary and unchanged as possible.\u201d Earlier this year, pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated outside the family\u2019s home in Kentish Town, north London, where they unfurled a banner saying \u201cStarmer stop the killing\u201d and left rows of children\u2019s shoes. The Starmers\u2019 main hopes, he told \u201cThis Morning,\u201d were for their children to be \u201chappy and confident.\u201d That might be helped by a new addition, he admitted, as a move to Downing Street is likely to see his children \u201cramp up\u2026 their campaign for a dog.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/victoria-starmer-profile-gbr-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

The drone attack took place in a settlement in the Podgorensky district, Voronezh governor Aleksandr Gusev said Sunday. Ukrainian sources said the warehouse was targeted because it was being used to supply ammunition to Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. \u201cSeveral UAVs were detected and destroyed by on-duty air defense forces over the territory of the Voronezh region last night. A fire broke out at a warehouse due to the fall of their wreckage. Detonation of explosive items began in the Podgorensky district,\u201d Gusev said. He did not identify the settlement where the attack took place, but said a state of emergency had been declared there. No one was injured in the attack, but two elderly women were taken to hospital for checks, he said. \u201cOperational services, military and officials are working on the site to eliminate the emergency,\u201d he said, adding arrangements have been made for the evacuation of residents from nearby villages as well. \u201cSo far, some 50 people from three settlements have been transported to temporary accommodation centers. We are providing them with all the necessary assistance,\u201d he said. A Ukrainian source familiar with the matter said drones of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) targeted the warehouse because it was being used to supply ammunition to Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. \u201cThe enemy was storing surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, shells for tanks and artillery, and boxes of ammunition for firearms on an area of 9,000 square meters,\u201d the source said.

{"id": "travel_uk-tourism-drop-visitor-numbers-election", "text": "It\u2019s hardly a great tourism slogan. \u201cBritain is grinding to a halt\u201d was the verdict of the UK\u2019s Labour Party on the country they hoped to govern, as they were setting out their case for election in June. On July 4, they won by a landslide, promising change. As residents wonder what to expect day-to-day, those abroad might wonder what it means for their travel plans. Because one industry that could do with a change is tourism. Since time immemorial, visitors have flocked to the UK. Its heritage and cultural sites have traditionally made it one of the jewels in Europe\u2019s crown. Yet while visitor numbers are up across the board on the continent \u2013 nearly all EU member states saw numbers rise in 2023 year-on-year \u2013 the UK has not yet caught up with pre-pandemic numbers. Nearly 41 million overseas residents visited the UK in 2019. In 2023, 37.68 million entered \u2013 a drop of 7.3%. Compare that with Italy, which set a new record for arrivals numbers in 2023. Only Luxembourg saw a drop of 0.1% fewer tourists. What\u2019s more, international visitors applying for a tourist visa were down by 19% on pre-pandemic numbers. The slow recovery coincides with tourism-allied hiccups. Regular strikes have been hampering transport. \u201cRail cancelations are at record levels,\u201d according to the new government in its pre-election manifesto. The UK has a glorious coastline, but in recent years many beaches are increasingly polluted by sewage. Tax-free shopping for tourists has been axed, and EU visitors now need a passport to visit, which most don\u2019t have. And in 2024, the rhetoric around safety in the capital has been ramped up. In February, then prime minister Rishi Sunak suggested the country was descending into \u201cmob rule.\u201d He also flagged a 20% rise in knife crime in London in May. His comments were political, made while campaigning for local elections. Yet few listening from abroad would have noted the context. So what\u2019s gone wrong for the UK \u2013 and can the incoming government turn it around? Labour\u2019s pre-election manifesto, in which the party outlined its plans for the country, pretty much ignored the tourism industry. But it didn\u2019t mince its words when describing the problems. \u201cBritain is grinding to a halt,\u201d it said. \u201cRail cancelations are at record levels\u2026 Conservative chaos has seen major projects abandoned, decades-long delays\u2026 and our infrastructure crumbling.\u201d The party has promised to \u201cmodernize\u201d UK transport infrastructure, \u201crebuilding Britain.\u201d The railways will be brought under public ownership. Those traveling by car will be pleased to know that Labour also pledged to repair potholes. However none of this will be quick. Labour\u2019s infrastructure overhaul is based on a 10-year plan. Shifting priorities Is the UK really doing that badly or have travel trends shifted, post-pandemic? For Tom Jenkins, CEO of the European Tourism Organisation, it\u2019s the latter. \u201cI think the UK is doing perfectly well but we\u2019ll see more people going to [continental] Europe,\u201d he says of 2024, adding that there\u2019s \u201callegedly a slight plateau of American demand for the UK.\u201d Patricia Yates, CEO of VisitBritain, disagrees, saying that American visitors have \u201cdriven our recovery since the pandemic.\u201d Kayla Zeigner, owner of travel agency Destination Europe, says she is booking ever-more trips to the UK. But for Marcy Zyonse, owner of Live The Dream Travel, a luxury vacations company, the UK has been hit by changing post-pandemic travel trends. \u201cThe appetite for epic, culturally immersive travel has been so strong in the past couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were starved for that. In the US, we didn\u2019t go beyond the Caribbean for a couple of years, so people are looking to do that Greece or Italy trip. We\u2019ve missed out on two or three years of travel, and I think the UK is too low down on the list.\u201d English-speakers want a more exotic experience, she says \u2013 starting with a foreign language. After all, the UK is known for history, culture and the royals \u2013 all of which will be around next year. It\u2019s easier to prioritize that for a much-needed Mediterranean break. And that heritage has also meant the outgoing government has let the tourism industry slide, says Yates. \u201cThere\u2019s a view that we have enormous strength in our culture and heritage, and people will just come,\u201d she says. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the case. Like every export industry, we have to pitch \u2013 to tell people why they should come now. The balance of being a history and heritage destination is that it was there 10 years ago and will be there in 10 years.\u201d There\u2019s also a hangover from the pandemic, when UK travel rules were particularly chaotic, say experts. Destinations that opened early got visitors raving about their first post-lockdown trips \u2013 which had a knock-on effect. \u201cCurrent hotspots are destinations that opened early in 2021 to American tourists, which created a huge surge in demand,\u201d says Zeigler. Zyonse agrees. \u201cYou guys in the UK were behind, and people lost confidence. People booking in 2021 for 2022 didn\u2019t book the UK, and the effect snowballed. Social media has driven people to those places [that opened up earlier].\u201d Making Britain \u2018great\u2019 again So what\u2019s to be done? For Yates, the new government could use tourism as an economy-booster \u2013 to the tune of 7% growth every year, she says, according to VisitBritain\u2019s projections. \u201cThe strength of tourism is that you can dial up quickly \u2013 we don\u2019t need to build lots of infrastructure,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a case of promoting the right places at the right time to the right customers.\u201d Promotion is tricky in itself. The outgoing Conservative government was infamous for its \u201causterity\u201d cuts to public spending. In evidence to parliament in March 2024, VisitBritain revealed that its marketing budget was around \u201c\u00a318 million ($23 million) annually, compared to over 80 euros million ($85.5 million) for Ireland.\u201d Back in November 2021, Yates told CNN that VisitBritain didn\u2019t know what its budget would be from March 2022. Today, she explains, it has a \u00a319.8 million core budget, and gets around the same amount from another government campaign. That\u2019s still around half of Ireland\u2019s budget \u2013 so private-sector funding is used to boost it. \u201cWe know that for every \u00a31 invested we get \u00a315 spent by tourists \u2013 a slice goes to the treasury, and money goes directly from international visitors into the economy. It\u2019s a win-win,\u201d she says. But she\u2019s keen for the new government to help take things further. \u201cTourism delivers over three million jobs, around 10% of the economy,\u201d she says. \u201cTo have a real growth plan, we have to make a statement about Britain overseas that will drive visitors and investment.\u201d Welcoming visitors Not many tourists will have cared about political instability \u2013 as Zeigler says, \u201cAmericans are dealing with our own political chaos.\u201d But Yates says that what does cut through is \u201cthe message of welcome.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hugely important as a driver for international visitors,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes Britain has done that well, like during the London Olympics. Sometimes we don\u2019t score as well. We need to look at how we position Britain as a welcoming destination, and how we look at borders and visas.\u201d In the 2023 Anholt-Ipsos Nation Brands Index, which ranks 60 nations on a range of attributes, the UK received its lowest ever rating for \u201cWelcome.\u201d Its rankings for \u201cCulture\u201d and \u201cPeople\u201d also dropped, though overall it rose two places to fourth position. A visa for a Chinese visitor to the UK lasts a year, but costs the same about as a 10-year visa to the US, she says. Marcus Lee, CEO of China Travel Online says that visa efficiency is one of the top three drivers for Chinese tourists. Visitors from the Gulf states have increased since the UK introduced a speedy \u201celectronic travel authorization\u201d scheme to fast-track their applications, says Yates. The scheme was due to expand to Europe and US markets \u2013 it will now be up to the Labour government to do so. Meanwhile the self-styled \u201chostile environment\u201d towards immigration of the last government hasn\u2019t helped either. \u201cFor tourism, we want an efficient and effective border, but we do want people to come,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to think about language.\u201d She says that people who visit the UK on vacation are 18% more likely to invest in the country \u2013 and investment is something the new government will be looking for. Brexit side effects As a result of Brexit, in 2021 the UK government abolished tax-free shopping for non-EU citizens. It means the UK is now the only European country not offering tax-free shopping to visitors from outside the continent. Data from New West End Company, which represents over 600 businesses in central London, in February showed that although visitor numbers in 2023 to the area were just 4% below 2019 levels, spending was down 19%. Visitors from the Gulf states \u2013 some of the wealthiest tourists to grace the UK \u2013 were up 20% on 2019 figures, yet they only spent 10% more. The pattern was repeated with tourists from across the globe. US tourists were up 8% but spent 14% less. In Italy and Spain, however, US spending was up by 143% and 179% respectively. \u201cThe impact of losing tax-free shopping is clear to see,\u201d says Dee Corsi, chief executive of the NWEC. \u201cWhile the UK strives to return to pre-pandemic levels of travel and spend, continental Europe\u2019s recovery continues at pace. \u201cWhilst the likes of Italy and France are actively leveraging tax-free shopping as a driver of growth, British businesses continue to trade at a disadvantage. With domestic spend remaining squeezed, a continued decline of tourist spending will have a knock-on effect on employment rates, inward investment, and supply chains across the nation.\u201d She calls bringing back tax-free shopping a \u201crare, golden opportunity for the government to\u2026 inject a shot of growth back into the economy, with a tried-and-tested scheme and a captive audience.\u201d \u201cWe would urge the new government to grasp this opportunity with both hands,\u201d she adds. Meanwhile, EU citizens now need a passport to visit the UK, where pre-Brexit they could cross the border with their ID cards. In 2021, Jenkins told CNN that three-quarters of Europeans don\u2019t have passports. Then there are clouds on the horizon regarding getting in and out. When the new ETIAS scheme launches, every traveler entering the Schengen area for the first time will need their biometric data captured. \u201cIt\u2019ll be time consuming initally,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence that really bad entry systems deter people.\u201d \u2019Bridgerton\u2019 to the rescue? So what can be done? For Zyonse, VisitBritain should spend that marketing budget on attracting influencers and travel advisors to lesser-known destinations. A self-declared lover of the UK, who calls London \u201ca better version of New York,\u201d she says that the post-pandemic drive for more \u201cepic\u201d adventures calls for a different approach. Timelapse videos of an elevator going up London\u2019s Shard skyscraper, or something more wild in the Lake District, could attract social media likes, she says. She also thinks that the \u201cmajority\u201d of US family trips are driven by children\u2019s choices. She just went to Greece to give her daughter a \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d experience, and says that the UK \u201cneeds to get young girls posting on social media wearing a crown, or having afternoon tea, or doing something \u2018Bridgerton\u2019-related.\u201d She\u2019ll approve of VisitBritain\u2019s next big campaign, then. Launching at the end of 2024, \u201cStarring Great Britain\u201d will revolve around filming locations, says Yates, who adds that her team also wants to promote cheaper, out-of-season travel.

The experts said the death of a child from malnutrition and dehydration indicates that health and social structures have been attacked and are critically weakened. \u201cWhen the first child dies from malnutrition and dehydration, it becomes irrefutable that\u00a0famine\u00a0has taken hold,\u201d the experts said The statement by the group of independent experts mandated by the UN cited the deaths of three Palestinian children \u2014 6-month-old Fayez Ataya, 13-year-old Abdulqader Al-Serhi,\u00a0and 9-year-old Ahmad Abu Reida. It said they died from malnutrition and lack of access to adequate healthcare in late May and early June. The experts emphasized these children died from starvation\u00a0despite medical treatment in central Gaza, indicating\u00a0that\u00a0famine\u00a0has now spread from northern Gaza into central and southern regions. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for commment. In June, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) reported a deterioration in the humanitarian situation following the launch of Israel\u2019s military operations in Rafah. The Rafah crossing \u2013 a crucial route for humanitarian aid to Gaza \u2013 has been closed since early May. Humanitarian aid workers continue to face tremendous risks while trying to distribute desperately needed aid to Gaza, the UN says. The majority of the infrastructure supporting humanitarian work in Gaza has been destroyed in Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas, according to the same report. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has depleted the territory\u2019s health system, leaving staff unable to treat malnourished children. Doctors previously told CNN they are being forced to turn away parents begging for baby milk, unable to even triage young patients with chronic illnesses compounded by severe hunger. And as Israel continues its siege\u00a0on Gaza,\u00a0preventing aid groups getting enough food into the enclave, parents say they have no choice but to watch their children starve to death. At least 34 children have already died of malnutrition in Gaza, the government media office reported on June 22. The true number could be higher, as limited access to Gaza has impeded aid agencies\u2019 efforts to fully assess the crisis there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/middleeast/gaza-famine-un-report-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_middleeast_israel-hamas-ceasefire-hostage-deal-demands-explainer-mime-intl", "text": "Optimism about an Israel-Hamas ceasefire-hostage agreement waned this week as Israel set conditions for the deal and Hamas warned that Israeli actions in Gaza could jeopardize the talks. Last week, a US official told CNN that a framework agreement is \u201cin place\u201d and an Israeli official said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations, signaling a potential breakthrough. Talks resumed in the Qatari capital Doha on Friday. Over the weekend, Hamas agreed to compromise on a major sticking point for Israel, that the Jewish state commit to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before signing an agreement. But a statement by the Israeli prime minister\u2019s office on Sunday cast doubt on whether the deal would progress, laying out several \u201cprinciples\u201d Israel is not prepared to abandon, including resumed fighting in Gaza \u201cuntil all of objectives of the war have been achieved.\u201d Israel launched its war on Gaza nine months ago, in response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities. The war has left swathes of the enclave unrecognizable, displaced almost the entire population and killed more than 38,000 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry there. Israel had said it wouldn\u2019t end the war until all hostages are freed and Hamas is eliminated. Some experts say Netanyahu\u2019s statement on Sunday suggests the deal may face new hurdles. The prime minister\u2019s conditions block \u201cany possibility of progress from the Israeli side,\u201d Gershon Baskin, a former Israeli hostage negotiator who once acted as a channel to Hamas, told CNN, adding that the conditions were \u201ccompletely against what Hamas\u2019 demands are.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that Hamas will give in to additional Israeli demands,\u201d such as staying on the Philadelphi Corridor, Baskin said, referring to the 14-kilometer (about 8.7-mile) buffer zone on the Egypt-Gaza border. Hamas is also unlikely to agree to an Israeli demand of \u201ca veto on the selection of Palestinian prisoners to be released.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know about where the talks stand. What is the deal that is on the table? US President Joe Biden in May laid out a three-phase proposal that he said Israel had submitted, as he declared \u201cit\u2019s time for this war to end.\u201d The first phase of the potential agreement would last six weeks and include the \u201cwithdrawal of Israeli forces from all populated areas of Gaza\u201d as well as the \u201crelease of a number of hostages, including women, the elderly, the wounded in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\u201d Phase 2 would allow for the \u201cexchange for the release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers.\u201d In Phase 3, the president said, a \u201cmajor reconstruction plan for Gaza would commence and any final remains of hostages who\u2019ve been killed will be returned to their families.\u201d On Thursday, a senior US administration told CNN\u00a0that the framework for a deal is \u201cnow in place,\u201d following a call between Biden and Netanyahu. An Israeli source familiar with the negotiations echoed a similar message earlier on Wednesday, telling CNN the two sides appear to be on the brink of a framework agreement. What is Hamas\u2019 position? Hamas has long demanded that Israel agree to a permanent ceasefire before signing any deal, which Israel has so far refused. A senior Hamas official \u2013 who had been involved in negotiations \u2013 told CNN Saturday the group would instead accept that talks on reaching a permanent ceasefire would take place throughout the first phase of any deal, which would last six weeks. This means, in the first phase, mediators would guarantee a temporary truce, the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Indirect talks\u00a0would continue towards implementing the second phase of the agreement. But as Israel issued new evacuation orders in Gaza city on Sunday, Hamas said on Monday that the move threatens to return the negotiating process to \u201cpoint zero.\u201d Netanyahu and his army bear full responsibility for the collapse of this negotiation path,\u201d the head of the group\u2019s political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, said. What is Netanyahu\u2019s position? An Israeli source familiar with the negotiations told CNN last week that Israeli officials believe Hamas\u2019 latest response will enable the two parties to enter detailed negotiations to reach an agreement. Netanyahu subsequently authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed talks in a bid to broker a deal, an Israeli official and a source familiar with the negotiations said, signaling progress after weeks of deadlock. In a statement Sunday, however, Netanyahu\u2019s office published a list of principles that it said will not be infringed upon by the plan agreed to by Israel and Biden. The prime minister\u2019s \u201csteadfast position\u201d against calls to halt Israeli military action in the southern Gaza city of Rafah is what brought Hamas to the negotiating table, the statement said. The principles include a resumption of the war until \u201call of objectives of the war have been achieved\u201d and the prevention of \u201csmuggling of weapons to Hamas from Egypt to the Gaza border.\u201d Israel began a ground operation in Rafah on\u00a0May 7, crossing the Philadelphi Corridor and seizing the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt. Israel has long accused Hamas of using the Philadelphi corridor to smuggle weapons from Egypt. Netanyahu also said there will be \u201cno return of thousands of armed terrorists to the northern Gaza Strip,\u201d the statement said. What is the White House saying? A US official told CNN Thursday that last week\u2019s call between Biden and Netanyahu seemed to reach a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d on the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2, adding that the deal is now \u201cvery consistent\u201d with what Biden had laid out in May. Asked if the administration believes that Netanyahu is playing politics and could try to sabotage the deal, the official said the deal is structured in a way that \u201cfully protects Israel\u2019s interests.\u201d The developments came after the US proposed new language to help bridge gaps in discussions for a deal, and as Biden scrambled for political survival after floundering in a presidential debate against his predecessor Donald Trump. Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict has been a key issue for voters. Are the two sides closer to a deal? Prospects of a deal appeared to become distant again this week after Netanyahu\u2019s demands, as senior Israeli politicians from accross the political spectrum publicly chided the prime minister over his handling of the war and the hostage talks. Far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s government, whom he relies on to keep his government intact, warned him against making compromises with Hamas. Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir warned that a negotiated settlement is a \u201csurrender to terrorism on all fronts,\u201d and said \u201cthe prime minister conducts himself as a one-man government, making decisions by himself, and excluding his natural partners in the government, including cabinet meetings that are without any significant content,\u201d describing the situation as \u201cintolerable.\u201d Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, told his party that the proposed outline of a ceasefire deal was a defeat and humiliation for Israel and a victory for Sinwar,\u201d Hamas\u2019 leader in Gaza. \u201cWe will not be part of a deal to surrender to Hamas,\u201d Smotrich said. \u201cThe people of Israel, the bereaved families and the IDF fighters demand victory.\u00a0We must not disappoint them.\u00a0We must not endanger the country.\u201d Meanwhile, the chairman of the National Unity party, Benny Gantz, who left the war cabinet last month after repeated disagreements with Netanyahu, accused the prime minister of prioritizing the survival of his government over bringing back the hostages. \u201cYesterday the prime minister linked bringing back the hostages to bringing down the government. Today, Ben Gvir connects a seat in the limited cabinet with political votes in the Knesset. Israel\u2019s security during the most difficult campaign in its history became a victim of political whims.\u201d Opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the prime minister\u2019s statement as \u201cprovocative.\u201d \u201cWhat is it good for? We are at a critical moment in the negotiations, the lives of the abductees depend on it,\u201d Lapid wrote Sunday on X.\u00a0\u201cWhy issue such provocative messages? How does it contribute to the process?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a hostage deal on the table,\u201d he said later. \u201cIt is not true that Netanyahu has to choose between the hostage deal and his continued tenure as prime minister. I promised him a safety net, and I will keep that promise. If Smotrich and Ben Gvir retire, he will get a safety net.\u201d  Baskin, the former negotiator, said that added US pressure is unlikely to sway the Israeli prime minister, who is battling for political survival amid anti-government protests demanding his resignation. US pressure is \u201cstrongly diminished now\u201d after Biden\u2019s debate against Trump, Baskin said. Biden\u2019s weak debate performance only led more Democrats to express doubts that he can beat his opponent in the upcoming election. \u201cIf the Americans are still optimistic (after Netanyahu\u2019s Sunday statement), then they are really living in La La land,\u201d Baskin told CNN. \u201cThey have really no idea what is going on in the mind of Netanyahu.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/middleeast/israel-hamas-ceasefire-hostage-deal-demands-explainer-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_asia_china-monster-coast-guard-ship-philippines-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "China anchored one of its two \u201cmonster\u201d coast guard ships inside the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone (EEZ) last week in what a Philippine official called an act of \u201cintimidation\u201d in the ongoing territorial dispute between Beijing and Manila in the South China Sea. Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela said the China Coast Guard vessel CCG-5901 anchored near Sabina Shoal in the Spratly Islands, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of the Philippine island of Palawan on July 3, well within Manila\u2019s 230-mile EEZ. Displacing 12,000 tons and with a length of 541 feet, CCG-5901 is three times the size of the United States Coast Guard\u2019s main patrol vessels, the National Security Cutters - leading many observers to refer to the Chinese vessel as \u201cThe Monster.\u201d While at Sabina Shoal, the Chinese ship anchored within 800 yards of one of the Philippine Coast Guard\u2019s newest and biggest ships previously deployed to the area, Tarriela said in a post on X. CCG-5901 is more than five times the size of the Philippine ship, the BRP Teresa Magbanua. \u201cIt\u2019s an intimidation on the part of the China Coast Guard,\u201d Tarriela said during a forum on Saturday, according to a Reuters report. But he said the Philippines would not back down on its South China Sea claims. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to pull out, and we\u2019re not going to be intimidated,\u201d Tarriela added. When asked the Philippine claims during a regular press briefing Monday, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the area in question was part of the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone. \u201cChina\u2019s military and police ships patrolling and enforcing the law in the waters near Xianbin Jiao are in compliance with China\u2019s domestic law and international law,\u201d spokesperson Lin Jian said, using the Chinese term for the Sabina Shoal. China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims. In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its maritime territorial claims, with China Coast Guard ships \u2013 reinforced by militia boats \u2013 involved in multiple clashes over the past year that have damaged Philippine ships and seen Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. A clash near Second Thomas Shoal in June saw Chinese coast guard officers\u00a0brandishing an axe\u00a0and other bladed or pointed tools at Filipino soldiers and\u00a0slashing\u00a0their rubber boat. A Filipino soldier lost a thumb during the confrontation. CCG-5901 wasn\u2019t involved in that incident but has been prowling areas of the Philippines\u2019 EEZ since, according to Ray Powell, a South China Sea expert and director of SeaLight at the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation at Stanford University. \u201cImmediately following the dramatic standoff at Second Thomas Shoal \u2026 The Monster toured nearly every Philippine outpost and key feature in the South China Sea,\u201d Powell said. Powell and other analysts say intimidation is one of the main jobs of the CCG-5901, which is larger than any regular coast guard ship in the world (a specialty US Coast Guard icebreaker is bigger) and even outsizes US Navy destroyers. The Arleigh Burke-class destroyers displace 9,700 tons or less and are about 35 feet shorter than CCG-5901. The US Coast Guard\u2019s National Security Cutters, displace 4,500 tons, a third of the size of CCG-5901. In a firepower comparison, CCG-5901 also betters the US cutters, with two main 76.2-millimeters guns compared to one main 57-millimeter gun on the US ships. \u201cIts massive size enables it to intimidate its neighbors while avoiding the escalatory implications of sending a gray-hulled military vessel,\u201d Powell said, referring to navy ships. Coast guards, known as white-hulled vessels because of their color, are usually assigned to law enforcement and search-and-rescue operations. In most countries, they are not normally expected to participate in military operations. The US Coast Guard, for instance, is part of the US Department of Homeland Security, not the Defense Department, although US Coast Guard vessels can come under US Navy control in certain scenarios. The China Coast Guard is part of the country\u2019s People\u2019s Armed Police, which is under the command of the Central Military Commission. Analysts say that\u2019s a key difference between the two coast guard agencies. \u201cIt is not really intended to carry out traditional coast guard missions, but is primarily used as a central element in China\u2019s paramilitary maritime force,\u201d Powell said of \u201cThe Monster.\u201d Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center, said CCG-5901\u2019s size and crew enable it to be a central command ship for a larger operation. He noted that a Chinese navy aircraft carrier was also operating near the Philippines in recent weeks and that the combination of the two is a coordinated effort to demonstrate overwhelming Chinese naval power to Manila. China has both the world\u2019s largest navy, in terms of sheer ship numbers, as well as the world\u2019s largest coast guard. Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said \u201cThe Monster\u201d shows the Chinese military\u2019s ability for \u201cescalation dominance,\u201d adding that the vessel the Philippines had previously sent to Sabina Shoal, the Teresa Magbanua, was one of its best. The China Coast Guard \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to be outdone thus this monster came along to show who\u2019s got a bigger set of muscles,\u201d Koh said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/asia/china-monster-coast-guard-ship-philippines-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

CNN cannot independently verify the ministry\u2019s numbers. A displaced man at the school told CNN children were among the injured. \u201cThere was a swing here, swings were here, (children) were playing. What was their fault?\u201d he said as he held his little daughter. \u201cWe barely found this place in the school, but even the school is not safe.\u201d CNN video shows several injured children arriving at a nearby hospital following the attack. The Israeli military said in a statement on Saturday militants were operating in structures located in the school area. \u201cThis location served as a hideout and operational infrastructure from which attacks against IDF (Israel Defense Forces) troops operating in the Gaza Strip were directed and carried out,\u201d the statement added. CNN cannot independently verify the Israeli military\u2019s claim. UNRWA Communication Director Juliette Touma told CNN UNRWA does not have all the information yet, adding that half of UNRWA\u2019s facilities in Gaza have been hit since October 7. \u201cAt least 500 people sheltering in those (UNRWA) facilities have been killed, many were women and children,\u201d she added. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said it \u201ccondemned in the strongest terms\u201d the attack on the UNRWA building, which it said \u201chouses thousands of displaced civilians.\u201d Jordan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the strike and what it called Israel\u2019s \u201cclear disregard for the rules of international law,\u201d saying that humanitarian facilities and shelters must be protected under international law. The news comes just as it appeared some progress was being made in long-stalled hostage release and truce negotiations. A senior Hamas official told CNN the militant group was ready to reconsider its insistence that Israel commit to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before signing an agreement that would usher in a temporary truce and begin a process to release hostages. Meanwhile, the near-weekly demonstrations against the Israeli government continued on Saturday. Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv\u2019s Democracy Square to call for new elections and the release of hostages amid discontent with how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has handled issues including the war in Gaza. Israeli police said in a statement that two protesters were arrested at the Tel Aviv demonstration, citing violations of public order and unsafe behavior, including \u201clighting bonfires on the road.\u201d The police said they deployed in large forces to maintain security and order and dispersed the demonstration after protesters illegally gathered on Menachem Begin Road and tried to block it, despite initial approval for the protest. Protesters waved Israeli flags and held signs criticizing Netanyahu, while police used water cannons to disperse demonstrators blocking the traffic on the Ayalon Highway. \u201cAfter most of the protesters dispersed naturally and in light of the violations of order by a handful of protesters, the police had to declare an illegal demonstration,\u201d the police said. \u201cDuring the dispersal of the rioters, the police arrested two suspects.\u201d The Israeli police further warned that it \u201cwill act with zero tolerance towards those who disrupt the order and will not listen to the policemen\u2019s instructions.\u201d The chairman of Israel\u2019s National Unity and former war cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, was seen participating in a rally calling for the return of the hostages. The often-weekly demonstrations have yet to change the political landscape, and Netanyahu still controls a stable majority in parliament. Additional reporting by Hamdi Alkhshali and Ibrahim Dahman.

{"id": "2024_07_09_sport_spain-france-euro-2024-semifinal-lamine-yamal-spt-intl", "text": "Lamine Yamal made history by becoming the youngest player to score in a men\u2019s European Championship as Spain edged past France 2-1 to reach Sunday\u2019s Euro 2024 final. France took the lead inside 10 minutes after Randal Kolo Muani headed home from Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s cross, but Spain leveled the scores soon after thanks to 16-year-old Yamal\u2019s stunning long-range effort. Dani Olmo then produced a brilliant effort of his own less than five minutes later to put Spain into the lead and it was an advantage La Roja defended stoically until the full-time whistle. Tuesday\u2019s victory also means Spain becomes the first team to win six straight matches at a single European Championship tournament. Luis de la Fuente\u2019s side will now face either the Netherlands or England, who play on Wednesday, in the final as Spain goes in search of a fourth Euros crown. Yamal, who picked up the man of the match award for his performance, celebrates his 17th birthday the day before the final and said his \u201cgoal\u201d was to still be in Germany for the occasion. \u201cWe were a goal down and I just got the ball, I didn\u2019t think about it much and then shot towards the goal,\u201d he said, per AFP. \u201cWe are very, very close. [We\u2019re] with a lot of happiness. This team is unbelievable. We deserve it. One step away from glory.\u201d Sublime Spain Few had picked Spain to win the tournament, but La Roja has been unequivocally the best team at Euro 2024 and already dispatched host Germany after extra-time in the quarterfinals. The pace and trickery of Yamal and Athletic Bilbao\u2019s 21-year-old winger Nico Williams have been one of the highlights of Spain\u2019s tournament \u2013 Rodri\u2019s control in midfield is another \u2013 and the pair of young forwards will undoubtedly continue to play a vital role for the national team in the years to come. France, conversely, has struggled for form at the tournament, something that has afflicted many of the so-called bigger teams. Les Bleus hadn\u2019t scored a goal from open play throughout the tournament to reach the semifinals, relying on own goals and a penalty from Mbapp\u00e9. After sustaining a broken nose in France\u2019s opening group game against Austria, Mbapp\u00e9 has, understandably, not been quite at his best. It was a frenetic start in Munich and Spain should have taken the lead inside five minutes. Yamal, playing on the right-hand side, cut back onto his left foot and whipped a delightful cross into the box, something that has become a feature of the youngster\u2019s tournament. His delivery was inch-perfect onto the head of Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz, but the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder put his effort over the crossbar when totally unmarked at the far post. It was a miss that Ruiz would rue almost immediately as three minutes later, France was in the lead. Mbapp\u00e9, who was finally played without a mask, put a cross towards the far post and Kolo Muani brilliantly peeled off the back of defender Aymeric Laporte to make space and head the ball past a rooted Unai Sim\u00f3n. Spain looked rattled and was struggling to contain France\u2019s counterattacks. The 38-year-old Jesus Navas, deputising for the suspended Dani Carvajal at right back, in particular was having a torrid time up against Mbapp\u00e9. But then the game changed in the blink of an eye, thanks to teenage sensation Yamal. Out of nowhere, the schoolboy, who promised his teachers ahead of the tournament that he would keep up with his homework in Germany, cut back onto his left foot 25 yards from goal and bent a stunning effort off the post and in. France goalkeeper Mike Maignan has enjoyed an impressive tournament for Les Bleus but had no chance of saving Yamal\u2019s arcing shot. It\u2019s difficult to comprehend how someone so young could possess the confidence and self-belief to not only think about taking that shot, but execute it to perfection on the biggest stage. That goal breathed new life into Spain and less than five minutes later, De la Fuente\u2019s side was ahead. After Navas\u2019 cross into the box was blocked, Olmo took two sublime touches to bring the ball under control and away from Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni, before drilling a deflected effort past a helpless Maignan. Spain had responded magnificently to the early pressure France applied. Now it was up to France coach Didier Deschamps to find a way for his team to fight back. Just after the hour mark, Deschamps rolled the dice. Off came Adrien Rabiot, N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and goal scorer Kolo Muani, who were replaced by Bradley Barcola, Eduardo Camavinga and the experienced Antoine Griezmann. Clear cut chances were few and far between, however, as France struggled to break down a resolute Spanish defence. After a promising first half, Mbapp\u00e9 was particularly disappointing in the second period. In the final few minutes, a wayward shot that ended up high in the stands when he was well placed inside the box summed up an underwhelming evening for the new Real Madrid star.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/sport/spain-france-euro-2024-semifinal-lamine-yamal-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

As the dust settles, the scale of destruction is startling. But it is also all-too familiar. This part of\u00a0Rafah,\u00a0Gaza\u2019s southernmost city which became the\u00a0last refuge for more than a million Palestinians\u00a0earlier in the war,\u00a0is\u00a0now unrecognizable. Israel has repeatedly described its ground operation in Rafah as \u201climited.\u201d But in this neighborhood in southern Rafah, the destruction looks almost identical to what I\u2019ve seen in northern Gaza, in central Gaza and in Khan Younis through the limited prism of trips into Gaza with the Israeli military. Some homes are\u00a0flattened and\u00a0other\u00a0buildings bombed out. \u201cThis is where the main destruction is because it was booby-trapped and because the tunnels were booby trapped,\u201d Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the IDF\u2019s top spokesman, tells me when I press him on how this represents a \u201climited\u201d operation. \u201cAnd\u00a0when you see destruction, it\u2019s because either the houses were booby trapped, either when we demolished a tunnel the houses\u00a0fell apart, or that Hamas fired from those houses and risked our forces and we had no other method but to make sure that our forces were safe,\u201d\u00a0Hagari added. Other parts of Rafah are not nearly as devastated, he says. But CNN cannot independently verify his claims: Israel has barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza independently and our only access is via embeds with the Israeli military. And this devastated section of Rafah is where they have brought us. The Israeli military has brought us here not to see the destruction, but to talk about why they launched an offensive here in the first place,\u00a0what they\u00a0say they\u2019ve uncovered\u00a0and what they\u2019ve accomplished. Before arriving into Rafah, we drive along Gaza-Egypt border:\u00a0through\u00a0what\u2019s known as the Philadelphi corridor.\u00a0The area\u00a0was seized by the\u00a0Israeli military, which\u00a0says it has uncovered dozens of tunnel shafts as well as rocket launchers used to fire rockets into Israel. Hagari showed us one tunnel shaft, which he said stretched about 90 feet\u00a0(28\u00a0meters)\u00a0underground. The Israeli military says Hamas has used the Philadelphi corridor to smuggle weapons in from Egypt and then deeper into the rest of the Gaza Strip. Hagari says some of the tunnels stretch toward Egypt, but he cannot yet definitively say whether those tunnels were functional and were used to smuggle weapons into Gaza. Egypt has denied that there are any tunnels stretching into its territory from Gaza. \u201cWe are researching those tunnels carefully and making sure which ones were functional and which are not functional anymore because maybe they were \u2013 from the Egyptian side \u2013 stopped,\u201d Hagari says. He won\u2019t say exactly how long Israeli forces will need to\u00a0occupy\u00a0this corridor, but says it could be weeks or months. Hagari also says Israeli forces killed more than 900 Hamas fighters in Rafah\u00a0and are close to defeating Hamas\u2019s Rafah brigade. But how many militants have melted away and are likely to regroup once Israeli forces leave this area is less clear \u2013 and absent a long-term strategy or an alternative to Hamas governance in Gaza, Hamas has already begun to do just that in other areas where Israeli forces had previously withdrawn. As for the Rafah ground operation, Hagari cannot say whether it will be the last\u00a0in Gaza. \u201cI won\u2019t say that because what you will see is when we\u2019ll have intelligence that maybe there are hostages in one of the points in Gaza, we will operate and do a raid. If we\u2019ll get intelligence in one of those areas that Hamas terrorists are preparing a terror attack against Israelis or our forces, we will do a raid and attack,\u201d Hagari says. \u201cThis is what you\u2019ll see.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/middleeast/destruction-inside-rafa-gaza-israel-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_style_north-carolina-artifacts-church", "text": "When not leading sermons, the Rev. Daniel Cenci\u00a0is quite the history buff. Cenci\u2019s two passions coincided when a plethora of centuries-old items were found June 20 in the yard of Christ Episcopal Church in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, where Cenci has served as rector since 2019. He said the church\u2019s construction crew was digging up a century-old magnolia tree when the mundane quickly turned into something extraordinary around lunchtime. The crew had hit something while digging up a pit for drainage underneath the stump. When Cenci saw the almost dome-like shape of the structure the crew had hit, he thought it was a crypt or an unmarked soldier\u2019s grave\u00a0given the many battles fought in eastern North Carolina\u00a0during\u00a0the Civil War. Cenci enlisted the help of a nearby parishioner to poke around. Soon, the two had pulled out a bone that was eight inches long. \u201cI thought, \u2018Oh gosh, maybe that\u2019s a crypt after all,\u2019\u201d Cenci told CNN. After telling the construction crew to go home for the day, artifacts like pottery, old and broken dishes, glassware, bottles and more bones were unearthed from the loose, sandy\u00a0terrain\u00a0filled with bricks. With guidance and inspection from a local museum and a specialist in early porcelain dating, the items were roughly dated\u00a0from the early 1700s up through the mid-1800s. The bones didn\u2019t belong to human bodies but to\u00a0animals \u2013\u00a0including\u00a0a possible jawbone from a wild boar. \u201cThe guess right now is maybe (the spot) is either a root cellar that was associated with an early home or a cistern for water storage, again associated with another early home in the city,\u201d Cinci said. The\u00a0North Carolina Office of State Archaeology\u00a0from the Raleigh and Greenville offices were called in to possibly further identify and date the items. Five days later, the ground was excavated, according to\u00a0CNN affiliate WTKR. After the state office agreed with the artifacts\u2019 initial dating estimate, they\u00a0were\u00a0labeled and placed on\u00a0plates in the church\u2019s kitchen until they can\u00a0be sent away for further testing.  Cenci was told that either a team from the Raleigh or Greenville archeology offices may return to the site, a graduate student from a local university would be tasked with continuing the excavation or the church\u00a0could\u00a0hire an outside archaeological firm. Due to the church being on private property and the lack of requirement for environmental review and permitting, the North Carolina Office of State Archaeology is not directly involved in the project past its initial assessments, Michele Walker, a representative for the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources told CNN in a statement Monday. Christ Episcopal Church\u00a0was founded in 1825\u00a0but the building it currently occupies wasn\u2019t built until 1856, according to Cenci. From research done by church parishioners\u00a0Ian Lowry, Robyn Nix and Sam Moncla,\u00a0who dug into deeds, wills and estate documents at the Pasquotank County courthouse, the group has discovered a Black man named George Davis used to own the property in the early 1800s that the church sits on \u2013 on two of the most premier lots in the city. His daughter Charlotte was married in the Episcopal church in 1833, according to church records and as posted by\u00a0Lowry on Facebook.\u00a0Nothing is confirmed yet, but some of the artifacts are thought to have been owned by Davis, Cenci explained. \u201cWe can safely say that Mr. Davis was living there, and we can also safely say that the bulk of artifacts found thus far fit into the time period of his occupancy,\u201d Lowry wrote in an email. \u201c(Davis) did very well for himself based on the items that have come out of the excavation site,\u201d Cenci said. \u201cWe\u2019ve found bottles of French wine and we found imported porcelain from China \u2026 It seems we have uncovered the history of an early African American in our community that was quite influential (and) quite affluent in the town which I think is really interesting.\u201d Cenci said all he did was stop the construction; Lowry, Nix and Moncla are \u201creally the heroes in this story as far as finding out what was in there and why it matters.\u201d With the church being founded in 1825, this discovery comes just in time for its 200th anniversary. \u201cAs a Christian, I believe it\u2019s God\u2019s providential timing that it would happen right as we\u2019re coming into our 200th anniversary,\u201d Cenci said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting\u00a0this \u2013 almost like a time capsule \u2013\u00a0back to when the church was founded.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/style/north-carolina-artifacts-church/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_americas_argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam", "text": "It was an attack that sent shockwaves through a country long considered a pioneer in LGBTQ rights. In the early hours of May 6, four lesbian women were set on fire\u00a0in Argentina. Only one of them survived. It happened at a\u00a0boarding house\u00a0in the Barracas neighborhood of Buenos Aires, where Pamela Fabiana Cobas, Mercedes Roxana Figueroa, Andrea Amarante and Sof\u00eda Castro Riglo were sharing a room. Witnesses say a man\u00a0broke in\u00a0and threw an incendiary device that set the women on fire. Pamela died soon after. Her partner Roxana died days later of organ failure. Andrea died on May 12 in a hospital. Andrea\u2019s\u00a0partner Sof\u00eda was the sole survivor. She spent weeks recovering in hospital and is alive today only because Andrea threw herself on top of her to shield her from the flames, Sofia\u2019s attorney Gabriela Conder told CNN. \u201cHer partner saved her,\u201d Conder said. Local LGBTQ rights advocates condemned the attack as a hate crime and lesbicide, saying the women were targeted because of their sexual identity. Police have arrested a 62-year-old man who\u00a0lived in the building but, according to Conder, aren\u2019t currently treating the incident as a hate crime as they say the motive is still unclear. For Argentina\u2019s LGBTQ groups \u2013 many of whom are planning to commemorate the four women with a rally this weekend \u2013 the attack represents an extreme manifestation of what they consider a growing wave of hostility against them. Those they blame most for this rising intolerance are the people in power. Chief among them, they say, is the country\u2019s new far-right leader Javier Milei. \u201cThings changed with the new government of Javier Milei,\u201d said Maria Rachid, head of the Institute Against Discrimination of the Ombudsman\u2019s Office in Buenos Aires, and a board member and founder of the Argentine LGBT Federation (FALGBT). \u201cSince the beginning of the new government, there are national government officials expressing themselves in a discriminatory manner and those hate speeches before our communities from places with so much power, of course, what they do is generate \u2013 actually legitimize \u2013 and endorse these discriminatory positions that are then expressed with violence and discrimination in everyday life,\u201d Rachid said. Milei under fire When Milei ran for president\u00a0in 2023, he and his party\u00a0were accused of making offensive remarks against LGBTQ communities which were deemed hate speech by multiple groups, including Argentina\u2019s National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes. In a YouTube interview ahead of the November election, Milei insisted that he does\u00a0not oppose same-sex marriage, but in that same interview, he went on to compare homosexuality to having sex with animals. \u201cWhat do I care what your sexual preference is? If you want to be with an elephant, and you have the consent of that elephant, that\u2019s a problem between you and the elephant,\u201d he said, angering LGBTQ communities, who called the comments dehumanizing. In late October, then-congresswoman-elect Diana Mondino, who would later become Milei\u2019s foreign minister, told an interviewer that she supports marriage equality in theory, but at the same time,\u00a0compared it to having lice. \u201cAs a\u00a0liberal, I\u2019m in favor of each person\u2019s life project. It is much broader than marriage equality. Let me exaggerate: If you prefer not to bathe and be full of lice and it is your choice, that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t complain later if there is someone who doesn\u2019t like that you have lice,\u201d she said. After\u00a0taking office in December, Milei took steps that\u00a0critics say weakened protections for LGBTQ groups. He banned\u00a0the use of\u00a0gender-inclusive language\u00a0in government; replaced the\u00a0Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity\u00a0with a less powerful undersecretariat within the Ministry of Human Capital; and effectively closed the national anti-discrimination agency, saying the Ministry of Justice would\u00a0absorb its functions. Milei\u2019s administration argued that some of those moves were part of his plan to cut public spending in response to the country\u2019s economic hardships. But critics say his actions have normalized a culture of discrimination toward LGBTQ groups, and in the most extreme cases, have led to violent attacks such as the deadly May 6 arson. \u201cWhen hate speech is enabled by those in power, these sectors start to feel legitimized to attack,\u201d Esteban Paul\u00f3n, a former FALGBT president who was elected to Congress last year, told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cAnd obviously, behind the verbal attacks come physical attacks.\u201d \u201c(Attacks) always happened. That\u2019s the reality. But they increased more in this current government due to the hate speeches constantly maintained on television, including hate speeches that our president Javier Milei exerts,\u201d said Jesi Hern\u00e1ndez, a lesbian and communication member of Lesbianxs Autoconvocadxs por la masacre de Barracas (Self-convened Lesbians for the Barracas massacre). \u201cToday it was Pamela, Roxana, Andrea and Sof\u00eda. And tomorrow it can be me.\u201d CNN\u00a0has repeatedly reached out to the presidency for comment on these allegations but has not received a response. Rise in hate crimes In 2023, an annual report by the National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes recorded\u00a0133 crimes\u00a0in which the victims\u2019 sexual orientation, identity and/or gender expression were used as a pretext for the attacks. Those numbers rose from 2022 and 2021, when 129 and 120 crimes were recorded, respectively. Rachid points out that the observatory\u2019s numbers only represent attacks that have been officially recorded, and that the real figures are likely much higher. Hern\u00e1ndez, meanwhile, notes that daily life for many people has been impacted in ways not shown by statistics alone. Some now fear they could be targeted next. \u201cThe\u00a0truth is that now, sleeping peacefully in your bed is a privilege,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said, referencing the May 6 attack, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t know if you have a neighbor who will throw something at you or come in. Sleeping is now a privilege for us.\u201d Despite calls from LGBTQ activists, the arson is currently being investigated as an aggravated homicide rather than a hate crime, according to Conder, Sofia\u2019s attorney. Sofia is set to testify at the end of the month, Conder\u00a0said. CNN has reached out to the criminal court investigating the case but has not received a response. Shortly after the May 6 killings, the presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni condemned the attack but\u00a0dismissed\u00a0the notion that it was motivated by hatred toward the sexual orientation of the victims. \u201cI don\u2019t like to define it as an attack on a certain group,\u201d Adorni said at a press conference. \u201cThere are many women and men who are suffering violence and these are things that cannot continue to happen.\u201d Progressives condemned his remarks, insisting that the government should regard lesbicide as a hate crime. Adorni responded on social media with a picture of a Spanish dictionary that said\u00a0lesbicide\u00a0is not a registered word. Progress in Argentina Argentina was once a progressive pioneer in\u00a0Latin America. In 2010, it became the first country in the region to\u00a0legalize same-sex marriage. In 2021, it also became the first to allow nonbinary people to mark their gender as \u201cX\u201d on\u00a0national identity documents. LGBTQ activists fear these historic gains are now being undermined \u2013 and potentially threatened \u2013 by the current government.\u00a0But they also take comfort in surveys that suggest anti-LGBTQ views are the minority in Argentina. According to a public opinion survey conducted in May by the University of San Andr\u00e9s, some 72% of respondents said they are in favor of marriage equality, 70% said they support policies that protect transgender people from discrimination, 75% said they do not consider that transsexuality is a disease that should be treated medically, and 79% said that comprehensive sexuality education in schools is a positive thing. The recent attacks have galvanized activists to fight for new policies and actions that would further protect LGBTQ rights. Congressman Paul\u00f3n told CNN that lawmakers are working with rights groups on various laws that would, among other things, punish discriminatory acts, prevent harassment in schools, and ban efforts to try to \u201ccorrect\u201d people\u2019s sexual orientation, identity and gender. He also said that to reduce attacks on LGBTQ communities, their voices and demands should be amplified in more societal sectors. To that end, Hern\u00e1ndez encouraged LGBTQ groups to push back against hate speech, telling those communities: \u201cThey are not insane, they are not sick, they are not people with lice. Quite the opposite. I would tell them that they are a disruptive person, that they are breaking out of the molds of \u2018normality.\u2019 And that they are very brave \u2026 and that they are whatever they want to be, despite all this.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/americas/argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_europe_kara-murza-russia-prison-hospital-intl", "text": "Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian opposition politician serving a lengthy jail sentence for treason, has been transferred to a prison hospital, his wife Evgenia said Friday. Kara-Murza, 42, was moved from the maximum-security IK-6 penal colony in the Siberian city of Omsk to a prison hospital in another part of the region, she said in a series of posts on X. His lawyers have not been allowed to see him and have been given contradictory information by hospital staff, she added. After arriving at IK-6 from Moscow, Kara-Murza\u2019s lawyers were made to wait for five hours before being told they could not see him, she said. They were later told to come back the next day. When the lawyers returned Friday morning, they were informed he was still being examined by doctors and had not yet been fully processed. They were told later Friday that they still could not see Kara-Murza, and that the correctional facility would be closed over the weekend, she said. \u201cThe lawyers were never able to see Vladimir and make sure that everything was okay with him,\u201d she wrote, saying that Kara-Murza has been suffering from polyneuropathy, \u201ca disease caused by two severe poisonings.\u201d Kara-Murza has claimed he was twice poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok \u2013 in 2015 and in 2017 \u2013 which caused him to suffer multiple organ failure and fall into a coma. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in his illness, but Kara-Murza has long maintained there was \u201cno other possible reason\u201d for it than a politically motivated attack. In an interview with CNN shortly before his arrest in 2022, Kara-Murza criticized the Kremlin for its persecution of its political opponents and invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThese people have a literally decades-long track record of going after their political opponents. Poison has been a particularly favored method because it gives them \u2013 or at least it did until all of these media investigations came out \u2013 plausible deniability,\u201d Kara-Murza told CNN. \u201cThis regime that is in power in our country today, it\u2019s not just corrupt, it\u2019s not just kleptocratic, it\u2019s not just kleptocratic, it\u2019s not just authoritarian \u2013 it is a regime of murderers. And it is important to say it out loud,\u201d he said, adding it was \u201ctragic\u201d that it took the invasion of Ukraine for Western countries to \u201copen their eyes\u201d to the danger of Putin\u2019s regime. He was arrested shortly afterward and later sentenced to 25 years in prison, in a decision condemned as politically motivated and draconian by the international community. Asked by CNN why he had chosen to return to Russia after recovering from his poisoning \u2013 and knowing the risks faced by Kremlin critics \u2013 he said: \u201cI\u2019m a Russian politician. I have to be in Russia. It\u2019s my home country. I think the biggest gift we could give \u2013 those of us who are in opposition to Putin\u2019s regime \u2013 to the Kremlin, is to give up and run. I mean, that\u2019s all they want from us.\u201d Since the death of Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison in February, Kara-Murza has been the most prominent Russian opposition figure persecuted by the Kremlin. A joint investigation by CNN and the group Bellingcat implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in poisoning Navalny during a trip to Siberia in August 2020. The investigation found that the FSB toxins team of about six to 10 agents trailed Navalny for more than three years before poisoning him via his underpants.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/kara-murza-russia-prison-hospital-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_world_global-elections-2024-maps-charts-dg", "text": "As the presidential race in the United States heats up, many other countries around the world are also conducting pivotal elections in 2024. More than 70 nations \u2013 home to nearly half the world\u2019s people \u2013 have already or will soon select their own leaders at the polls, according to data from NGO the International Foundation for Electoral Systems. Here\u2019s a closer look at the countries holding elections, in maps and charts. India, the world\u2019s most populous country, has already held the largest election this year. The South Asian nation has more residents than the European Union and the countries of North America combined. The election took 44 days, with more than one million polling stations, and its voters represented about 12% of the world\u2019s population. Voters in Mexico, the second most populous country in Latin America, selected the nation\u2019s first female president \u2014 one of just 26 female leaders worldwide. About 54% of Mexicans voted in what was the largest election in the country\u2019s history, with more than 98 million eligible voters, some 70,000 candidates and more than 20,000 public offices on the ballots. Elsewhere in the world, over 30% of elections in 2024 are being held in undemocratic regimes \u2014 places where the contests aren\u2019t fair or equal, and where leaders at times stop opposition or arrest protesters, among other undemocratic practices like election fraud. Vladamir Putin, for example,\u00a0faced no real opposition in the Russian election in March this year. With most of his potential challengers dead, imprisoned or exiled, Putin won in a landslide with 87.3% of the vote. The Russian leader is currently serving his fifth term as president, and in 2020, he succeeded in amending the constitution for term limits, enabling him to potentially stay in power until 2036. Iran held an election last week that saw the lowest voter turnout for a presidential contest since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. With no\u00a0candidate\u00a0receiving more than 50% of votes, a runoff election took place June 5 between the two\u00a0leading candidates: Reformist lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian and ultraconservative former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili. Scores of other major countries are voting this year, including Pakistan, Bangladesh and France. In the first round of French elections last week, Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party led in the parliamentary votes, and President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance came in third. While the RN slumped to third place in the decisive second round, after centrist and leftist parties united to prevent it from taking power, it still won more seats in the French parliament than ever before, making it the largest single party, and appears likely to be a potent force in the years ahead. In recent European Parliament elections, far-right parties performed well \u2014 with the National Rally gaining seven seats \u2014 and were particularly popular with young people. Voter turnout among young people has historically been quite low. For instance, in the 2019 UK election, only 47% of voters aged 18 to 24 participated, compared to 75% of those over 65, according to Ipsos Mori estimates. The trend was even more pronounced in the US, where only 28% of voters aged 18 to 29 turned out for the 2018 election, as estimated by CIRCLE. One aspect that might influence young people\u2019s votes is that the median age of current national leaders around the world is 62, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2023, 76% of Americans aged 18 to 29 said that Biden, 81, is too old to run for president, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. So far this year we have already seen many elections, but the season is far from over, with many countries still waiting to go to the polls.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/world/global-elections-2024-maps-charts-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_travel_barcelona-tourism-protests-scli-intl", "text": "Protesters in Barcelona have sprayed visitors with water as part of a demonstration against mass tourism. Demonstrators marching through areas popular with tourists on Saturday chanted \u201ctourists go home\u201d and squirted them with water pistols, while others carried signs with slogans including \u201cBarcelona is not for sale.\u201d Thousands of protesters took to the streets of the city in the latest demonstration against mass tourism in Spain, which has seen similar actions in the Canary Islands and Mallorca recently, decrying the impact on living costs and quality of life for local people. The demonstration was organised by a group of more than 100 local organizations, led by the Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Turi\u0301stic (Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth). According to official figures, almost 26 million visitors made an overnight stay in the Barcelona region in 2023, spending \u20ac12.75 billion ($13.8 billion). However, the Assemblea de Barris pel Decreixement Tur\u00edstic says that these visitors increase prices and put pressure on public services, while profits from the tourism industry are unfairly distributed and increase social inequality. It has published 13 proposals to reduce the number of visitors and transition the city to a new model of tourism, including the closure of cruise ship terminals, more regulation of tourist accommodation and an end to public spending on tourism promotion. On Saturday, the city\u2019s mayor, Jaume Collboni, highlighted a series of measures that he has announced recently to reduce the impact of mass tourism, including increasing the nightly tourist tax to \u20ac4 ($4.30) and limiting the number of cruise ship passengers. At the end of June, Collboni also announced that it would end apartment rentals for tourists by 2028 by scrapping short-term rental licenses for more than 10,000 apartments. This would help to make housing more affordable for long-term residents, according to Collboni, who said rents had increased 68% in the past 10 years, with the cost of buying a house up 38%. However, Collboni has been criticized for allowing events such as a Louis Vuitton catwalk show in architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s Parc G\u00fcell in May, as well as the upcoming America\u2019s Cup sailing competition. The growing discontent in Barcelona echoes similar protests in other parts of Spain. In April, locals in the\u00a0Canary Islands\u00a0mobilized to protest against\u00a0excessive tourism, blaming visitors for pricing them out of their homes and causing environmental damage. These complaints are common to many tourist hot spots around the world, which have experienced record visitor numbers recently as the travel industry has roared back from a pandemic-induced downturn. Such surges may be sweet for local economies and hospitality businesses\u2019 bottom line, but they also come with notable downsides: increased noise, pollution, traffic and strain on resources; a lower quality of life for locals; and a diminished visitor experience, among others. Not surprisingly, many tourist magnets have created initiatives and restrictions intended to combat overtourism, including new or increased tourist taxes, campaigns aimed at discouraging problematic visitors and attendance caps at popular attractions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/travel/barcelona-tourism-protests-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}

Orban was the first EU leader to visit Moscow since April 2022 and his trip was made even more controversial by the fact that Hungary has just taken over the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union. Putin and Orban said they discussed ways to end the conflict in Ukraine.  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Putin said Russia was \u201calways open for discussion\u201d for a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict but stressed that he stands by the terms it has already outlined. Those terms would be unacceptable for Ukraine and its western allies. Ukraine has made it clear that any peace deal must include the return of Ukraine\u2019s pre-2014 territory. Orban\u2019s press secretary Zoltan Kovacs said the prime minister\u2019s visit to Moscow was of \u201cspecial significance,\u201d being the first since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Friday\u2019s meeting marks the 14th\u00a0time the two leaders have met since 2009, he said. Orban has long been Putin\u2019s greatest ally in Europe, a rare outlier among the otherwise united bloc. He has been campaigning for\u00a0a ceasefire as opposed to military support for Ukraine. \u201cThe talks with President Putin at the Kremlin focused on the Ukraine settlement and bilateral relations, emphasizing Hungary\u2019s unique position to communicate with both warring sides,\u201d Kovacs said in a post on X following the meeting on Friday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen criticized Orban\u2019s decision to visit Moscow, saying \u201cappeasement will not stop\u201d Putin. \u201cOnly unity and determination will pave the path to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine,\u201d she added. Kyiv was also quick to criticize Orban\u2019s trip. \u201cThe decision to make this trip was made by the Hungarian side without approval or coordination with Ukraine,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s foreign ministry said Friday. \u201cWe remind that the principle of \u2018no agreements on Ukraine without Ukraine\u2019 remains inviolable for our country and call on all states to strictly adhere to it.\u201d The ministry said Ukraine\u2019s peace formula \u2013 the plan outlined by President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 \u201cremains the only realistic way to restore a just peace.\u201d Orban\u2019s trip to Moscow came just days after his trip to Kyiv on Tuesday, his first visit to Kyiv\u00a0since Russia\u2019s full-scale war began. He used the trip to urge Zelensky to consider a \u201cceasefire\u201d in order to \u201cspeed up peace talks\u201d with Moscow \u2013 something Zelensky firmly rejected.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/orban-meets-putin-russia-ukraine/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/10/2024", "section": "world"}}
