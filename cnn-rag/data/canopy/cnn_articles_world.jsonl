Past coverage of the 2023 and 2022 hurricane season and the latest weather news can also be found on CNN. Follow the storm tracker for the path and forecasts of the latest storm. Facts The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30. The areas covered include the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. The National Weather Service defines a hurricane as a \u201ctropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher.\u201d Hurricanes are rated according to intensity of sustained winds on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. The 1-5 scale estimates potential property damage. A Category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane. The National Hurricane Center advises preparedness: \u2022 A hurricane watch indicates the possibility that a region could experience hurricane conditions within 48 hours. \u2022 A hurricane warning indicates that sustained winds of at least 74 mph are expected within 36 hours. Predictions April 4, 2024 - The Colorado State University Tropical Meteorology Project team predicts an \u201cextremely active\u201d Atlantic hurricane season. The team forecasts 23 named storms, including 11 hurricanes, five of which will be major hurricanes. May 23, 2024 -\u00a0The Climate Prediction Center (CPC)\u00a0at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\u00a0forecasts\u00a0an 85% chance for an above-normal season, predicting that there is a 70% chance of having 17 to 25 named storms, of which eight to 13 could develop into hurricanes, including four to seven major hurricanes (Categories 3-5). 2024 Atlantic Storm Names Pronunciation Guide Tropical Storm Alberto June 19, 2024 - Tropical Storm Alberto forms over the western Gulf of Mexico.June 20, 2024 - Makes landfall near Tampico, Mexico.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/05/weather/2024-atlantic-hurricane-season-fast-facts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_tech_apple-openai-partnership", "text": "When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attended Apple\u2019s annual developer conference this week, he walked the campus, mingling with current and former executives, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Nearly an hour later, the iPhone maker announced a much-rumored partnership with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT technology to devices later this year. But Altman, who has emerged as the poster child for generative AI in the 18 months since the launch of ChatGPT, was not featured in Apple\u2019s formal presentation, neither in person or via livestream. Nor did he join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives in a private press event about privacy and security and the partnership between the two companies. \u201cI was not surprised Sam Altman did not appear on stage,\u201d said Ben Wood, an analyst at market research firm CCS Insight in an interview with CNN. \u201cApple had to manage the message carefully. OpenAI is merely the vehicle to address broader AI-powered inquiries that are not core to the Apple experience. Having him in the livestream would have only created an unnecessary level of confusion.\u201d Earlier this week, Apple showed off a handful of AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall \u2013 the majority of which are fueled by the company\u2019s own proprietary technology, called Apple Intelligence. The company will offer OpenAI\u2019s viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity, usually only when Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry. The move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continues to face concerns from researchers, industry experts and government officials around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more. The deal also comes at a time when the industry is moving quickly, and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to engage with the technology responsibly. Apple hopes that a big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales as the device has languished without a major upgrade for years and users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices as a result. An uncertain economic environment is also weighing on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was recently passed by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. In the 60 hours after Apple\u2019s Monday event, however, the company\u2019s stock price (AAPL) rose by as much as 10%, boosting Apple\u2019s market capitalization by more than $300 billion, rocketing past Nvidia and putting Apple back in contention with Microsoft for largest market value. The timing is further noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the latest buzzy technology. \u201cApple needed to deliver an AI story and Apple Intelligence should help placate nervous investors and reassure them that Apple is keeping pace with its rivals,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe partnership with ChatGPT is a major development which beefs up Apple\u2019s AI offerings, and new features like a significantly improved Siri will be welcome to users.\u201d But the partnership could also open Apple up to some vulnerability, as it has no control over OpenAI\u2019s models or what it does with user inputs. Apple alignment with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could also cause some challenges down the road. A limited partnership Although Apple has been working on its own AI program for years, a partnership with OpenAI marks a way for it to fill in the competitive gaps. When a user has a question beyond Siri\u2019s scope, ChatGPT can step in. In the demo following the keynote, Apple showed CNN how someone could upload a picture of vegetables at a farmer\u2019s market and ask what they could make for dinner. Siri may suggest that the question is better suited for ChatGPT, and provide the user with a prompt to give consent to use the service. Apple using ChatGPT as a complimentary service could potentially cut down on risks associated with the company. It\u2019s also very possible Apple could partner with other AI companies in the future too, such as Google\u2019s Gemini or more niche providers with certain expertise, such as in healthcare. \u201cI think Apple will take a pragmatic approach to the OpenAI partnership,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf Apple finds that the relationship with OpenAI starts to affect the overall user experience or worse, create challenges around security and data integrity, it might look to add further guardrails, or find other ways to deliver AI-powered content.\u201d A focus on privacy and security Apple has been vocal about how it intends to keep user data private and secure when using its own proprietary technology, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone and inputs will be kept away from a far-off server cloud. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up,\u201d he added. Apple said it will not share any personal user information with OpenAI, so inquiries made through ChatGPT won\u2019t be linked to an Apple user\u2019s account. And the repeated consent prompt to require users to opt into using ChatGPT with Siri is noteworthy too; each time Siri wants to kick over a question to ChatGPT, it\u2019ll ask for permission first. Wood believes the consent prompts and other guardrails that Apple is implementing \u201creflect its nervousness.\u201d Meanwhile, Reece Hayden, a principal analyst at ABI Research, told CNN that Apple\u2019s approach is smart because it provides customers with a choice of how to deal with their data. \u201cBy providing a phased approach that blends ChatGPT and native capabilities, users will worry less about the partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cApple can also continue to highlight their own AI capabilities and mitigate some of the risks of being associated with OpenAI, which remains in a state of flux.\u201d Industry concerns Companies like OpenAI have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but many experts, researchers and AI employees believe they should be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures. Just last week, a group of OpenAI insiders demanded that artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about the concerns over the technology they\u2019re building. So it came as no surprise when some industry watchers, including Elon Musk, were quick to react to Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI. In a post to X Monday, Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies \u2014 which include Tesla, SpaceX and X, among others \u2014 if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans. If Apple \u201cintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,\u201d Musk said that would constitute \u201can unacceptable security violation.\u201d Although concerns over how employees are using AI models is a topic of worldwide discussion at the moment across many industries, Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said Musk\u2019s reaction is a bit misdirected and the topic is not specific to iPhones. \u201cAny employee with a smartphone should follow company policies and not enter any private information into the open domain of ChatGPT,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not specific to the iPhone \u2026 or Tesla.\u201d Andrew Cornwall, senior analyst at Forrester, told CNN he thinks it\u2019s unlikely that Apple users will become loyal to ChatGPT, as many people won\u2019t use the service unless the iPhone maker can\u2019t provide an appropriate response. \u201cWhen users do query ChatGPT, Apple will track the prompts and gather metrics to improve its own models,\u201d he said. \u201cApple may switch providers or even use more than one third party \u2014 until it has mastered its own model. At that point, Apple will shut the garden gate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/tech/apple-openai-partnership/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

The blaze broke out at around 10:31 a.m. local time at a facility operated by battery maker Aricell in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, about 50 kilometers southwest of Seoul. It was extinguished around 3:10 p.m, and firefighters were able to enter the factory, said Hwaseong Fire Department official Kim Jin-young in a briefing. Among the dead, two were\u00a0Koreans and 20 were foreigners, the majority of whom were Chinese nationals, Kim added in a later briefing. Rescue workers recovered a number of burned bodies, Kim said, and one person died due to cardiac arrest. At least two people were seriously injured with burns and five suffered minor injuries, Kim said.

{"id": "2024_06_26_asia_north-south-korea-balloons-defector-activist-group-intl-hnk", "text": "Beside a desk scattered with soldering pieces, loose wires and electronic parts, Choi\u2019s computer screen tracks wind conditions and the GPS location of some unlikely parcels: massive \u201csmart\u201d balloons he has sent floating into North Korea. From a small apartment in South Korea\u2019s capital, Choi, who CNN is identifying by a pseudonym for his privacy and safety, is one of the parties engaged in what has become a tit-for-tat balloon feud between the two Koreas, heightening tensions on the Korean Peninsula. For many years, South Korean activists and North Korean defectors have sent balloons to the North, loaded with propaganda material criticizing dictator Kim Jong Un and\u00a0USB sticks filled with\u00a0K-pop songs and South Korean television shows\u00a0\u2013 all strictly prohibited in the impoverished, highly isolated nation. In response, North Korean authorities have sent more than 1,000 balloons toward the South since May carrying trash, waste and worms \u2013 fueling tensions as Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korea\u2019s leader, warned of \u201ctrouble\u201d ahead. In 2020, South Korea passed a law criminalizing the sending of anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the border as the previous liberal government in Seoul\u00a0pushed for engagement with Pyongyang. But many campaigners\u00a0defied the ruling before it was struck down by a court last year, which called the law an excessive restriction on free speech, in response to a complaint filed by North Korean defector-activists in the South. Choi, co-founder of the Committee for Reforming and Opening North Korea, is among the North Korean defectors who have vowed to continue sending balloons to their homeland. The balloons assembled by Choi\u2019s group from their Seoul apartment base are a step up from rudimentary balloons that randomly scatter their contents when they crash or pop. Fitted with GPS trackers,\u00a0the activists can monitor\u00a0these next generation \u201csmart\u201d balloons in real time on journeys that often span hundreds of kilometers.\u00a0The group once tracked one of its balloons that drifted all the way to China, according to its data. The group\u2019s oblong-shaped balloons are about 12 to 13 meters (about 40 to 42 feet) long, made of plastic and filled with hydrogen, Choi said. They carefully chose the plastic\u2019s thickness so it can both endure the wind and allow some hydrogen to naturally leak through, helping control the balloons\u2019 altitude, he added. The sensors and small circuit boards attached to the balloons help the balloons travel at a certain altitude and for a certain distance. \u201cIf the balloons float too high over 4,000 meters, the dispenser won\u2019t work properly so we keep an extra bag of leaflets to drop when it reaches too high in altitude,\u201d Choi said. \u201cIt\u2019s programmed to release the hydrogen gas depending on the altitude.\u201d \u201cI believe North Korea can change when the deification of Kim Jong Un is cracked, and sending these smart balloons is the way to achieve that,\u201d Choi added. \u201cI feel very proud that we have contributed to dismantling the idolization of Kim Jong Un.\u201d 3D-printed parts The smart balloons sent by Choi\u2019s group carry a number of different payloads, including some that are automated. In one version, the balloons carry a small, makeshift loudspeaker that looks like a camping lantern, held in place by zip ties and glue. Attached to a cushion, battery pack and a parachute, it blares propaganda as it floats to the ground, with one message declaring: \u201cNorth Korea can survive only if the Workers\u2019 Party is abolished.\u201d The balloons are sometimes fitted with an automated flyer-dispensing device. They can carry about 1,500 propaganda leaflets \u2013 which the dispenser spits out rapidly with the help of a timer and an altitude-adjusting device. \u201cWe devised a method to disperse the leaflets over a large area, covering 50 to 300 kilometers (about 31 to 186 miles), making it very difficult for North Korean authorities to collect them all,\u201d Choi said. \u201cWith our system, we can control the leaflets to fall every 300 meters or every kilometer, making sure more people can see them.\u201d These features allow the group more control over their devices than the typical balloons used by other activists. For example, smart balloons are designed to begin spitting out leaflets at specific points based on their wind speed and direction, Choi said \u2013 purportedly allowing them to distribute within target areas. They can also control the frequency of the leaflets\u2019 distribution. While Choi buys some parts for the devices, he uses 3D printers to make the others. He credits his engineering studies at a North Korean university before his escape to the South \u2013 and\u00a0YouTube videos and the rest of his group \u2013 for helping him improve upon the existing balloons being sent North, before setting up the organization in 2013. And this isn\u2019t his full-time job; he works elsewhere in the daytime, comes to the apartment after work, makes 3D-printed parts, then assembles them for up to six hours a day. Each smart balloon costs about $700 to make, he said. Choi\u2019s motivation, he said, is his family still living in North Korea. And he bristled at those in South Korea who have urged the activist groups to stop. \u201cTo those who criticize our activities, it\u2019s like saying, \u2018Let\u2019s help maintain the dictatorship in South Korea,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to\u00a0decades of authoritarianism in Seoul before the South\u2019s transition to democracy in the 1980s. Rising tensions The balloon feud has seen tensions heighten between the two Koreas, which technically remain at war \u2013 an armistice ended the Korean War that split the peninsula in 1953 but no formal peace treaty was ever signed. Relations between the two countries thawed somewhat in 2017 and 2018, allowing some South Korean elements, including parts of its pop culture, to seep into the hermit nation. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years as leader Kim ramped up weapons testing in defiance of United Nations sanctions and diplomatic talks fell apart, prompting strict rules to snap back into place in the North. Meanwhile, both nations are drawing closer to their respective partners \u2013 with North Korea recently signing a defense agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0and South Korea stepping up cooperation with Japan and the United States. On Tuesday, after South Korea detected the latest batch of 350 trash balloons from North Korea, the country\u2019s military warned it could restart loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts at the border \u2013 something it hasn\u2019t done since 2018. In past years, Seoul has used giant speakers to play propaganda and music across the heavily militarized border \u2013 including news reports and K-pop group Big Bang\u2019s hit song \u201cBang Bang Bang.\u201d \u201cOur military is ready to immediately start anti-North Korea propaganda broadcasts and will operate with flexibility according to the strategical and operational situation,\u201d said South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, adding that whether it resumes the loudspeakers is \u201cup to North Korea\u2019s actions.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/asia/north-south-korea-balloons-defector-activist-group-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_middleeast_israel-gaza-rescue-operation-palestinian-toll-intl-cmd", "text": "Bullet holes fleck the bloodstained walls of the Miqdad family home, in Nuseirat camp, central Gaza. CNN footage from the house shows a cream teddy bear perched on a white cupboard, with broken plastic strewn across the shelves. In another room, mother-of-four Rasha Abdel Miqdad shudders with grief, before breaking down in tears. \u201cThis is the blood of my son, Yamen. May God bless his soul,\u201d the 32-year-old Palestinian told CNN on June 12. \u201cMy son was innocent. \u201cWe are civilians, and we have no connection to the resistance or anything or any faction. We have no connection to it at all.\u201d CNN spoke to seven members of the family who described a horror-filled haze of gunfire, tank artillery and aerial bombardment around their home on June 8. Israeli forces stormed through the building searching for militants and indiscriminately spraying bullets, according to the family members. Four people suffered gunshot wounds, leaving one child severely injured and 12-year-old Yamen dead, the family alleged to CNN. Soldiers interrogated and beat male relatives, and forced a child to strip, relatives claimed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released footage on June 16 showing forces in the Miqdad\u2019s house on the same day as a\u00a0high-profile hostage rescue operation\u00a0nearby. In the heavily edited video, shared on social media and described as forces \u201csecuring the area\u201d during the operation, members of the Israeli Paratroopers Reconnaissance Battalion appear to enter the home. The video does not show what happened on the third floor, where the family say they were attacked. CNN has reached out to the IDF but has not received a response to the specific allegations made. The allegations provide a window into the scale and force of this\u00a0Israeli\u00a0operation\u00a0to free hostages taken during the attack on Israel last October. Eyewitnesses say they are still traumatized, after more than 270 Palestinians were killed and another 698 people injured on June 8, according to authorities in Gaza. Health staff said that hospitals, already stretched beyond their limits, were completely overwhelmed. These extremely high reported casualty tolls prompted renewed warnings from human rights organizations who say Israel is not doing enough to protect civilians as it prosecutes its war, and that militants are endangering Palestinian lives. The UN human rights office (OHCHR)\u00a0warned that\u00a0Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups may have committed war crimes through their actions. OHCHR spokesman Jeremy Laurence said the Israeli operation \u201cseriously calls into question whether the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution\u2026 were respected\u201d and that, by holding hostages in densely populated areas, Palestinian armed groups are \u201cputting the lives of Palestinian civilians, as well as the hostages themselves, at added risk.\u201d It was not clear how many of those killed were militants. The Ministry of Health in Gaza does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. But the ministry said many of those impacted were women and children, as well as people recently displaced by Israel\u2019s offensive in the southern city\u00a0of Rafah. The IDF has disputed the ministry\u2019s numbers, claiming that casualties from the operation were \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the casualty figures given by either side. The IDF said special forces teams launched the rescue operation in Nuseirat camp just after 11 a.m. local time, and by 11:25 a.m. had begun\u00a0raids\u00a0on both buildings where hostages were being held. After exchanging heavy fire with militants, and as the surrounding area came under intense Israeli missile and rocket fire, the special forces retrieved the hostages then started to travel out of the camp, toward an area near the US military\u2019s floating pier on the Mediterranean coast. It was along this route that Israeli forces stormed the Miqdad family house for between 30 and 45 minutes, according to eyewitness accounts corresponding with videos analyzed by CNN. Flames and plumes of smoke billow over wrecked vehicles in the aftermath of the operation, according to footage taken at 1:10 p.m. local time and obtained by CNN. Civilians wail over bodies heaped on top of each other, as young children look up to the sky in disbelief. In one frame, filmed on a nearby street, members of the Miqdad family can be seen carrying their injured children into a car as Israeli drones buzz overhead. The Miqdad family home, which a CNN team visited later, stands just under a mile (1.5 km) from the site where the hostages were held, as determined by CNN through video analysis. \u201cThey left nothing behind. It\u2019s all destroyed,\u201d said the mother Rasha, speaking fourtwo days after the operation. \u201cThe room is full of blood. My children\u2019s clothes are all blood. \u201cThere is no safe place\u2026 no place where we can protect ourselves.\u201d Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on southern Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed 37,658 Palestinians and injured at least another 86,237 people, according to Gaza health officials. \u2018Felt like an earthquake\u2019 Artillery and missile fire erupted near the Miqdad family home before the Israeli forces entered on June 8, the father, Mohammad, told CNN. He said he gathered his family \u2013 some 14 people, mostly women and children \u2013 into a room. The family trembled with fear as the voices of soldiers grew closer, until, they claim, the troops kicked down the door, opened indiscriminate fire, threw stun grenades and pointed weapons at some of the children. \u201cThey came to the apartment we were at, and started shooting and saying, \u2018Who is here, who is here?\u2019 We told them we were civilians, children and women,\u201d Mohammad told CNN. Rasha told CNN the raid \u201cfelt like an earthquake,\u201d adding that soldiers confiscated their cell phones. \u201cThey carried weapons, pointing them at an eight-month-old baby and a four-month-old baby.\u201d Israeli troops detained the two men present and demanded to know whether there were any militants in the building, Mohammad said. He and his father-in-law, Abdul Raouf, 58, tried to declare their innocence. Then, they allege, soldiers forced bags over their heads, tied their hands behind their backs and physically assaulted them. Mohammad\u2019s second oldest child, Ahmad, is still reeling from the attack. The 13-year-old told CNN he could hear the soldiers beating his father and grandfather in the hallway, before he claims he was himself forced to strip. Soldiers then told him to put his clothes back on, he said, before he was taken out of the room and \u201cpunched,\u201d pointing to his face. \u201cHe asked me to take off my clothes to make sure I was a little boy,\u201d Ahmad recalled. \u201cHe threw me to the ground and put blindfolds on me,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wanted to tie me, but I started kicking with my feet, so he put his shoe here,\u201d he said, pointing to his neck, \u201cand stepped on me to silence me. \u201cThey meant to kill me.\u201d Mohammad told CNN that before the Israeli forces withdrew, they threatened to shoot his relatives, after which he heard gunshots. \u201cThe soldier said, \u2018If you don\u2019t tell me where the resistance fighters are and where the weapon is in your house, I will kill your children,\u2019\u201d Mohammad said. \u201cHe went to the room,\u201d he said, referring to the part of the house where the women and children were, adding, \u201cA minute after, and I heard the gunshots.\u201d Ahmad told CNN: \u201cAt that moment, we assumed my brothers had been killed.\u201d It is not clear if any of the family members were hit in the second round of shooting. Bullet casings that appear in a video filmed by CNN at the house are stamped with IMI, which denotes the Israeli weapons manufacturer Israeli Military Industries, according to two weapons experts, Richard Weir, senior researcher in the Crisis and Conflict division at Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member. One casing is a 9mm caliber, likely a pistol, or a machine pistol or a submachine gun, Weir said. Israeli forces were in the house for up to 45 minutes, family members told CNN. When they eventually left, Mohammad, still blindfolded, says he called on Rasha to remove the bag over his head. They say their two sons were limp and bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds. One of their children, Mumen, 16, says he was shot in his shoulder and abdomen, while his younger brother, Yamen, 12, had bullet injuries to his abdomen and leg. \u201cI called the ambulance, but they said they cannot come because the area is dangerous,\u201d Mohammad told CNN. Instead, the family raced north by car to Al-Awda Hospital. But for Yamen, it was too late. \u201cThey gave him CPR for 10 minutes, but he was already martyred,\u201d Mohammad said. Scenes of \u2018massacre\u2019 at local hospitals The footage obtained by CNN from the area shows survivors clambering over rubble as missiles streak across the sky. Entire buildings are hollowed out. Palestinian men and boys delicately cover dead bodies with blankets, trying to give dignity to those killed in the Israeli\u00a0operation. Hospital workers say they could not manage the flood of casualties from the daytime raid, which was carried out when the streets and market were busy with people. At least 250 Palestinians wounded in Nuseirat were transferred from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital to Nasser Hospital, according to health authorities.

The bulk carrier Philipp Oldendorff spotted a canoe-shaped boat adrift with people on board roughly 440 nautical miles, or about 815 km, south of Tenerife, and provided first aid to those affected while passenger ship Insignia was sent to the area, the Salvamento Maritimo statement said. The Insignia, owned by Oceania Cruises, rescued a total of 68 people and recovered three bodies, the agency said, adding that it could not recover the remains of two people due to poor weather conditions. On Thursday, Insignia\u2019s crew reported that one of the rescued migrants was in critical condition and needed to be evacuated. He died before a search and rescue helicopter could reach him, the agency said. The 62 men, three women and three minors rescued were from sub-Sahara Africa, according to the Insignia\u2019s\u00a0report\u00a0to the agency. \u201cSafety of life at sea is of paramount importance for all seafarers,\u201d an Oceania Cruises spokesperson told CNN via email. \u201cWe can confirm that Insignia rescued 68 people from a vessel in distress between Cape Verde and Tenerife and bought them onboard for medical assistance and provided food, drinks, clothing and a safe place to rest.

{"id": "2024_06_26_americas_bolivia-coup-attempt-claims-intl-latam", "text": "Bolivian President Luis Arce stared down a short-lived attempted coup on Wednesday, after calling on the public to \u201corganize and mobilize\u201d in defense of democracy as soldiers and armored military vehicles surrounded government buildings in La Paz. \u201cWe cannot allow coup attempts to take Bolivian lives once again. We want to urge everyone to defend democracy,\u201d Arce said from the presidential residence, Casa Grande, as the attempted coup got under way. Footage from the scene showed armed soldiers gathered around Murillo Plaza, a main square in La Paz where the national executive and legislative offices are located. Armored vehicles were seen ramming into the doors of Bolivia\u2019s government palace, according to Associated Press, as the country\u2019s former President Evo Morales, who, like Arce, is in Bolivia\u2019s Movement to Socialism (MAS) party, said on X that a \u201ccoup d\u2019\u00e9tat is brewing.\u201d They were being led by Juan Jos\u00e9 Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, the former army chief who had been dismissed from his position just the day before, reportedly for threatening to block a bid by Morales for reelection. He was later detained and was seen being forced into a police vehicle, according to local media. Prior to his detention, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga addressed reporters in the square on Wednesday, flanked by soldiers, saying \u201cwe want to restore democracy\u201d as he spoke of the country\u2019s economic woes. \u201cThe people have no future, and the army has the courage to look out for the future of our children, the well-being and progress of our people,\u201d he said, adding that they were \u201cgoing to free all political prisoners\u201d including Bolivia\u2019s former President Jeanine Anez,\u00a0currently imprisoned for what the courts said was her role in deadly protests that erupted after her ascension to power in 2019. In images shown on Bolivian television, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga then entered the palace hallway and \u2013according to Associated Press \u2013 was confronted by Arce who told him, \u201cI am your captain, and I order you to withdraw your soldiers, and I will not allow this insubordination.\u201d The situation appears to have been defused when Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u2019s replacement as army chief, General Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez \u2013 who was only appointed Wednesday \u2013 ordered the soldiers in the square\u00a0to return to their units. \u201cI order\u00a0all personnel mobilized in the street\u00a0to\u00a0return to their units,\u201d Sanchez said from a podium\u00a0at\u00a0the presidential palace amid cheers and\u00a0applause. Armed vehicles were seen leaving Murillo Plaza soon after, according to footage from State media Bolivia TV. Arce also announced Wilson Guardia and Gerardo Zabala, as new heads of Bolivia\u2019s navy and air force, respectively. CNN is trying to contact Bolivia\u2019s government for comment. Tensions in Bolivia have been rising over the next general elections in 2025 over the plans of leftist Morales to run against Arce. Morales, who publicly split from his one-time ally Arce, resigned in 2019 following mounting protests over accusations of fraud in the elections; at the time, he claimed he was forced out in a coup. Before his dismissal, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga had reportedly said Morales should not be able to return as president, and threatened to block him if it happened. Bolivia\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office launched\u00a0a criminal investigation against Z\u00fa\u00f1iga later on Wednesday, with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office saying on X that \u201call the other participants\u201d involved in Wednesday\u2019s events in La Paz would also be investigated. The Attorney General\u2019s Office said it will make \u201call the necessary efforts\u201d to identify all persons involved\u00a0and further investigate the attempted\u00a0coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and impose\u00a0the \u201cmaximum punishment on those responsible.\u201d Fredy Mamani, former deputy foreign minister of Bolivia and ally of Morales and Arce, told CNN that despite the \u201cundemocratic\u201d nature of \u201cthe tanks, the uniformed soldiers and taking the square\u2026 it is essential to highlight that the Bolivian people are united in the face of any coup d\u2019etat.\u201d News of the attempted coup was roundly condemned by international and regional leaders, including Paraguay\u2019s President Santiago Pe\u00f1a, Mexico\u2019s president, and the European Union. \u201cWe express our support for democracy in our brother country and to the legitimate government of Luis Arce,\u201d Chile\u2019s President Gabriel Boric said on X. The secretary general of the Organization\u00a0of\u00a0American\u00a0States (OAS), a pan-American organization, Luis Almagro, condemned the mobilizations in the \u201cmost energetic way\u201d on X, saying the \u201carmy must submit to the legitimately elected civil power.\u201d The European Union said it opposed \u201cany attempt to disrupt the constitutional order in Bolivia\u00a0and overthrow democratically elected governments,\u201d adding it stands in solidarity with the Bolivian government and its people, according to a post from European policy chief Josep Borrell on X.

{"id": "2024_06_26_middleeast_israel-gaza-rescue-operation-palestinian-family-intl-cmd", "text": "Bullet holes fleck the bloodstained walls of the Miqdad family home, in Nuseirat camp, central Gaza. CNN footage from the house shows a cream teddy bear perched on a white cupboard, with broken plastic strewn across the shelves. In another room, mother-of-four Rasha Abdel Miqdad shudders with grief, before breaking down in tears. \u201cThis is the blood of my son, Yamen. May God bless his soul,\u201d the 32-year-old Palestinian told CNN on June 12. \u201cMy son was innocent. \u201cWe are civilians, and we have no connection to the resistance or anything or any faction. We have no connection to it at all.\u201d CNN spoke to seven members of the family who described a horror-filled haze of gunfire, tank artillery and aerial bombardment around their home on June 8. Israeli forces stormed through the building searching for militants and indiscriminately spraying bullets, according to the family members. Four people suffered gunshot wounds, leaving one child severely injured and 12-year-old Yamen dead, the family alleged to CNN. Soldiers interrogated and beat male relatives, and forced a child to strip, relatives claimed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released footage on June 16 showing forces in the Miqdad\u2019s house on the same day as a\u00a0high-profile hostage rescue operation\u00a0nearby. In the heavily edited video, shared on social media and described as forces \u201csecuring the area\u201d during the operation, members of the Israeli Paratroopers Reconnaissance Battalion appear to enter the home. The video does not show what happened on the third floor, where the family say they were attacked. CNN has reached out to the IDF but has not received a response to the specific allegations made. The allegations provide a window into the scale and force of this\u00a0Israeli\u00a0operation\u00a0to free hostages taken during the attack on Israel last October. Eyewitnesses say they are still traumatized, after more than 270 Palestinians were killed and another 698 people injured on June 8, according to authorities in Gaza. Health staff said that hospitals, already stretched beyond their limits, were completely overwhelmed. These extremely high reported casualty tolls prompted renewed warnings from human rights organizations who say Israel is not doing enough to protect civilians as it prosecutes its war, and that militants are endangering Palestinian lives. The UN human rights office (OHCHR)\u00a0warned that\u00a0Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups may have committed war crimes through their actions. OHCHR spokesman Jeremy Laurence said the Israeli operation \u201cseriously calls into question whether the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution\u2026 were respected\u201d and that, by holding hostages in densely populated areas, Palestinian armed groups are \u201cputting the lives of Palestinian civilians, as well as the hostages themselves, at added risk.\u201d It was not clear how many of those killed were militants. The Ministry of Health in Gaza does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. But the ministry said many of those impacted were women and children, as well as people recently displaced by Israel\u2019s offensive in the southern city\u00a0of Rafah. The IDF has disputed the ministry\u2019s numbers, claiming that casualties from the operation were \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the casualty figures given by either side. The IDF said special forces teams launched the rescue operation in Nuseirat camp just after 11 a.m. local time, and by 11:25 a.m. had begun\u00a0raids\u00a0on both buildings where hostages were being held. After exchanging heavy fire with militants, and as the surrounding area came under intense Israeli missile and rocket fire, the special forces retrieved the hostages then started to travel out of the camp, toward an area near the US military\u2019s floating pier on the Mediterranean coast. It was along this route that Israeli forces stormed the Miqdad family house for between 30 and 45 minutes, according to eyewitness accounts corresponding with videos analyzed by CNN. Flames and plumes of smoke billow over wrecked vehicles in the aftermath of the operation, according to footage taken at 1:10 p.m. local time and obtained by CNN. Civilians wail over bodies heaped on top of each other, as young children look up to the sky in disbelief. In one frame, filmed on a nearby street, members of the Miqdad family can be seen carrying their injured children into a car as Israeli drones buzz overhead. The Miqdad family home, which a CNN team visited later, stands just under a mile (1.5 km) from the site where the hostages were held, as determined by CNN through video analysis. \u201cThey left nothing behind. It\u2019s all destroyed,\u201d said the mother Rasha, speaking fourtwo days after the operation. \u201cThe room is full of blood. My children\u2019s clothes are all blood. \u201cThere is no safe place\u2026 no place where we can protect ourselves.\u201d Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on southern Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed 37,658 Palestinians and injured at least another 86,237 people, according to Gaza health officials. \u2018Felt like an earthquake\u2019 Artillery and missile fire erupted near the Miqdad family home before the Israeli forces entered on June 8, the father, Mohammad, told CNN. He said he gathered his family \u2013 some 14 people, mostly women and children \u2013 into a room. The family trembled with fear as the voices of soldiers grew closer, until, they claim, the troops kicked down the door, opened indiscriminate fire, threw stun grenades and pointed weapons at some of the children. \u201cThey came to the apartment we were at, and started shooting and saying, \u2018Who is here, who is here?\u2019 We told them we were civilians, children and women,\u201d Mohammad told CNN. Rasha told CNN the raid \u201cfelt like an earthquake,\u201d adding that soldiers confiscated their cell phones. \u201cThey carried weapons, pointing them at an eight-month-old baby and a four-month-old baby.\u201d Israeli troops detained the two men present and demanded to know whether there were any militants in the building, Mohammad said. He and his father-in-law, Abdul Raouf, 58, tried to declare their innocence. Then, they allege, soldiers forced bags over their heads, tied their hands behind their backs and physically assaulted them. Mohammad\u2019s second oldest child, Ahmad, is still reeling from the attack. The 13-year-old told CNN he could hear the soldiers beating his father and grandfather in the hallway, before he claims he was himself forced to strip. Soldiers then told him to put his clothes back on, he said, before he was taken out of the room and \u201cpunched,\u201d pointing to his face. \u201cHe asked me to take off my clothes to make sure I was a little boy,\u201d Ahmad recalled. \u201cHe threw me to the ground and put blindfolds on me,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wanted to tie me, but I started kicking with my feet, so he put his shoe here,\u201d he said, pointing to his neck, \u201cand stepped on me to silence me. \u201cThey meant to kill me.\u201d Mohammad told CNN that before the Israeli forces withdrew, they threatened to shoot his relatives, after which he heard gunshots. \u201cThe soldier said, \u2018If you don\u2019t tell me where the resistance fighters are and where the weapon is in your house, I will kill your children,\u2019\u201d Mohammad said. \u201cHe went to the room,\u201d he said, referring to the part of the house where the women and children were, adding, \u201cA minute after, and I heard the gunshots.\u201d Ahmad told CNN: \u201cAt that moment, we assumed my brothers had been killed.\u201d It is not clear if any of the family members were hit in the second round of shooting. Bullet casings that appear in a video filmed by CNN at the house are stamped with IMI, which denotes the Israeli weapons manufacturer Israeli Military Industries, according to two weapons experts, Richard Weir, senior researcher in the Crisis and Conflict division at Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member. One casing is a 9mm caliber, likely a pistol, or a machine pistol or a submachine gun, Weir said. Israeli forces were in the house for up to 45 minutes, family members told CNN. When they eventually left, Mohammad, still blindfolded, says he called on Rasha to remove the bag over his head. They say their two sons were limp and bleeding from multiple gunshot wounds. One of their children, Mumen, 16, says he was shot in his shoulder and abdomen, while his younger brother, Yamen, 12, had bullet injuries to his abdomen and leg. \u201cI called the ambulance, but they said they cannot come because the area is dangerous,\u201d Mohammad told CNN. Instead, the family raced north by car to Al-Awda Hospital. But for Yamen, it was too late. \u201cThey gave him CPR for 10 minutes, but he was already martyred,\u201d Mohammad said. Scenes of \u2018massacre\u2019 at local hospitals The footage obtained by CNN from the area shows survivors clambering over rubble as missiles streak across the sky. Entire buildings are hollowed out. Palestinian men and boys delicately cover dead bodies with blankets, trying to give dignity to those killed in the Israeli\u00a0operation. Hospital workers say they could not manage the flood of casualties from the daytime raid, which was carried out when the streets and market were busy with people. At least 250 Palestinians wounded in Nuseirat were transferred from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital to Nasser Hospital, according to health authorities. Al-Aqsa hospital is serving nearly five times the number of in-patients it had pre-war with just one functioning electricity generator, the UN\u2019s Office for Humanitarian Affairs reported\u00a0on June 10.

{"id": "2024_06_24_americas_migration-us-mexico-border-tohono-oodham-intl-latam", "text": "The thermometer hit 111 Fahrenheit\u00a0as we rolled up to a battered tent deep in the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation reservation in Arizona.\u00a0Under its shade lay around a dozen dazed looking families, many with small children.\u00a0A stressed-looking mother of two paced back and forth. They had walked for five hours to get here, and had been waiting all day. But they looked at us \u2013 and the\u00a0tribal dignitaries\u00a0on whose land they were trespassing \u2013 with only mild curiosity.\u00a0They were asylum seekers, looking for the green uniforms of US Border Patrol so that they could turn themselves in. Chairman Verlon Jose, leader of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, considered addressing them, and then turned away. \u201cThis is nothing that the nation can solve,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever I say to them is not even going to be relevant, other than our prayers for their journey.\u201d The Tohono O\u2019odham, or \u201cpeople of the desert,\u201d have lived in the Sonoran desert for thousands of years, their\u00a0ancestral\u00a0homelands stretching from what is now Pima County, Arizona, all the way to Mexico\u2019s Sea of Cortez. The\u00a0US-Mexico border now slices across those lands, a 62-mile line of low metal fencing weaves between ancient saguaro cacti and\u00a0that\u00a0marks the southern limit of the\u00a0Nation\u2019s\u00a0federal Indian reservation\u00a0\u2013 and the edge of the United States. The Tohono O\u2019odham do not recognize this border; enrolled members speak their own language, live on both sides and travel back and forth. But it has become impossible to ignore amid\u00a0record numbers of migrants crossing into the US from Mexico\u00a0and a bitter political storm over what to do with them. You could drive for miles on the sprawling Tohono O\u2019odham reservation without encountering anyone beside the free-ranging cattle. But for decades, migrants and asylum seekers, northbound drug smugglers and southbound arms traffickers, and US Border Patrol agents have roamed here in endless pursuit across the rocky terrain. The toll of all this traffic on the environment is obvious; discarded clothes, trash, diapers and even ID cards line the border. In December, during the peak of recent border crossings, thousands of asylum seekers camped out on\u00a0the Nation\u2019s territory, burning the reservation\u2019s wild mesquite trees for warmth as they waited to be apprehended. The sight of the broken branches, piles of abandoned plastic bottles and human waste left in the migrants\u2019 wake was heartbreaking to the tribe, Jose told CNN. \u201cYour heart feels for the migrants and so forth like that\u2026 but then other part says look at the destruction that they\u2019re causing us\u2026 look at the trash that they\u2019re leaving,\u201d Jose told CNN. The chairman and Arizona governor Katie Hobbs\u00a0wrote in a joint letter to the federal government last year requesting ramped up staffing and resources from the US Customs and Border\u00a0Protection (CBP)\u00a0to deal with the surge. But the\u00a0Nation\u2019s\u00a0longstanding reliance on the federal government to enforce the border means an uneasy trade of tribal sovereignty for security. Border\u00a0police have had violent run-ins with members, and the thought of a potential border wall is seen as a travesty here \u2013 a mutilation of the land itself. \u201cAll we want is safe passage to our traditional homes, to our sacred areas. The drug activity, the migrant activity is going to go on and go on. And we\u2019re caught in the middle of this,\u201d Jose said. Strangers in the desert The Tohono O\u2019odham reservation\u00a0is part of Arizona\u2019s Tucson sector and\u00a0one of the busiest immigration sectors in the country in both apprehensions of border crossers and marijuana seizures, according to the Customs and Border\u00a0Protection\u00a0website. Across the sprawling reservation, the tribe works closely with CBP, providing land for checkpoints, forward operating bases, surveillance infrastructure, and putting forward indigenous-led special units that investigate and track drug smuggling. The\u00a0Nation says that it spends an average of $3 million annually to assist with border security. Still, strangers walk onto the reservation all the time. In the small southern community of\u00a0Menagers\u00a0Dam, just a 15 minute walk from the border, people turn up asking for water or a phone, others march straight into homes to raid their kitchens, said Annette Mattia, 61, who lives in the village. Some\u00a0Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u00a0members put out water or food for the migrants, others are afraid to. Some members have been involved in smuggling themselves, she says. \u201cWe\u2019re always calling (Border Patrol) because where we live is a bushy area with the trees still there and everything. And that was like the gateway for smugglers. You can just go walk in our yard and in the little trees, and you\u2019ll find the slipper shoes the smugglers use, or their camouflage clothes,\u201d she says. Still, seeing Border Patrol\u2019s trucks and helicopters on the reservation and frequent questioning by agents also makes many\u00a0of the Nation\u2019s residents\u00a0bristle. \u201cIf you decide to go out into the mountains for the day, if you want to pick the cactus fruit or get materials from the desert, Border Patrol will be out there, and they will be on you: \u2018What are you doing here, why are you out here?\u2019,\u201d Annette Mattia told CNN. \u201cYou know, this is our reservation. It\u2019s our nation. We can go hunting if we want to go hunting, we can gather if we want to gather,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re here because the border\u2019s here.\u201d A deadly landscape Sprawling across 2.8\u00a0million acres, it\u2019s easy to imagine getting lost in this desert reservation. Massive rock formations are the only landmarks, rising between low plains dotted with dry shrubs and cactus forests. Many migrants who cross here never make it out alive; the remains of at least 1,650 people have been found across the Tohono O\u2019odham reservation since 2000, according to local organization Humane Borders, which\u00a0works with the Pima County Medical Examiner\u2019s office to track deaths. Last year, the bodies of 81 people were found on the reservation, according to Humane Borders. So far in 2024, 10 bodies have been found here, according to the Humane Borders map, all discovered on the San Miguel corridor \u2013 the same route where we met dozens of people waiting with children as young as toddlers. Most, but not all, are reduced to skeletons in the arid desert. In May, one unidentified man found close to the border was found \u201cfully fleshed\u201d \u2013 he had\u00a0died from heat exposure within a day of being found, according to the county medical examiner\u2019s report. In February, the body of a 22-year-old woman was found on the Baboquivari Peak\u00a0mountain range; she was the victim of blunt force injuries, the medical examiner assessed. Summer is the deadliest time for border crossings. But while migration through the Sonoran Desert has historically slowed during these searing months, that\u2019s no longer the case today, a CBP spokesperson told CNN; human traffickers who\u2019ve made a business of promising asylum in America now push migrants through the border year-round in order to maximize profits. Demand for traffickers is high, despite the risks \u2013 which migrants may not always understand. Since the pandemic, people fleeing stuttering economies, climate change, crime and authoritarian governments have flocked to the US southern border, a CBP spokesperson told CNN \u2013 nearly all those journeys were facilitated by criminal groups. \u201cNo one crosses on their own anymore,\u201d the spokesperson told CNN. Cartels\u2019 grip on the border area is near-complete, he confirmed; attempting to cross the Mexican side of the desert into the US without paying is another way to end up dead. Migrants sent one way, drugs another Today, faced with vast numbers of asylum seekers in a blistering landscape, the day-to-day work of Border Patrol often ends up being humanitarian. In the Tucson Sector, Border Patrol agents perform dozens of rescues each week, according to statistics posted online by the agency, and frequently end up treating dehydrated or injured migrants in the desert. Even more often, agents simply ferry families from the desolate border where asylum seekers politely wait to be apprehended, to detention centers further inland \u2013 a task that one agent likened with annoyance to babysitting or Uber driving. Some describe with nostalgia a Wild West version of their jobs from decades past, chasing drug runners across a dramatic landscape. \u201cBack in the day when it was just single males with a lot of narcotics, it was dangerous but kind of exciting,\u201d said the agent, who requested anonymity because he did not have permission to speak publicly. \u201cSecure the border. We didn\u2019t have to babysit. We were up in the mountains getting narcotics and stuff, chasing gun traffickers, drugs. But now it\u2019s moms and infants. It sucks. Nobody wants to deal with a mama and baby.\u201d Border Patrol agents and Nation\u00a0members say migrants, on whom so much national attention is focused, are often used as a distraction for law enforcement on the reservation. Cartels funnel large groups toward remote areas that are difficult and time-consuming to reach, in addition to being more dangerous for the travelers, while smugglers trek with drug-loaded backpacks\u00a0up another route. \u201cThe cartels want migrants to cross in rural areas to pull us away, so drugs and stuff can make it through while we\u2019re busy\u2026 You\u2019ve got to drive the freaking 30 or 40 minutes out there, pick them up, drive 30 or 40 minutes back. You ain\u2019t got time to go chase three or four people with backpacks walking through the desert,\u201d the agent told CNN. Urban crossing areas are also often more closely patrolled than the desert wilds and are more likely to be blocked by a towering steel barrier, unlike these lands. Mike Wilson, a Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u00a0member who has gained celebrity in human rights circles for years spent putting out water for migrants on the reservation, says many of the deaths on the reservation were predictable. In a recently published memoir, \u201cWhat Side Are You On?\u201d Wilson blames a US border policy of deterrence \u2013 blocking irregular migration at urban crossing points \u2013 for driving asylum seekers into Tohono O\u2019odham lands and the most perilous parts of the desert. The strategy, which originated in the 1990s, included a calculation that deaths resulting from the dangerous trek would deter future migrants. The number of illegal border crossings has risen since then. Security vs. sovereignty Frustrations over the border here came to a head last year, when Annette\u2019s brother Raymond Mattia was shot and killed by a group of Border Patrol agents at his home. Nothing to do with immigration \u2013 they\u00a0were supposed to be backing up a local Tohono O\u2019odham police unit\u00a0that was looking into a 911 call reporting two gunshots had been heard. Footage from\u00a0the agents\u2019 body cameras\u00a0showed their flashlights casting through the dark of the Arizona desert, choppily illuminating saguaro cacti and low shrubs in the neighborhood in search of movement in the area, before noticing the unarmed 58-year-old \u00a0standing in his front yard. Obeying agents\u2019 orders, he removed his hand from his pocket, withdrawing a cell phone. They began firing immediately. \u201cI thought they were yelling and shouting at illegals,\u201d she recalled, describing their attitude as a \u201chyped up and ready to hunt.\u201d \u201cThey had flashlights going like crazy, shouting, yelling at each other, and I was like, \u2018What the heck is going on?\u2019 Then I realized they were going to Ray\u2019s house.\u201d It is unclear if Raymond Mattia was the person they were looking for; authorities made no allegations following the incident. The US Attorney\u2019s Office in Arizona has chosen not to press charges over the killing, prompting the Mattia family to launch a wrongful death lawsuit. But holding border agents to account has been\u00a0increasingly hard to do following\u00a0a 2022 Supreme Court ruling\u00a0that gave federal agents broad legal protection against claims of excessive force. \u201cI know they\u2019re here to protect the border: for the terrorists, the immigrants, the smugglers. But when they\u2019re coming to the reservation to shoot a Native American person who is at home, they should be accountable for that kind of action,\u201d Annette Mattia said. In a statement last year criticizing the US Attorney\u2019s decision not to prosecute, Jose linked Mattia\u2019s death to a larger failing of border management. \u201cThe US government\u2019s refusal to enact sensible border solutions has brought undue hardship to O\u2019odham and other border communities,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile politicians waste time debating walls and other ineffective and divisive ideas, our people are persecuted\u00a0and in this case, killed by federal agents.\u201d The chairman sees the federal approach toward the border as all too focused on maintaining an imaginary line and scoring political points, and expressed frustration\u00a0with the failure of Congress to find a bigger-picture, bipartisan solution\u00a0\u2013 something that in recent weeks has led the Biden administration to rely on executive orders instead. \u201cWhy would we want to protect a border? We want to protect the environment. We want to protect the people. We want to protect the communities around here,\u201d\u00a0Jose said. That\u2019s his mandate from Nation\u00a0elders, he said. What the US should do, he said, is focus on \u201ckicking its drug habit\u201d to shrink demand for smuggled narcotics, and widen sustainable immigration pathways for economic migrants that allow them to come, work and eventually leave. Still, as long as migrants keep coming here, so will Border Patrol \u2013 and the tribal government has been clear that it wants the federal agency to handle the immediate crisis. New buildings designed to serve as sleeping and living quarters for Border Patrol agents are currently being built on the reservation. Standing on the border halfway up a mountain, where the low posts that mark the border stop, and the rocks and dry shrubs flow seamlessly between the US and Mexico, Jose was clear on his own red line: While much is out of the Nation\u2019s\u00a0hands, he will resist any kind of border wall \u2013 a prospect that has haunted the nation since the Trump administration, and which looms again with the former President\u2019s reelection bid. From his view, the very first migrant surge started at Plymouth Rock. \u201cIf ever there was a time to build a wall,\u201d he said, \u201cit would have been 500 years ago.\u201d Edited by CNN\u2019s Rachel Clarke in Atlanta.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/americas/migration-us-mexico-border-tohono-oodham-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "style_greg-du-toit-photographer-south-africa-spc", "text": "Playing safe is not an option for wildlife photographer Greg du Toit. The South African has spent the past two decades photographing lions, rhinos and elephants, embracing more adventure and danger than most people will experience in a lifetime. Unlike many in his field, du Toit says he doesn\u2019t use bait, camera traps, digital manipulation, captive bred animals or drones. All he needs is his Nikon camera, a chance to get close to his subject, the right natural light, and a lot of patience. It\u2019s a combination that has won him international accolades, including Wildlife Photographer of the Year in 2013, and in April, the wildlife category at the Fine Art Photography Awards, for \u201cThe Enchanted Forest,\u201d a series showing elephants in a forest on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe. Speaking with CNN by phone, on the way to Tanzania for his next project, he shared his approach to fine art photography, what the past two decades have taught him and why taking pictures in Africa feels different to anywhere else in the world. The conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. CNN: What are the most important aspects to you when you\u2019re taking a picture in the wild? Greg\u202fdu Toit: I learned to photograph on film, so I like my work to resemble a moment that I experienced from behind my camera, sort of a moment in nature. So I never do multiple exposures. The fundamental thing remains the same as it always was since the very first time I picked up a camera, and that is light. I really like to work with beautiful quality light, golden or blue even sometimes. And then beyond that, sort of adding a touch of mood or a touch of mystery. CNN: How do you achieve mood in your pictures? Du Toit: I spend a lot of time in nature. I get up super early, for the good light, I stay up late and then, like for this Enchanted Forest series, I just found places in the forest that work right, where there was a beautiful window or there was a beautiful light coming through, and I just wait for an elephant to show up. So that portfolio, it\u2019s literally five photographs and it took me five years. From a business point of view, that makes absolutely no financial sense whatsoever, but I\u2019m just an artist. For me, it\u2019s all about just creating the art even if it comes at a great expense in terms of investing time. I do just love being out there as well, so it\u2019s not like a major sacrifice. CNN: In the age of social media, I\u2019d expect photographers to be constantly posting series after series instead of really taking their time\u2026 Du Toit: I had always focused on only quality. I used to get, like, six photos a year and I\u2019d be happy with that. Then social media came along and especially Instagram, and it was like, \u2018no, you need at least an image a day,\u2019 or more than that even, and I just couldn\u2019t do that. I kind of gave up on social media, which sort of felt like I was committing career suicide when I did that. But I\u2019m just sticking to my guns. I can\u2019t sort of adapt and just produce quantity because the way I work just does not allow for that. CNN: What are you hoping to convey with your wildlife photography Du Toit: I just want to tell people that it\u2019s not too late, especially here in Africa. We still have such incredible wildernesses, full of these amazing animals, and that\u2019s why when I photograph, I really try and focus on not just the animal itself, but on the environment in which that animal lives. That winning series of elephants is exactly that.\u202f There are still these incredibly wild places that are still full of incredible animals and it\u2019s not too late for us to enjoy them, to preserve and conserve them. CNN: You mainly focus on taking photographs in Africa. What would you say that makes wildlife photography in Africa different from other parts of the world? Du Toit: I\u2019ve been on trips and the other parts of the world are wonderful. For example, I\u2019ve been up to the Arctic to photograph polar bears, and I\u2019ve been to India for tigers and things like that. But every time I\u2019ve done that, I\u2019ve just\u202ffelt that those places lacked this energy that Africa has. It\u2019s like a wild energy \u2026 there\u2019s that feeling of mystery and intrigue, the feeling that this place is so big and so vast and a little bit dangerous, and I love that. Du Toit famously once spent 16 months photographing lions at a waterhole in Kenya\u2019s South Rift Valley. For the first 13 months he sat in a hole in the ground next to the water hole, followed by three months laying in the water, in an effort to get the perfect shot. CNN: When you took your iconic pictures of the lions, you were there sitting in the water for months, you caught malaria. Is there a kind of contradiction between the beauty of the end product, and the reality of the work that goes into getting the image? Du Toit: Yeah, the photographs you see are just polished and they just look beautiful, but the reality of getting those photographs is very different. Very often in these really wild places in Africa, you get gypsy flies and so you end up being bit by these flies and it\u2019s really painful, so between shots you\u2019re kind of swatting flies. It\u2019s hot and sweaty, so it\u2019s not glamorous work. Also, your cameras get dirty and [Africa] it\u2019s a very sort of dusty place. But I really just love the end product. Getting a good photograph is the sort of best thing I can do. It\u2019s the best feeling, and I really do just love nature. I\u2019d rather be there than anywhere else. CNN: One thing that many people don\u2019t realize is that, apart from the picture of the two lions, there is another one with a bunch of lions just standing there\u2026 Du Toit: That\u2019s right, there were others watching me. I sort of unpacked this in my book [\u201cWilderness Dreaming,\u201d published in 2022], but I\u2019d only thought about getting the shots, I didn\u2019t think beyond that. So when those two lionesses finish drinking, they just lay on the edge watching me and then it started to get dark. So I slowly started trying to move to the side of the waterhole (\u2026) I\u2019m moving, I\u2019m getting to the edge of the water. The water\u2019s getting shallower. So more and more of my body is becoming exposed and these lionesses are getting more and more interested\u2026 I\u2019m quite amazed I lived to tell the tale. Eventually I managed to get to the edge of the water hole, and I just jumped up and ran off. CNN\u202f: You don\u2019t use camera traps, digital manipulation or captive-bred animals. Why is that important to you? Du Toit: I want to photograph animals in their wild habitats, doing what they naturally do. For me, it\u2019s all about wildlife\u2026 It\u2019s all about the subject and the subject\u2019s environment, and then it\u2019s about light, and really using good quality light because that for me is what brings that kind of mystery, and then just working with good angles. I love good backgrounds as well. CNN: Do you have any particular tricks for capturing animals\u2019 natural behaviour without disturbing them? Du Toit: Wild animals know the shape of a human being and I don\u2019t want to scare or intimidate my subjects; I want them to just be doing what they would do naturally.\u202fSo I\u2019ve learned ways to conceal the human form, and one of the simplest ways is to photograph from a vehicle. I can spend 10, 12 hours a day in a car, so well over 50,000 hours a year in a car.\u202fThe other thing I do, which I did with the lions, I dug a hole in the ground, so you sit in the hole and then you have a roof over you, and then you photograph from there. CNN: What is your next photography project? Du Toit: I\u2019m trying to create a body of work and then go to Ngorongoro crater [in northeastern Tanzania] because it\u2019s one of those places in Africa that\u2019s glossed over. It\u2019s the most incredible place. It\u2019s an extinct volcano and it\u2019s nature\u2019s own game reserve. It\u2019s kind of like Jurassic Park. I\u2019m going to be spending a week there now, which is fun.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/greg-du-toit-photographer-south-africa-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_ukraine-moldova-eu-talks-intl", "text": "Formal negotiations between Ukraine and Moldova on joining the European Union begin on Tuesday, a landmark moment for the two former Soviet-bloc countries that marks the start of a long, drawn-out process. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X:\u00a0 \u201cCongratulations to Moldova and Ukraine on opening accession negotiations. This is very good news for the people of Ukraine, Moldova, and the entire European Union. The path ahead will be challenging but full of opportunities.\u201d The two nations first applied to join the EU in 2022, shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While the bloc has been broadly supportive of Ukraine and sent over $100 billion, according to EU figures, the path to joining the EU for either country will  be far from smooth. Hungary, Russia\u2019s main ally within the EU, has dragged its feet on a number of issues concerning Ukraine, including military and financial aid. In December of last year, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he would block Kyiv\u2019s bid to begin accession talks. He eventually dropped his objections, however, Orban will still have plenty of opportunities to frustrate Ukraine. The path to EU membership requires candidate to meet a set of criteria before entering into detailed chapters of negotiation \u2013 known as the chapters of the acquis \u2013 covering a range of issues, from economic standards to rule of law. There are 35 chapters in total, all of which must be agreed by all negotiating parties, including the 27 EU member states. The process of opening, negotiating and closing all 35 chapters is expected to take over a decade for both Moldova and Ukraine. Further to this, neither country has yet to meet the criteria to even reach this stage of the negotiations. Meeting the criteria is particularly complicated for Ukraine, as it is virtually impossible to meet the standards required while under invasion and at war. Moldova, too has domestic difficulties, with the self-declared Moldovan independent state of Transnistria seeking alliance with Russia while the rest of the country turns to Europe. Transnistria is internationally still recognized as part of Moldova, but it is not implausible that some will see this as a reason the country cannot join the EU while the matter is unresolved. Practical and technical negations aside, there is also a political dimension to this that is likely to complicate negations. Expanding the bloc to the east of Europe will have consequences for the rest of the EU member states. It is likely both Ukraine and Moldova will be net recipients of the EU budget. That makes it a harder sell for all the existing EU nations, as their spending will go up and their overall share of the budget will fall. There will also be implications for industry. Ukraine, for example, has already run into trouble with European partners over its agricultural industry. Poland, one of the most consistent supporters of Ukraine in its war effort, temporarily banned Ukraine from exporting grain into the country because it was harming Polish farmers. The spat escalated, with Poland suspending its military support for Ukraine. Perhaps more importantly, accepting Ukraine and Moldova to the bloc would mean adding around 40 million new EU citizens from Eastern Europe. This means giving freedom of movement within the bloc to many people who might want to escape what has recently been a war zone. It would also shift the balance of power within the EU further to the east. While there are no hard and fast rules about which member states align on which issues, it is broadly reasonable to say that the eastern countries have different political views to southern and Western European countries. That could mean some existing EU member states will slow down and frustrate the process unless certain safeguards are put in place protecting their own privileged positions within the bloc. The start of negotiations is a big moment for those hoping to join the bloc to they can move further away from Russian influence and into the EU yolk. But in reality, these opening talks are mostly symbolic and there is still a long way to go before either country becomes a full member state.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/ukraine-moldova-eu-talks-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_europe_ukraine-russia-power-blackouts-spring-intl", "text": "Kateryna Serzhan says the only way to survive Ukraine\u2019s almost daily blackout schedule is to \u201calways have a plan B.\u201d The 35-year-old\u00a0has had to adapt to life in her high-rise Kyiv apartment block with her active 3-year-old daughter, Varia. Going out to play involves hiking back up 15 flights of stairs carrying her now 17 kg (37 lb) child. They tend to take a ball instead of a bicycle for those days, she jokes. Without power, there\u2019s no water, so she has to schedule her child\u2019s baths around the blackouts. But sometimes they occur outside of the scheduled times. Keen to provide hot meals each day to a toddler who doesn\u2019t always eat them, she now has a gas camping stove in her kitchen, and a small battery to power the microwave. Serzhan\u2019s resilience masks a deepening crisis in Ukraine. These are not the first rolling blackouts since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, but they are the first to happen in the spring and early summer \u2013 traditionally the months with lowest electricity demand before air-conditioning season kicks in \u2013 underscoring the scale of the supply problem. In the early hours of Thursday morning, Ukraine endured the seventh massive Russian attack on its energy facilities since March 22 this year. Ukrenergo, the state-owned grid operator, reported damage in four regions. Seven energy workers were injured, and previously scheduled power outages extended. On Saturday, \u201cmassive\u201d Russian missile attacks hit several Ukrainian energy facilities, leaving thousands without power, officials said. In the Zaporizhzhia region, two power engineers were injured and the energy facility was damaged overnight, according to Ivan Fedorov, the head of Zaporizhzhia\u2019s regional military administration. Ukraine\u2019s energy grid has been firmly in the crosshairs of Russian missiles since the war began but this year Moscow began specifically targeting power generation facilities \u2013 thermal power plants, hydroelectric power stations, even energy storage facilities \u2013 a marked shift in tactics from the previous winter, when the attacks were less precise, and the damage easier to repair. Experts say Russia has been using better weaponry and taking advantage of thin Ukrainian air defenses. At Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction conference in Berlin in mid-June, President Volodymyr Zelensky laid out the scale of the destruction from the first six attacks. \u201cRussian missile and drone strikes have already destroyed 9 GW of capacity, while the peak energy consumption in Ukraine last winter was 18 GW. So, half of it does not exist anymore,\u201d he said. Officials and energy executives are now acknowledging there is no way to avoid blackouts this winter. The mission now is simply to minimize them. \u201cIf we don\u2019t restore the existing the damaged plants, if we don\u2019t improve the interconnector capacity for input, if we don\u2019t build these distributed generators, at least in some places\u2026 then people will have power for less than four hours per day,\u201d says Dmytro Sakharuk, executive director of DTEK, Ukraine\u2019s largest private energy company. \u201cWe have 120 days left before the start of the heating season,\u201d he warns. \u201cIt cannot be business as usual.\u201d Ukraine is trying to tackle the problem in a variety of ways.\u00a0As well as rebuilding what they can, in some cases using parts from decommissioned power plants in Europe, officials and energy companies are trying to secure as many generators and gas turbines as possible to support critical infrastructure through the winter, and are working with European partners to increase imports of electricity. Before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine was a net exporter of electricity, and had even been able to resume some exports during wartime.\u00a0That stopped in March. \u201cWe are doing our best,\u201d Deputy Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk told CNN. \u201cWe understand that without energy it will be very difficult to survive.\u201d When supply-side efforts fall short, all that\u2019s left is to reduce demand. And that means asking for even more sacrifice from the already blackout-weary Ukrainian people. \u201cWe asked our people\u2026 to be ready to understand the situation, to support Ukraine, to support our energy workers,\u201d says Grynchuk. \u201cWe call it the second front line, energy.\u201d At the end of April, a few weeks after a Russian attack destroyed the Kyiv region\u2019s biggest power plant, Andrii Buzovskyi, a 52-year-old Kyiv police officer, spent about $1,400 on two solar panels for his balcony. \u201cI installed them so that my family would not feel uncomfortable when there is no electricity,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWhat will happen next is unknown.\u201d The government would like to see more of this. Ukraine\u2019s Prime Minister Denis Shmyhal just announced new grants to help housing cooperatives invest in solar panels and heat pumps. Ukraine\u2019s central bank is also working to make loans for households and businesses to buy energy-related equipment more affordable. In her Kyiv high-rise, Serzhan is pursuing a different kind of energy independence. She is so worried about braving freezing temperatures in her apartment this winter, she\u2019s looking to rent a small house outside Kyiv with a wood-burning stove. \u201cIt\u2019s like the 19th century,\u201d she admits. Companies are doing their part. Ukrainian Railways has revised the schedule for 74 suburban trains (about 7% of the total), temporarily suspending some services.\u00a0The company told CNN it\u2019s also halted the use of air conditioning in administrative buildings, and turned off outdoor lighting. The chief executive of supermarket chain Auchan Ukraine, Marta Trush, told CNN that while all its stores are already equipped with generators, it has modernized its refrigerators to save energy and reduced its range of products with short sell-by dates.\u00a0Some of that has the added incentive of mitigating soaring costs. \u201cThe operation of the entire network on diesel generators is about three times more expensive than from the central power grid,\u201d said Trush. \u201cSo, to save electricity in the sales areas, we reduce lighting and temporarily restrict access to refrigerators, but we see how customers are understanding of the forced measures.\u201d Power outages have a clear inflationary effect, said Igor Piddubnyi, a researcher at the Kyiv School of Economics. \u201cCompanies have to have to somehow get back-up power supply and they are\u2026 buying the diesel generators, solar panels, etcetera\u2026and it increases the cost of production,\u201d he told CNN. Ukraine\u2019s inability to export electricity also upsets its balance of trade, he says, which feeds into inflation. The National Bank of Ukraine estimated in May that economic growth will slow to 3% this year, from 5.3% in 2023, mostly because of the damage to the energy sector. Inflation is expected to rise slightly to 8.2%. And while Russia is experiencing a wartime uplift for its labor force, with unemployment at record lows, Piddubnyi said evidence shows power outages are forcing Ukrainian companies to lay off workers. The central bank still expects unemployment to fall this year, but only to 14% from the current level of 15%. It is painful situation, said Piddubnyi. \u201cUkraine really loses a lot, but also the problem is that Russia is still gathering huge profits from exporting oil and gas.\u201d The Kyiv School of Economics estimated last month that rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s damaged energy infrastructure would cost $50.5 billion, factoring in new measures to improve its resilience against further attacks. That\u2019s the equivalent of the entire hard-won loan backed by the profits of frozen Russia assets Ukraine was recently promised, but it may not see that money for months.\u00a0 The G7, having already spent $3bn to date to support Ukraine\u2019s energy sector, just announced another $1bn in funding in early June. And Piddubnyi points out that calculating the true cost of rebuilding, while attacks continue, is impossible. \u201cThere is a clear uncertainty of how many more power plants will be destroyed by Russians,\u201d he said. Ukraine\u2019s energy ministry says it has been building concrete shelters to protect some energy equipment from attacks. But more advanced air defense systems are the only way to protect entire power plants and prevent the reconstruction bill from spiraling higher. In the wake of Thursday\u2019s attack, Kyiv\u2019s intensive lobbying efforts finally looked to be paying off. Romania agreed, after months of deliberation, to send a Patriot air defense system to Ukraine.\u00a0And a senior White House official told CNN that Ukraine was being given top priority for US shipments of advanced air defense capabilities, ahead of some other countries.\u00a0Those deliveries should start this summer. Sakharuk, who spoke to CNN before the seventh wave of strikes on energy facilities on June 20, said he would like to see deliveries of air defense munitions specifically to protect energy facilities. He admits keeping up morale among employees is a major challenge.\u00a0\u201cThey see that they are in a type of cycle where they repair an energy facility and Russia finds out that it\u2019s being repaired, and (it is) again destroyed.\u201d \u201cIn some cases, the workers did this three to four times already.\u201d CNN\u2019s Clare Sebastian wrote and reported from London, and Olga Voitovych reported from Kyiv.

{"id": "travel_american-comedian-prefers-living-in-estonia", "text": "He hadn\u2019t traveled any further than Canada before he was 20, but Stewart Johnson says he knew from early on that he \u201cdidn\u2019t really want to live in the States.\u201d The stand-up comedian, originally from Wisconsin, explains that he felt as though he\u2019d \u201calready seen\u201d America, and was keen to explore more of the world as quickly as he could. \u201cI wanted to see new stuff,\u201d Johnson tells CNN Travel. \u201cAnd apart from geography, there\u2019s not really that much unique about the States if you\u2019ve already grown up there.\u201d While he could never have predicted where he\u2019d end up living, Johnson has a vivid memory of watching Estonia, once part of the Soviet Union, declare formal independence back in 1991. Early travel dreams \u201cA friend said, \u2018Where in the world is this?\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. \u201cHe (his friend) goes, \u2018How the hell do you know that?\u2019\u201d A few years later, Johnson happened to find himself working with an Estonian at a summer camp in the US and the pair formed a firm friendship. In 1996, Johnson traveled to Europe to study and his summer camp friend invited him to Estonia the following year. \u201cI just took an overnight train to Estonia,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd all of my German friends at the time said, \u2018Don\u2019t go, you\u2019re not going to come back.\u2019 And they were right.\u201d Johnson explains that his friends were worried that he\u2019d \u201cbe kidnapped or murdered or something\u201d \u2013 organized crime was a problem in the Northern European \u00a0country between the 1990s and 2000s. \u201cI eventually didn\u2019t come back because I liked it,\u201d adds Johnson. \u201cThat\u2019s the irony of it.\u201d Johnson felt an affinity with Estonians from the get go, explaining that he found their honesty wonderfully refreshing. \u201cThe thing that I really liked about Estonians, and Estonians have never believed me when I say this, but I liked how friendly they were,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause Estonians consider themselves to be very closed and cold people. But I actually kind of liked that. And I liked the honesty that Estonians have.\u201d After spending a week in the country, Johnson returned to the US to finish his studies with the aim of entering the Foreign Service. However, he decided to head back to Estonia \u201cto get to know the place a little bit better\u201d instead. In 1998, Johnson arrived back in the country with just \u201ctwo suitcases and a book bag\u201d and ended up staying for good. Building a life \u201cI just kind of started building a life here,\u201d he says. Johnson initially lived in Tartu, the country\u2019s second largest city, and says he settled in very quickly. Reflecting on his first years in Estonia, Johnson notes that things were very different to how they are now. \u201cThe place was pretty poor back then,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was hard to find things like chicken breasts or minced meat. \u201cYou could only get minced pork \u2013 and even that was frozen. So cooking was a bit of a challenge. But I enjoyed it. I\u2019ve never been one to shy from a challenge.\u201d Although he didn\u2019t speak the language at all, Johnson says he was able to pick it up by watching American TV shows and reading the Estonian subtitles. \u201cQuite often, people don\u2019t really believe that that\u2019s possible,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause Estonian is considered one of the, if not the most difficult language for native English speakers to learn. \u201cBut that also explains why I have a funny accent. Because I learned by reading, not by speaking.\u201d Johnson initially arrived in Estonia on \u201ca regular tourist visa\u201d before acquiring a student visa. He went on to marry an Estonian and his two children, ages 16 and 19, were born in the country. \u201cI have a family here,\u201d he says, before explaining that he became a permanent resident after his marriage. \u201cThat\u2019s mainly why I\u2019ve stuck around.\u201d Johnson, who is now divorced, says he\u2019s thankful that his children grew up in Estonia as he feels that there\u2019s \u201ca lot less bullying than in the States.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t really have team sports at schools here like they do in the States,\u201d adds Johnson. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have the problem of jocks and cheerleaders, and things like that. People seem to be much more supportive of each other.\u201d Comedy career In 2010, Johnson co-founded a comedy group, Comedy Estonia, and began touring the country as a stand up comedian. \u201cMy very first joke, I told them that I forgot my first two jokes,\u201d he recounts. \u201cAnd I was telling the truth\u2026 I just froze when I got up there.\u201d \u201cThey thought it was hilarious and started clapping. And then I actually did remember my jokes, and it was a smashing huge success.\u201d While he\u2019s no longer a part of the group, Johnson holds private comedy shows occasionally, and has also made a film \u201cThe Chuck Band Show,\u201d which is loosely based on his story. Johnson, who was diagnosed with testicular cancer a few years ago, says that his experiences with the country\u2019s health care system, which is based on compulsory solidarity-based health insurance, helped to inspire the movie. \u201cMy final bill for three months of treatment and 15 or 16 days in the hospital getting chemo was 5 euros,\u201d he says \u2013 little more than $5. \u201cAnd it would probably have been half a million dollars had I been in the States.\u201d When it comes to the general cost of living in Estonia, Johnson says he\u2019s noticed a significant increase in recent years, particularly with regards to property prices and groceries. \u201cI would say that the cost of living has become higher in Estonia,\u201d he says, noting that property prices are \u201cbasically the same price as American properties,\u201d but salaries are \u201cso much lower.\u201d \u201cEspecially with the inflation of the last few years. But that\u2019s offset, because if you live in the city, you don\u2019t need a car. You can take free public transport for city residents \u2013 it\u2019s all free.\u201d Johnson returns to the US \u201cevery few years\u201d and admits to being disappointed by how \u201ccommercial\u201d things have become. \u201cEverywhere you go, it\u2019s buy two and get one free,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you have to have some membership card, or just some crap that you just don\u2019t want to have to deal with. \u201cAnd every time I go to a shop, they want to know my zip code. Even if I\u2019m paying in cash. And I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t live in the States.\u2019\u201d After spending so many years living outside of the US, Johnson says he\u2019s noticed a difference in the way people respond to each other over there. \u201cPeople are really uptight in the States these days,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that when I lived there in the \u201990s. \u201cPeople were just relaxed, but now they\u2019re all up in arms. They will confront you in a shop if they don\u2019t like something that you\u2019re doing.\u201d Temperate climate Although his day to day life may be very different in Estonia, Johnson feels that things aren\u2019t very different scenery wise. \u201cIt looks exactly the same as Wisconsin,\u201d says Johnson, who has also released a book, \u201cTales from Estonia,\u201d about his experiences in the country. \u201cExcept they have a few more swamps and bogs here. \u201cIt\u2019s flat on one side of the country and hilly and forested on the other, just like my home state.\u201d However, he stresses that Estonia is \u201cnot nearly as cold as Wisconsin.\u201d \u201cNow things are getting even warmer,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe have very little snow that stays in the winter now. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of ice. Because of climate change, most people are really complaining about the winters here. \u201cBecause this far north, we only get six hours of sunlight on the shortest day of the year. And the sun is never really that high above the horizon.\u201d Johnson explains that things are the \u201cexact opposite\u201d during summer time. \u201cYou get six hours of sundown, but it never really gets completely dark,\u201d he says, adding that you can \u201calways see a purple sunset color throughout half of the sky.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always loved it. I never get tired of that.\u201d When asked what advice he\u2019d give to Americans hoping to move to a country like Estonia, Johnson jokes that they should just \u201cstay in America.\u201d \u201cThere are too many of us who have already left,\u201d he quips. \u201cWe don\u2019t need more Yankees outside of that country.\u201d On a more serious note, Johnson suggests that Americans relocating to another country should try not to \u201ccluster with other Americans.\u201d \u201cJust integrate, let it happen,\u201d he says. \u201cNot everything is going to be the same. Just take your finger out and relax, enjoy the new culture. \u201cYour country is not going to change because one person has left it. It\u2019s not that you have to maintain your culture. \u201cJust learn something new. You\u2019re not going to regret it.\u201d One of the things Johnson loves most about living in Estonia is its modernity \u2013 Estonia was the first country where the parliament was elected online, and he\u2019s been hugely impressed by its transformation during the 25 or so years since he moved there. \u201cEvery year something new gets built, or there\u2019s a new system,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve always learned is that, if Estonians decide to do something, they do it. \u201cAnd they decided to become a very modern country\u2026\u00a0 Really, it\u2019s been the experience of a lifetime, being able to watch this kind of transformation over a quarter of a century.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/american-comedian-prefers-living-in-estonia/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_ammo-arrests-turks-and-caicos", "text": "Five Americans have been arrested in Turks and Caicos over the past six months under gun control laws that make bringing firearms or ammunition into the territory without prior permission from police a crime. Michael Lee Evans, of Texas; Sharitta Grier, of Florida; Bryan Hagerich, of Pennsylvania; Ryan Tyler Watson, of Oklahoma; and Tyler Wenrich, of Virginia, were all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to Turks and Caicos, a 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. All have said the ammunition recovered from their luggage was not intentionally packed, according to American lawmakers who went to the British Overseas Territory in May as part of efforts to petition for their expedited release. Though the infractions had carried a mandatory 12-year prison sentence and fine \u2013 with reductions only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d \u2013 a mid-June revision clarified courts may impose a fine, a custodial sentence or both in exceptional circumstances, a member of the territory\u2019s House of Assembly said June 14. Four Americans arrested under the law have pleaded guilty, been sentenced and returned to the US, while the last is due in court next week. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the laws in Turks and Caicos and the affected Americans: No constitutional right to carry firearms in Turks and Caicos Though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased \u2013 and that\u2019s a worry, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said. While it is legal to fly in the US with unloaded firearms and ammunition in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration, bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d The mandatory sentence was in place to protect those on the islands, Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. Judges could use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d she said. But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said: \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly.\u201d Even so, the \u201camendment was introduced to address concerns about the rigidity of the previous sentencing framework, which mandated both imprisonment and financial penalties for all firearms offenses, regardless of the specific context or severity,\u201d House of Assembly member\u00a0Edwin\u00a0Astwood said in a statement. \u201cThis often resulted in disproportionately harsh sentences that did not always fit the nature of the crime or the circumstances of the offender.\u201d US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials have said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick has said, and none got a 12-year sentence. While Turks and Caicos collaborates with the US in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d Bryan Hagerich Hagerich was the first of the five to return to the United States after he received a suspended 52-week sentence in late May, which meant he didn\u2019t face immediate incarceration, his representatives said. He was also given a $6,700 fine. The father of two pleaded guilty to possession of 20 rounds of ammunition, according to the Turks and Caicos government.  Hagerich paid the fine and was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory. He got home May 24, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign, a group that helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. Arriving at Pittsburgh International Airport, Hagerich told reporters he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d to have his two children jump into his arms, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WTAE. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Hagerich said. \u201cA lot of memories to make together. Just so elated to see them. They\u2019ve been so strong through all this.\u201d Before Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, his wife had packed two suitcases \u2013 one if he was sentenced to prison and another if he were allowed to return home \u2013 they said in an exclusive interview with \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cIt was dark; you have no concept of time,\u201d Hagerich said about his week-long stay in jail in Turks and Caicos. \u201cI was with three folks that were accused of murder. It was scary.\u201d Tyler Wenrich Wenrich pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. He was sentenced May 28 to three weeks time-served in jail and fined $9,000, said Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, a Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands spokesperson said that day in a statement. He returned home to Virginia on May 30. The Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case, saying, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Wenrich was charged with possession of two 9 mm rounds, according to the Turks and Caicos government. Michael Lee Evans Evans pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9 mm rounds of ammunition and appeared before the court on April 24 via video conference. He was allowed to return to the United States on bail due to a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation and to attend his June sentencing hearing virtually, said his attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel. Evans got a suspended 33-month sentence, and his attorney believes it is unlikely he will have to serve time in jail. \u201cIf he has no problems in (Turks and Caicos) within 12 months, he will not have to do any time,\u201d Smith told CNN on June 24. Ryan Tyler Watson Watson was visiting Turks and Caicos with his wife in April to celebrate several friends\u2019 40th birthdays when he was charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition. He plead guilty in May. The first of the Americans to be sentenced under the amended firearms law, he got a suspended 13-week sentence and a $2,000 fine, or $500 per bullet, a spokesperson for the Turks and Caicos Islands Supreme Court told CNN on June 21. Watson soon returned home and reunited with his family, US Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said on X. Sharitta Shinese Grier Grier was\u00a0arrested in mid-May and is awaiting trial after making bail, Tynes said\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. The Florida mother had no idea two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, she told CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen because I couldn\u2019t believe it was in there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey went through my bag and said they found rounds at the bottom of my carry-on.\u201d Grier was released on bail but can\u2019t leave the island until her case concludes and must report to a local police station weekly, the station reported. \u201cI\u2019m just broken,\u201d Grier said. Grier\u2019s next court appearance is July 5, police said. US lawmakers tried to free Americans The Americans\u2019 arrest has stoked tension between US officials and their counterparts just a few hundred miles away. A request by a US congressional delegation to the islands in May for charges against the five Americas to be dropped did not yield the desired result. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today,\u201d Republican US Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said May 20 in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now, (where) every third week an American is being detained wrongfully (in) Turks and Caicos,\u201d Republican US Rep.\u00a0Guy Reschenthaler told ABC News the same week. Meanwhile, the prison on Turks and Caicos has been flagged by the United Nations for humanitarian concerns, Reschenthaler told CNN. In a House of Assembly address, the islands\u2019 Misick said, \u201cThe (accusations) of congressman (Reschenthaler) against the government and people of the Turks and Caicos Islands are nothing more than diabolic falsehoods.\u201d Reschenthaler wanted to see a \u201cresolution here where the Americans get zero amount of jail time. They should be given time served and be sent home to the United States,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on May 20. \u201cThey were innocent mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny other nation would handle this with a fine in sending that person back to the country of origin. Here, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d On May 28, Mullin welcomed the news of Wenrich\u2019s release, calling it \u201canother step in the right direction,\u201d according to a post on X. \u201cI again encourage TCI to address the unintended consequences of their law to prevent this from happening again.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_20_africa_kenya-anti-tax-protests-intl", "text": "Violent clashes between police and protestors have broken out in Nairobi,\u00a0Kenya\u00a0on Thursday as a government vote on a controversial finance bill gets underway. A CNN team on the ground witnessed chaotic scenes as protestors were tear gassed by police, with one journalist left bloodied after being directly hit with a canister. Parliament has been sealed off since Thursday morning with roads around it blocked as lawmakers debate the Finance Bill inside. Anger continues over proposed tax hikes in the East African nation that has struggled with rising living costs. Police are breaking up peaceful protesters with tear gas and water cannons around the city center in Nairobi. CNN has met protesters as young as 18 who say they\u2019re fighting for\u00a0their\u00a0future. \u201cPresident Ruto, look at the tears of the Children of the country of\u00a0Kenya. Look at the tears of the women in the country of\u00a0Kenya,\u201d one young man told CNN\u2019s Larry Madowo. The government has faced backlash and protests since Tuesday over the controversial bill and was forced to amend it after dozens of demonstrators rallied outside the country\u2019s parliament building. Among the taxes suspended was a 16% value-added tax on bread and a 2.5% tax on motor vehicles, a\u00a0statement\u00a0from\u00a0Kenya\u2019s presidency said. A proposed increase in mobile money transfer fees was also shelved along with taxes on vegetable oil. Additionally, levies on locally produced products, such as diapers and sanitary towels, have been dropped. But the changes have failed to satisfy protesters who have called for the bill to be scrapped completely. Mass arrests were recorded in Nairobi earlier on Tuesday with at least 283 people, including journalists covering the protests detained by police, civil society groups said. Young Kenyans or GenZs, say they are fighting for their future and are using social media platforms such as TikTok to amplify their message. The app, known for its short, engaging videos, has morphed from its role as an entertainment hub into one for social and political activism.

{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_europe-election-youth-far-right-intl-cmd", "text": "Pollsters were surprised by the burst of populism in 2016, but many now think they shouldn\u2019t have been. In the United States and United Kingdom, swaths of voters in deprived regions \u2013 places \u201cleft behind\u201d by globalization \u2013 were given the chance to stick it to the system, and they took it. Why was anyone surprised? Pollsters have now been surprised by another trend. In this month\u2019s European Parliament elections, far-right parties performed predictably well \u2013 but especially, and unexpectedly, among young people. A few years ago, \u201cGeneration Climate\u201d \u2013 thought to be unquestionably liberal and progressive \u2013 were voting mostly green. But now, their vote has helped far-right parties capture one in four seats in Brussels. What happened? Perhaps the \u201cleft behind\u201d is not only a geographical phenomenon, but generational. Gen-Z - those born between 1995 and 2012 - has been baptized in crises: first the financial, then the eurozone, then of the pandemic and now of war in Europe. More and more young people believe they will have harder lives than their parents. Why should a left-behind generation be less vulnerable to the lure of populism than left-behind places? Roberto Foa, co-director of the Centre for the Future of Democracy at the University of Cambridge, a leading researcher of youth dissatisfaction with democracy, sees \u201ctwo big divides\u201d in Western societies: \u201cThe wealth divide between economically successful and left-behind regions, and the intergenerational divide in life opportunities.\u201d Political scientists may have overlooked both cohorts because they have long been disconnected. But now their apathy is turning into antipathy \u2013 a desire, once more, to stick it to the system. \u201cIf you are a political entrepreneur who is seeking to break the established party system, those are your options, in terms of mobilizing fresh support,\u201d Foa told CNN. The trend, he says, has been a long time coming: \u201cI\u2019m surprised that people are surprised.\u201d Youth support for far-right parties is being felt in several European countries. In Germany, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), won 16% of the under-25 vote in the EU elections \u2013 tripling its share in that demographic from the previous vote in 2019. Among French voters under 34, the National Rally (RN) was the most popular party, with 32% of the vote \u2013 a 10-point rise compared to 2019. In Poland, 30% of under-30 voters supported the far-right Confederation party, up from 18.5% in 2019. Far-right parties enjoyed a similar uptick in support in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Austria, and continued to do well in Italy. How alarmed \u2013 and surprised \u2013 should mainstream parties be? Generation, not geography Consider these policy proposals. Young people will pay no income tax. If they start a business, they will be exempt from corporation tax for five years. Students working part-time will have their wages topped up by the state, which will also build 100,000 units of student housing. They can also travel by train for free. You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking this must be the platform of the far left. But no: This was RN doyenne Marine Le Pen\u2019s offer in the 2022 French presidential election, which she narrowly lost. Young people, unsurprisingly, loved it. Just under 50% of 25-to-34-year-olds who cast a vote opted for Le Pen, compared to just 41% of the general population and 29% of voters over 70. Whereas the \u201cgray vote\u201d took Donald Trump to the White House and Britain from the EU, it kept the French far right at bay. That may soon change. After his Renaissance party was trounced by the far-right in the EU elections, President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election, which could result in Jordan Bardella, the RN\u2019s 28-year-old leader, becoming France\u2019s prime minister next month. For Arthur Prevot, manager of the RN\u2019s youth wing in Paris, this is great news. Macron\u2019s presidency has failed to deliver for young people, he says. \u201cPurchasing power has decreased incredibly over the past seven years. Between the \u2018gilets jaunes\u2019 crisis, the rise in fuel prices, and all the different taxes that have been introduced \u2013 all of this impacts daily life, including mine,\u201d Prevot, 22, told CNN. His economic concerns prompted him to join the party which may soon govern France, although Macron will remain president. Jonathan Verbeken, a deputy RN candidate in Paris\u2019 15th district, said the main reason he joined the party was because, \u201cwe see people suffering daily, struggling to make ends meet. We see a deplorable situation in France, specifically with security and immigration. We want to react to that.\u201d To many older voters, the RN remains a terrifying prospect. Despite its years-long effort to \u201cnormalize,\u201d previous generations remember its antisemitic, neofascist origins. But young voters appear less concerned by these roots, says Simon Schnetzer, author of a recent survey of Germany\u2019s youth. \u201cYoung people are first-time voters. They are a blank sheet. What drives their decisions most is: Who can offer me something that best fits my needs?\u201d he told CNN. The lack of historical baggage, coupled with the strange death of center-left parties in many parts of Europe, has allowed the far right to appear respectable and armed with economic solutions to young people\u2019s problems. Sarah-Lee Heinrichs, a 23-year-old politician for the German Green Party, said economic concerns have become far more prevalent among young people since the last European Parliament elections in 2019, when the Greens became the second largest party in Germany for the first time. In the wake of the pandemic, the full-scale war in Ukraine and the return of soaring inflation, environmentalism is no longer young people\u2019s priority, she says. \u201cIf governments don\u2019t provide social security \u2013 good jobs and a place to live that doesn\u2019t cost more than 50% of your income every month \u2013 then the far-right will rise,\u201d Heinrichs told CNN. And with economic insecurity is coming fiercer opposition to immigration, nearly a decade after the continent \u2013 and especially Germany - welcomed a record number of refugees fleeing war in Syria. An alarming new trend began last month, after a short clip filmed on the German vacation island of Sylt was posted on X. In the video, well-dressed German youths belt out \u201cAusl\u00e4nder Raus!\u201d (\u201cforeigners out!\u201d) and \u201cDeutschland den Deutschen!\u201d (\u201cGermany for Germans!\u201d) over a 1999 Eurodance beat. The chant has since swirled across the country, currently hosting the European soccer championships. Its appeal is not confined to Germans. As Italy played Spain last week, fans in the stadium could be heard giving their own rendition. Swiping right If that\u2019s the \u201cdemand\u201d side, what about the supply? After her center-right bloc secured the most seats in the European Parliament, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen took to the stage in Brussels to give a victory speech. But her tone was more somber than victorious. She spoke of the importance of defending European values: integration, democracy and the rule of law. How do these abstract values sound to young voters? \u201cYoung people will double check, does that help me with any of my needs? Does it entertain me? Does it give me security? Is it fun? And if it\u2019s none of that, it\u2019s boring,\u201d said Schnetzer. \u201cIf you have this TikTok logic, you\u2019ll quickly swipe further.\u201d While Europe\u2019s mainstream gives grave speeches, the far right is developing vast followings on social media platform TikTok. The RN\u2019s clean-shaven Bardella posts videos of himself wine tasting and doing shots. Maximilian Krah, the AfD\u2019s lead candidate going into\u00a0the EU elections, offers his followers dating advice: \u201cDon\u2019t watch porn, don\u2019t vote for the Greens.\u201d In one TikTok, Nigel Farage \u2013 often described as the \u201carchitect\u201d of Brexit \u2013 approaches a fruit store, says \u201clovely melons,\u201d raises his eyebrows and walks off. The clip has been viewed 2.5 million times. Farage seems aware of this burgeoning market and keen to exploit it. In a recent interview, he praised misogynist online influencer Andrew Tate for being an \u201cimportant voice\u201d for \u201cemasculated\u201d young boys. Tate \u2013 who has racked up billions of views on TikTok \u2013 is facing charges in Romania of human trafficking and rape, which he denies. But those who have puzzled over Tate\u2019s appeal to young men should not be surprised that politicians making jokes about breasts enjoy similar success. The distinction between politicians and entertainment has long grown fuzzy \u2013 but for today\u2019s young, they no longer even exist in separate spaces. Just one swipe separates the voice of a figure like Tate and the voice of a politician. We shouldn\u2019t be surprised if here is where ideas are shaped. Thrill of the new It is not yet clear how deeply these far-right sympathies are held. In a trend especially pronounced among young people, voters are increasingly \u201cnot loyal to any particular party or platform,\u201d says Foa. \u201cThey\u2019re very volatile between one election and the next.\u201d Just as young voters campaigned vociferously for green parties in 2019, their allegiances could switch again. The appeal of the far right may also be dampened if its politicians begin to govern. Out of office, the far right is unable to break promises, while it can point endlessly to the mainstream\u2019s inability to deliver. Once in government, it will prove just as disappointing. That, at least, appears to be\u00a0Macron\u2019s theory. But the burst in support for far-right parties could spell a darker trend. In his studies of youth dissatisfaction with democracy, Foa noted a growing penchant for authoritarianism. Lacking a personal memory of life under authoritarian rule or the struggle to achieve democracy, young people are less enamored with the system than previous generations. This success of far-right parties should be a warning to Europe\u2019s mainstream. To Churchill\u2019s famous quote, \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others,\u201d we should not be surprised if young people ask in reply: \u201cReally?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/europe-election-youth-far-right-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_israel-orthodox-military-high-court-intl", "text": "Israel\u2019s Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered the government to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military, delivering a blow to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that has the potential to unravel his ruling coalition. The court also ordered the government to withdraw funding from any religious schools, or yeshivas, whose students do not comply with draft notices. \u201cThe government wanted to distinguish at the level of law enforcement between individuals based on their group affiliation,\u201d the court said in its ruling. \u201cIt was determined that by doing so, the government seriously harmed the rule of law and the principle according to which all individuals are equal before the law.\u201d Ultra-Orthodox (or Haredi) Jews have, for all intents and purposes, been exempt from national mandatory military service since Israel\u2019s founding (Palestinian citizens of Israel are also exempt.) Ultra-Orthodox men spend much of their early lives out of the workforce, entirely devoted to religious study. They view yeshivas as fundamental to the preservation of Judaism, as important to Israel\u2019s defense as the military. Most Israelis believe ultra-Orthodox men should serve in the military, according to recent polls, but Haredi parties have been staunchly opposed to efforts to rescind the draft exemption. Netanyahu\u2019s fragile government coalition relies on two Haredi parties \u2013 United Torah Judaism and Shas \u2013 to govern. He has for weeks been trying to advance legislation through Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset, that would enshrine in law a draft exemption for Haredi men. The decision comes at a critical time for a country at war for nearly nine months, and a prime minister whose far-right government lost its veneer of wartime solidarity earlier this month when Benny Gantz, an opposition leader, left Netanyahu\u2019s war cabinet. And although Israel\u2019s military chiefs publicly decry manpower shortfalls, this ruling is unlikely to result in large numbers of ultra-Orthodox men joining ranks anytime soon. \u201cThe Supreme Court ruling puts an end to 76 years of unlawful inequality and discrimination,\u201d Eliad Shraga, chair of the Movement for Quality Government in Israel \u2013 the main petitioner in the case \u2013 said in a statement. \u201cWe will no longer agree to the absurd situation where there are those who give to the state, contribute and even risk their lives, and there are those who do nothing.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s party, Likud, said in a statement reacting to the ruling that that legislation remained \u201cthe real solution to the conscription problem,\u201d and \u201cnot a High Court ruling.\u201d Aryeh Deri, leader of the Shas party, decried the ruling. \u201cEven here, in the Jewish state, alongside our precious fighters who sacrifice their lives against the enemies, we will continue to guard those who learn the Torah, which preserves our special power and creates miracles in battle,\u201d he said, according to the Ynet news site. \u201cWhoever tried to disconnect the people of Israel from the Torah in the past failed miserably.\u201d Nonetheless, Moshe Roth, a member of Knesset from the United Torah Judaism party, on Tuesday downplayed the ruling. \u201cNothing is going to change practically,\u201d Roth told CNN. \u201cMany see this as kind of muscle flexing.\u201d Although the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is now legally obliged to draft Haredi men, military leaders say they are not prepared to do so en masse. Ultra-Orthodox men, who already serve in some small numbers in the military, have particular religious requirements, and so they usually serve in special units. \u201cAccording to the calculations of the army, there were 1,800 that were conscripted last year,\u201d Gilad Malach, director of the Ultra-Orthodox in Israel program at the Israel Democracy Institute, said after the ruling. \u201cThe army needs to do some change in order to conscript them. According to the army, next year the army can receive 4,800.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that the Supreme Court says that, immediately, there is one legislation connected to conscription of the ultra-Orthodox society, and it is the regular conscription law,\u201d Malach added. \u201cWe are in a very, very problematic political situation for the (governing) coalition \u2013 for the Haredim, and for Netanyahu.\u201d Israel\u2019s Deputy Attorney General Gil Limon instructed the government on Tuesday to immediately begin recruitment of an additional 3,000 ultra-Orthodox men, which the military has already said it could accommodate. He also that that \u201cin light of the current needs of the army and to promote equality in the burden,\u201d the military must \u201cdevelop and present a recruitment plan to increase this number.\u201d Tensions in Netanyahu\u2019s government Although the Supreme Court has now ruled that the IDF must draft Haredi men, ultra-Orthodox leaders will continue to push for legislation that gives them a legal exemption. \u201cWe are being practical when it comes to any these issues, and leaving the coalition doesn\u2019t change the fact,\u201d Roth said. The ruling is likely to increase tensions within Netanyahu\u2019s government, and between its political and military leaders. The war in Gaza has put significant strain on Israel\u2019s military, and given the issue of recruitment an urgency it lacked before Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack. The IDF has called up huge numbers of reservists, asking them to serve extended tours of service and removing legions of workers from Israel\u2019s economy. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has publicly criticized Netanyahu\u2019s attempt to exempt Haredi Jews. And IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi has been vocal about the need to draft Haredi men. \u201cEvery such battalion that we establish, an ultra-Orthodox battalion, decreases the need for the deployment of many thousands of reservists thanks to the mandatory service people,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cWe want to expand the base as much as possible \u2013 of those who come to enlist, I tell you that there is an opportunity for change in the ultra-Orthodox community.\u201d This is not the first time the Supreme Court has struck down the Haredi exemption. In 1998, the court told the government that allowing Haredim to get out of conscription violated equal protection principles. In the decades since, successive governments and Knessets have tried to solve the issue, only to be told again and again by the court that their efforts were illegal. In a February poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute, 64% of Israeli respondents and 70% of Jewish Israeli respondents said that the Haredi exemption \u201cshould be changed.\u201d The pollsters spoke with Israeli adults \u2013 600 in Hebrew and 150 in Arabic.

Preparations are being made for Modi\u2019s visit to Moscow and dates will be announced soon, Kremlin spokesperson Yuri Ushakov said, according to Russia\u2019s state-owned TASS news agency. \u201cI can confirm that we are preparing a visit by the Prime Minister of India,\u201d he said, according to TASS. \u201cI can\u2019t say about the dates yet, because the dates are announced by the parties in agreement. But we are actively preparing. And this visit will happen.\u201d CNN has contacted India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs for comment. The upcoming trip will be Modi\u2019s first to the country since 2019 and comes less than a month\u00a0after he was narrowly re-elected as prime minister during a weekslong vote. Modi\u00a0last met Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Uzbekistan in 2022, where he told the leader that today\u2019s era is \u201cnot of war\u201d. Putin also visited New Delhi just months before his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. India\u2019s ties with Russia date back decades to the Cold War and have remained strong despite repeated sanctions on Moscow from Western governments. New Delhi has repeatedly abstained from votes condemning Russia at the United Nations and has avoided public criticism of Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine. India remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment \u2013 a vital link given India\u2019s ongoing tensions at its shared Himalayan border with China \u2013 and has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin\u2019s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces global isolation. At the same time, India\u2019s ties with the United States have grown stronger, amid shared concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi met with US President Joe Biden during a state visit to Washington last June, in a trip further cementing their defense, trade and technology partnership. The Indian leader also addressed Congress during that trip, an honor typically reserved for close US allies and partners, and attended a lavish state dinner. Later that year, Putin did not attend the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in New Delhi, during which leaders delivered a consensus statement criticizing his invasion of Ukraine.

{"id": "travel_ukraine-kyiv-tourists-chernobyl-conflict", "text": "Before Russia invaded Ukraine, visitors from abroad frequently travelled to see Chernobyl, the nuclear power station that disastrously went into meltdown in 1986. After the release of the HBO series \u201cChernobyl\u201d in 2019, record numbers of visitors poured into the exclusion zone around the abandoned city of Pripyat, which housed the plant\u2019s workers, according to official numbers. Back then, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree to pave the way for more tourists. New land, water and air routes were planned. Museums were being developed. A new modern hotel was on its way. Up to one million tourists a year were expected by 2025. Then the war started and everything changed. Russia attacked and Chernobyl, for a while, became the frontline as Russian troops occupied the exclusion zone, destroyed infrastructure and dug trenches in the radioactive dirt of the infamous Red Forest where dying trees turned the color of rust after being contaminated by fallout. The area is now de-occupied but active fighting continues along the frontlines. For the most part, only official delegations and military personnel currently have access to the exclusion zone. But even as fighting rages in the south, east and north of Ukraine, travellers are still heading to the country, drawn by scars from the ravages of war that are still fresh. In Horenka, a suburb northwest of Kyiv, gray apartment buildings stand deserted and broken windows and damage from Russian shells are a common sight \u2013 a legacy of some of the worst Russian atrocities during the early days of the war. Coming to the area was once unthinkable. But it has now become one of the stops of tours through the towns in Kyiv region that show visitors the devastation and the horrors of war, as they learn more about what happened here from those still living through it. \u201cWe were very much against such tours in the first months of the de-occupation, in the first year of the de-occupation,\u201d said Mariana Oleskiv, head of Ukraine\u2019s State Agency for Tourism Development. \u201cIt was a rather traumatic experience for all the residents.\u201d \u201cBut now we are already seeing a significant change. People are ready for the world to know about the heroism of Ukrainians, on the one hand, and the crimes of the Russians, on the other,\u201d she said. Among those who have gone on such tours are members of international organizations, volunteers, diplomats, people involved in reconstruction efforts and anyone who wants to witness what unfolded here. Jean-Baptiste Laborde, a French student from Bordeaux, is also following the route. He\u2019s accompanied by Svitozar Moiseiv, a guide and co-founder of a travel company behind some of the tours. \u201cI\u2019ve been following events since the war began,\u201d Laborde said. \u201cSo I wanted to see for myself what happened there, the destructions, the Russian occupation.\u201d The journey begins Laborde and Moiseiv start their tour in Horenka. Standing not too far from one of the dilapidated apartment buildings, its entrance covered in red tape, its yard being inspected by a demining team and its innards exposed by bombardment, Moiseiv tells how Russian soldiers arrived here on February 24, 2022, and moved on to the big cities, including the capital. He describes what happened in the nearby villages of Horenka, Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka. The story is suddenly interrupted by a resident who hid in the basement of the building in the early days of the war. Ivan Bilotserkivets\u2019 apartment was destroyed but he and all his neighbors were unharmed. The pensioner recounts how they watched Russian helicopters attempting to land at Hostomel airport, just a few kilometers away. He says locals were sure the violence would end in a few days. But the reality is that the full-scale war is now well into its third year. \u201cIn general, I have a positive view of the fact that people from all over the world come to see our house and the consequences of the war,\u201d Bilotserkivets says. \u201cIt affects their perception of the war when people see the destruction with their own eyes.\u201d From his pocket, he pulls out a drone photo of his home taken just days after it was hit and shows it to Moiseiv and Laborde. \u201cIt is painful when you have worked all your life and done everything in your apartment, and now there are only ashes left,\u201d he says. \u201cAll our belongings were destroyed in one blow.\u201d Bilotserkivets says he has spoken with many of the visitors. \u201cThey come and ask: tell me what happened here and how. Of course, I share our experience. There were people from the United States, Brazil, Portugal, from many countries.\u201d For the locals, the most urgent issue is the restoration of their homes. Hopes of which were raised \u2013 then dashed \u2013 when world-famous graffiti artist Banksy arrived to paint a mural on one of the walls. \u201cBanksy came here several times, and we served him borsch and donuts,\u201d Bilotserkivets says. \u201cWe thought that this would somehow contribute to faster reconstruction. But because of his drawings, the opposite happened. Now we are waiting for a decision on what to do with them, whether they will be dismantled.\u201d The reconstruction can\u2019t start before that decision is made, he said. \u2018Endless cemetery\u2019 A few hundred meters away is another location of the tour, which links the history of Kyiv\u2019s defence against the Nazi army during World War II and the story of a Ukrainian family\u2019s survival during the Russian invasion in 2022. Moiseiv shows Laborde a section of a concrete fortification that was part of the Soviet army\u2019s defences in the 1940s. Almost 80 years later, the crude concrete structure became a shelter for a family for two weeks during heavy shelling when they would only break cover to run back to their house for food, water or candles. Laborde enters the fortifications to experience the conditions in which the family lived. Moiseiv tells Laborde what happened in each of the settlements, how the landscape affected the Russian offensive. The Ukrainian army blew up bridges to stop the Russian advance, he explains, but that made it difficult for people to evacuate quickly as the invading army approached. \u201cFrankly speaking, it is extremely unpleasant and difficult for me to actually be here every time I come here. Because, relatively speaking, we are moving through an endless cemetery,\u201d Moiseiv says. \u201cNow we are driving along Yablunska Street, where more than 70 civilians were killed. We will stop at the memorial to the shooting of young men. From a psychological point of view, this is a difficult process,\u201d he says as the tour reaches Bucha, a town that has come to symbolize Russian atrocities around Kyiv. Moiseiv says he tries to show human suffering in a personalized way on his tours \u2013 damaged houses, holes in the fences of residents. \u201cWe know their names and we know what they did during the hostilities.\u201d \u201cSuch tours are especially needed so that Europe and the whole world can help us more now, so that we can survive this cruel and absolutely inhuman struggle,\u201d he says. Among the locations of the tour is also the Church of St Andrew in Bucha, where more than 100 bodies of civilians were buried in a single mass grave and then exhumed after the liberation of the town. Now there is a memorial at the gravesite. There are fresh flowers near some of the names, as relatives of the victims come to honor the memory of their loved ones. Laborde stops to read the names. Immersive tour Yulia Bevzenko has also been conducting tours in Kyiv for Ukrainians and foreigners for 10 years. Among her clients since the war began have been famous film stars and directors, politicians, foreign ambassadors and volunteers. She developed her \u201cKyiv is not Kiev\u201d route to show how the capital lives during the war. \u201cThe tour is not about entertainment, it is an immersive tour,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are not trying to distract their attention from the war. We are trying to immerse them in it.\u201d Before the start of the war Bevzenko ran about four tours for visitors per week. In 2022, she gave four or five tours in English during the entire year, and the guests were not tourists in the true sense of the word. \u201cMy clients during the war, a full-scale war, were people who cannot be called tourists now, because they are representatives of companies that come to help Ukraine, they come here for different reasons,\u201d she said. Moiseiv, the tour guide travelling with the French student, also said pure tourism was almost non-existent after the start of the war, but in 2023 about 100 people visited Bucha with him. Oleskiv, Head of the State Agency for Tourism Development, said too \u201cthat tourism for classical purposes\u201d is very rare. Bevzenko says visiting Bucha and Irpin is an emotional but also educational experience \u2013 for both foreigners and Ukrainians. \u201cThese are not excursions,\u201d she says. The information needs to be presented carefully, accurately and \u201cwith respect, with honor, with an understanding that there is a war going on.\u201d Visitors in Kyiv see the National Guard and military personnel in the streets. Bevzenko takes them to a wall with thousands of photos of fallen soldiers. She shows them the city\u2019s largest medical hub. Petra Schr\u00f6ckeneder, a volunteer from Austria who has been helping house Ukrainians in her home city of Salzburg since the first days of the invasion, went on one of Bevzenko\u2019s tours. \u201cNow I can really understand the pain Ukrainians have every day in their life and how strong they are as a nation,\u201d she says. Some of the locations that touched her the most were the destroyed Irpin bridge, around which people tried to escape to Kyiv from occupied towns like Bucha. Some were shot by the Russians. She also saw graves and the destroyed houses in Bucha. \u201cHearing about it and seeing it are very different things,\u201d said Schr\u00f6ckeneder, who hosted Ukrainian children who had trouble reaching their parents still in the midst of conflict. \u201cI saw the pain,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you see it yourself, I cannot describe how different it is.\u201d \u201cMy mind could not process how many people already died fighting this war,\u201d Schr\u00f6ckeneder said. \u201cUkraine is still protecting Europe with being so strong. And I think it\u2019s very important for other people from Europe to see this.\u201d While many countries, including the US, currently warn against all travel to Ukraine, it seems that a willingness to discover the realities of the conflict, continues to draw visitors across its borders. And with an eye on a post-war future, Mariana Oleskiv, the head of the State Agency for Tourism Development, says she hopes travelers will one day be able to return to Chernobyl. But, she adds, Ukraine\u2019s recent experiences of conflict must remain at the heart of any travel experience. \u201cIt will also contain a part of the new history, including the defense of the Kyiv region, the trenches that (the Russians) dug in the ground contaminated with radiation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/ukraine-kyiv-tourists-chernobyl-conflict/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_africa_kenyan-president-rejects-finance-bill-intl", "text": "Kenyan President William Ruto said Wednesday that he will not sign a controversial finance bill, backing down in the face of mass protests that swept the country and reportedly left at least 23 people dead. \u201cHaving reflected on the continuing conversation regarding the content of the finance bill 2024, and listening keenly to the people of Kenya who have said loudly that they want nothing to do with this Finance Bill 2024, I concede, and therefore I will not sign the 2024 finance bill,\u201d Ruto said during a television address Wednesday. \u201cThe people have spoken,\u201d Ruto said. \u201cFollowing the passage of the bill, the country experienced widespread expression of dissatisfaction with the bill as passed, regrettably resulting in the loss of life, the destruction of property and desecration of constitutional institutions.\u201d Protesters in Kenya say they will go ahead with a \u201cOne Million People March\u201d on Thursday despite Ruto accepting their key demand of scrapping the bill. A\u00a0poster shared widely\u00a0on social media calls on all generations to return to the streets across the country on Thursday and block roads leading to the capital Nairobi. Some protesters have also called for people to occupy the State House in Nairobi. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken with Ruto since the clashes to urge restraint. According to a State Department readout of their call, Blinken \u201cunderscored the importance of security forces demonstrating restraint and refraining from violence and encouraged prompt investigations into allegations of human rights abuses.\u201d Kenya, a nation often praised for its stability, had seen escalating protests over the bill, which the government introduced to rein in public debt. Last week, the government\u00a0scrapped\u00a0some tax increases, including a proposed 16% value-added tax on bread along with taxes on motor vehicles, vegetable oil and mobile money transfers. But the concessions were not enough to quell protests amid the\u00a0rising cost of living. On Tuesday they turned deadly when security forces fired teargas and live ammunition at protesters. Dramatic scenes in the nation\u2019s capital Nairobi saw government buildings set on fire and a ceremonial mace stolen from the parliament in the melee. Kenyan lawmakers were evacuated from the parliament as police went up against protesters, CNN affiliate NTV Kenya reported. At least 23 people died in the violence, according to Kenya\u2019s Police Reforms Working Group, (PRWG) a civil society organization. The PRWG alleged in a statement published by Amnesty International Kenya that police targeted young, unarmed protesters outside the parliament, with the violence continuing into the night. They added that \u201creports show police shot several people in Githurai, Nairobi, one over 40 times \u2014 between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m., way after the protest ended.\u201d This was in contrast to details given by Ruto, who said in his speech that six people died. \u201cI send my condolences to the families of those who lost their loved ones in this very unfortunate manner,\u201d Ruto added. \u201cThere is need for us as a nation to pick up from here and go into the future,\u201d Ruto said, adding that he would hold an engagement with the young people at the forefront of the protests to hear their ideas and proposals. The Law Society of Kenya is calling for the resignation of Kenya\u2019s inspector general of police and the Nairobi regional commander over officers allegedly shooting protesters. \u201cWe saw plainclothes policemen shooting protesters as early as 11 a.m. There was a clear directive to kill protesters,\u201d Law Society of Kenya president Faith Odhiambo alleged in an interview with CNN on Wednesday evening. \u201cThere was no intent to let the protesters move around.\u201d The Law Society also said the police \u201cabducted\u201d several prominent social media users connected to the protests, and six people remain missing. \u201cThe reports from those who have been freed is that they were taken blindfolded and handcuffed, and they didn\u2019t know where they were,\u201d she told CNN, after the society secured the release of six people. \u201cEven after they come out, most of them are quite shaken and afraid and want to go into hiding. Our message to the government is that if a country is built on fear, one day people will stop fearing. And that\u2019s what we saw on Tuesday.\u201d Ruto\u2019s change of heart came as a surprise to some who observed his hardline stance just a day earlier. During a nationwide address after the parliament was set alight, Ruto said the events on Tuesday were a grave threat to \u201cnational security\u201d and that the conversation around the bill had been \u201chijacked by dangerous people.\u201d Kenyan analyst Herman Manyora said withdrawing the bill much earlier could have saved the lives lost on Tuesday. \u201cHis announcement should have come earlier. He has done today what he should have done two days ago to avoid what we went through yesterday. It pains me that we had to wait \u2026 for us to do what we should have done on Monday \u2026 and that\u2019s a general feeling among people,\u201d Manyora told CNN.

{"id": "2024_06_21_europe_italy-indian-farm-worker-death-intl-latam", "text": "The death of an Indian\u00a0migrant\u00a0worker in Italy, who was reportedly abandoned on a road after his arm was severed at work, has sparked outrage and prompted calls for a demonstration on Saturday in the town of Latina, in the country\u2019s central Lazio region. Satnam Singh,\u00a0a 31-year-old farm worker, was left on the street\u00a0Monday\u00a0after losing his right\u00a0arm while working at\u00a0a farm near Latina, which is southeast of Rome, CNN\u2019s affiliate SkyTG24 reported. His arm was reportedly severed by a plastic wrapping machine on the farm. Singh died days later and has come to symbolize the plight of vulnerable migrant workers in the country, with several trade unions and Latina\u2019s Indian community organizing demonstrations in the following days. Italian state broadcaster RAI said Singh was hooked by the plastic wrapping machine, towed by a tractor, which severed his right arm and crushed his lower limbs. Singh was then loaded into a van and abandoned near his home, while his severed arm was left in a vegetable collection box, RAI reported. He died\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0at\u00a0the San Camillo\u00a0hospital in Rome. An investigation into farm owner Antonello\u00a0Lovato \u2013 who allegedly left the injured Singh outside his home after the incident \u2013 has now been opened over potential charges of manslaughter and failure to assist a person in danger, Reuters reported, citing lead prosecutor Giuseppe De Falco. Singh did not have a regular contract or a residence permit, according to SkyTG24, and had been working at the same company for Italy for two years. CNN has reached out to De Falco and to Lovato\u2019s lawyers for comment, as well as to the Indian government. Lovato\u2019s father, Renzo Lovato told\u00a0RAI\u00a0that Singh had been warned \u201cnot to approach the vehicle\u201d and that \u201cthere is sadness because a man died at work and it should never happen. The\u00a0family\u2019s\u00a0lawyer, Valerio Righi, told Reuters that\u00a0Antonello Lovato \u201cspontaneously went to the judicial police an hour after the events, as any decent person would do,\u201d\u00a0adding that his client was waiting for the charges to be formalized to defend himself. Responding to allegations that Singh was abandoned without calls to an ambulance, Righi said, \u201cYou will see during the proceedings that maybe help was called sooner than people think.\u201d The farm worker\u2019s death has shocked the country. Italy Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed\u00a0her condolences and\u00a0strongly condemned Singh\u2019s death at\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0cabinet meeting. \u201cThese are inhumane acts that do not belong to the Italian people, and I hope that this barbarism will be harshly punished,\u201d she said in a statement. \u2018Unprecedented brutality\u2019 Trade unions met with the Italian\u00a0Labor Minister Marina Elvira Calderone and Agriculture\u00a0Minister Francesco Lollobrigida on Friday to discuss changes needed to prevent such events from happening again. What happened to Satnam Singh is \u201cmuch more than an injury: it is an inhuman act of barbarism in which those who abandoned him demonstrated that they had no regard for the value of human life,\u201d Calderone said Thursday in an interview with RAI, calling for exemplary punishments against exploitation at work. Several trade unions have organized a demonstration for Saturday in Latina and called for a two-hour strike to demand \u201cdignity and respect for the health and safety of workers\u201d and to urge political and social forces to combat worker exploitation and inhuman work conditions. Trade unions have also organized a fundraiser to raise funds for Singh\u2019s family, with some condemning Italy\u2019s gangmastering system, which involves the illegal recruitment and exploitation of agricultural workers. In a press release on Wednesday, trade union leader Maria Grazia Gabrielli called the incident one of \u201cunprecedented brutality\u201d. She said the incident was a result of \u201cthe irregularity in which we relegate thousands of\u00a0migrants who arrive in our country in search of hope.\u201d She said migrants found themselves as \u201cslaves of contemporary society, irregular, without a residence permit, and therefore more susceptible to blackmail by those who consider work only for profit, and rights - such as that of assistance - only as obstacles.\u201d Gabrielli added that exploitation in the fields often results in \u201cstarvation wages, unsafe and inhuman working rhythms and conditions, psychological and physical violence which unfortunately also lead to terrible events like the one in Latina.\u201d The Indian community of Latina will take to the streets on June 25\u00a0 to take part in a demonstration in memory of Singh, and will deliver an open letter to the prefect of Latina, Maurizio Falco calling for action and denunciation of the incident, according to RAI. According to a report from Italy\u2019s biggest labor union, CGIL, and labor union FLAI, in 2021 there were approximately 230,000 irregular workers employed in the primary sector, which largely includes non-resident foreigners employed in agriculture.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/europe/italy-indian-farm-worker-death-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_weather_south-heat-wave-midwest-flood-recovery", "text": "Dangerous heat is setting its sights on millions of Americans across the South and Plains on Monday, including several communities recovering from destructive flooding over the weekend. Here\u2019s the latest. \u2022 Heat heads to the South: The unrelenting heat shifts into the South and Southern Plains on Monday and Tuesday, bringing temperatures in the mid to upper 90s. Some cities could even see 100-degree highs, including Dallas and Little Rock, Arkansas. The heat index \u2013 a measurement of how the body feels in humidity and high temperatures \u2013 could top a dangerous 110 degrees in some areas. \u2022 Minnesota dam compromised: Southern Minnesota\u2019s Rapidan Dam is in \u201cimminent failure condition\u201d after this weekend\u2019s dangerous flooding, Blue Earth County Emergency Management warned Monday. The dam \u2013 about 70 miles southwest of Minneapolis \u2013 was intact as of late Monday morning, but water was flowing around it. No evacuation orders were issued as of late Monday morning. \u2022 Flood-stricken communities begin recovery amid sweltering heat: Heat alerts on Monday spread over 1,000 miles from North Florida to South Dakota, which was among several states inundated by heavy rain and devastating flooding over the weekend. Heat advisories are in effect for several areas that were swamped with floodwater over the weekend, including parts of\u00a0northern Iowa, southern South Dakota, eastern Nebraska and northern Missouri and Kansas. President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for Iowa after catastrophic flooding forced some communities to evacuate. \u2022 Record-breaking weekend heat: Daily high-temperature records were broken from New York to Mississippi over the weekend, including some that were more than a century old, as a brutal heat wave embraced the mid-Atlantic and I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C. to New York. Philadelphia hit 98 degrees on Sunday, shattering its 1888 record of 97 degrees. Both Greenville, Mississippi, and Raleigh, North Carolina, saw a record 100 degrees. People in the region can breathe a sigh of relief Monday as cooler temperatures begin to set in. \u2022 Flooding turns deadly in South Dakota: At least one person died during severe flooding in South Dakota, Governor Kristi Noem said. \u201cI want to remind everybody to remember the power of water and the flow of water, and to stay away from flooded areas,\u201d the governor warned. At least nine people were rescued from rising water in Sioux Falls, where emergency personnel reported stranded drivers and dozens of trapped vehicles. And the flood threat still isn\u2019t over \u2013 several rivers in the state are swollen with floodwater and will continue rising over the next few days, Noem said. \u2022 More than 20 rivers at major flood stage: Flood warnings remain across waterlogged areas of South Dakota, Iowa and southern Minnesota, as well as along rivers that are running well above normal. At least 23 river gauges have reached major flood stage in the area, meaning extensive flooding of buildings, main roadways, and other critical infrastructure is possible, according to the National Weather Service. That number is expected to grow as water continues to collect across creeks and streams, eventually dumping into major rivers. \u2022 \u201cMonsoon-like\u201d conditions coming to the Southwest: An influx of tropical moisture \u2013 some of which is from Tropical Storm Alberto \u2013 is bringing \u201cmonsoon-like conditions\u201d to the Southwest, the Weather Prediction Center said. Thunderstorms are possible through midweek as a result. While the rainfall may be welcomed by firefighters battling several active wildfires in the region, too much rain could trigger flooding and debris flows, making it difficult for crews to access burn areas. Where heat will go next A heat dome building over the southwestern and south-central US early this week will push temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal each afternoon in an area spanning from the West into the Southeast. High temperatures in the upper 90s and low 100s are expected Monday from southern South Dakota through the Southeast. A handful of daily record high temperatures could fall in parts of Nebraska and Kansas, and a few are at risk in Mississippi. The southern tier of the country will remain the epicenter for sizzling conditions Tuesday with high temperatures in the low 100s likely in the southern Plains and Southeast. Atlanta is forecast to top out in the upper 90s both Tuesday and Wednesday, about 10 degrees above normal for late June. By Wednesday, heat will briefly shift back into some of the same areas of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast that baked last week, but it won\u2019t touch the extreme nature of last week\u2019s oven-like conditions. Temperatures in the upper 90s and low 100s will return in the mid-Atlantic and 90s will return as far north as southern New England. A few daily high temperature records are in jeopardy Wednesday \u2013 including DC and Baltimore \u2013 but much of the northeast US will avoid unseasonable heat. Stormy weather maintains flood threat There will be rain chances for heavily flooded areas of the Midwest most of this week. A level 2 of 5 risk for severe thunderstorms is in effect over the area Monday and Tuesday and some of these storms could unload rounds of heavy rainfall. Exactly how much rain falls and where depends on how thunderstorms develop each afternoon, but the heaviest storms could unload more than an inch of rain in a short time. That\u2019s more than enough to cause additional flooding concerns in areas that can\u2019t take much more rain. Storms are expected to roar to life each day in the late afternoon or early evening hours and remain a threat overnight. Damaging wind gusts and hail\u00a0are also threats with any severe thunderstorm early this week. After a brief break on Wednesday, additional heavy rain is possible in the same areas Thursday and Friday.

{"id": "2024_06_26_style_casa-susanna-trans-photo-archive", "text": "With coiffed black hair, pearls, a hand on her hip and a high-heeled pointed toe, a woman poses jubilantly for the camera on the steps outside her home. Her name is Susanna Valenti, and her home is Casa Susanna, located in the Catskills, in upstate New York. In the 1950s and \u201960s, Casa Susanna served as a safe haven and a sanctuary for people to explore their gender identity and expression in ways they were not able to in daily life. Photographs taken there show individuals in scenes of comfortable domesticity and community, getting dressed in traditionally feminine clothes and celebrating occasions and holidays together. These images, part of the Art Gallery of Ontario\u2019s (AGO) permanent collection, are brought together in a new publication, \u201cCasa Susanna: The Story of the First Trans Network in the United States, 1959-1968,\u201d and offer valuable insight into the environment that Valenti and her wife Marie Tonell created. Purchased in 2004 at a New York City flea market by two art dealers and later acquired by the AGO in 2015, this particular selection of 340 Casa Susanna images are part of a much wider archive, including some currently in the personal collection of photographer Cindy Sherman. In recent years, the photographs have come to the attention of artists, scholars, activists and more interested in the intersections between queer identities, photography and the arts\u2014and more collections of photographs made by members of the community who visited Casa Susanna have been found and archived, such as the Louise Lawrence Transgender Archive. In the last decade, Casa Susanna has inspired a Broadway play, Harvey Fierstein\u2019s \u201cCasa Valentina\u201d; been referenced in the television series \u201cTransparent\u201d; and was the subject of an acclaimed documentary film released last year. The photobook includes contextual essays and a foreword by historian, writer and documentary filmmaker Susan Stryker, who recalls images circulating within her generation and community of trans women in the late 1980s and 1990s. \u201cThey were just ubiquitous in trans underground networks,\u201d Stryker said in an interview with CNN. \u201cI have to say, I\u2019ve been tickled in recent decades when people have discovered them and said, \u2018oh, there\u2019s a treasure trove of these things that we never knew existed.\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018who never knew they existed?\u2019\u201d Building community In January 1960, Los Angeles-based writer and editor Virginia Prince launched \u201cTransvestia,\u201d a magazine \u201cpublished by, for and about Transvestites for the purpose of providing a center about which people interested in the field may gather.\u201d This terminology was Prince\u2019s way of describing herself and her intended audience. Although preferred language for many in the trans community has changed since that time, Stryker noted that she is \u201cwary of stamping the past with the present,\u201d and that while different forms of gender expression can be seen in the photographs and some individuals within them may have identified as transgender, others may not have described themselves in that way. \u201cTransvestia\u201d was a subscription-only publication sent clandestinely through the mail until 1963, after which it was available at some newsstands and adult bookstores across America. Though its frequency declined over the years, the magazine remained in circulation until 1986. At the time of its inception, \u201ccross-dressing,\u201d as it was deemed, was criminalized across the US; Prince built up a network of peers by contacting people whose details she found reading arrest reports in newspapers. \u201cVirginia was the person who helped bring that community somewhere out of the deep underground,\u201d said Stryker. Through \u201cTransvestia,\u201d those with similar interests could see themselves reflected in the publication\u2019s pages, and could connect with each other by placing personal advertisements in the person-to-person column. Valenti had a regular column in \u201cTransvestia,\u201d called Susanna Says, and many of the photographs featured in the magazine were taken at Casa Susanna. Born in Chile in 1917, Valenti met her wife at a wig shop \u2014 popular with crossdressers \u2014 that Tonell ran in New York City. Casa Susanna was Tonell\u2019s property in the Catskills; those who frequented the home included Gloria, a millionaire from Michigan; Jessica, a Colombian heiress; and Felicity, an airline pilot and World War II veteran who was the sibling of photographer Lee Miller. \u201cI think it became an almost mythical place, that place we all seek in some way where you feel accepted and where you feel at home,\u201d said Sophie Hackett, the AGO\u2019s Curator of Photography and co-author of the new book. \u201cIt provided, even if only for a weekend, a sense of home and a sense of family for people who perhaps didn\u2019t feel that elsewhere in their lives. We can\u2019t underestimate the power of that, and the pictures are a testament to that.\u201d Finding home In Stryker\u2019s view, Valenti\u2019s role in cultivating the physical space was crucial, and the way she lived her daily life as a femme-presenting person was a model for others. \u201cYou see people who become mothers to their community and that\u2019s really the way I think of Susanna most deeply,\u201d said Stryker. \u201cShe was trans mother to her community and she provided a nurturing and supportive environment for people to get to a better place in their life. I see that as a very positive and giving way of being.\u201d Postwar American values emphasized a \u201csuburban nuclear family existence,\u201d with stereotypically traditional, rigid gender roles, said Hackett. That broader societal backdrop provides important context for the photographs\u2019 production, and the way that gender is explored and expressed by the individuals within them. \u201cSo many of the individuals are seeking to understand what this impulse was, which flew in the face of the way many of them were raised as men in the United States at the time,\u201d Hackett added. It too provides insight into the way the individuals at Casa Susanna both saw and wanted to see themselves. In many ways, this aesthetic echoed Virginia Prince\u2019s preference for the way those featured in \u201cTransvestia\u201d should look. In an October 1961 article, titled \u201cThe Art of Female Impersonation,\u201d Prince wrote a series of guidelines for manners and mannerisms, including ways of sitting, standing and smoking, that she felt emulated \u201cthe best in womanhood.\u201d \u201cWhat I see mostly when I look at those photos are people who are trying their best to embody a middle class respectability of womanhood,\u201d said Stryker. \u201cThey are not being freaky-deaky gender queers or flamboyant drag queens. They are showing they can be a \u2018respectable\u2019 person by showing how they embody very conventional and mostly white, middle class interpretations of what respectable womanhood looks like.\u201d The act of making these images was in itself a way of forming both a sense of self, and connecting with a broader community. In discoveries of other Casa Susanna photographs, multiple copies of the same image have been found. \u201cIt looks like these photos were traded like baseball cards; people in the community swapped them with each other,\u201d said Stryker. \u201cIt was just a really important way of making real a way that people felt about themselves and making it communal rather than subjective or in your head.\u201d Although Valenti expressed plans to turn Casa Susanna into a hotel, and to live full time as a woman, an accident Tonell suffered in 1967 meant that she had to work, and live, as her male identity in order to cover medical bills. Her regular column in \u201cTransvestia\u201d came to an end, the book\u2019s co-author Isabelle Bonnet wrote in an introductory text, and she stopped communicating with Prince.\u00a0 Casa Susanna was sold in 1972. From the early 1980s onwards, Valenti and Tonell lived separately, with Valenti living as a woman. Both died in 1996.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned. His office declined to give details, saying an official announcement was being prepared", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/style/fumihiko-maki-architect-dies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Romania\u2019s 1-1 draw with Slovakia was enough for both teams to reach the round of 16, with the Slovaks qualifying as one of the four best third-placed teams. It was a heartbreaking end to the tournament for Ukraine, which exits Euro 2024 after finishing bottom of the group, despite picking up more points than some of the teams that qualified third from other groups. It is the first time in European Championship history that a team has won four points and finished bottom. Belgium\u2019s failure to top Group E, however, means the\u00a0Red Devils\u00a0now face the daunting task of taking on France in the round of 16. If Belgium plays as it has done so far this tournament, few people will give the team a chance against France. It was another sluggish, disjointed performance from Domenico Tedesco\u2019s side, who rarely troubled Ukraine throughout the clash. Belgium dominated possession for the opening 20 minutes, the team conducted by captain and star man Kevin De Bruyne in midfield, though the Red Devils were unable to really test Anatoliy Trubin in the Ukraine goal. Ukraine manager Serhiy Rebrov had made the bold call to drop both Oleksandr Zinchenko and captain Andriy Yarmolenko, while he was also without injured Chelsea forward Mykhailo Mudryk. Perhaps their replacements just needed time to find their feet as Ukraine burst to life halfway through the first half and began to put Belgium under sustained pressure. Roman Yaremchuk fired a shot from range which stung the palms of Koen Casteels, before Artem Dobvik disappointingly dragged his shot wide from the edge of the area. Yaremchuk perhaps should have given Ukraine the lead when a wonderfully worked short free kick set him free in the box, but he opted to cross the ball instead of shoot. Belgium only looked like a threat with De Bruyne on the ball and he was again carrying the team through another disappointing half of football at Euro 2024, brilliantly threading a ball into the path of Romelu Lukaku, who scuffed his effort when through on goal. Belgium suffered the biggest upset of the tournament in its opening 1-0 defeat to Slovakia and had De Bruyne largely to thank for a 2-0 win over Romania. With Belgium struggling to find any rhythm, Ukraine began to increasingly exert its dominance on the game. The impetus was on the Ukrainians, too, given the knowledge that with Romania and Slovakia drawing 1-1 at halftime, and the danger that they would finish bottom of Group E on goal difference, with all four teams on four points. Meanwhile, Belgium knew if the results stayed the same it would be in for a tough round of 16 clash against France, but a defeat would mean elimination. Both teams started to show a bit more intent as the game entered the final 20 minutes. Yannick Carrasco drew a smart save from Trubin, while Ruslan Malinovskyi almost caught out Casteels at his near post from a corner kick. Youngster Georgiy Sudakov perhaps should have won it for Ukraine in the closing minutes after making a brilliant slaloming run into the Belgium penalty area, but hit his shot straight at Casteels. The full-time whistle brought the Ukrainian players to their knees. It was a cruel way for its Euro 2024 adventure to come to an end, making history but for all the wrong reasons.

South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said a suspected balloon was seen flying in northern Gyeonggi Province, which borders Seoul, around 9 p.m. local time (8 p.m. ET). About 100 of the\u00a0balloons\u00a0fell inside\u00a0South\u00a0Korean\u00a0regions, most of which were found in\u00a0north\u00a0of Gyeonggi Province and capital Seoul with \u201cno hazardous substances\u201d found so far, it said. Seoul\u2019s Metropolitan government later sent out a push notification alerting the city that a North Korean balloon had entered the sky over Seoul, adding that citizens should refrain from touching downed balloons and report any sightings to authorities. The South Korean military has\u00a0warned it could restart loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts at the border \u2014 which it had paused for the last few years \u2014\u00a0adding whether Seoul resumes the loudspeakers is \u201cup to\u00a0North\u00a0Korea\u2019s actions.\u201d \u201cOur military is ready to immediately start anti-North Korea propaganda broadcasts, and will operate with flexibility according to the strategical and operational situation,\u201d said the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday. North Korea has sent over 1,000 balloons toward the South since May, which\u00a0it calls\u00a0reprisals for South Korean activists flying leaflets that contain materials critical of the regime of its leader Kim Jong\u00a0Un. On Thursday, a South Korean advocacy group flew 20 large balloons carrying thousands of anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets and USB sticks with South Korean entertainment toward North Korea. A day later, on Friday, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korea\u2019s leader, warned of \u201ctrouble\u201d ahead. \u201cWhen you do something you were clearly warned not to do, it\u2019s only natural that you will find yourself dealing with something you didn\u2019t have to,\u201d she said. A South Korean analysis of North Korean balloons sent between late May and early June detected parasites in the balloons\u2019 soil, which \u201cmay have originated from human feces,\u201d the ministry said, pointing to \u201chuman genes\u201d found in the soil. The analysis found roundworms, whipworms and larva currens along with other waste, such as cloth and wastepaper, the ministry said, adding there was no risk of contamination or infectious disease from the analyzed soil. The balloons also carried damaged clothes from a South Korean brand, signaling \u201chostility towards South Korean goods,\u201d as well as clothes with imitations of Disney characters, according to the ministry. The latest balloon salvo comes as tensions on the Korean Peninsula heighten, and inter-Korean diplomacy remains at an impasse.\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a defense agreement with North Korea last week as talks on its denuclearization efforts have stalled, and Kim has\u00a0vowed to expand his country\u2019s nuclear arsenal\u00a0and threatened to use it against the South. In the meantime, a US Navy aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea over the weekend ahead of trilateral exercises with South Korea and Japan in the waters near the peninsula. It is the latest in a series of US military moves aiming to affirm Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad\u201d commitment to its treaty ally in South Korea. US and South Korean officials signed a\u00a0new memorandum of understanding\u00a0on diplomatic intelligence sharing and analysis on Monday, according to South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry. Japanese, South Korean and U.S. officials also held a trilateral call where they issued a\u00a0joint statement\u00a0that called the deepening security cooperation between Russia and North Korea a matter of \u201cgrave concern\u201d to those seeking to maintain peace on the Korean Peninsula. \u201cThe United States, ROK, and Japan condemn in the strongest possible terms deepening military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia, including continued arms transfers from the DPRK to Russia that prolong the suffering of the Ukrainian people, violate multiple United Nations Security Council Resolutions, and threaten stability in both Northeast Asia and Europe,\u201d the statement said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/asia/north-korean-balloons-south-korea-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_europe_balkan-states-heat-power-outage-minister-intl", "text": "A major power outage hit Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania and most of Croatia\u2019s coast on Friday, disrupting businesses, shutting down traffic lights and leaving people sweltering without air conditioning in the middle of a heatwave. Montenegro\u2019s energy minister said the shutdown was caused by a sudden increase in power consumption brought on by\u00a0high temperatures, and by the heat itself overloading systems. Power distribution is linked across the Balkans for transfers and trading. \u201cThis was just waiting to happen in this heat,\u201d Gentiana, a 24-year-old student in Montenegro\u2019s capital Podgorica, told Reuters. Temperatures hit 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) across the southeastern European region. Electricity and wifi networks went down from around 1 p.m. (1100 GMT), officials and social media users said. Suppliers in the four countries said they started restoring supply by mid-afternoon and power was largely back by the evening. At the start of the blackout, traffic light failures caused gridlock in Bosnia\u2019s capital Sarajevo and the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar, Reuters reporters said. Many lost water in Podgorica as pumps stopped working, locals reported. Air conditioners shut down and ice cream melted in tourist shops. Cars also ground to a halt in the Croatian coastal city of Split, state TV HRT reported. Ambulance sirens rang out across the city, it added. \u201cThe failure occurred as a result of a heavy load on the network, a sudden increase in power consumption due to high temperature and the high temperatures themselves,\u201d Montenegro\u2019s energy minister, Sasa Mujovic, said in a TV broadcast. Experts were still trying to identify where the malfunction originated, he added. Risk remains Montenegro\u2019s Vijesti TV said a fire had been spotted in a 400KW transmission line in a rugged area along the border with Bosnia - though it was not immediately clear if this could have been the cause of outages or in some way related to them. The report cited unnamed sources from the electric transmission company CGES which, it said, would need helicopters to access the site. Albanian Energy Minister Belinda Balluku said there had been a breakdown in an interconnector between Albania and Greece and he had heard there had been similar circumstances in Montenegro and parts of Croatia and Bosnia. A full investigation would take time, but early analysis suggested that \u201cbig volumes of power in the transmission system at the moment and very high temperatures in record levels have created this technical problem,\u201d Balluku added in a video address. Power in Albania was restored within half an hour, but the country remained at a high risk of further shutdowns as power usage and heat levels were still high, he said. Shifts in the region\u2019s energy supplies have put strains on its transmission systems,\u00a0industry officials say. Western Balkan nations have seen a boom in solar energy investment, meant to ease a power crisis that had threatened a shift away from coal. But the infrastructure is not prepared for new energy feeds, the president of North Macedonia\u2019s Energy Regulatory Commission and other industry figures told Reuters in April last year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/europe/balkan-states-heat-power-outage-minister-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_sport_nba-draft-how-to-watch-spt-intl", "text": "The next wave of NBA talent is ready to take center stage. The 2024 NBA Draft\u2019s two days of action begin on Wednesday, with the Atlanta Hawks set to make the No. 1 overall selection for the first time in the post-1985 Draft lottery era. While there is no generational prospect in the mold of Victor Wembanyama at the top of this year\u2019s class, there is still plenty of talent primed to make an impact in the world\u2019s best professional league. How to watch the 2024 NBA Draft For the first time in the history of the current format \u2013 which began in 1989 \u2013 the Draft will be held across two days, following in the footsteps of the US\u2019 three other major sports leagues, which hold their drafts across multiple days. First round picks will hear their names called at the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 Barclays Center on Wednesday night with the second round taking place at ESPN\u2019s Seaport District Studios the following day on June 27. The first round of the draft will be broadcast from 8 p.m. ET on both ABC and ESPN, while the second round begins at 4 p.m. ET on ESPN. International representation With basketball continuing to grow on a global scale, teams are increasingly turning their attention to overseas prospects, with the NBA\u2019s consensus mock draft suggesting that at least four of the 14 lottery picks could be from outside the US. It appears that a Frenchman will be first off the board for the second year running, though unlike the 2023 draft, there is more than one player in the mix. Zaccharie Risacher and Alexandre Sarr have both been linked with the No. 1 pick leading up to the Draft, with mock drafts swinging in Risacher\u2019s favor in recent days. Risacher spent last season with French club JL Bourg-en-Bresse of France\u2019s LNB \u00c9lite league and could develop into an elite \u2018three-and-D\u2019 small forward for the Hawks if selected first overall. With a six-foot-eight frame and a long wingspan, he is expected to make an impact on the defensive end immediately, an area where rookies typically struggle. Meanwhile, Sarr \u2013 who played for the Perth Wildcats of the Australian National Basketball League \u2013 could begin the season as the starting center for the Washington Wizards, who own the No. 2 overall pick. Reports speculate that the Hawks are leaning towards Risacher after Sarr declined a pre-draft workout with the team. Sarr clarified that his camp advised him to take the decision, saying that being drafted is the priority but that he still wants to be the No. 1 pick. Forward Matas Buzelis \u2013 born in Chicago but of Lithuanian heritage \u2013 has also been touted as a potential top-five selection. The 19-year-old\u2019s blend of height, ball-handling ability, playmaking and shooting upside means that he fits the archetype of the modern NBA wing. Buzelis raised eyebrows earlier this year when he challenged Risacher to a one-on-one matchup. \u201cOf course, I want to see him one-on-one,\u201d Buzelis told Lithuanian outlet Basket News in March. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t want to do that with me. His agent will not do that with me, and I know he won\u2019t. It\u2019s a business decision. \u201cMy advantage is that I have everything over him.\u201d Buzelis followed up by stating that he \u201crespects\u201d Risacher as a player but doubled down on his comments the day before the draft. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t want to see me. I\u2019m just going to keep it real with everybody,\u201d he said with a smile on his face. Serbian point guard Nikola Topi\u0107 is another name to keep an eye on, though he was recently diagnosed with a partially torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which could affect his draft stock. Another Frenchman, Tidjane Sala\u00fcn, could potentially find his way into the lottery or even the top 10. College prospects Despite the influx of talent from abroad in recent years and a perceived drop in star power in men\u2019s college basketball compared to previous seasons, there are still plenty of skilled NBA-ready players at the collegiate level. While Risacher and Sarr are heavily predicted go at one and two, former Kentucky sharpshooter Reed Sheppard has a strong case to be selected just behind them. A late-season surge in scoring by the combo guard turned the heads of NBA scouts, who have seemingly taken note of his ability to perform on the offensive end as well as stifle opponents on the other side of the ball. Listed around six-foot-two, Sheppard is often credited for playing bigger than his size. Towering UConn center Donovan Clingan has also received pre-draft plaudits and has drawn comparisons to four-time defensive player of the year Rudy Gobert. Expected to have an impact as a dominating interior presence from day one in the league, it is unlikely to see Clingan fall out of the top 10. Reigning two-time consensus national player of the year Zach Edey is another player who can be a game-changer in the paint. The seven-foot-four, 300-pound center is the tallest player in Big Ten conference history and his seemingly unstoppable post presence and footwork made him one of the most dominant players in college, though there are concerns about his skillset not translating to the NBA. Wings Stephon Castle, Cody Williams and Dalton Knecht are all candidates to fill out the top 10, while Ron Holland II remains an intriguing prospect. He chose to play for the NBA\u2019s developmental G-League Ignite team \u2013 alongside Buzelis \u2013 instead of attending college. Bronny James, son of NBA all-time leading scorer LeBron James is expected to go towards the end of the second round, possibly at No. 55 to the Los Angeles Lakers where he could team up with his father. Full draft order Teams are able to trade picks on draft night. The Phoenix Suns and Philadelphia 76ers have each lost a second-round pick due to a league penalty, meaning that there will be 58 selections made rather than the usual 60. First round 1.

{"id": "2024_06_26_europe_evan-gershkovich-trial-begin-russia-intl", "text": "Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, went on trial Wednesday, appearing in a Russian courtroom\u2019s glass cage with his head recently shaved. Later Wednesday, Gershkovich\u2019s family said the past 15 months had been \u201cextraordinarily painful.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re deeply disappointed that he will have to endure further attempts to discredit him and to paint a picture that is unrecognizable to anyone who knows him. Evan is a journalist, and journalism is not a crime,\u201d his family said in a statement. Gershkovich, 32, was arrested while reporting for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), which he joined in January 2022, just weeks before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While many newsrooms subsequently pulled their reporters out of Russia, Gershkovich remained, covering the war and how it was changing life in the country. He was arrested while on a reporting trip in the city of Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and later accused of spying for the CIA. Gershkovich, the US government, and the WSJ have vehemently denied the charges against him. Within two weeks of his arrest in March 2023, the US State Department designated him as wrongfully detained and called for his immediate release. The press was briefly allowed into the courtroom 15 minutes before Wednesday\u2019s hearing began at 11 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET). During earlier appeals against his pre-trial detention, Gershkovich has made love-heart signs and given a thumbs-up to his friends, family and supporters. On Wednesday, Gershkovich stood cross-armed, seeming healthy and composed, occasionally smiling and waving to the crowd of reporters. No reporters will be allowed into the courtroom during the trial itself, which is expected to last months. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. After Wednesday\u2019s hearing wrapped early afternoon, court officials said the trial would resume on August 13, state news agency TASS reported. The trial of Gershkovich, the American-born son of Soviet-era emigres to the US, has highlighted the extent to which Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has harmed relations between Moscow and Washington. In their indictment, Russian prosecutors said that \u201cunder instructions from the CIA\u201d and \u201cusing painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d Gershkovich \u201cwas collecting secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory. Russian authorities have not publicly offered any evidence for their claims. WSJ Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker said it was \u201cjarring to see him in yet another courtroom for a sham trial held in secret and based on fabricated accusations.\u201d \u201cWhile we are told he\u2019s doing well given the circumstances, Evan\u2019s wrongful detention continues to be a devastating assault on his freedom and his work and an unfathomable attack on the free press. It\u2019s outrageous that he has already endured 455 days in prison when he never should\u2019ve been arrested,\u201d she said in a statement. Pjotr Sauer, Russian affairs reporter for Britain\u2019s The Guardian newspaper and friend of Gershkovich, told CNN, \u201cEvan is just an honest journalist,\u201d and emphasized that Russian authorities have not presented any evidence against him. \u201cWe\u2019re not holding our breath, it could take weeks or months. And we don\u2019t have much trust in the Russian justice system,\u201d said Sauer, who exchanged letters with Gershkovich before the American reporter was transferred to Yekaterinburg. \u201cRealistically, we believe that Russia will convict him because they\u00a0arrested him in the end because he\u2019s a bargaining chip for Moscow, for Putin to be exchanged.\u201d Ahead of the trial, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US \u201ccertainly\u201d does not expect Gershkovich to have \u201ca free and fair trial given that these are charges that never should have been brought in the first place.\u201d Miller said embassy personnel were traveling to Yekaterinburg, more than 800 miles from Moscow, and would attempt to attend the trial. Before being transferred to Yekaterinburg, Gershkovich was held in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo prison, spending almost every hour of the day in a small cell as his pre-trial detention period was extended several times. He has passed the time by writing letters to his friends and family, his parents, Ella Milman and Mikhail Gershkovich, said in a recent interview with the WSJ. \u201cHe\u2019s managing the best way he can, in a tiny space, one hour walking outside \u2013 six steps, six steps, six steps,\u201d Milman said, drawing a small courtyard with her finger. \u201cHe\u2019s been exercising, meditating, reading a lot, answering letters. His knowledge of the Russian language and the culture helped him adjust to the situation.\u201d Political \u2018pawns\u2019 In his State of the Union address in March \u2013 with Gershkovich\u2019s parents in the audience \u2013 US President Joe Biden said his administration was working \u201caround the clock to bring home Evan\u201d and other \u201cAmericans being unjustly detained all around the world.\u201d Shortly after the first day of Gershkovich\u2019s trial concluded, the US Embassy in Moscow demanded Russia stop using him and other detained Americans as \u201cbargaining chips.\u201d \u201cThis trial is not about the presentation of evidence, due process or the rule of law. We are talking about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political goals,\u201d the embassy said. The number of Americans being held in Russia has swelled in recent years. Paul Whelan, a former US Marine, was arrested in Moscow in December 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020 on espionage charges, which he has consistently and vehemently denied. The US State Department has also declared him wrongfully detained. After marking another grim milestone last week, surpassing 2,000 days in Russian custody, Whelan told CNN he has spent \u201can incredible amount of time\u201d in detention \u201cfor a crime that never occurred\u201d as he urged the Biden administration to take \u201cdecisive action\u201d to bring him and Gershkovich home. Brittney Griner \u2013 the basketball star who used to play in Russia during the WNBA offseason \u2013 was detained in Russia and sentenced to nine years in prison after authorities found cannabis oil in her luggage. After spending nearly 300 days behind bars, Griner was freed in a prisoner swap for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, nicknamed the \u201cMerchant of Death\u201d by his accusers. A former Soviet military officer, Bout was serving a 25-year sentence in the US on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles and provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2013 charges he and the Kremlin denied. The Kremlin has consistently said that any negotiations regarding a potential prisoner swap\u00a0should be conducted in complete confidentiality, without disclosing any details on the progress of these discussions. Western officials and analysts have accused Russia of using jailed Americans as political pawns. Discussing the case of Ksenia Karelina \u2013 a US-Russian dual citizen also on trial in Yekaterinburg after being accused of donating $51 to a Ukrainian charity \u2013 Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov told CNN that Russia aims \u201cto build up a bank of hostages with American passports,\u201d which Moscow can use \u201cas leverage\u201d in any negotiations with Washington. In an interview with American right-wing pundit Tucker Carlson, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested the Kremlin could be willing to free Gershkovich in exchange for Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from Russia\u2019s domestic spy organization who was convicted of assassinating a former Chechen fighter in broad daylight in Berlin in 2019. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll tell you: sitting in one country, a country that is an ally of the United States, is a man who, for patriotic reasons, eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals,\u201d Putin said.

{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_unauthorized-hajj-muslim-pilgrims-death-intl", "text": "Abdelzaher Abdo Salem, 81, decided to make the pilgrimage to Mecca from Egypt after fulfilling a mission to get his youngest son Mahmoud married two years ago. \u201cThis was his last wish,\u201d his son Mahmoud said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t perform the Hajj before that because of the lack of money, and because I was going to get married, and there were a lot of expenses.\u201d Due to the high cost of Hajj through official channels \u2013 150,000 Egyptian pounds ($3,091), in addition to plane tickets \u2013 Salem had resorted to a representative of an unlicensed company to organize the trip, at a lower cost of around 100,000 Egyptian pounds ($2,061). But Salem never made it back to Egypt. He was among the more than 1,300 pilgrims who died during this year\u2019s Hajj as temperatures in Saudi Arabia reached record levels. Saudi authorities said that the vast majority of those who died were not authorized to conduct the rituals. The tragedy, resulting in one of the highest Hajj death tolls in years, has brought attention to the shadowy industry of unauthorized pilgrimage agents. These agents profit from Muslims\u2019 desire to fulfill their religious obligations by sidestepping official procedures, leading pilgrims on potentially hazardous journeys. Saudi authorities said many of those who died \u201cwalked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort\u201d as the temperature reached a record 125 degrees Fahrenheit (51.7 degrees Celsius). For Salem, the process to get to Mecca involved obtaining a personal visit visa to Saudi Arabia instead of a special Hajj visa that would authorize him to access the holy cities and pilgrim facilities, including air-conditioned\u00a0venues and medical services. A visit visa however bars entry into Mecca, so its holders are forced to take a desert path to access the holy city, often on foot. Salem, who was traveling with his wife, had been promised by a representative of the Egyptian travel agency that a bus would be provided to transport the group. However, there was no transport for them to and from Mount Arafat, his son Mahmoud said, so the two had to walk towards Mina, around 8 miles away, to complete the \u201cstoning the devil\u201d ritual. On the way, Salem\u2019s wife became exhausted and sat down to rest. Determined to complete the rituals, her husband continued walking. He promised his wife he would return, said Mahmoud. But contact with Salem was subsequently lost. His wife searched for him for five days until she found his name on the list of deceased at Al-Ma\u2019aisam Hospital in Mecca. \u201cOur mother informed us of the news via a voice message on WhatsApp. The news was a tragedy for us,\u201d Mahmoud said. \u201cOur mother is there, devastated, and no one is there to comfort her.\u201d A lucrative industry Each year, Saudi authorities issue licenses permitting legal access to Mecca for pilgrims. These licenses provide access to air-conditioned transportation and accommodation facilities for worshipers. However, the number of licenses is limited \u2013 1.8 million this year \u2013  and they can cost several thousand dollars. Every country is allocated a number of licenses that is proportional to its Muslim population. This process excludes those who cannot afford the license or are not included in the allocation. Hajj is a once-in-a-lifetime religious obligation for every able-bodied Muslim. Many Muslims wait their entire lives to make the journey, often delaying the pilgrimage into their old age until they have saved enough money and fulfilled their family obligations. However, millions are left disappointed when they cannot secure a spot through official channels. Each country traditionally gets one Hajj license for every 1,000 Muslims \u2013 that\u2019s a 0.1% rate. But according to Egyptian officials cited in state media, Egypt, a Muslim-majority country of 110 million, was allocated 50,000 Hajj licenses this year, a rate of approximately 0.05%. This has given rise to a lucrative industry of travel agencies that promise to get pilgrims to Saudi Arabia unofficially, often with assurances of transport and accommodation that may not be fulfilled or are below standard. Coupled with the extreme heat this year, this spelled tragedy for many pilgrims. While deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year\u2019s gathering was held amid particularly high temperatures. Hajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom. Atef Aglan, a member of the Egyptian Travel Agents Association, says there is a lack of awareness about the procedures of the Hajj among many Egyptians, which allows inexperienced tour operators and some mosque imams to exploit the poor, promising a cheaper Hajj without the appropriate visa or accommodation and transport. He proposes criminalizing the phenomenon because \u201cit has become a profession for those with no profession.\u201d \u201cThis is premeditated murder because this broker knows that the temperatures are above 50 degrees (Celsius), and he knows that these people do not have decent accommodation,\u201d Aglan said. A Hajj package from a licensed agency costs pilgrims approximately $4,760,\u00a0while unauthorized trips cost around $3,700, Aglan says. The average annual household income in Egypt is $1,429 as of 2019, according to the latest figures. Lack of adequate care for pilgrims The tragedy has also underscored Saudi authorities\u2019 inability to curb unauthorized pilgrimages or provide adequate care for those who undertake such journeys, which have been taking place for years. It is unclear how many unauthorized pilgrims made it to this year\u2019s Hajj, but Saudi news outlet Al Sharq Al Awsat reported Tuesday that 141,000 such pilgrims received free medical treatment during the Hajj season. That amounts to approximately 8% of the 1.8 million pilgrims this year. In recent decades, the sheer size of Hajj crowds has been a factor in the number of\u00a0deadly incidents\u00a0during the pilgrimage, including a stampede that killed more than 700 people in 2015. Recognizing the economic potential of religious tourism, Saudi Arabia plans to increase Hajj pilgrim numbers to 5 million by 2030 from just under 2 million now. But some pilgrims have lamented the poor infrastructure and organization of the Hajj. Even those on official tours can spend the bulk of their day walking outdoors in searing heat. Hania Hassan Salama, 65, a homemaker from Egypt, asked her children to draw a mural of the Kaaba on the wall of their house, a tradition in Egypt to announce a pilgrimage. The day the mural was completed, the children lost contact with her. The family was later informed that she had died, her relatives told CNN. Salama had purchased a Hajj package from a licensed tour operator. Her nephew Mustafa Mohammed said responsibility for the large number of deaths partly lies with Saudi authorities. \u201cThis year there was negligence, medical negligence. People were dying in the street and no one was helping them,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cEven if some people went on a visa not designated for Hajj, they do not deserve to be left to die in the street without finding medical help.\u201d Two other pilgrims who recently returned from Hajj told CNN there were insufficient medics or basic facilities to protect worshipers from the effects of the sweltering heat in Saudi Arabia last week. Even those pilgrims who made the journey through official channels said authorities failed to provide enough water, shade or medical support to worshipers. Some\u00a0witnesses have told CNN\u00a0of how they saw worshipers losing consciousness and walked past bodies covered in white cloth. A 44-year-old Indonesian man who only wished to be referred to as Ahmad, recalled seeing many dying from the heat. \u201cAlong the way home, I saw many pilgrims who died. Almost every few hundred meters, there was a body lying and covered with an ihrom (white fabric) cloth.\u201d CNN has reached out to Saudi authorities regarding the reportedly inadequate response to this year\u2019s heat and has yet to hear back. Clamping down on unauthorized pilgrimage Before this year\u2019s Hajj season started, Saudi authorities warned pilgrims against using agents selling unauthorized Hajj packages and had been in contact with other governments in an effort to crack down on the trend. Authorities had also arrested some illegal agents and\u00a0issued warnings about penalties for those found to assist unauthorized pilgrims. Ahead of the pilgrimage this month, Director of Public Security and Head of the Hajj Security Committee, Lieutenant General Muhammad bin Abdullah Al-Bassami, laid out efforts to crack down on unauthorized pilgrims in a televised address, saying \u201cthe security of the pilgrims is a red line.\u201d Regional papers subsequently said that more than 300,000 people had been barred from performing the rites as a result. Since the tragedy, Egyptian authorities appear to be clamping down on unauthorized agencies. The government has ordered the revocation of the licenses of 16 Hajj tourism companies involved in making unauthorized pilgrimages to Mecca and has referred their managers to the public prosecutor. Salem, the 81-year-old Egyptian who died during the Hajj, was buried in the Al-Baqi cemetery in Medina, Saudi Arabia according to an Islamic tradition that a pilgrim is buried in the holy land if he dies during the pilgrimage. His wife plans to return to Cairo Friday after completing the rituals. Until she returns, Mahmoud said the family \u201cis trying to contact her to calm and comfort her, and to urge her to take care of herself because she is there alone.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/middleeast/unauthorized-hajj-muslim-pilgrims-death-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_style_last-safe-abortion-photos", "text": "Sixty years ago this month, a young woman died alone from a self-induced abortion she and her lover had conducted on a motel room floor in Norwich, Connecticut. Her name was Gerri Santoro. Santoro\u2019s death was one of many \u2014 all too many \u2014 which activists and healthcare workers sought to avoid by legalizing abortions and abortion care in the United States. But she became a particular symbol of this movement when a graphic police photograph of her dead body was printed in the feminist publication Ms. Magazine in April 1973, just a few months after the US Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision\u00a0legally protected\u00a0the medical procedure. Today, in the aftermath of that half-century-old ruling being overturned on June 24, 2022 \u2014 a decision which some people fear has triggered the resurgence of conditions,\u00a0and restrictions,\u00a0similar to those that contributed to Santoro\u2019s death \u2014 one artist is reinvigorating visual advocacy of abortion, aiming to change the cultural mindset toward it and those who provide the procedure. Carmen Winant\u2019s new photobook, \u201cThe Last Safe Abortion,\u201d also seeks to memorialize the labor, advocacy and community-building of abortion care providers and women\u2019s health care workers in the near-50-year period that the right to an abortion was legally protected\u00a0across the US. Though particularly salient at this time, Winant\u2019s book isn\u2019t a direct response to the Roe repeal, she told CNN. Rather, the idea had been percolating in her mind for some time, she explained, sparked by having to regularly circumnavigate \u201caggressive\u201d anti-abortion activists proselytizing on the campus of Ohio State University, where she\u2019s an associate professor in the art department. \u201cTheir (visual) strategy is really clear and specific and has been specific for the past three or four decades: blowing up these photographs of so-called aborted fetuses that are really gory and sensational, and using (them) as a confrontational device,\u201d Winant said. \u201cIt really ignited this line of inquiry \u2026 around photography and movement building and consciousness raising. \u201cWhere are our pictures? Where are the pictures of people who are pro-choice and invested in reproductive justice and health care work?\u201d Winant recalled thinking. \u201cWhy have we been so reticent or slow to utilize pictures in our movements?\u201d MYA Network, a national group of clinicians, activists and patients working to normalize abortion care, has also embraced this effort. One of MYA\u2019s initiatives is The Issue of Tissue, which depicts fetal tissues up to around nine weeks old, showing the reality of what early abortions look like, in contrast to the often misleading images long circulated by anti-abortion advocates. Winant is actually best known for her work on birth \u2014 particularly a 2018 Museum of Modern Art exhibit called \u201cMy Birth,\u201d which showed more than 2,000 found photographs \u2014 largely from the 1970s \u2014 drawing from birthing experiences, birth workers and feminist literature. \u201cI am moved by birth in its own right \u2014 as a mysterious and expansive phenomenological experience \u2014 but most of all I am interested in it as a channel through which to study feminist healthcare networks and the building of radical social movements,\u201d Winant wrote in her book. \u201cGiving women information (pictorial or otherwise) about their bodies is a tool of feminist world-building.\u201d \u201cThe Last Safe Abortion\u201d is a continuation of this theme, Winant says. The book demands that the labor and humanity of abortion care providers \u2014 often both invisible and vilified \u2014 be included and appreciated in social and political conversations about reproductive rights, which often also ignore birthing people and women\u2019s healthcare workers. \u201cIt was really important for me to politically put people back in the picture,\u201d Winant told CNN. A long fight for the right to choose Winant drew the collection of photos she curated for her book from more than a dozen institutional, organizational and personal archives, as well as her own, largely centered on the Midwest \u2014 a \u201cparticularly vulnerable area\u201d for reproductive rights, she said.\u00a0  The first photographs in the book are of the interiors of a clinic waiting room, putting viewers into the shoes of a hypothetical staffer or patient who has just walked in, Winant said. From here, the goings on are all too ordinary \u2014 and mundane: Clinic employees demonstrate procedures, replace batteries in clocks, hold workshops, sterilize equipment, check patients in for appointments and celebrate each other\u2019s birthdays. Notably, none show strife or confrontations with protestors, in contrast to the visual narratives that often surround abortion care. The clinics exist in their own context, as a place of safety and community. \u201cThat also felt political: to demonstrate that this work is quotidian and regular and unsensational,\u201d Winant said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much care and dignity \u2014 small steps that are put into making people feel safe. It\u2019s such a significant part of their job.\u201d To Winant, something as simple as answering phones represented a heroic act of solidarity \u2014 \u201cnetworking to save each other\u2019s lives,\u201d she said. The book\u2019s title reflects this mission. As Winant spoke with clinics and their staff in the wake of the Roe overturning, one refrain she consistently heard was the promise and determination to \u201cprovide the last safe abortion\u201d in their state. \u201c\u2018If we do the last legal abortion in Ohio, that is what we will do. We will stay open for as long as we possibly can,\u2019\u201d Winant recalled one staffer saying. \u201cWords as resolute as they are elegiac.\u201d Winant has never really been interested in art for art\u2019s sake, she told CNN, but rather in how it \u201ccirculates in the world and (its) power to impact people on a political level, but also on a deeper level, like something more cellular.\u201d Winant\u2019s work, as well as her own life, also rejects the notion that people who support or have abortions live on one side of the binary to which the debate over abortion rights is often reduced. \u201cThe right to be pregnant and give birth has everything to do with a right to be what feminists would call \u2018unpregnant,\u2019 and not to give birth,\u201d Winant said. \u201cAs someone who has had children, as someone who has had an abortion, that is the same struggle (when) it comes to choice \u2014 and not only our own choices, but the feminist health care networks that support those choices.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/style/last-safe-abortion-photos/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_tech_openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor", "text": "Victor Miller, 42, recently filed paperwork to run for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, but it wasn\u2019t exactly for him: He listed the name of a customized AI chatbot to appear on the ballot. He argued that the chatbot, named VIC \u2013 for \u201cvirtual integrated citizen\u201d \u2013 would use technology from artificial intelligence company OpenAI to make all political decisions and help govern the city. (VIC is not affiliated with a political party.) AI has \u201chelped me in my life personally \u2026 such as helping me with my resume,\u201d Miller told CNN. \u201cI think it could add a layer to help a town. I really want to see that happen.\u201d On Tuesday, however, OpenAI told CNN it shut down Miller\u2019s access to the tool that was being used to interact with and persuade voters. Using ChatGPT in this way, according to the company, is against its policies. AI is making politics even more complicated as government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use AI tools responsibly, and the tech is advancing faster than social, legal and regulatory guardrails. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken action against these uses of our technology for violating our policies against political campaigning,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told CNN. On its website, OpenAI states it prohibits \u201cengaging in political campaigning or lobbying, including generating campaign materials personalized to or targeted at specific demographics.\u201d Miller said he was motivated to create VIC after he was denied access to city records about policies and procedures because he made his request anonymously. \u201cIf I was able to ask AI and interact with this new intelligence, it would have known the law and I would have gotten the records,\u201d he said. The city did not respond to request for comment on the denial of records, but Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray told CNN in a statement that he is \u201cclosely\u201d monitoring Miller\u2019s bid for mayor. \u201cWyoming law is clear that, to run for office, one must be a \u2018qualified elector,\u2019 which necessitates being a real person,\u201d Gray said in the statement. \u201cTherefore, an AI bot is not a qualified elector.\u201d He also suggested the chatbot is essentially a fig leaf for a Miller candidacy. Gray said he wrote a letter to the Cheyenne municipal clerk raising his concerns about the bid. Although the public-facing version of VIC has been removed by OpenAI, Miller said it still works on his own ChatGPT account. He plans to bring it, along with a microphone, to a local Cheyenne library and give voters the opportunity to directly ask it questions via its voice-to-text feature. OpenAI told CNN it also took action against another candidate in the UK who was using its AI models to help campaign for Parliament. Steve Endacott, chairman of an AI company called Neural Voice, answers questions from voters via AI Steve, a chatbot, on his site. He is running as an independent. Endacott did not respond to a request for comment. His website offered a ChatGPT chatbot where voters were able to leave opinions and help create policies. If a voter asked the tool a question about AI Steve\u2019s policies and it didn\u2019t have an answer, it would conduct a search and create a policy suggestion. (While his website continues to operate, the tool is no longer powered by ChatGPT.) \u2018Gimmick is the right word\u2019 Although AI chatbots are getting smarter, some experts told CNN the technology should never substitute for human judgment in running any part of government. \u201cWhen it comes to AI now and what it will be like in the future, it should never be used to make automated decisions,\u201d said Jen Golbeck, a professor at the College of Information Sciences at the University of Maryland. \u201cAI has always been designed for decision support \u2013 it gives some data to help a human make decisions but is not set up to make decisions by itself.\u201d The emergence of AI political candidates also comes amid growing concerns about how the spread of misinformation could impact elections. Earlier this year, for example, a fake recording of a candidate in Slovakia saying he rigged the election went viral. Golbeck said, however, that there may be a place for AI in politics when it comes to helping with various tasks, such as answering forms from constituents or directing how to get problems solved. \u201cYou may be able to train a chatbot with all of the knowledge found in an office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the decision making should always be left to humans.\u201d David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, agreed, noting the people behind an AI candidacy are leaning into \u201ca cultural moment\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. \u201cGimmick is the right word for it,\u201d Karpf told CNN. \u201cChatGPT is not qualified to run your government.\u201d Karpf said he doesn\u2019t believe lawmakers need to make formal legislation around AI chatbots running for office because \u201cno one is going to vote for an AI chatbot to run a city.\u201d Karpf believes that the timing of these cases is noteworthy, too. \u201cWe have a very serious election coming up, and I don\u2019t mind levity in it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this is: We should laugh for a minute and get back to work.\u201d But Miller said he hopes the attention around his efforts inspires more AI candidates in the months ahead. \u201cI think this can expand beyond the mayor and Parliament, and [reach the whole] world,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/tech/openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_israel-ultra-orthodox-draft-explainer-intl", "text": "The Israeli Supreme Court issued a ruling on Tuesday ordering the government to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military. Since Israel\u2019s founding, ultra-Orthodox Jews have been exempt from mandatory military service. The court also said that the government could no longer fund any religious schools (called \u201cyeshivas\u201d) whose students don\u2019t participate in the draft. Though both men and women are subject to Israel\u2019s mandatory conscription, the ruling only applies to ultra-Orthodox men. Who are the ultra-Orthodox? The ultra-Orthodox, known as \u201cHaredim,\u201d in Hebrew, practice a form of Judaism that is marked by stringent religious observance and strict lifestyles. They make up around 14% of Israel\u2019s 9.5 million citizens, and are the fastest-growing segment of the population. Because they are disproportionately young, they make up 24% of recruitment-age Israelis, according to the Israel Democracy Institute. Why don\u2019t they serve in the military? Some do, but far fewer than most Israeli Jews. The vast majority do not participate in the country\u2019s mandatory military service. For ultra-Orthodox men, studying Judaism\u2019s religious texts is central not only to their own lives but \u2013 they believe \u2013\u00a0the preservation of all of Judaism, and even the defense of Israel. Torah study begins in the teenage years and often continues into young adulthood. It is a full-time pursuit that precludes secular study, participating in the workforce (and therefore paying taxes) \u2013 or serving in the military, as most non-ultra-Orthodox Israeli Jews do. Technically, the military service exemption applied to young men who were actively studying at a yeshiva. In practice, anyone who tells a recruiter that he studies at yeshiva \u2013 anyone who presents themselves to be ultra-Orthodox \u2013\u202fcan get out of service. \u201cThe Jewish people survived persecutions, pogroms and wars only thanks to the preservation of their uniqueness \u2013 the Torah and the mitzvot,\u201d the head of Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Shas party said on Tuesday, referring to the 613 commandments that rule orthodox Jewish life. \u201cThis is our secret weapon against all enemies, as promised by the Creator of the world. Even here, in the Jewish state, alongside our precious fighters who sacrifice their lives against the enemies, we will continue to guard those who learn the Torah, which preserves our special power and creates miracles in battle.\u201d What did the Supreme Court say? In essence, the court said that the ultra-Orthodox could not be treated differently from other Israeli Jews. The law that mandates military service, it said, also applies to them. (Palestinian citizens of Israel remain exempt from service.) \u201cThere is no legal framework that makes it possible to distinguish between yeshiva students and those destined for military service,\u201d the court said in its ruling. The government \u201cseriously harmed the rule of law and the principle according to which all individuals are equal before the law.\u201d Why is it important now? The fight over whether the ultra-Orthodox should serve in the military is nothing new. Their exemption is as old as the state of Israel itself \u2013\u00a0in place from its founding in 1948. The Supreme Court ripped up that longstanding rule 50 years later, telling the government that allowing the ultra-Orthodox to get out of conscription violated equal protection principles. In the decades since, successive governments and Knessets (the Israeli parliament) have tried to solve the issue, only to be told repeatedly by the court that their efforts were illegal. The latest government attempt to paper over the problem, in place since 2018, expired at the end of March. It of course took on new significance on October 7, when Hamas and other militant groups crossed over from Gaza and killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, and took hundreds captive. The months since have put incredible strain on Israel\u2019s military, and particularly on the reservists who have been called up for extended tours of duty. Growing fears of a full-scale war with Lebanon only add to those worries. Ultra-Orthodox politicians argue that the fight over getting them to serve is being used a political bludgeon, and that the military has no manpower problem. The Israel Defense Forces\u2019 (IDF) leaders disagree. \u201cWe want to move forward, not because it\u2019s nice, [but] first of all because it\u2019s necessary,\u201d IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said recently. \u201cEvery such battalion that we establish, an ultra-Orthodox battalion, decreases the need for the deployment of many thousands of reservists thanks to the mandatory service people.\u201d The ultra-Orthodox service exemption has also stoked resentment among Israelis who have spent months away from their families while serving in the military, and seen loved ones killed. It has further opened the religious-secular divide in Israel that has always been present, but has grown, especially as the ultra-Orthodox share of the population increases. What does it mean for the war? In the short term, probably very little. Because the ultra-Orthodox have such strict religious practices, they usually serve in special units. The IDF is working to expand those units, but it will take time. \u201cAccording to the calculations of the army, there were 1,800 that were conscripted last year,\u201d Gilad Malach, director of the Ultra-Orthodox in Israel program at the Israel Democracy Institute, said after Tuesday\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe army needs to do some change in order to conscript them. According to the army, next year the army can receive 4,800.\u201d Israel\u2019s Deputy Attorney General Gil Limon instructed the government on Tuesday to immediately begin recruitment of an additional 3,000 ultra-Orthodox men, which the military has already said it could accommodate. He also that that \u201cin light of the current needs of the army and to promote equality in the burden,\u201d the military must \u201cdevelop and present a recruitment plan to increase this number.\u201d Where it could have a bigger impact is if it causes Israel\u2019s governing coalition to fall apart, which is entirely possible. Why is this ruling bad news for Netanyahu? When Netanyahu formed his government coalition in late 2022, he included two ultra-Orthodox parties \u2013 Shas and United Torah Judaism \u2013 to form a thin majority. Because yeshiva study is so important to those parties, this ruling could have big ramifications. For the moment, they seem to be downplaying the decision, saying they have no plans to pull out of the coalition. Despite the court\u2019s ruling, the ultra-Orthodox parties are still trying to pass legislation in the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, that would enshrine the draft exemption in law. Because the IDF doesn\u2019t have the capacity yet to draft the ultra-Orthodox into special units, it\u2019s unlikely that many will be drafted anytime soon. Once those draft orders start going out, the court\u2019s order for the government to stop funding yeshivas whose students refuse to serve could have a big impact \u2013\u00a0and affect whether the ultra-Orthodox party leaders still think there\u2019s benefit to being part of the government. What comes next? This story has been full of endless twists and turns. It will almost certainly not be the final word. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party, along with his ultra-Orthodox allies, will continue to try to pass a law enshrining the draft exemption in law. But as the past decades have proven, there is little guarantee that they will be able to do that in a way that satisfies the\u00a0Supreme\u00a0Court.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/middleeast/israel-ultra-orthodox-draft-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Opposition figure Leila De Lima, who was released on bail last November after\u00a0she was acquitted of two counts, was cleared of a third and final charge on Monday, her lawyer told state broadcaster PTV. The charges stemmed from allegations by Duterte that De Lima had received payoffs from convicted drug gangs to fund her 2016 senatorial bid. More than 6,000 people were killed in\u00a0anti-drug operations\u00a0during Duterte\u2019s tenure as president from 2016 to 2022, according to police data. Many of the extrajudicial killings of suspected drug offenders took place in the poorest areas of the country \u2013 and independent monitors believe the number of those killed could be much higher. Human rights activists had long criticized De Lima\u2019s prosecution and lengthy detention, pointing out that she was held in a police cell despite not having been convicted of any charges. They say her treatment is emblematic of a deteriorating rights situation in a country where political activists and the media often face threats, harassment and even death for attempting to keep those in power in check. On Monday, supporters who gathered outside the courthouse in Muntinlupa city shouted, \u201cLeila is free,\u201d according to a livestreamed video posted on her official Facebook page. Speaking to reporters outside the court, De Lima said\u00a0Duterte would be held responsible for \u201csins committed\u201d against Filipinos. \u201cI\u2019m only one of the victims. Thousands of Filipinos were murdered during the bloody and fake \u2018drug war.\u2019 Many families lost loved ones,\u201d she said. \u201cFor those who weren\u2019t killed, they were left languishing in jail because of the incorrect and twisted enforcement of the law. I\u2019m one of those who have experienced unjust imprisonment.\u201d During his tenure as president, Duterte\u00a0repeatedly said the\u00a0killings\u00a0of\u00a0drug\u00a0suspects are lawful if police are acting in self defense. He had previously admitted to killing drug suspects\u00a0during his time as mayor of Davao City. In July last year, the International Criminal Court (ICC)\u00a0rejected an appeal by the Philippine government to block an investigation by prosecutors into Duterte\u2019s drug war. An ICC judge said the dismissal by the Hague-based court meant the Philippines has exhausted its options to appeal. Duterte\u2019s administration and its successor under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have pushed back against the ICC\u2019s probe, denouncing the investigations as unjust. The Philippines was formerly a signatory to the ICC but Duterte canceled the country\u2019s membership after the court began probing his drug war. But under the ICC\u2019s withdrawal mechanism, the court keeps jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period of a state \u2013 in this case, between 2016 and 2019, when the Philippines\u2019 pullout became official.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/asia/philippines-leila-de-lima-acquitted-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_sport_jim-schlossnagle-texas-baseball", "text": "Jim Schlossnagle was incensed on Monday when a reporter asked him about his future as the Texas A&M baseball team\u2019s head coach. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty selfish of you to ask me that question to be honest with you. But, I left my family to be the coach at Texas A&M. I took the job at Texas A&M to never take another job again,\u201d Schlossnagle said in response to a reporter\u2019s question about rumors that he was considering taking the job at the University of Texas, A&M\u2019s hated rival. \u201cAnd that hasn\u2019t changed in my mind, and that\u2019s unfair to talk about something like that. \u2026 I understand you gotta ask the question, but I gave up a big part of my life to come take this job and I\u2019ve poured every ounce of my soul in this job, and I\u2019ve given this job every single ounce I could possibly give it. So, write that.\u201d Less than 24 hours later, Schlossnagle was a Texas Longhorn. It\u2019s a stunning turnaround that has infuriated Aggies, whose athletic teams will finally be back in regular competition with Texas once the Longhorns join the Southeastern Conference later on this year. The two schools have long been intrastate rivals and the rivalry runs deep \u2013 A&M\u2019s unofficial fight song, \u201cThe Aggie War Hymn,\u201d was penned by a graduate who wanted to express his hatred of the University of Texas while he sat in a trench in France during World War I. Schlossnagle\u2019s about-face came so quickly that his social media presents quite the sight: Posts celebrating the Aggies\u2019 performance in the College World Series  sit right below photo illustrations of the coach clad in Texas\u2019 burnt orange and white. A&M athletic director Trev Alberts said in a statement that Schlossnagle gave word of his decision to leave for Texas shortly after the team arrived back in College Station, Texas, after being defeated by the University of Tennessee in Omaha, Nebraska. That arrival was just hours after Schlossnagle\u2019s terse answer over his future at Texas A&M, where he had coached for three years. \u201cAfter our baseball team arrived back in College Station earlier today, Jim informed me of his desire to leave Texas A&M,\u201d Alberts said. \u201cWhile we are certainly disappointed, we are grateful for his contributions in helping our baseball program reach unprecedented heights. Baseball success is important to everyone associated with Texas A&M, we will not stop in our pursuit of excellence and our commitment to baseball will not waiver.\u201d For his part, Schlossnagle acknowledged he was likely to anger the Aggie fanbase. \u201cAlthough I know many will be upset with my decision, I chose to make a change to join a longtime friend to continue my career as a college baseball coach,\u201d he said in a statement released through Texas A&M. \u201cThe run to the National Championship game was truly a remarkable one this year, and I will savor the memories and true friendships I have made there for a lifetime.\u201d In his introductory press conference in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday, Schlossnagle thanked A&M for his time at the school and apologized for not being able to explain his decision to his team before departing. He also apologized to the reporter who he called selfish in Monday\u2019s press conference. \u201cHe\u2019s a young reporter. He asked a question that was an obvious question,\u201d Schlossnagle said. \u201cI wish I could have answered that better. But in the moment, all 30 minutes after the last pitch, all I could think about was our players. And I really wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk about myself for the future.\u201d He added that the tense moment at Monday\u2019s press conference was genuine, because at the moment he truly did feel that way. But he cited his relationship with Texas athletic director Chris Del Conte \u2013 whom he worked with extensively at Texas Christian University \u2013  and the opportunity at Texas as ultimately leading him to make his decision on Tuesday. \u201cI get it, I get it. All I can say is, I have a career too,\u201d Schlossnagle said when asked about upset Aggies fans. \u201cI have a personal life as well. I have goals and I simply felt like \u2013 no negative at A&M, just the positives of the alignment (at Texas) and my relationship with Chris.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/sport/jim-schlossnagle-texas-baseball/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_27_europe_julian-assange-profile-intl-cmd", "text": "Julian Assange\u00a0started his WikiLeaks whistleblowing website on a quest for \u201cradical transparency and truth,\u201d a mission that turned an already polarizing personality into a notorious character and\u00a0earned him\u00a0crusaders and critics\u00a0in equal measure. His\u00a0long-running battle against extradition to the United States had been making its way through UK courts for years until a remarkable plea deal on Monday. Assange, 52, left the UK after agreeing to plead guilty to a single felony charge in exchange for time served. The deal was finalized in a remote US court in the Pacific on Wednesday morning, after which he is expected to return to his native Australia. It has been 12 years since Assange was a free man. He spent the past five years in London\u2019s high-security Belmarsh prison and nearly seven years before that holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in the English capital,\u00a0trying to avoid arrest. He was facing life imprisonment in the US for publishing hundreds of thousands of sensitive military and government documents supplied by former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning more than a dozen years ago. But recently there has been increased pressure for a resolution to Assange\u2019s case. In April, US President Joe Biden offered\u00a0Assange\u2019s supporters a glimmer of hope saying his administration was\u00a0\u201cconsidering\u201d a request from Australia\u00a0to drop its charges against the WikiLeaks founder. The remarks were described as an \u201cencouraging\u201d signal by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who added that Assange had \u201calready paid a significant price\u201d and \u201cenough is enough.\u201d The ascent of Assange Born in Townsville, eastern Queensland, in 1971, Assange had a less than conventional upbringing. His education was a combination of home schooling and correspondence courses, since his family moved frequently. In his teens, he discovered a natural proficiency for computing, but his activities \u2013 which included accessing several secure systems, including the Pentagon and NASA, under the hacker alias \u201cMendax\u201d \u2013 soon put him on the radar of authorities. In 1991, he was charged with 31 counts of cybercrime by Australian authorities but only received a small fine at sentencing after pleading guilty to most of the charges. Following his brush with the law, Assange worked as a computer security consultant, traveled and briefly studied physics at the University of Melbourne before withdrawing from the course. His vision when starting WikiLeaks in 2006 was that it would be a kind of online repository, which would publish anonymously submitted documents, video and other sensitive materials after vetting them. It ran for several years, uploading material ranging from the US military\u2019s operating manual for its detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to internal documents from the Church of Scientology and some of 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin\u2019s stolen emails. But it was catapulted to global attention in 2010 with a video that later became known as \u201cCollateral Murder.\u201d Back then, journalist Atika Shubert caught wind of footage circulating which claimed to show a deadly 2007 US helicopter attack in Iraq. Then a reporter for CNN in London, Shubert tracked down the individual in possession of the footage. On first impressions, Assange was \u201cvague\u201d and \u201celusive,\u201d Shubert recalled. With the benefit of hindsight, she now believes his behavior was the result of \u201csitting on this cache of documents from Chelsea Manning and trying to figure out how to publish it.\u201d He showed up unannounced at CNN\u2019s London office soon after, a USB stick with thousands of classified documents in the palm of his hand. \u201cThat was my first introduction to the world of data dumps and what exactly WikiLeaks was doing - the scale of it - which I had never heard of before,\u201d Shubert said. WikiLeaks ultimately released the video from the US helicopter attack in Iraq, sparking condemnation from human rights activists and earning rebuke from US defense officials. By the year\u2019s end, the organization had gone on to publish nearly half a million classified documents relating to the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Under a global spotlight As WikiLeaks continued its disclosures, Assange found himself the latest cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre \u2013 his every movement intensely scrutinized. And with each headline, his infamy grew among those who did not share his vision. Fidel Narvaez, former consul of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, met Assange in 2011, after WikiLeaks released another huge archive \u2013 this time of secret US diplomatic cables. The pair became close friends through the years. \u201cAssange can be stubborn, sometimes he can clash with other people, but once you know him \u2026 he is extremely respectful and warm. He has a great sense of humor,\u201d Narvaez told CNN. \u201cHis one mission in life is publishing, which is what he has done with WikiLeaks.\u201d Assange\u2019s story, as the \u201cteen hacker who became insurgent in information war\u201d as the Guardian put it in 2011, sounded like the plot of a Hollywood blockbuster. Soon his tale was immortalized in documentaries and films, perhaps most notably in 2013\u2019s \u201cThe Fifth Estate,\u201d which Assange labeled a \u201cgeriatric snoozefest\u201d that used what he considered flawed source material. For journalist and author James Ball, who briefly worked at WikiLeaks and was based for a time at Ellingham Hall, a remote manor house north of London where Assange holed up before seeking refuge in Ecuador\u2019s embassy, the infancy of WikiLeaks was an \u201cexhilarating\u201d time. \u201cYou were working on the kind of material that we (had) really never seen before. Leaks have become a bit more common since, but the idea that you could peruse through these huge sets of records that showed what happened in conflicts or what actually happened in closed rooms, was sort of completely new,\u201d Ball told CNN. WikiLeaks became a household name thanks to its frequent data dumps, but some were starting to question the founder\u2019s behavior. For many, his polarizing personality became an issue. Ball added: \u201cHe sort of liked the attention. \u2026 He liked the fuss that (the disclosures) caused but he was oddly incurious actually about the documents.\u201d Others offer alternative explanations for Assange\u2019s eccentricities. Narvaez said the Assange he knew was \u201chyperactive and workaholic\u201d and pointed to his diagnosed autism spectrum disorder as an element of his personality. Shifting attitudes Such questions aside, WikiLeaks essentially ground to a halt when Assange was accused of sexual assault in Sweden in August 2010. The organization\u2019s focus shifted from offense to defense, despite the transparency campaigner\u2019s vehement denial of the allegations against him. There were mounting calls for Assange to leave WikiLeaks and, when he didn\u2019t, many cut ties with it. Assange labeled it \u201ca smear campaign\u201d orchestrated to pave the way for his further extradition to the US and refused to go to Sweden for questioning. In June 2012, while out on bail from UK officials over the Swedish probe, he opted for a nuclear option and knocked on the door at 3 Hans Crescent, where he requested political asylum from Ecuador. Outside the confines of his diplomatic shelter, the world questioned whether Assange was trying to circumvent justice. Over time, his relationship with his host soured along with the arrival of a new president in Ecuador in 2017. Assange was \u201can inherited problem\u201d for Lenin Moreno, who was facing pressure from the US to expel him from the diplomatic bolthole. \u201cIt was obvious that former President Moreno was going to give in to external and internal pressure,\u201d Narvaez said. Narvaez, seen as too close to the unwanted houseguest, was asked to leave in July 2018 amid a shake-up of the diplomatic mission\u2019s staff. \u201cI left him isolated, and I was the last person he trusted,\u201d Narvaez said. Nine months later, in April 2019, Assange was pulled kicking and screaming from the building by London\u2019s Metropolitan Police on an extradition warrant from the US Justice Department. Legal limbo Once in British custody, Assange had lived, mostly isolated, in a three-by-two-meter cell at Belmarsh prison in southeast London. The prison has the capacity to hold over 900 inmates and is known for once housing infamous terror suspects such as\u00a0Abu Hamza al-Masri\u00a0within its high-security unit. The US accused Assange of endangering lives by publishing secret military documents in 2010 and 2011. He was wanted on 18 criminal charges relating to his organization\u2019s dissemination of classified material and diplomatic cables and faced up to 175 years in prison conditions much harsher than here in the UK. Fighting his corner since he entered Belmarsh: his wife, Stella Assange. The couple married in March 2022, while he was in prison. Stella, the mother of Assange\u2019s two young sons, called her husband a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d outside court in March and has repeatedly voiced her fear that, if extradited, he could take his own life. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about how he\u2019s doing. Physically, he\u2019s aged prematurely,\u201d she previously told CNN. \u201cHe\u2019s on medication. As you know, in October 2021, he had a mini-stroke and he has all sorts of health problems.\u201d She had labeled the US\u2019 latest guarantees that Assange could lean on First Amendment protections at trial\u00a0\u201cblatant weasel words\u201d in a statement on April 16. \u201cThe diplomatic note does nothing to relieve our family\u2019s extreme distress about his future \u2013 his grim expectation of spending the rest of his life in isolation in US prison for publishing award-winning journalism,\u201d she said. Nick Vamos, head of business crime at Peters & Peters law firm and a former head of extradition at the UK\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service, told CNN that on the other side of the coin, some might suggest that \u201cyou should allow the judicial system to follow through to its conclusion\u201d without being influenced by protests from supporters. Assange\u2019s team had argued his potential extradition was for political reasons and that a handover to the US violated the European Convention on Human Rights. It was a claim supported by independent experts. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Jill Edwards, in February called on the British government to halt a possible extradition and reiterated her concerns about Assange\u2019s fitness and \u201cthe potential for him to receive a wholly disproportionate sentence in the United States.\u201d Marking Assange\u2019s five years at Belmarsh, Amnesty International\u2019s Secretary General Agn\u00e8s Callamard had warned that Assange, if extradited, would \u201cbe at risk of serious abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, which would violate the prohibition on torture or other ill-treatment.\u201d She added that US assurances over his treatment could not be relied upon as they are \u201criddled with loopholes.\u201d Far-reaching repercussions Beyond the personal costs for Assange, many had expressed concern about the broader implications for press freedom around the world if he had been sent to the US. Five international media organizations that collaborated with Assange previously called the US government to end its prosecution of him for publishing classified material. In a 2022 letter, representatives for The New York Times, the Guardian, Le Monde, El Pa\u00eds and Der Spiegel argued publishing is not a crime. \u201cObtaining and disclosing sensitive information when necessary in the public interest is a core part of the daily work of journalists. If that work is criminalised, our public discourse and our democracies are made significantly weaker,\u201d the letter stated. Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the plea deal averted \u201cthe worst-case scenario for press freedom, but this deal contemplates that Assange will have served five years in prison for activities that journalists engage in every day. He continued, \u201cIt will cast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world.\u201d Likewise, former Guardian editor and collaborator Alan Rusbridger wrote on X that while it was \u201cgood news that Assange is apparently free,\u201d he expressed concern at the repercussions of his years-long legal battle. \u201cHis treatment was a warning to journalists and whistleblowers to keep quiet in future,\u201d he added. And I suspect it will have worked.\u201d This story has been updated with latest developments following Assange\u2019s US plea deal.

{"id": "2024_06_26_sport_euro-2024-portugal-georgia-czech-republic-turkey-spt-intl", "text": "Georgia caused the biggest upset of Euro 2024 so far with a sensational 2-0 win over Portugal to book its place in the round of 16. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia gave Georgia the lead inside two minutes after an awful error in the Portuguese defense, before Georges Mikautadze scored the second from the penalty spot in the second half. Competing at the first major tournament in the nation\u2019s history, Georgia has captured the hearts of fans at Euro 2024 for its fearlessness and high-intensity football. Both were on display again in Wednesday\u2019s deserved victory as Georgia eventually saw out the win with relative ease, qualifying for the knockout stages as one of the tournament\u2019s four best third-place teams. Elsewhere, Turkey\u2019s 2-1 win against Czech Republic means the team finishes second in Group F behind Portugal. Portugal had already qualified for the knockout stages with wins over Czech Republic and Turkey and was looking to become just the second team after Spain to win all three group games at Euro 2024. Georgia, meanwhile, knew only a win would be enough to reach the round of 16. The lowest-ranked team at Euro 2024, Georgia had proven to be no pushover in its games so far during the tournament, losing narrowly against Turkey and drawing with Czech Republic. Given the team had already qualified, perhaps a lack of focus and intensity led to Portugal gifting Georgia the opening goal less than two minutes into the game. An awful back pass by Antonio Silva gave the ball straight to Mikautadze, whose through ball found Kvaratskhelia inside the box and the Napoli forward finished brilliantly across Diogo Costa. So loud was the roar that went up inside the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen that it might have been heard back in Tbilisi. Portugal dominated possession for the rest of first half but was limited to long shots by a diligent Georgia defense. Goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili was equal to them all, keeping out efforts from an increasingly frustrated Ronaldo and Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix. Ronaldo let his annoyance get the better of him after claiming he should have been awarded a penalty for having his shirt pulled, resulting in yellow card for dissent. For all of Portugal\u2019s dominance, Georgia should have doubled its lead after 35 minutes but Giorgi Gvelesiani couldn\u2019t make contact with his header after rising highest to try and get on the end of Kvaratskhelia\u2019s free kick. Kvaratskhelia then had a glorious opportunity to get Georgia\u2019s second just minutes into the second half after more poor defending from Portugal, but scuffed his shot from just 10 yards out. Georgia, however, was not to be denied its second goal. After a long wait for a break in play \u2013 that only came when Mamardashvili sensationally tipped Diogo Dalot\u2019s long-range strike behind for a corner \u2013 VAR ruled that Otar Kiteishvili had been fouled inside the penalty area in an earlier passage of play. Mikautadze stepped up and calmly side-footed the ball into the bottom corner to send thousands of Georgia fans inside the Arena AufSchalke wild for a second time this evening. That was Mikautadze\u2019s third goal of the tournament, making him the top scorer at Euro 2024. Georgia was far from just hanging on to its lead in the second half and was good value for its two-goal advantage, comfortably holding Portugal at arm\u2019s length. Of the two teams, Georgia looked the most likely to get the next goal and was a constant threat on the counterattack. Nelson Semedo had the best chance of the half for Portugal, but the indomitable Mamardashvili got down sharply again to preserve the clean sheet. When the referee blew for full time, the Georgian bench emptied onto the pitch and the players celebrated in front of their fans as though they had won the entire tournament.

{"id": "2024_06_25_africa_kenya-protests-tax-rises-intl", "text": "Kenyan President William Ruto denounced protests on Tuesday that saw parliament stormed and at least five people shot dead as \u201ctreasonous\u201d \u2013 but did not address the swelling outrage against a controversial finance bill that\u00a0sparked the widespread demonstrations. Kenya is in the grip of nationwide protests against proposed tax hikes, culminating in Tuesday\u2019s \u201ctotal shutdown\u201d of the country, which quickly turned violent as police used tear gas and live rounds on protesters. The controversial finance bill has unleashed widespread protests movement vowing for \u201c7 Days of Rage.\u201d Last week, the government scrapped some tax increases, including a proposed 16% value-added tax on bread along with taxes on motor vehicles, vegetable oil and mobile money transfers. But the concessions have not been enough to quell protests amid the rising cost of living. A CNN team saw\u00a0two bodies lying motionless on the ground in Nairobi as the country\u2019s parliament was breached. Kenyan police were also seen beating and later arresting\u00a0some paramedics\u00a0who were helping injured protesters. During a nationwide address after parliament was set alight, Ruto said the events on Tuesday were a grave threat to \u201cnational security\u201d and that the conversation around the bill had been \u201chijacked by dangerous people.\u201d \u201cIt is not in order, or even conceivable, that criminals pretending to be peaceful protesters can reign terror against the people, their elected representatives, and the institutions established under our Constitution and expect to go scot-free,\u201d the president said, adding that democratic expression and crime must be isolated from one another. Kenya\u2019s defense ministry said the military has been deployed to support the country\u2019s police services as human rights and civil society groups criticize the heavy-handed response by the police on Tuesday. It was reported that at least five people were shot dead and around 31 were injured during Tuesday\u2019s protests. Of these, 13 were hit with live bullets, four with rubber bullets, and three with launcher canisters, according to a joint statement by Amnesty International Kenya, the Kenya Medical Association, the Law Society of Kenya, and Police Reforms Working Group Kenya. The joint statement also accused the police of shooting at a medical emergency center located at a church. CNN has reached out to the\u00a0Kenyan police for comment. \u201cThe use of live bullets must now stop,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDespite the assurance by the government that the right to assembly would be protected and facilitated, today\u2019s protests have spiraled into violence. Human rights observers and medical officers have reported several incidents of human rights violation.\u201d The demonstrations, sparked by the Finance Bill 2024, have seen citizens rally under the banner of \u201c7 Days of Rage,\u201d as the nation faces more days of upheaval. The dramatic scenes that unfolded in the nation\u2019s capital saw government buildings set on fire and a ceremonial mace stolen from Parliament in the melee.  Kenyan lawmakers were evacuated from Parliament as police went up against protesters, CNN affiliate NTV Kenya reported. Internet monitoring site\u00a0NetBlocks reported a \u201cmajor disruption\u201d to internet connectivity Tuesday. Nairobi\u2019s City Hall, the office of the Governor of Nairobi, was also set on fire, live visuals from CNN affiliate Citizen TV showed. A fire could be seen blazing through a lower-ground window, with other windows also emitting smoke. According to Citizen TV, some people were seen removing furniture, including chairs, from the building. Vehicles parked at Kenya\u2019s Supreme Court, which is close to the City Hall, were also set on fire. Earlier on Tuesday, Auma Obama, the half-sister of former United States President Barack Obama, was teargassed by police during an interview with CNN live on air, while protesting\u00a0against the bill. \u201cI can\u2019t even see anymore, we\u2019re being teargassed,\u201d Obama said in dramatic footage captured by a CNN team on the ground. Obama, a\u00a0Kenyan-British activist, was speaking to CNN alongside a group of young protesters when the group was teargassed in Nairobi. A spokesman for former President Obama declined to comment on the tear gas incident on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m here because look at what\u2019s happening. Young\u00a0Kenyans are demonstrating for their rights. They are demonstrating with flags and banners,\u201d Obama said. Accusations of abductions Security forces have also been accused of abducting prominent Kenyans, particularly those who have large social media followings Amnesty International\u00a0Kenya\u00a0says it is investigating the whereabouts of up to 12 people who were \u201cabducted in the middle of night\u201d ahead of Tuesday\u2019s planned protests. The list includes bloggers, content creators, human rights defenders, a doctor, and a parliamentary staffer, Amnesty\u00a0Kenya\u00a0executive director Ir\u0169ng\u0169 Houghton told CNN. \u201cWe are horrified by some of the testimonies we have heard over the last 24 hours. We have about 12 people unaccounted for who have been picked up, in many cases, by people who are uniformed or not uniformed,\u201d Houghton said, adding that that they had not received legal assistance and their families didn\u2019t know their whereabouts. \u201cWe are now seeing not just abductions but disappearances,\u201d he said. CNN has reached out to the Kenyan police for comment. Kenya\u2019s opposition leader Raila Odinga called for the government to \u201cimmediately stop the violence its agencies are meting out on citizens.\u201d In a statement on X, Odinga also called for the arrest of police officers who are alleged to have shot and killed protesters, as well as for the immediate withdrawal of the country\u2019s controversial finance bill. International leaders urged for calm on Tuesday. The United Nations Secretary General called on Kenya\u2019s police and security forces to \u201cexercise restraint,\u201d his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday, adding that he was \u201cdeeply concerned over the reported violence that we\u2019ve seen.\u201d The African Union Commission called on all stakeholders to refrain from further violence. A statement from the body said its chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat urges \u201call stakeholders to exercise calm and refrain from further violence. The chairperson also appeals to national stakeholders to engage in constructive dialogue to address the contentious issues that led to the protests in the supreme interest of Kenya.\u201d The protests come as\u00a0Kenya\u2019s standing gains global prominence as US President Joe Biden designated\u00a0the country a \u201cmajor non-NATO ally\u201d on Monday, marking the first time a sub-Saharan African nation has received this status. In May, Biden announced his decision to elevate\u00a0Kenya\u00a0to this designation while hosting President Ruto at the White House for a grand state visit, celebrating 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations. Tuesday also saw hundreds of Kenyan police officers arrive in Haiti\u2019s capital to lead a multinational mission to support Haiti\u2019s National Police in battling deadly gangs that have\u00a0seized control\u00a0of much of Port-au-Prince.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/africa/kenya-protests-tax-rises-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_25_europe_france-debate-attal-bardella-bompard-intl", "text": "Three of France\u2019s highest-profile candidates in the country\u2019s upcoming legislative elections sparred in the first major debate of the campaign on Tuesday. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal squared off against Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right National Rally, and Manuel Bompard of the leftist alliance dubbed the New Popular Front in a wide-ranging, sometimes chaotic two-hour affair. Attal, 35, and Bardella, 28, are two of the country\u2019s youngest and most popular politicians.\u00a0After serving in various positions in Macron\u2019s government, Attal was named the youngest prime minister in French history earlier this year. Bardella led the National Rally to a dominant showing at the European elections on June 9. Bompard, 38, does not have the same sort of name recognition or leadership position. He was elected to the French National Assembly in 2022 representing Marseille and is a member of the far-left political party France Unbowed. None of the three candidates appeared to land any knockout blows or move the needle enough to sway the opinion of voters. Bardella didn\u2019t appear to sufficiently address criticisms that his party platform is short of specifics. Attal didn\u2019t seem to give angry voters a reason to opt for continuity. And Bompard\u2019s presence on the stage served as a reminder to voters that the left has not yet decided who will lead them if they win the vote. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really a punchline that was striking or impactful,\u201d said Jean Petaux, a political scientist and expert in French politics. French voters will head to the polls on June 30 and July 7 for a two-round snap election that President Emmanuel Macron called after the National Rally crushed his centrist political movement during the European elections. The move took the French political establishment and society at large by surprise. Not even Attal was aware he was about to lose his job until shortly before the announcement. Macron framed the decision as an exercise in democracy, an opportunity for the French to clarify who they want running the country. But it\u2019s incredibly risky. Macron is gambling that the higher stakes national vote, which draws greater turnout and more scrutiny than European contests, will see the French spurn the National Rally\u2019s anti-immigrant, euroskeptic agenda in favor of more moderate political forces. He\u2019s also assuming that French voters use the runoff, as they have historically, to keep the far right out of power. As things stand, however, Macron will lose his bet. Opinion polls conducted since the snap elections were announced show the National Rally\u2019s momentum has continued to hold, while France\u2019s numerous left-leaning parties have put aside their various ideological differences to jointly field candidates across the country. A survey released on Sunday by pollster IFOP found the National Rally leading all parties with the support of 35% of voters. The New Popular Front, the leftist alliance, came in second with 30% and Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble dropped to third with 20%. If those results hold, the French legislature would be thrown into a state of political paralysis. No party would amass enough votes to meet the 289-seat threshold for an absolute majority in the 577-seat lower chamber, the National Assembly. Macron\u2019s party is already governing without a majority after its poorer-than-expected showing in the 2022 legislative elections, forcing it to either seek out coalitions to pass legislation or use a constitutional tool to force through new laws \u2013 including last year\u2019s controversial pension reform that raised the retirement age to 64 for most workers \u2013 without a vote. But falling behind to either the left or right could be the death knell to his agenda. A loss would force Macron to nominate a prime minister from whichever party wins \u2013 putting a political opponent in charge of running the government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/europe/france-debate-attal-bardella-bompard-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Farage \u2013 who heads the fast-growing Reform UK political party and was a pivotal figure in in Brexit \u2013 is seeking to win a seat in parliament for the first time in next month\u2019s general election. During an interview with the BBC Friday, Farage was asked if he stood by a tweet posted in February 2022 which called Putin\u2019s decision to invade Ukraine a \u201cconsequence of EU and NATO expansion.\u201d \u201cWhy did I say that? It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of NATO and the European Union was giving this man [Putin] a reason to his Russian people to say they\u2019re coming for us again, and to go to war,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Nick Robinson. \u201cWe\u2019ve provoked this war \u2013 of course it\u2019s his fault \u2013\u00a0he\u2019s used what we\u2019ve done as an excuse,\u201d he said. Farage \u2013 a former EU parliamentarian \u2013 claimed to be \u201cthe only person in British politics\u201d to predict the invasion of Ukraine. Following his BBC appearance, Farage took to X and clarified his comments. \u201cI am one of the few figures that have been consistent & honest about the war with Russia,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPutin was wrong to invade a sovereign nation, and the EU was wrong to expand eastward.\u201d Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reacted to the comments today while speaking to journalists. \u201cWhat he said was completely wrong and only plays into Putin\u2019s hands,\u201d said Sunak. \u201cThis kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain\u2019s security.\u201d Former Conservative defence secretary Ben Wallace spoke to the BBC\u2019s Today program about Farage\u2019s comments, where he called the Reform leader \u201ca bit like that pub bore we have all met at the end of the bar who often says \u2018Oh no, if I was running the country\u2019 and presents very simplistic answers to actually, I am afraid in the 21st century, complex problems.\u201d Labour leader Keir Starmer also responded to Farage\u2019s comments, calling them \u201cdisgraceful\u201d in an interview with Sky News. \u201cI think anybody who wants to stand to be a representative in our parliament should be really clear that whether it\u2019s Russian aggression on the battlefield, or online, that we stand against that aggression. That\u2019s standing behind Ukraine but also standing up for our freedom,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are disgraceful comments, which reveal the true face of Nigel Farage: a Putin apologist who should never be trusted with our nation\u2019s security,\u201d wrote John Healey, a Labour MP and shadow Defence Secretary. He added that Farage has \u201cshown that he would rather lick Vladimir Putin\u2019s boot than stand up for the people of Ukraine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/europe/nigel-farage-ukraine-russia-eu-provoke-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

The proposal, outlined by US President Joe Biden last month, sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. But on Sunday, Netanyahu told Israel\u2019s Channel 14 he was ready to make \u201ca partial deal\u201d with Hamas to return only some hostages from Gaza, in comments that were at odds with the proposal, which was approved by his own war cabinet. He added that Israel will continue fighting in the enclave after the ceasefire. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the war is going to end, but the war in its current stage is going to end in Rafah. This is true. We will continue mowing the grass later,\u201d Netanyahu told the right-wing broadcaster in what was his first one-to-one interview with local Israeli media since October 7. His apparent dismissal of the ceasefire and hostage release proposal faced an angry backlash from Israeli politicians and a group representing Israel\u2019s hostages and their families, which has become a potent political force in the country. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum called Netanyahu\u2019s comments to Channel 14 \u201can unprecedented national failure and a failure to meet the goals of the war.\u201d Opposition figure Gadi Eisenkot \u2013 who resigned from Israel\u2019s war cabinet a week before Netanyahu disbanded it \u2013 also slammed Netanyahu, saying \u201cthere are soldiers who are fighting now because they have war goals to return the hostages.\u201d On Monday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US opposes continued military operations in Gaza. \u201cThat\u2019s just a recipe for continued conflict, continued instability and continued insecurity for Israel,\u201d he told a press briefing. The Hostage and Missing Families Forum later released a video showing the kidnapping of three Israelis by Hamas on October 7. The video shows Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Or Levy and Eliya Cohen in the back of a pickup truck, being driven along a tree-lined road in southern Israel by militants wielding assault weapons. \u201cHere are the dogs, here they are,\u201d one of the gunmen can be heard saying. Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli citizen then age 23, can be seen with his face bloodied and what appears to be bone protruding from his left arm \u2013 blown off after a grenade was tossed into the bunker in which he and several others had been hiding from Hamas gunmen. Goldberg-Polin\u2019s family told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that they agreed to releasing the video of their son because world leaders \u201cmaybe need a wake-up call.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s horrific. It\u2019s gut-wrenching. It\u2019s a\u00a0video that no parent wants to\u00a0see of their kid,\u201d Jon Polin said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that\u00a0people in the world see the\u00a0videos, understand what\u2019s\u00a0happening, understand what\u00a0happened on October 7, and most\u00a0particularly, that leaders of\u00a0the world see it.\u201d Hamas released a video of Goldberg-Polin in April, the first proof that he survived the blast. In the video, he criticized Netanyahu\u2019s government, as other Israeli hostages in Hamas propaganda videos have done. Held in Gaza for six months at the time, he was almost certainly speaking under duress. \u201cEvery day that passes puts the hostages at greater risk and diminishes our chances of bringing them back safely,\u201d the Forum said in a statement, calling for a deal that brings all of the hostages home. \u2018An important correction\u2019 Netanyahu scrambled to walk back his comments to Channel 14. On Monday, an Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN that Israel has stressed to Hamas through mediators Qatar and Egypt that it\u2019s committed to the Israeli ceasefire and hostage release proposal. \u201cNetanyahu\u2019s words at the Knesset were an important correction. To this day he has not said publicly that he supports the Israeli proposal.\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s words move the ball to Hamas\u2019 court. If Hamas says yes, there will be a deal. We now need to push for a deal with everything we got,\u201d the Israeli source said. In a short statement issued after his interview Sunday, Netanyahu\u2019s office sought to clarify what he said, saying the prime minister had \u201cmade it clear that we will not leave Gaza until we return all 120 of our hostages, living and deceased.\u201d Seeking to row back his explosive comments even further, Netanyahu on Monday told the Knesset: \u201cWe are committed to the Israeli proposal that President Biden welcomed. Our position has not changed.\u201d The release of the video may be intended to refocus minds in Israel\u2019s security cabinet, reminding Netanyahu and other senior officials of the war\u2019s initial aim to return the hostages, many of whom remain in Gaza nearly nine months after their abduction. It came as the number of hostages believed to be dead rose to 42 with the announcement by the Israeli military that one of its soldiers, Sergeant Major Mhamad El Atrash, 39, was killed on October 7 and that his body is being held by Hamas. Previously, on June 8, the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office said it believes that at least 41 hostages from the October 7 attack are dead, with their bodies being held in the Gaza Strip. At least five American hostages are believed to be held alive and four others believed to be dead. More than a million Palestinians were taking shelter in Rafah before Israel started its air and ground operation in the southern Gazan city, defying calls from the international community not to proceed. Around 800,000 people have since been displaced from Rafah, where\u00a0conditions\u00a0have been described by the United Nations food agency as \u201capocalyptic.\u201d The\u00a0city\u2019s border crossing\u00a0with Egypt \u2014 a vital entry point for humanitarian aid \u2014 has remained closed since the Israeli military seized it early last month. And international pressure on Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza have mounted since it started its operation in Rafah. Last month, the UN\u2019s top court\u00a0ordered Israel\u00a0to immediately halt its controversial military operation there, calling the humanitarian situation \u201cdisastrous.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/middleeast/israel-hostage-forum-video-netanyahu-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_26_style_marissa-teijo-71-beauty-pageant-contestant-reaj", "text": "Bejeweled and sequined with her\u00a0hair teased high, Marissa Teijo, 71, made history last weekend when she donned six-inch heels and walked across the stage of the Miss Texas USA competition, to thunderous applause. \u201cMy team told me that I got a standing ovation,\u201d Teijo told CNN. \u201cAll I know is that they were cheering.\u201d The El Paso resident is the oldest contestant to ever compete in the pageant, its director told CNN. Teijo\u2019s age is not the only reason her participation broke barriers in the pageant world. She is also\u00a0married, a mother and previously divorced \u2013 all previous disqualifiers until last year, when the Miss Texas USA rules changed, according to\u00a0the pageant\u2019s website. Born in 1952, Teijo grew up on a cotton and maize farm in Lazbuddie, a small town in Northwest Texas. She is the second oldest of four children, and she and her siblings spoke English among themselves and Spanish to their parents, who migrated to the US\u00a0from Mexico. \u201cMy father made us work every summer, from dawn to when the sun set. But I liked it. It was a lot of walking. We had to walk up and down the rows and take out all the weeds with a hoe,\u201d Teijo recalled. She said those early days on the farm instilled a love of being active. As an adult, Teijo said she ran, exercised at the gym and even\u00a0started competing in bodybuilding competitions when she was 40. \u201cI have twelve trophies,\u201d Teijo said. For more than four decades, the grandmother of three taught second grade and was a substitute teacher. After she retired during the pandemic, she was recruited to join a modeling agency. Teijo said she was urged to compete in a local pageant, but she initially decided against it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was something I would be able to do,\u201d Teijo said. But she changed her mind when her agent told her how much she could inspire others with her healthy lifestyle. She was already doing it in her community. \u201cI thought, \u2018Yeah, you know what. If I\u2019m already getting a few people that tell me that I\u2019m their inspiration, I can inspire a lot more,\u2019\u201d she said. But I thought it would just be Houston and El Paso.\u201d To prepare for pageant competitions, Teijo said she\u00a0hired a \u201ctough\u201d trainer and started weightlifting more intensively. She said because she\u2019s in her early 70s, she worried if she trained really hard, she\u2019d get injured. Instead, she\u2019s now in\u00a0even better shape than before. But at the pageant rehearsal last weekend, when\u00a0a choreographer instructed contestants on where to walk for each portion of the competition, Teijo said her confidence waned. \u201cThe practice was grueling. Oh my gosh. I kept making so many mistakes. I was getting nervous,\u201d she admitted. Her pageant roommate noticed her struggling with the choreography and gave her a hand. \u201cShe said, \u2018Do you want me to help you down the stairs?\u2019 I said yes because I was afraid of falling. And when she walked down the stairs, she stopped and held out her hand so I could walk down. I thought that was so kind of her,\u201d recounted Teijo. The septuagenarian said she was surprised by how accepting all the other contestants were, too. \u201cAll the girls were so nice and sweet to me, and they came up to compliment me, telling me I was beautiful and \u2018How do you get your abs?\u2019 It was just really, really nice.\u201d Despite the flubs while practicing, Teijo proudly told CNN she got it right during the competition. Aarieanna Ware, who was previously Miss Dallas, took home the title of Miss Texas USA. She\u2019s set to compete in Miss USA on August 4. After the competition was over, women of all ages waited for her in the lobby of the Hilton Houston Post Oak hotel, showering her with praise and admiration. She said positive comments have flooded her Instagram and Facebook pages, too. \u201cI wasn\u2019t as fancy and as polished as the other girls, but I did it,\u201d said Teijo. She said she knew she wouldn\u2019t win, but that wasn\u2019t her goal. It was to inspire women to be active, especially through weightlifting and healthy eating. \u201cIt\u2019s something that will keep you looking young, and you don\u2019t just do it for vanity\u2019s sake. You don\u2019t do it for beauty. It\u2019s to be healthy, to be strong and be able to do things as you get older.\u201d Things like Miss Texas USA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/26/style/marissa-teijo-71-beauty-pageant-contestant-reaj/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_weather_us-summer-heat-forecast-climate", "text": "Summer is off to a sweltering start after multiple record-breaking heat events sent temperatures soaring for millions of people in the US. So when will it end? Forecasts for the coming weeks and months show exceptional heat is largely here to stay, with only fleeting periods of respite. And the sobering summer reality on a planet warming due to fossil fuel pollution is the heat isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 it\u2019s only going to get more frequent and intense as global temperatures rise. \u201cSummers like the one we are experiencing now and the summer we had last year \u2013 which was the hottest on record \u2013 are going to become par for the course in the years ahead,\u201d said Kristina Dahl, a climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. A sign of things to come There will still be colder-than-average summers in the future, but climate change is making it likelier more summers will end up hotter-than-average, Dahl told CNN. And the fingerprints of a changing climate are already visible, even before summer has reached its hottest months. This spring, hundreds of cities in the eastern half of the US experienced one of their 10 hottest Mays on record in what was another sign of a changing climate: dangerous heat seeping into typically cooler seasons. Early season heat waves add to the danger of what\u2019s already the deadliest weather threat because the body can\u2019t gradually acclimatize, or cope better with the heat, Dahl explained. Acclimation or not, the abnormally hot temperatures are also altering the perception of what\u2019s hot. Temperatures through at least midweek will climb up to 10 degrees above normal in parts of the western and southern US, but that pales in comparison to last week\u2019s roasting conditions. Summer should be hot, just not this hot: Parts of the central and eastern US sweltered through temperatures 25 or 30 degrees above normal last week. The heat was so extreme Caribou, Maine, a town just 10 miles from the Canadian border, hit 96 degrees, tying its all-time record high temperature. \u201cThis is not your grandmother\u2019s heat, this is significantly different,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cThis (heat) really isn\u2019t normal and it\u2019s measurably influenced by climate change.\u201d The hottest is yet to come Forecasts for the next few weeks, the next month and the rest of the summer all show one trend clearer than anything else: hotter-than-average temperatures for large sections of the US. Above average temperatures are expected into early July for a vast majority of the Lower 48 with the exception of states along the northernmost tier of the country, according to forecasts from the Climate Prediction Center. July is typically the hottest month of the year, but it is expected to be even hotter than normal this summer in almost every state. Most of the East and parts of the Rockies are likely to be the most anomalously warm areas next month. This prolonged heat could be record-breaking. Last July in Phoenix was the hottest month ever experienced in any US city. The city\u2019s average July temperature \u2013 calculated based on both high and low temperatures for the month \u2013 was an astonishing 102.7 degrees. Heat in Phoenix last summer wasn\u2019t just extreme, it was long-lasting. Its longevity and dangerously high daytime and overnight temperatures took a toll on human health. The scorching July contributed to the deadliest year for heat in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, since officials began keeping records in 2003. Heat lasted well beyond July last summer for much of the US. A series of unrelenting heat domes baked huge parts of the country with the effects of each worsened by the one before. Every heat dome that parked over part of the country roasted the ground, dried out soils and made subsequent temperatures even hotter. This year looks to be no different. Warmer-than-normal conditions are expected to extend through the summer and most of the fall, according to the CPC. Warmer-than-normal falls aren\u2019t nearly as dangerous as hot summers. But the cooler seasons only mask the lingering threat of extreme heat as long as global temperatures continue to rise, which scientists say can only be mitigated by dramatically reducing or phasing out planet-polluting fossil fuel use. \u201cThe more we try to normalize (heat), the greater the danger we have of taking our eye off the ball in terms of what needs to be done to address climate change,\u201d Dahl said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/weather/us-summer-heat-forecast-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

But enormous problems still loom ashore. The US military says it is now moving about 800 pallets of humanitarian aid per day to Gaza via the temporary pier, or roughly 40 trucks. But for now, that aid isn\u2019t helping to alleviate the worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza, where more than 2 million people are facing crisis, emergency, or catastrophic levels of food insecurity according to a new report. More than 6,000 pallets of aid delivered via the pier are stacked and awaiting pickup onshore, US military officials said, as the World Food Program has suspended aid collections due to security concerns. CNN was granted access to the pier on Tuesday for the first time since it was first anchored to the Gaza coastline last month, witnessing trucks driving off a logistical vessel, across the pier and onto the Gaza shoreline. The pier is composed of interlocking floating platforms made of hundreds of tons of steel that rumble as each wave passes underneath. Tug boats on either side help keep the platform stable. An Israeli military division is charged with ensuring the security of US military personnel and civilian truck drivers in the area and a US C-RAM air defense system capable of intercepting mortars provides an extra layer of protection. The visit also gave CNN rare access to witness up close the tremendous destruction that nearly nine months of war have wrought on Gaza\u2019s coastline, with most buildings in sight either flattened or heavily damaged. Beyond the bombed-out buildings, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is growing increasingly desperate once again, particularly in northern Gaza, where hunger is on the rise. Humanitarian aid operations in Gaza have been severely hampered by an increase in Israeli military operations over the past month and humanitarian aid officials say lawlessness and looting are also on the rise. The Israeli military says it has been getting hundreds of aid trucks into Gaza recently, blaming humanitarian aid agencies\u2019 lack of capacity for not picking up and distributing the aid. But aid groups say their efforts are hampered by a lack of communication with the Israeli military that leaves them at risk of being caught in the crossfire. US President Joe Biden announced plans to build the pier during his State of the Union address, vowing it would \u201cenable a massive increase\u201d in humanitarian aid getting into Gaza. But bad weather and rough seas have hampered that effort, damaging the pier and taking it offline for weeks over the last month-and-a-half. The Pentagon has said it is committed to keeping the pier operational, despite reports that it was considering shutting the project down altogether. Pressed on criticism from humanitarian aid groups that the US\u2019s $230-million effort would have been better spent pressuring Israel to get more aid into Gaza via land routes, Capt. Joel Stewart, the senior Navy officer involved in the operation, told CNN the pier was always intended to be \u201ca surge response\u201d and not a \u201clong-term solution.\u201d \u201cThe sea is a difficult task-mistress. Unpredictable. Each wave is different than the last, so dealing with that is a challenge,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve adapted to that and I think we\u2019re in a better position now than we were initially.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/middleeast/us-military-pier-gaza-uncollected-aid-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_israel-gaza-children-starvation-malnutrition-intl", "text": "Younis lays disorientated on a green mattress in\u00a0Nasser Hospital, in southern Gaza. His long brown eyelashes rest delicately on his pale sunken face, as he drifts in and out of sleep. The 9-year-old Palestinian boy lies in his mother\u2019s arms, clearly wasted from severe malnutrition and suffering from dehydration. His blue jogging bottoms hang off his emaciated legs, as his tiny ribcage protrudes from his billowy orange T-shirt. \u201cI call on people with conscience to help me find health care for my son, so that he can go back to normal,\u201d his mother, Ghanima Juma\u2019a, told CNN last week at the hospital in Khan Younis. \u201cI am losing my son in front of my eyes.\u201d Two months ago, the family was forced to flee the southern city of Rafah as Israel ramped up its attacks there. These days, they struggle to survive, living along the polluted coastline of Asda\u2019a \u2014 near the Al-Mawasi tent camp \u2014 where they cannot find enough food, water, or even shade from the Gaza heat. \u201cWe have to keep moving from one area to the other because of the war and the invasion\u2026 Life is difficult,\u201d his mother said. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a tent over our heads.\u201d Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has depleted the territory\u2019s health system, leaving staff unable to treat malnourished children. Doctors told CNN they are being forced to turn away parents begging for baby milk, unable to even triage young patients with chronic illnesses compounded by severe hunger. And as Israel continues its siege on Gaza,\u00a0preventing aid groups getting enough food into the enclave, parents say they have no choice but to watch their children starve to death.\u00a0More than eight months of bombardment has shredded infrastructure, wiped out communities and laid waste to entire neighborhoods. Sanitation systems \u2014\u00a0already stressed by water shortages from extreme heat \u2014\u00a0have been heavily destroyed, according to\u00a0the UN, diminishing access to clean water. A report published Tuesday by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which assesses global food insecurity and malnutrition, warned that almost all of Gaza will\u00a0face famine\u00a0within the next three months. The UN\u2019s food agency earlier warned that southern Gaza could soon see the same \u201ccatastrophic levels of hunger\u201d recorded previously\u00a0in the north,\u00a0where Israel concentrated its military offensive in the early days of the war. At least 34 children have already died of malnutrition in Gaza, the government media office reported on June 22. The true number could be higher, as limited access to Gaza has impeded aid agencies\u2019 efforts to fully assess the crisis there. More than 50,000 children require treatment for acute malnutrition, the\u00a0UN\u2019s agency for Palestine refugees\u00a0(UNRWA) said earlier this month. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks on southern Israel, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others were abducted. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed\u00a037,658 Palestinians\u00a0and injured another\u00a086,237 people, according to Gaza health officials. Severe water shortages As Younis suffers in his mother\u2019s arms in Gaza\u2019s south, children in the north have been dealing with food shortages even longer. In the Jabalya refugee camp, they queue at a water truck, beads of sweat rolling down their faces, as they weave through the rubble-filled streets. Dozens of other Gazans crowd together to access water as aid workers nearby distribute thick, steaming red soup from large saucepans. It\u2019s rare access to food and clean water. Those in the north told CNN they have resorted lately to drinking polluted water, which does little to help dehydration and spreads infectious diseases. Israel insists there is \u201cno limit\u201d on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, but its inspection regime on trucks, restrictions on land routes and increased bombardment means relief is barely trickling in.\u00a0Even when aid enters the besieged territory, the risk of hungry Palestinians scrambling over convoys hampers distribution efforts. UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u00a0recently\u00a0warned the\u00a0absence of police authorities in Gaza during the conflict had led to \u201ctotal lawlessness.\u201d Earlier this year, the UN\u00a0warned that\u00a0Israel is creating an \u201centirely man-made disaster\u201d in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has\u00a0\u00a0denied allegations\u00a0by the International Criminal Court\u2019s chief prosecutor that he has used \u201cstarvation of civilians as a method of warfare.\u201d \u201cThe only water we have is what we get as aid. People are suffering as a result, it is indescribable,\u201d said one civilian named Hassan Kalash.\u00a0\u201cWe are ill and don\u2019t have the strength to transport the water\u2026 The water pipe is broken. We do not have water infrastructure.\u201d Civilians there told CNN they have no access to running water, relying on scant aid entering the area. At least 67% of water and sanitation facilities in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed or damaged in the eight months of bombardment,\u00a0UNRWA\u00a0said last week. All of five wastewater treatment plants in Gaza have shut down,\u00a0according to the UN Environment Programme. The UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has\u00a0accused Israeli authorities of obstructing humanitarian access to northern Gaza. In the first three weeks of\u00a0June,\u00a036 trucks carrying aid \u2014\u00a0 which were facilitated by Israel \u2014 were allowed to reach Gaza, while another 35 were either denied access,\u00a0impeded\u00a0or canceled due to logistical, operational or security reasons. The impact on the ground is visceral. In Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza, 5-year-old Razan wears a gold ring on her finger, which is covered in red sores. The Palestinian girl is sprawled on a trolley in the central Gaza facility, her grey eyes weary with exhaustion. \u201cShe changed after the war. She became weak,\u201d her aunt, Um Razan Mheitem, told CNN, adding that her niece had developed skin inflammation due to malnutrition. \u201cWe cannot find anything for her. Everything in the market is expensive, or not available.\u201d \u2018Waiting for them to die, one by one\u2019 Newborn babies and pregnant women are among the most at risk of malnutrition and dehydration in Gaza, according to aid agencies and health workers. Undernourished mothers are more likely to give birth prematurely, with\u00a0newborns dying because they weigh too little. At the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, doctors were unable to keep baby Amal alive just four days after her birth. CNN filmed the moments before her death, showing Amal drawing heavy breaths in an incubator, after her mother, Samaher, gave birth two months prematurely. Her tiny pink toes are covered in plastic tubes. \u201cThese babies are dying. It is God\u2019s decision, but it is caused by people,\u201d her father, Ahmed Maqat, told CNN, after she died on Saturday. Samaher had endured months of her pregnancy without sleeping, eating or drinking, Maqat said. \u201cEveryone in these beds today is at risk of dying. We are waiting for them to die one by one,\u201d he added, his voice quivering with grief. \u201cWe have no life.\u201d Dr Ahmed Kahlot, head of the incubators department at Kamal Adwan, told CNN that Samaher\u2019s poor health meant her daughter was just \u201cwaiting for death.\u201d Many of those who do survive are too dehydrated and malnourished to breastfeed their children. But health workers told CNN there are few alternatives, with shortages of lactose free or soya milk for infants. Another Palestinian in Kamal Adwan Hospital told CNN that her son, who suffers from an inflamed esophagus, is unable to access soya milk, which he needs in his condition. \u201cHe hardly sits,\u201d she said of her 2-year-old child. \u201cHe cannot even crawl, cannot walk.\u201d Around 250 patients are receiving treatment for malnutrition at the hospital, and there are only two functioning stabilization centers for severely malnourished children in Gaza, OCHA reported\u00a0earlier this month, endangering almost 3,000 children, who were receiving treatment for acute malnutrition in the south prior to the military escalation in Rafah. Doctors say they are often unable to treat babies who show symptoms of malnutrition, including breathing problems, chest infections, and severe dehydration, amid dwindling medical supplies. Malnourished patients with chronic or infectious illnesses are less likely to recover,\u00a0a local pediatrician\u00a0told CNN, as the spread of\u00a0disease spikes\u00a0in displacement shelters. Authorities in Gaza have recorded more than 1.4 million cases of infectious diseases since October 7, according to the Ministry of Health there. As hunger worsens and parts of the enclave hurtle towards widespread famine, aid agencies have repeatedly called for the opening of land crossings into Gaza, which they say are the most effective way of getting relief into the strip. A US-built floating pier designed to bring in aid in by sea has been beset by problems \u2014\u00a0from unfavorable sea conditions to distribution issues once the aid ins transferred on land \u2014\u00a0failing to make a meaningful difference to the crisis. Back in Khan Younis, Ismail Madi told CNN last week how worried he was for his 4-year-old son, Ahmad, who was suffering jaundice from malnutrition. \u201cMy son will not be able to survive this,\u201d he said. \u201cI call on the American president Joe Biden\u2026 to intervene,\u201d added Madi, \u201cto save this child who has nothing at all to do with any political conflict.\u201d But just days later, the boy died. With other young children to provide for, Madi\u2019s life as a parent is full of stress. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to feed a family of 10 in these difficult times.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/middleeast/israel-gaza-children-starvation-malnutrition-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_uk_king-charles-ascot-horse-racing-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "Arriving in a horse-drawn open carriage, King Charles III and Queen Camilla attended Royal Ascot in style this week. Dressed in their finest frocks and wearing hats of all different shades, onlookers at the opening day of the five-day racing festival in Berkshire, southeast England, on Tuesday applauded as the royals passed by. Camilla wore a bold cobalt-blue dress with a wide-brimmed matching hat, while Charles sported a formal gray suit and top hat. In this year\u2019s official program, the royal couple made a touching nod to the late Queen\u2019s passion for horses, while wishing this year\u2019s participants the best of luck in the upcoming races. \u201cIt gave us immense pleasure and joy to witness Desert Hero\u2019s victory in the King George V Stakes last year, particularly as he was bred by Her late Majesty,\u201d the couple wrote in the program. \u201cWe wish all the participants this week the very best of luck in seeking that unique thrill of a Royal Ascot winner.\u201d Last year\u2019s Royal Ascot saw an unlikely win for Charles, with his horse, Desert Hero, overcoming odds of 18 to 1 to land first place. Francis Brooke, Charles\u2019 representative at Ascot, said the win was the \u201chighlight of the week,\u201d with Hero winning in \u201cthrilling style.\u201d Brooke added that this year\u2019s event will have a race named after the King. \u201cWe are delighted to have renamed our premier five furlong sprint in honour of His Majesty The King,\u201d he said in a statement. Another of Charles\u2019 horses, also inherited from the late Queen, raced in the Betfred Oaks at Epsom Downs last month, finishing in 11th place out of 12, according to the Jockey Club. This love of horses has bound together multiple generations of the royal family, from the time of Queen Anne in the 18th century, when Royal Ascot was created, to the present day. Camilla even reportedly met Charles at a polo match in Windsor in 1970. A long royal pedigree Royal Ascot dates to 1711, when Queen Anne established the first iteration of the quintessentially British spectacle, according to the event\u2019s organizers. This first event, held on August 11 that year, consisted of three separate heats, each four miles long, which Anne said would allow the \u201chorses to gallop at full stretch.\u201d It was a test of extreme stamina, according to Royal Ascot, with each heat roughly the same length as the modern-day Grand National. Nearly 100 years later, in 1807, Royal Ascot\u2019s oldest surviving race, known as the Gold Cup, was added to the mix. It was during the 2013 Gold Cup that the late Queen\u2019s face famously lit up with sheer joy as she watched her horse, Estimate, cross the finishing line in first place. \u201cWe have all the trophies. I have actually managed to win the Gold Cup, which is unusual,\u201d said Elizabeth, then 87 years old. Her passion for racing flowered when she was a teenager. \u201cWhen she was young, she had ponies. At the age of, I think, of 16, her father took her to the racing stable for the first time,\u201d John Warren, the late Queen\u2019s bloodstock adviser, told CNN in 2014. \u201cThere was a tremendously good filly (young female horse) at that time, and she went into the stable and she went and patted this filly, and she tells the story that she didn\u2019t want to wash her hands for the rest of the day for the touching of the horse.\u201d Over the years, her keen interest in the sport resulted in an impressive 24 wins at Royal Ascot and a significant return in prize money from her more than 400 horse racing victories in total. And the late monarch wasn\u2019t alone in her passion. Princess Anne, her only daughter, has taken after her as a keen rider and was even part of the British equestrian team at the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games. And given Charles\u2019 good fortune at last year\u2019s Royal Ascot, it seems Queen Elizabeth\u2019s lucky streak has passed down to her son. \u201cThe King and Queen have retained a healthy interest in the sport,\u201d a spokesperson for the Jockey Club told CNN Wednesday. \u201cBecoming joint patrons of The Jockey Club and their subsequent visits to both Epsom Downs and Royal Ascot demonstrates their ongoing commitment to the sport of horse racing.\u201d Aside from racing, horses still have a practical role to play for the royal family. Since the reign of Queen Victoria in the 19th century, a particular type of horse called a Windsor Grey \u2013 known for its stamina and steady temperament \u2013 has been the favorite provider of horsepower for the royal family\u2019s carriages. Named because they used to be kept at stables in Windsor, Windsor Greys have been used in public ceremonial events like royal weddings and coronations to transport members of the clan and their guests. Over the years, race horses, carriage horses and ponies alike have been ever-present in the lives of the royal family, and despite the change in monarch, their position seems assured for many more years to come. CNN\u2019s Max Foster, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Ben Church and Aly Vance contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/uk/king-charles-ascot-horse-racing-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}

Any potent thunderstorms that develop will likely reach parts of the I-95 corridor by late afternoon or early evening. Damaging wind gusts and heavy rainfall are the greatest threats posed by the strongest storms, but hail and an isolated tornado or two cannot be ruled out. Any rainfall will ultimately be beneficial for the region, which dried out after being scorched by an intense heat wave last week. But flash flooding could result if heavy rain falls too fast, especially in low-lying or poor-drainage areas. Some thunderstorms may initially develop separately from one another only to ultimately congeal and form powerful lines that deliver greater wind damage. Power outages may ramp up in this scenario, especially if damaging winds roar over densely populated urban areas. The storm threat will largely cease during the overnight hours as thunderstorms push off the coast and out over the Atlantic.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/27/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_americas_boluarte-allegations-icc-crimes-against-humanity-intl-latam", "text": "Two human rights groups have made a submission to the International Criminal Court accusing Peru\u2019s President Dina Boluarte and members of her government of crimes against humanity in connection with the deaths of 49 people during the Andean country\u2019s weeks-long protest movement in 2022 and 2023. The International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and Peru\u2019s Association for Human Rights (APRODEH) submitted a communication to the ICC Tuesday, asking it to open a preliminary examination against Boluarte and members of her government regarding the allegations. According to the ICC, submitting a communication is the first step for it to establish if, based on available information, it appears that crimes within its jurisdiction have been committed. If it decides this is so, the court can proceed to\u00a0open a full preliminary examination. Lawyers Jimena Reyes, director of the Americas desk at FIDH, and Gloria Cano, director of APRODEH, met members of the Prosecutor\u2019s office on Tuesday and submitted documentation alleging crimes against humanity took place between December 7, 2022 and February 9, 2023, a statement released by the FIDH says. \u201cThe persons implicated in the commission of the crimes of murder and attempted murder were state authorities, including members of the Peruvian Army and the Peruvian National Police, who acted in accordance with a state policy planned or, at a minimum, approved by omission, by the highest national authorities of\u00a0Peru,\u201d\u00a0a report issued by FIDH and Aprodeh concludes. The victims \u201cwere part of a civilian population of protesters or persons perceived as such, mainly young, poor men from indigenous areas of the country\u201d the report added. CNN has reached out to the Peruvian government and the attorney representing Boluarte for comment. President Boluarte has denied any personal responsibility since the protests started while former Prime Minister Alberto Otarola said the government defended \u201cPeruvians\u2019 right to peace and calm\u201d. Apart from the victims, there were also hundreds of people injured \u201cas a result of the indiscriminate use of lethal force by the military and by the police who were in charge of patrolling the demonstrations after the declaration of a state of\u00a0emergency,\u201d\u00a0Cano told CNN. \u201cThe majority were killed while exercising their legitimate right to protest,\u201d Cano said. The victim profiles submitted to the ICC include 32-year-old Leonardo\u00a0Hancco\u00a0and 18-year-old\u00a0Beckhan Quispe, whose cases have been previously reported by CNN. Allegations of \u2018extrajudicial executions\u2019 The Andean country\u2019s weeks-long protest movement was sparked by the impeachment and arrest of former President Pedro Castillo in December 2022, fuelled by deep dissatisfaction over living conditions and inequality in the country. While protests occurred throughout the nation, the worst violence was in the rural and indigenous south. An\u00a0Amnesty International report in May 2023\u00a0found that Peruvian\u00a0security forces\u00a0carried out widespread attacks against protesters including young men and children. The report alleges the security forces took part in\u00a0\u201cextrajudicial executions \u201cand \u201cwidespread use of lethal ammunition\u201d while trying to contain the protests. Forty-nine civilians were killed,\u00a0and Amnesty International says that several of those killed were bystanders. \u201cIn none of the cases was evidence found that the deceased person posed a risk to the life or integrity of the officials,\u201d the Amnesty International report says. Peru\u2019s Prosecutor\u2019s office opened a preliminary investigation in\u00a0January 2023\u00a0against Boluarte, Otarola, and other ministers at the time for alleged genocide, homicide and serious injuries committed during the protests. Boluarte testified at a closed-door meeting last year\u00a0CNN en Espanol reported. This investigation remains open. Peru\u2019s defense and interior ministries had also been contacted for comment. Both ministries told CNN in February 2023 they could not comment until an ongoing investigation carried out by the Prosecutor\u2019s office is finished. Peruvian authorities have said that the country\u2019s security forces acted in self-defense. Last year Boluarte said that she and her ministers do not decide protocols for the Armed Forces or the Police. \u201cThey have their own law and protocols. Who do they comply with? Their commanders. We don\u2019t have any power over them. I can be the Supreme Chief of the Armed Forces, but I have no command (over them) and the protocols are decided by them,\u201d\u00a0she said. Yovana Mendoza, president of the victim\u2019s association in Ayacucho and who lost her 34-year-old brother\u00a0Jhon Mendoza, told CNN this request to the ICC\u2019s is a cry for help from the families in Peru.\u00a0She says\u00a0they have been forgotten and ignored by the authorities there. \u201cHere we don\u2019t trust the government, as they only introduce laws to protect\u00a0themselves,\u201d\u00a0she said. Ruth Barcena told CNN she is hopeful for justice with this request after the death of her husband Leonardo Hancco.

{"id": "2024_06_25_middleeast_gaza-famine-ipc-report-intl-latam", "text": "A high risk of famine persists in Gaza and the situation \u201cremains catastrophic\u201d as the war between Israel and Hamas continues, according to a report\u00a0released Tuesday by\u00a0the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). Nearly half a million are projected to face catastrophic levels of hunger, the most severe level on the IPC scale where people \u201cexperience an extreme lack of food, starvation, and exhaustion of coping capacities,\u201d according to the report. 96% of the population of Gaza \u2013 more than 2 million people \u2013 will face crisis, emergency, or catastrophic levels of food insecurity through at least the end of September, the report projects. \u201cA high risk of famine persists across the whole of the Gaza Strip as long as conflict continues and humanitarian access is restricted,\u201d the\u00a0report said. \u201cOnly the cessation of hostilities in conjunction with sustained humanitarian access to the entire Gaza Strip can reduce the risk of a famine occurring in the Gaza Strip.\u201d \u201cThe last few months have demonstrated that food and humanitarian access and malnutrition prevalence can change very quickly, the risk of epidemics is increasing and eight months of extreme pressure on the lives of the population make them much more vulnerable to collapse into famine,\u201d said the report, compiled by the IPC\u2019s Famine Review Committee. \u201cGiven the unpredictability of the ongoing conflict and humanitarian access challenges, any significant change may lead to a very rapid deterioration into Famine,\u201d the report said. The findings of the report echo testimonies from those on the ground about the dire humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Nearly nine months of Israel\u2019s bombardment and siege have depleted the health care system, battered water infrastructure and created dire conditions for the entire population of more than 2.2 million people. Increased Israeli attacks in the southern city of Rafah have triggered mass displacement and an outbreak of infectious diseases in the sprawling tent camps where people cannot access basic sanitation. With no signs of\u00a0an imminent ceasefire\u00a0being agreed to stop the fighting, relief workers say the suffering of civilians on the ground will only get worse. \u201cThe latest data shows\u00a0that, to be able to purchase food, more than half of the households had to exchange their clothes for money and one third resorted to picking up trash to sell,\u201d the report detailed in its \u201cspecial snapshot.\u201d \u201cMore than half also reported that, often, they do not have any food to eat in the house, and over 20 percent go entire days and nights without eating.\u201d The report acknowledged there were some improvements to the situation in the north of Gaza, where the IPC warned in March that famine was imminent. Tuesday\u2019s report assessed that due to an increase in food deliveries in March and April, \u201cthe available evidence does not indicate that Famine is currently occurring\u201d in the north. However, it notes the possibility remains throughout the entire Gaza Strip. Although there was also some improvement in the south of Gaza in that time, the report said, the situation deteriorated with the launch of Israel\u2019s military operations in Rafah. The Rafah crossing \u2013 a key transitway for humanitarian aid to Gaza \u2013 has been closed since early May, and only a handful of other land crossings remain open. Humanitarian aid workers continue to face tremendous risks to try to distribute the desperately needed aid to Gaza. The majority of the infrastructure to support humanitarian work in Gaza has been destroyed in Israel\u2019s war against Hamas. \u201cThe humanitarian space in the Gaza Strip continues to shrink and the ability to safely deliver assistance to populations is dwindling,\u201d the report\u2019s special snapshot said. \u201cThe recent trajectory is negative and highly unstable. Should this continue, the improvements seen in April could be rapidly reversed.\u201d The report also \u201cencourages all stakeholders who use the IPC for high-level decision-making to understand that whether a Famine classification is confirmed or not does not in any manner change the fact that extreme human suffering is without a doubt currently ongoing in the Gaza Strip.\u201d It \u201cdoes not change the immediate humanitarian imperative to address this civilian suffering by enabling complete, safe, unhindered, and sustained humanitarian access into and throughout the Gaza Strip, including through ceasing hostilities,\u201d the report continued. \u2018Specter of famine continues to hang over Gaza\u2019 The United States, Israel\u2019s closest ally, has repeatedly called on the Netanyahu government to do more to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. US President Joe Biden warned in early April that Israel had to take immediate concrete steps or risk changes in US policy. Thus far, there have been no such changes in policy. A spokesperson for the US humanitarian agency USAID said in response to the report that \u201cthe scale of food insecurity in Gaza is staggering.\u201d \u201cMore than 2 million people are in need of food assistance And the inability of food to get into the hands of people and the ongoing insecurity is driving that need,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. The spokesperson said that \u201ccivilians and aid workers must be protected; attacks on hospitals, health facilities, ambulances, water services, civilian telecoms services, and IDP shelter locations must stop; and the health, water, and sanitation system must be strengthened in order to avert worse outcomes.\u201d \u201cSince the conflict first began unfolding, USAID has worked relentlessly to increase assistance into Gaza and we will continue to do so,\u201d they said. \u201cThe IPC report \u2026 obviously it confirmed what we all know and what we\u2019ve been dealing with for some time is that the humanitarian situation on the ground is extremely dire. That\u2019s why we have been so incredibly focused on alleviating that situation,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Tuesday. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for a ceasefire, obviously, even as we try to get one and we need to do more to improve the humanitarian situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do \u2026 through working to resolve these issues between the government of Israel, the Israeli security forces and the UN humanitarian agencies.\u201d Meanwhile, humanitarian workers are warning that the situation in Gaza is untenable. \u201cIn the north, when we raised the famine alarm, we were able to get some more trucks in. And so for the moment, it is better. Not great \u2014 I don\u2019t want to give false illusions here that this is all hunky dory, because it\u2019s not,\u201d said World Food Programme Director Cindy McCain. \u201cThere\u2019s still great need in the north, and it\u2019s complex. It\u2019s complex for this reason. It\u2019s not just food they need. They need water, they need sanitation, they need health care. All of those things contribute to famine.\u201d A humanitarian official told CNN, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to very rapidly be back on the sort of trajectory that we were seeing in north. The scale will be much larger because it was 300,000 people give or take in northern Gaza. It\u2019s one and a half to 1.8 million people now in the southern middle areas who are in similar boat.\u201d Kate Phillips-Barrasso, of Mercy Corps, added, \u201cThe population cannot endure these hardships any longer. The toll of military action has been far too high, and we fear without dramatic changes to the provision of humanitarian aid, the death toll will climb as people succumb to months of deprivation. \u201cThe humanitarian situation is deteriorating rapidly, and the specter of famine continues to hang over Gaza,\u201d Phillips-Barrasso told CNN. \u201cDespite some aid getting in, the glaring contradictions remain. Commercial trucks are allowed passage, yet humanitarian aid is limited, scrutinized at the border, and, when permitted to cross, typically only reaches some city centers without proper security.\u201d \u201cCompounding the suffering is oppressive summer heat, no access to clean water, and increasing exposure to garbage and sewage. This lethal equation will undoubtedly lead to acute suffering and mortality,\u201d she said. On Friday, the commissioner-general for the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinia refugees (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, urged the \u201cuninterrupted, regular, coordinated and meaningful flow of humanitarian assistance.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

{"id": "2024_06_17_tech_mcdonalds-ai-drive-thru-program", "text": "McDonald\u2019s is pulling the plug on artificial intelligence ordering technology it was testing at more than 100 restaurant drive-thru systems in the US, a possible hiccup in the rapid rollout of AI in the fast food industry. The company had worked with IBM to develop and test AI-driven, voice-automated ordering at some of its restaurants. The fast food giant says it\u2019s still working on AI-related solutions at a time when its rivals are making similar investments. It plans to shut off the technology in restaurants participating in the test \u201cno later than July 26, 2024,\u201d according to reporting from trade publication Restaurant Business. \u201cIBM remains a trusted partner and we will still utilize many of their products across our global System,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in an email sent to franchisees and shared with CNN. But the company suggested it will look at AI partners other than IBM. McDonald\u2019s and IBM launched their partnership in 2021, announcing the development of Automated Order Taking (AOT) technology to create a more convenient and simplified ordering experience for its customers and restaurant teams as a part of its \u201cAccelerating the Arches\u201d growth plan. IBM said the AOT\u00a0technology that emerged from the partnership has \u201csome of the most comprehensive capabilities in the industry, fast and accurate\u201d in\u00a0demanding conditions. \u201cWhile McDonald\u2019s is revaluating and refining its plans for AOT, we look forward to continuing to work with them on a variety of other projects,\u201d IBM said in a statement. McDonald\u2019s says this is not the end of\u00a0its AI efforts. It plans to\u00a0\u201cevaluate long-term, scalable solutions\u201d for voice-ordering by the end of 2024. \u201cAI is clearly going to be a part of restaurant automation and efficiencies going forward, but the technology is still in its infancy,\u201d said David Henkes, senior principal and head of strategic partnerships at Technomic. \u201cThe McDonald\u2019s experience and commitment to AI shows the potential upside, but it also shows the limitations of the technology at the present time.\u201d McDonald\u2019s is not the only fast-food chain experimenting with AI.
