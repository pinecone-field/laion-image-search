The drone flying over their building in Gaza was getting louder and she had a feeling that something bad was about to happen. \u201cWhatever happens to me, happens to him,\u201d she says of her reasoning in holding him so close to her baby bump. She does not remember the moment of impact, but the memory of the aftermath is imprinted in her brain. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel the strike itself, you just open your eyes and you are under the rubble,\u201d she says. She immediately started feeling around, searching for Azzouz, until her mother-in-law screamed. \u201cShe found him over my belly. She picked him up. His body was in her hands and his head dropped on my belly,\u201d she recalls. Since that moment on October 24, she has been questioning her will to live. She initially asked her family to leave her to die, but they instead went looking for help to dig her out of the destroyed house in Khan Younis. \u201cMy leg wasn\u2019t visible. My arm was only hanging to my body by a small piece of flesh. I tried to rip it apart but I couldn\u2019t, so I rested it over my belly,\u201d she says. By the time she reached the hospital she was presumed dead, she says. Her eight-month pregnancy made doctors look again and they delivered her daughter Mariam by cesarian. \u201cAs she took her first breath, I came back to life. The doctors told me it was a miracle,\u201d she says. Hijazi tells her story in a faint voice lying in a hospital bed in Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital. Her left arm was amputated, and both legs sustained extensive damage, requiring bone grafts to repair them. Critical delay Despite the occasional groans of pain, the relatively quiet hallways of the Gaza ward at Hamad Hospital in Doha are starkly different from the overwhelmed medical facilities in Gaza. Behind every door is a story of a miraculous survival tainted by inconsolable loss. Mothers being treated for life-altering injuries can finally begin to process the loss of a child and struggle with their diminished ability to care for their surviving children. \u201cMy daughter is the one that saved me. When I was first injured, I was saying, \u2018I don\u2019t want her. I want my son back,\u2019\u201d Hijazi says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even lift my head. I couldn\u2019t see her, much less take care of her.\u201d\u00a0She hopes that one day her daughter will give her the energy to carry on. Hijazi was evacuated from Gaza for medical treatment a month after her injury. Mariam, almost as old as the war and with the same chubby cheeks as her late brother, is with her grandparents in Egypt. Hijazi has watched Mariam grow up on video calls. She hasn\u2019t held her for over six months. In Doha, she leaves the hospital between surgeries and doctors assure her she will be able to walk again. \u201cI have been working in orthopedics for around 21 years. The kind of injuries, the severity of the injuries, the types of bone loss, and the kind of infections we faced with the Gaza patients are beyond (anything) I\u2019ve seen before,\u201d says Dr. Hasan Abuhejleh, consultant orthopedic surgeon at Hamad Hospital. He has had to tell many patients that their amputations, while necessary to save their lives, could have been avoided if there were more resources available to them in Gaza. More than 4,800 people have been evacuated from Gaza for medical treatment since Israel launched its military offensive in response to the Hamas attacks of October 7, and thousands more in a serious condition are waiting to leave. Israel has denied 42% of the medical evacuation requests made, the United Nations and aid agencies said in an update on May 10. In recent days, they added, \u201cthe closure of Rafah Crossing has abruptly halted all medical evacuations of critically ill and injured patients outside Gaza.\u201d CNN has not yet received a response from Israel\u2019s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to its request for comment on the rejected medical evacuation requests. Delays to medical evacuations have had a huge impact on the cases that come to Abuhejleh\u2019s hospital. Haunting photo The pain reverberates in different frequencies through the hospital rooms. Shaimaa Al-Ghoul messages the CNN team from an isolation room. Like many patients coming out of Gaza, she has a drug-resistant infection picked up in the territory\u2019s struggling hospitals. Al-Ghoul lost her husband and two of her four children in an airstrike in Rafah in February. The family was sleeping in one room when, suddenly, \u201cthe bed was split in half and I fell onto the ground floor,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI heard Hothaifa (her 11-year-old son) pleading for rescuers not to leave him behind. I didn\u2019t hear my husband or Jenan or Mohamed, so I knew they were martyrs,\u201d she says. She was nine months pregnant and believes the shrapnel that hit her belly also killed her unborn son. Abdullah was delivered\u00a0stillborn the following day. Al-Ghoul shares cheerful pictures of her children before the war, followed by a widely -circulated photo of her daughter Jenan\u2019s\u00a0body, lower limbs severed and\u00a0propelled by the blast to dangle from a window by the scarf she wore to bed. She wants to show the horrors of the war and the memories she and others in this ward are haunted by. Her son Hothaifa roams the hospital hallways on crutches. His injured leg is too swollen to bear weight. The laughs that come easily to his 6-year-old sister, Mariam, who wasn\u2019t with the family that night and was evacuated uninjured, seem to be foreign to the muscles of his face. Mariam enters a room which other patients had warned us housed patients with horrific stories of pain and loss. She plays on the beds left empty when some patients go out in their wheelchairs for a breath of fresh air at sunset. Life after loss Inside that room, Shahed Alqutati, 23, has just finished physiotherapy. Her left leg was amputated and the other is encased in an external fixator \u2013 a metal frame holding her smashed bones together. The strike that hit her third-floor apartment in northern Gaza on October 11 threw her and her husband Ali, a 26-year-old university professor, onto the street. Shellshocked, she opened her eyes to find her leg torn and blood everywhere. \u201cMy husband was in front of me. He was also injured. He lost both his legs and his hand. I shouted to him \u2018Ali, Ali.\u2019 He heard me and he also shouted \u2018Shahed.\u2019 He looked at his severed arm and asked me \u2018where is my arm.\u2019\u201d These were the last words they shared. Both were taken to hospital but Ali did not survive. She lost the love of her life and the baby they were about to have. \u201cA week before the war we bought everything for the baby, every clothes, every t-shirt. (sic) Pink, pink, pink. We were very excited,\u201d she recalls. Her daughter Sham was stillborn two days after the strike, two months before she was due. Her suffering didn\u2019t end there. Alqutati was taken to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City for treatment \u2013 and in November endured an Israeli siege that left patients and medical staff without food or water and with dwindling medical supplies. After two weeks, the Israeli military forced her and others out of the hospital. Her father pushed her in a wheelchair along damaged roads. At a checkpoint, she says, Israeli \u201csoldiers shot in the air and told people to go back. Go back where? There is no place to go. We walked and walked for too many hours,\u201d she says. That obstacle added another day to their arduous journey on the streets. By the time they reached Rafah, her wounds were bleeding and infected, Alqutati says, but she was still afraid of entering hospitals struggling to cope with a daily influx of people injured in the conflict. \u201cIf I went to the hospital, I\u2019ll die, not recover or heal,\u201d she says. Her father dressed her wounds away from the hospitals. Treatment came after she was medically evacuated out of Gaza, and with it the time to process the loss. In one of the many videos she shares on social media, her late husband Ali is seen sheepishly smiling when he realizes she\u2019s filming him again, at a university function, from the backseat of a car, as he paces in a shop. \u201cNo one will feel (my) pain. With the people (I am) strong, happy, laughing. But when I am alone, I feel something painful here,\u201d she says pointing to her heart. \u201cI cannot be healed from that,\u201d she says. \u201cThis will stay with me for all my life. Amputation, fractures, burns, nerve problems \u2026 There is no new leg for me. This is something that will not be forgotten. And how can I forget? I lost my beloved one and my baby,\u201d she adds. Despite the different outcome of their pregnancies, Alqutati and Hijazi describe a similar despair that shackles them to the horrors of the war in Gaza. Like many medical evacuees, they are uncertain about their future and where they might end up, and worried about the family members stuck in Gaza. \u201cLife has ended. There is no more joy,\u201d Hijazi says. \u201cI close my eyes and all the memories overwhelm me. I went to the mall and saw the baby formula I used for my son, and I felt I was dying. And it was just baby formula. You can only imagine what happens when I see his picture or videos or his toys or his clothes,\u201d she says. Tears stream down her face when she watches a video she filmed of Azzouz giggling. \u201cThe pain will never go away. It\u2019s things that can\u2019t be forgotten,\u201d she says. \u201cWe give birth only to lose them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/middleeast/injured-palestinian-mothers-children-qatar-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_middleeast_israel-memorial-day-protests-intl-latam", "text": "Protesters took to the streets of several cities across Israel on Saturday, demanding the release of all hostages held in Gaza ahead of Israel\u2019s Memorial Day. They demanded the resignation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and for early elections to be held. Families of hostages held in Gaza also took part in anti-government protests, including in Tel Aviv, Caesarea, Rehovot, and Haifa. The protests come as Israel gears up to mark Memorial Day starting Sunday evening. Many waved Israeli flags and held up signs with images of the Israeli hostages, calling on the government to bring them home alive. Around 240 people were taken hostage and moved to Gaza during Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel that also killed more than 1,200 people. A little more than 100 were freed during a release deal in November, but the Israel Defense Forces believes there are still 132 hostages being held in Gaza, 128 of whom were taken on October 7. The believes that, of those 128, only 92 are still alive. Among those at the protests Saturday was Yael Adar, the mother of Tamir Adar, who was abducted on October 7 and whose death was announced in January. She said all she wanted was to bring back the body of her son so she could hold a proper burial. \u201cFor 90 days, we fought for his return alive, 90 days of hoping that Tamir would return to us, to the bosom of the family \u2013 a hope that vanished with the news that he was no longer alive,\u201d Adar said during a rally. \u201cSince then, all we ask is to bring Tamir and all the murdered hostages back for burial, here in the land they loved. To grant Tamir the burial he deserves. To grant us closure, to have a grave where we can be with his memory,\u201d she added. Hagit Chen, mother of Itay Chen, who was killed on October 7 and whose remains were taken into Gaza, said she wanted to bury her son in peace. \u201cI have been invited to take part in many ceremonies for Israel\u2019s Remembrance Day, but the only ceremony that I ought to be in, with my family and with the memory of my own son, is a ceremony that the country has not enabled me to have,\u201d Chen said. \u201cHow much more suffering can one take? I turn to the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu: It is time that you bring them all back! The living for rehabilitation and the fallen for a respectful, appropriate Jewish burial,\u201d she added. Hostage died a month ago, Hamas says The protests came as the Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, claimed that one of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza died more than a month ago. Abu Obaida, the military wing\u2019s spokesperson, said on Telegram that Nadav Popplewell, who was 51 years old when abducted, had died of wounds he sustained after an Israeli airstrike hit the place where he was held. \u201cHis health condition deteriorated and he died because he did not receive intensive medical care,\u201d Obaida said. Popplewell, who has dual British-Israeli citizenship, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nirim on October 7, 2023. His mother, Channah Peri, was also abducted but was released as part of the hostage deal on November 24. His brother Roi was killed on October 7. The Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office told CNN it did not know whether Popplewell was alive or dead. The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment. The United Kingdom\u2019s Foreign Office said it is seeking more information about Popplewell. \u201cThe UK government has been working with partners across the region to secure the release of hostages, including British nationals. We will continue to do all we can to secure the release of hostages,\u201d the office told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/middleeast/israel-memorial-day-protests-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_climate_heat-wave-asia-gaza-climate-intl", "text": "A deadly heat wave in Gaza in April, which saw punishing temperatures worsen an already dire humanitarian crisis, was made hotter and more likely by the human-caused climate crisis, according to an analysis published Tuesday. Gaza was not alone. Several heat waves spanning a vast area of the Asian continent last month during the\u00a0world\u2019s hottest April on record\u00a0were made more intense and likely by the climate crisis, the analysis from the World Weather Attribution initiative (WWA) found. The WWA report divided the heat waves into three areas: West Asia, the Philippines and a region spanning South and Southeast Asia. In West Asia, the analysis focused on the Palestinian territories, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan, where temperatures spiked above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) last month. It found climate change made the heat in this region around five times more likely and 1.7 degrees Celsius hotter than it would have been before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels. Soaring temperatures had a particularly stark impact on the 1.7 million displaced people in Gaza, already struggling with insufficient water access and inadequate healthcare. There was little respite from the relentless heat for those crammed into makeshift tents and shelters, often covered with plastic sheets. At least three people, including two children, reportedly died from the heat, the analysis notes. In the Philippines, the extreme heat last month \u2014 which forced hundreds of schools to close as temperatures reached more than 42 degrees Celsius \u2014 had such a strong link to human-caused global warming the report concluded it would have been impossible without it. To calculate the influence of climate change on the extreme heat, WWA researchers used weather data and computer models to compare the world\u2019s current climate \u2014 which is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels \u2014 with the climate of the past. \u201cFrom Gaza to Delhi to Manila, people suffered and died when April temperatures soared in Asia,\u201d Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment and a report author, said in a statement. \u201cHeat waves have always happened. But the additional heat, driven by emissions from oil, gas and coal, is resulting in death for many people.\u201d The scientists also examined the role of El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate pattern that influences global weather. While they found it had no influence in West Asia\u2019s April heat, it did affect the intensity of heat in the Philippines, pushing up temperatures by 0.2 degrees Celsius. However, the impact of climate change there was greater, increasing temperatures by about 1.2 degrees. In today\u2019s warmer world, the kind of extreme heat waves experienced in Gaza and West Asia, as well as the Philippines, are not rare and can be expected around once every 10 years, the report found. But it warns worse could be in store. If the planet\u2019s average temperature rises to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, which is predicted to happen in the 2040s or 2050s if the world does not decarbonize fast enough, similar extreme heat waves could be expected once every five years in West Asia and every two to three years in the Philippines. Heat wave made 45 times more likely The WWA analysis also looked at parts of South and Southeast Asia, many of which also experienced unprecedented heat last month. Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam all broke records for their hottest April day, while temperatures spiked to 46 degrees Celsius (115 Fahrenheit) \ufeffin India. Bangladesh and Thailand also experienced scorching April temperatures and were included in the study. Climate change also played a pronounced role in this region, according to the analysis, making the heat 45 times more likely and 0.85 degrees Celsius hotter. The scientists took a simpler approach than usual for this part of Asia, looking only at weather data and not computer models, because the region overlapped with two previous analyses of extreme heat events in 2022 and 2023, which also found climate change played a strong role. The numbers in the report are important, Otto said, \u201cbecause they show us that everywhere climate change is an absolute game changer when it comes to extreme heat.\u201d But numbers alone don\u2019t necessarily show how bad the impacts are \u2014 these depend on people\u2019s vulnerability and exposure. Days of temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) were \u201cparticularly difficult for people working outdoors, people living in informal housing (and) people living in refugee camps,\u201d Otto said. Asia is also home to some of the planet\u2019s fastest growing cities, said Carolina Pereira Marghidan, climate risk consultant at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, on a call with reporters. This has led to rapid, unplanned development. \u201cMany cities have seen extreme losses of green space,\u201d Pereira said, increasing the impacts of extreme heat on residents. The world must take \u201cmassive, unprecedented steps to reduce emissions,\u201d said Mariam Zachariah, a researcher at the Grantham Institute, in a statement. If not, she added, \u201cextreme heat will lead to even greater suffering in Asia.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/climate/heat-wave-asia-gaza-climate-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_americas_guyana-nigel-dharamlall-sexual-assault-allegations-intl-latam", "text": "A powerful politician in Guyana has been accused of sexual assault for the second time in less than a year, following his resignation last July over separate allegations. The accuser, economist Sarah Aneesah Hakh, told an online press conference held in the capital Georgetown that former Minister Nigel Dharamlall sexually assaulted her in 2020 and 2021. Hakh said the first alleged incident occurred during a business meeting when Dharamlall was Guyana\u2019s senior minister of regional development. \u201cThe fact that he is still in that party is mind boggling to me,\u201d Hakh said. Dharamlall, a Guyanese politician seen as a power broker in the country, was recently appointed to the executive committee of Guyana\u2019s ruling People\u2019s Progressive Party. He has been photographed recently with Guyanese President Irfaan Ali and Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo. Dharamlall rejected the allegations in a statement posted on his Facebook page, saying \u201cI wish to categorically and most vehemently deny each and every one of the allegations made.\u201d He accused Hakh of being on a \u201ccampaign to tarnish my reputation,\u201d claiming that \u201cher demeanor towards me changed fundamentally after I rebuffed her advances and spurned her attempts to engage in an intimate relationship.\u201d CNN has reached out to Dharamlall for comment and has contacted the office of Guyana President Irfaan Ali. Dharamlall resigned from Guyana\u2019s cabinet and parliament last year after an indigenous teenage girl accused him of rape in an unrelated incident, which he has denied. The girl later withdrew the claim according to officials and no charges were filed, President Ali said\u202fin a video statement\u202flast July. He emphasized at the time that his government had \u201callowed the system to work. We have not intervened; from day one,\u201d apparently referencing public criticism over how the girl\u2019s case was handled by authorities. Her withdrawal however was seen by some as a sign of government corruption, with the public speculating her family had been paid off. In a March statement, Guyanese women\u2019s rights group Red Thread criticized officials for failing the accuser. \u201cIt is of great concern that the public nature of this complaint, the powerful political status of the suspect, the discontinuance of the matter at this early stage and the haste with which this investigation was ended, will reinforce the perception of impunity, and inevitably discourage other victims of sexual violence from coming forward,\u201d it wrote. \u2018Violated against my will\u2019 Hakh, who was seen as a rising star in Guyana, said she was first assaulted by Dharamlall during what was supposed to be a meeting about her taking a role as a regional executive officer in September 2020. She alleged that Dharamlall took the then-25-year-old into his bedroom, disrobed and forcibly performed oral sex on her without her consent in the Anna Regina State House, a town on the country\u2019s coast. Hakh told reporters on Friday that she told Dharamlall to stop several times, saying she is a lesbian and \u201cthis is not something I came here expecting to do and can\u2019t offer anything.\u201d \u201cI was violated against my will by a man who exploited my situation and tried to entrap me in a compromising situation due to my future contract with the ministry,\u201d she said. Hakh also alleged that a second incident took place in 2021, in the Cummings Lodge neighborhood on the outskirts of Georgetown, when she says she met Dharamlall to discuss several grievances she had with the ministry of local government. During their meeting, Hakh alleges Dharamlall tried to remove her clothes. Hakh told CNN she didn\u2019t file a police report in 2020 or 2021 due to fears of police corruption and that she would be shunned publicly and within her family, which she says did business with Dharamlall. \u201cI knew I was going up against something that was dangerous and my whole strategy was that if I made a report that was preemptive, and it didn\u2019t go anywhere, I automatically had no credibility,\u201d she told the press conference on Friday, adding that she finally filed a police report on May 9. Hakh said she also filed cyberbullying charges against Dharamlall on May 8.\u202f CNN has contacted Guyanese police for comment. Hakh said she decided to go public with her allegation because \u201cI need to give victims the strength to know that they\u2019re not alone, and that there is no shame in what happened to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/americas/guyana-nigel-dharamlall-sexual-assault-allegations-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

The girls decided to step down and give (up) their dream of a lifetime \u2014 a crown, a national title. Why would two girls decide to give that up?\u201d It is the first time the mothers have spoken publicly about the ordeal, which roiled the pageant world last week. It marked the first time a titleholder in Miss USA or Miss Teen USA had resigned, and both happened in quick succession. On Instagram, UmaSofia Srivastava said her values \u201cno longer aligned\u201d with those of the organization, while Noelia Voigt cited her mental health, though her long, cryptic statement seemed to spell out \u201cI am silenced\u201d in the first 11 sentences. Speaking on Good Morning America, Jackeline declined to answer whether the supposed secret message was intentional. But responding to whether she feels as if her daughter was silenced, she said \u201cShe is, and she would be the rest of her life if this NDA is not (lifted).\u201d Voigt\u2019s resignation letter to Miss USA, obtained and published by CNN on Saturday, revealed a range of allegations against Miss USA CEO Laylah Rose, including a \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d rife with \u201cbullying.\u201d According to the letter, Rose is \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control, the antithesis of women\u2019s empowerment, that is\u2026unsafe for future titleholders and employees,\u201d Voigt wrote. Among the issues, Voigt claimed that Rose failed to provide her with appropriate travel accommodations or an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d leading to an incident where she was left alone in a car with a stranger at a parade in Sarasota, Florida, where an unnamed man sexually harassed her, she wrote. Her mother, who was with her in Sarasota, saw her just after the alleged incident occurred, she said in the interview. \u201cI saw Noelia so stressed out, and I said, \u2018What happened?\u2019 and she said, \u2018Mom, get in the car,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe told Noelia, \u2018Are you into old men with money?\u2019 and made Noelia very, very uncomfortable.\u201d Rose did not apologize, according to Jackeline. In her resignation letter, Voigt said that Rose told her that the organization \u201ccannot prevent people saying things to you at public appearances\u201d and that it is \u201cunfortunately, part of the role.\u201d Barbara Srivastava said that during their reigning year, the titleholders were \u201cill-treated, abused, bullied and cornered.\u201d Jackeline called for the Miss Universe Organization, which owns Miss USA, to \u201cspeak to us or apologize.\u201d The parent organization, owned by JKN Global Group, has been silent over the past week. The Miss USA and Miss Universe Organization did not immediately return a request for comment, and did not respond to CNN\u2019s earlier requests for comments on Friday. For now, the mothers are warning prospective pageant contestants about getting involved with Miss USA. On Wednesday, the runner-up for Miss USA, Savannah Gankiewicz from Hawaii, will step up and take the title in a ceremony. But Miss Teen USA remains open, as the runner-up from 2023, New York\u2019s Stephanie Skinner, declined to be crowned in a public statement on Instagram. CNN has contacted the second runner-up, Miss Pennsylvania Teen Maggie Ross, on whether she will take the title, but no announcement has been made. \u201cLook at what happened to Noelia and UmaSofia. Right now, it\u2019s not the right time to participate,\u201d Jackeline said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want these families and these girls to go through what we\u2019re going through,\u201d she added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/style/miss-usa-mothers-gma/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Cold lava, also known as lahar, is a mixture of volcanic debris such as ash, sand and pebbles that flows down a volcano\u2019s slopes during wet weather. Images\u00a0shared by Indonesia\u2019s disaster response agency showed thick mud and ash partially covering roads and\u00a0mountainside villages near the foot of Mount Marapi, an active volcano in western Sumatra.

Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

President Joe Biden will appear at the site in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, on Wednesday to highlight the administration\u2019s efforts to invest in job growth in America. The news comes six years after the Trump administration announced a $10 billion investment by tech manufacturer Foxconn \u2013 with the promise to bring 13,000 jobs to the area \u2013 on the same Wisconsin land, a plan that never materialized. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. Microsoft said it will use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state on generative AI by\u00a02030, thanks in part to a partnership with United Way Wisconsin, United Way Racine and other community partners. It also plans to open a lab on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to help companies and manufacturers infuse the technology into their businesses. Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella earned a master\u2019s degree in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, according to his company profile. In his remarks Wednesday, Biden plans to directly point his finger at Trump for the failed project, according to a White House official. In a statement sent to CNN, Foxconn parent company Hon Hai Technology Group said it \u201ccontinues to grow\u201d in Wisconsin and \u201csupports expansion of technology and innovation to the state.\u201d Foxconn, which said it has invested about $1 billion into the state, still has a major manufacturing site for data servers in Racine County with more than 1,000 employees. It has facilities in 205 locations across 24 countries. \u201cEmployment at Foxconn Wisconsin has grown at least 42% in the three years since 2020,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe have been Racine County\u2019s largest taxpayer in recent years.\u201d The president\u2019s visit to the key battleground state will also present an opportunity for the White House to try to highlight some of the Biden administration\u2019s key first term achievements \u2014 and specifically, funding from legislation like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the so called \u201cChips Act,\u201d which invests in semiconductor chip manufacturing in the United States, that will boost the Badger State.

Last year, Biden signed an executive order on AI aimed to get entrepreneurs access to technical assistance and resources, help small businesses commercialize AI breakthroughs, and expand grants for AI research in areas such as healthcare and climate change. The White House also introduced an order in 2023 to require AI system developers to share results of their safety tests with the federal government before they are released to the public. Microsoft\u2019s move comes at a time when the government seeks to monitor and regulate the risks of artificial intelligence.

{"id": "2024_05_13_style_upcycled-clothes-fashion-brands-lawsuits", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 A little over a year ago, NFL player Travis Kelce stepped out in a flamboyant silk shirt emblazoned with two barrel-chest-sized pink flamingos and trimmed across the bottom with a giant Chanel logo. The design was upcycled from vintage Chanel scarves by stylist Logan Horne, whose brand, J. Logan Home, specializes in refashioning heritage luxury accessories. His pieces, which retail at close to $3,000 each, have also been worn by the musicians Dua Lipa and 2 Chainz and are sold at stores including Farfetch, Kith and The Webster. They\u2019ve also caught the attention of the French luxury giant\u2019s legal department. In February, lawyers acting for Chanel sent Horne a cease and desist letter, demanding his label stop selling products bearing its logo and other brand signifiers. It\u2019s the latest in a flurry of cases that have turned upcycling into an emerging legal battle ground, pitting a practice that\u2019s been pitched as key to improving the industry\u2019s sustainability credentials against the established bounds of trademark protection. \u201cWe really have these two values that point in different directions,\u201d said Fashion Law Institute founder Susan Scafidi. \u201c(Upcycling) is absolutely risky, despite the fact that it is trending and ethical.\u201d Why is upcycling controversial? Chanel\u2019s objection to J. Logan Home\u2019s designs isn\u2019t exactly a bolt from the blue. Major luxury players have historically been wary of the secondary market, concerned it could damage their carefully controlled hold on brand distribution and image, cannibalize sales and encourage counterfeiting. It\u2019s a tension that has played out prominently over the last decade thanks to the rapid rise of online resale platforms. Though some brands have begun to tentatively embrace the space, others have remained cautious. Chanel, in particular, has pursued high-profile cases against re-commerce players it argues are using its brand without permission and selling fakes. (The brand scored a major win earlier this year, when a New York court awarded it $4 million in damages in its suit against the resale business What Goes Around Comes Around. A separate legal dispute with The RealReal is ongoing.) Smaller-scale upcycling has attracted less attention so far. But the practice has become more widespread, driven in part by demand for logo-heavy streetwear, greater access to vintage products and deadstock fabrics and a growing desire among young designers to operate sustainably. That\u2019s given rise to an increasing number of trademark and copyright infringement complaints targeting upcyclers from brands including Louis Vuitton and Levi\u2019s, as well as Chanel. In 2022, Louis Vuitton secured a $603,000 pay out and permanent injunction in a Texas case against a business selling refashioned Vuitton products. Last year, Levi\u2019s brought a complaint against French label Coperni, alleging it was using pocket stitching and fabric tabs confusingly similar to the famed denim label. The sale of such products, alongside items that had actually been upcycled from Levi\u2019s jeans without authorization, created additional risk of consumer confusion, the company argued. Both brands declined to comment when reached by Business of Fashion. Does upcycling infringe on brands\u2019 trademarks? The disputes reflect legitimate trademark and copyright concerns, but they also raise questions over how far these protections should stretch when they conflict with broader sustainability goals, according to legal experts. \u201cIt is a grey area within the law,\u201d said Scafidi. \u201cBrands absolutely have a legal leg to stand on. The question is how well-clad it is.\u201d In general terms, once a brand has sold an item, it becomes fair game to be resold or redistributed by third parties. But this principle, known as the first-sale doctrine or trademark exhaustion, may not apply if an item has been reworked or embellished, lawyers said. Upcyclers can take precautions, like avoiding the prominent use of logos, or providing consumers with clear disclosures that reworked products are not authorized or affiliated with the brands they reference (an approach J. Logan Home adopted). But these steps still may not be sufficient to counter arguments of copyright or trademark infringement, according to lawyers. And while the legal frameworks protecting companies\u2019 intellectual property are well established, whether the sustainability benefits of upcycling should be weighed against these hasn\u2019t really been tested. \u201cIf we want to move from a linear to a circular economy, we need to upcycle,\u201d said Irene Calboli, a professor of law at Texas A&M University. \u201cThe fact that intellectual property law gets in the way of those who want to upcycle or recycle is just wrong.\u201d Chanel said it is paying close attention to sustainability matters, pointing to its work with L\u2019Atelier des Mati\u00e8res, which recycles unsold items and deadstock from luxury and premium brands. \u201c(Upcycling is) a positive trend that we continue to explore, and we have always been conscious of the need to strike a balance between protecting the rights of our brand and the rights of others to create and trade freely,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cHowever, the use of elements stamped with the Chanel logo is sometimes simply an unauthorized misappropriation of our trademarks\u2026 in such cases, we take the action we deem appropriate to protect our rights.\u201d The wider legal crackdown hasn\u2019t only targeted brands making prominent use of logos either. Before she became a celebrated New York designer, Batsheva Hay worked as a copyright lawyer. So it was a shock when she found herself on the receiving end of a cease and desist letter from a large commercial brand over a short run of dresses made from deadstock fabric sourced from India. Though it bore no obvious logo, as it turned out, the print she used had been made for a bigger player who didn\u2019t want to see it reproduced elsewhere. \u201cI was really humiliated and horrified because I thought it was some cool vintage fruit print and it turned out to be some kind of junky commercial print,\u201d said Hay. Rather than take on the time and expense of fighting the case, she just took the remaining three dresses she hadn\u2019t yet sold off her site. What does this mean for the future of upcycling? Horne says he can\u2019t afford to fight Chanel, which has threatened to seek statutory damages of $2 million per mark, disgorgement of all profits and payment of its attorney\u2019s fees if he doesn\u2019t stop selling products carrying the company\u2019s branding, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by Business of Fashion. Instead, he said he\u2019s looking at to pivot his brand while continuing to find creative ways to address the industry\u2019s issues with waste and over-production. The dream would be an opportunity to officially collaborate with an established label on an upcycled collection. \u201cAs much as I believe in my mission\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to go bankrupt going to battle with Chanel,\u201d he said. Industry watchers say the current flurry of cases reflect a broader adjustment to emerging new models. Some big brands, like Prada, Gucci and indeed Levi\u2019s, have already dabbled with upcycling collections and programs of their own. Anna Foster, who runs the refashioned brand E.L.V. Denim, has partnered with companies including Gabriela Hearst and The Outnet to help upcycle excess inventory. These days, she says she\u2019s having about a conversation a week with brands interested in exploring collaboration, but the industry moves slowly. Meanwhile, politics may be moving at a faster speed, creating different challenges for brands. Both consumers and policy makers are increasingly aware of the huge levels of waste generated by the fashion industry, with new regulations that would make brands more responsible for dealing with old clothes and excess inventory in the pipeline in both Europe and the US. \u201cWe really are at an inflection point where we might have a result in court that is different from the result in the court of social media,\u201d said Scafidi. \u201cIt\u2019s that tension that really needs to be resolved.\u201d This article was originally published by\u00a0The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

{"id": "2024_05_14_americas_venezuela-essequibo-guyana-csis-intl-latam", "text": "Venezuela continues to build up military infrastructure and hardware close to the border with Guyana as President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters scale up their threats to annex an\u00a0oil-rich piece of Guyanese land. In a report shared with CNN, the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that while the Venezuelan government \u201chas little to gain and much to lose from a full-blown conflict\u201d it continues to play \u201ca dangerous game\u201d over its claim over the densely forested Essequibo region. \u201cThe constant drumbeat asserting \u2018the Essequibo is ours,\u2019 alongside the creation of new military commands and legal structures to oversee the defense of the region, is helping to institutionalize a sense of perpetual prewar footing,\u201d it wrote. Tension over the region, which amounts to about two-thirds of Guyanese national territory, mounted last year after a Venezuelan referendum in which voters assented to creating\u00a0a Venezuelan state within the disputed region. Guyana had called the move a step towards annexation and an \u201cexistential\u201d threat as the specter of armed conflict loomed over the region. CNN previously reported in February about an expansion of operations at Venezuela\u2019s Anacoco Island military base despite both countries agreeing in December to pursue a diplomatic avenue to resolve the conflict. Using satellite imagery and social media, CSIS found that the expansion of Anacoco Island\u2019s military base has continued. A bridge is seen being built across the Cuyuni River to connect the Venezuelan riverbank to the island, which has been a point of contention between the countries after it was awarded to Guyana in an 1899 ruling by an international tribunal. Venezuela annexed it in the 1960s. The island\u2019s airfield has expanded and now includes a small control tower, CSIS writes. Satellite imagery from March showed an area next to the airfield with more than 75 field tents, \u201cenough for a battalion-sized unit of several hundred personnel.\u201d The field tents have since been relocated to the southern side of the airfield \u201cdemonstrating the base\u2019s continued ability to provide logistics and resupply for a sizeable military force continuously for over a month,\u201d it wrote. Meanwhile, by the coast, at least two Iranian-built\u00a0Peykaap III (Zolfaghar) fast missile boats are seen at Venezuela\u2019s small coast guard station at Punta Barima, \u201cplacing Venezuelan missiles and naval forces within arm\u2019s reach of the Guyana-administered Essequibo\u201d as it just 40 miles (64 kilometers) from the Guyanese border. Maduro could \u2018fall victim to own rhetoric\u2019 The threats to Guyana have concerned its partners. Last week, two US Navy F/A-18 fighter jets flew over the capital Georgetown, demonstrating \u201cour routine security cooperation and expanding bilateral defense partnership with Guyana,\u201d the US Embassy in Guyana wrote. While smaller than Idaho, Guyana is home to vast oil reserves and is on track to become the world\u2019s highest per capita oil producer. It, however, has an army estimated to be less than 5,000 soldiers, and lacks the hardware or manpower to face possible Venezuelan aggression. All things considered, \u201cif you\u2019re if you\u2019re Guyana, and your army is 5,000 people, it doesn\u2019t seem like the Venezuelans are taking their foot off the gas,\u201d Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program\u00a0at CSIS and lead author of the report, told CNN. There has been speculation that the upcoming Venezuelan elections at the end of July have given Maduro the motivation to escalate against Guyana, using it as a way to distract from his record: Millions of people have fled the country due to poor economic conditions, food shortages and limited access to health care. CSIS argues that instead of tamping down the aggression after the vote, \u201cMaduro may be tempted to ramp up both rhetoric and action related to the Essequibo in a true gambit to manufacture a regional crisis in the aftermath of a stolen election.\u201d It may not be in Maduro\u2019s interest to \u201cinitiate a full-blown conflict with neighbor Guyana, but his escalatory rhetoric tethers his political reputation and legitimacy to his willingness to back his words with force\u201d especially with his key internal ally, the armed forces, CSIS writes. \u201cThus, one of the most concerning possibilities is that Maduro will fall victim to his own rhetoric. He has whipped up nationalist passions without providing an escape valve.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/americas/venezuela-essequibo-guyana-csis-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_style_alice-munro-dies-92-author-obituary", "text": "Alice Munro, the Nobel Literature Prize winner best known for her mastery of short stories and depictions of womanhood in rural settings, has died in Ontario, Canada, at the age of 92. The news was confirmed to CNN \u201cwith great sadness\u201d by a spokesperson at her publisher, Penguin Random House. Born in 1931 in Wingham, Ontario, Munro grew up on what she described as the \u201ccollapsing enterprise of a fox and mink farm, just beyond the most disreputable part of town\u201d in a 1994 interview with \u201cThe Paris Review.\u201d Amid familial struggles, Munro found an escape in reading as a child. Her early enthusiasm for renowned writers such as Emily Bront\u00eb, Charles Dickens, and Lucy Maud Montgomery, among others, reflected an appreciation for literature beyond her age. \u201cBooks seem to me to be magic, and I wanted to be part of the magic.\u201d she told The Guardian of her childhood reading habits. \u201cBooks were so important to me. They were far more important than life.\u201d As the valedictorian of her high school\u2019s graduating class of 1949, Munro received a two-year scholarship to attend the University of Western Ontario, where she majored in journalism before switching to English. Despite the scholarship initially being a lifeline for Munro, perpetual financial struggles forced her to work as a tobacco picker, a library clerk and even to sell her own blood while studying. After the conclusion of her scholarship, and before her graduation, she married fellow student James Munro and moved with him to Vancouver, where the couple had three children in relatively quick succession (their middle child, Catherine, died shortly after her birth due to kidney complications), and then to Victoria in 1963, where they opened a bookstore. There, Munro wholly immersed herself in literature, namely writers such as Eudora Welty, Flannery O\u2019Connor, and Carson McCullers, whose work Munro told \u201cThe Paris Review\u201d validated her desire to write about rural people in small towns. In addition, she was able to overcome a crippling writer\u2019s block that had plagued her in her twenties \u2014\u202fand had resulted in more abandoned work than finished writing. But it was maternity that led to Munro\u2019s mastery of short stories, not only because familial relationships and domestic lives served as a focal point in many of her works, but also because in her attempt to reconcile her maternal responsibilities with her desire to write, Munro could only set aside short periods of time during her day to craft stories, to the point where she would jot down ideas and drafts during her children\u2019s naps. Munro\u2019s mainstream breakthrough came in 1968 with the publication of her debut short story collection, \u201cDance of the Happy Shades.\u201d A collection of 15 of her earliest stories, the book received critical acclaim and won Canada\u2019s prestigious Governor General\u2019s Award for Fiction in the same year. It largely sets the tone for Munro\u2019s prose; semi-autobiographical in nature and exploring the universality of the human urge for self-discovery, love, and independence, through the mundanity of everyday life in small, rural communities. \u201cWhat you\u2019re getting in a small town is social attitude sort of distilled so you could look at them,\u201d Munro told Canadian broadcaster CBC in 1990. \u201cThe small town is like a stage for human lives.\u201d Throughout her writing career, Munro published 14 short story collections, and was a regular contributor in literary magazines such as \u201cThe New Yorker\u201d and \u201cTamarack Review.\u201d In several of her later collections, such as \u201cThe Moons of Jupiter\u201d and \u201cThe Progress of Love,\u201d Munro experimented with the traditional architecture of short stories and incorporated nonlinear narrative structures. She was also known for constantly editing and revising her stories, even after publication. Several of her short stories were adapted to film, including the 1983 Oscar-winning short \u201cBoys and Girls\u201d and the 2006 Oscar-nominated film \u201cAway from Her.\u201d In 2009, Munro revealed she had been treated for cancer and had undergone coronary bypass surgery. Three years later, she published her final collection of short stories, \u201cDear Life,\u201d which, although a drearier portrayal of small-town lives, served as a literary closure to her semi-autobiographical depictions of womanhood in rural towns. Munro\u2019s mastery of short stories and literature has been lauded by many of her contemporaries. Literary critic James Wood hailed Munro as \u201cour Chekhov,\u201d drawing similarities to the renowned Russian short story writer, while her compatriot and fellow writer Margaret Atwood elevated her to \u201cinternational literary sainthood.\u201d In 2013, Munro was selected as Nobel Laureate in Literature for her body of work spanning seven decades. The Nobel Committee described Munro as a \u201cmaster of the contemporary short story,\u201d whose writing captured \u201cthe feeling of just being a human being.\u201d \u201cI want my stories to move people,\u201d Munro said in her Nobel Lecture in absentia, \u201ceverything the story tells moves the (reader) in such a way that you feel you are a different person when you finish.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/style/alice-munro-dies-92-author-obituary/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

The number was reduced because the UN says it is now relying on the number of deceased women and children whose names and other identifying details have been fully documented, rather than the total number of women and children killed. The ministry says bodies that arrive at hospitals get counted in the overall death count. UN spokesperson Farhan Haq told a daily briefing at the UN that the health ministry in Gaza recently published two separate death tolls \u2013 an overall death toll and a total number of identified fatalities. In the UN report, only the total number of fatalities whose identities (such as name and date of birth) have been documented was published, leading to confusion. According to Haq, the ministry published a breakdown for 24,686 fully identified deaths out of the total 34,622 fatalities recorded in Gaza as of April 30. The fully identified death toll comprises of 7,797 children, 4,959 women, 1,924 elderly, and 10,006 men, the UN spokesperson said, citing the Gaza health ministry. The health authority in Gaza noted that the documentation process of casualties\u2019 full identification details is still ongoing, Haq added. Two officials from the Palestinian Ministry of Health have told CNN that although the ministry keeps a separate death toll for identified and unidentified individuals, the total number of people killed remains unchanged. The total number of dead also does not include the approximately 10,000 people who are still missing and trapped under the rubble, the officials added. Israel launched its military assault on Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people in Israel and abducted more than 250 others. Israel\u2019s months-long siege of the Palestinian enclave has since pulverized large parts of Gaza and drastically diminished critical supplies, exposing the entire population of more than 2.2 million people to the risk\u00a0of famine. CNN has seen a daily report from the Palestinian health ministry which matches the number OCHA published in the revised version. A total of 15,103 children and 9,961 women have been killed in Gaza since October 7, the Gaza ministry of health said in its latest report. Both the UN and US officials have previously appraised the figures from the Ministry of Health in Gaza as credible.  CNN cannot independently verify the ministry\u2019s numbers. The ministry does not distinguish between casualties among fighters and civilians.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/middleeast/death-toll-gaza-fatalities-un-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

The suspect was indicted on a charge of forced disappearance in the case involving the three tourists, whose bodies were found last week dumped in a 50-foot well with gunshot wounds to the head. The prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement Wednesday that it would also press charges of homicide. Brothers Jake and Callum Robinson and their friend Jack Carter Rhoad were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana when they went missing. Mexican authorities believe that at some point between the afternoon of April 27 and the following morning, several people approached the surfers intending to steal their vehicle, and \u201cdue to the reaction of the victims, they deprived them of their lives.\u201d Authorities said the suspect \u2013 one of three Mexican citizens who have been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping in the case \u2013 was captured a \u201cfew hours\u201d later. \u201cOther evidence was also collected, such as rods from tents, firearm casings, plastic gallon bottles, blood stains, and drag marks, in the place where they were presumably camping,\u201d authorities said. While Baja California\u00a0has been plagued by drug cartel violence in recent years, it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada. Dozens of people held a protest last week in Ensenada calling on authorities to do more to tackle violence facing tourists and locals alike. Many held up surfboards with slogans written on them in tribute to the three slain tourists. Drug cartels have terrorized Mexico with ever-increasing levels of violence, fueled in part by huge demand for drugs from US consumers and armed with an arsenal of weaponry from north of the border. While parts of Mexico are established tourist destinations, violent crime including kidnapping and human trafficking plague parts of the country, particularly in border areas. Mexico\u2019s\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is among the highest in the world, and\u00a0more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country.\u00a0Studies show only around seven percent of murders in Mexico are ever solved.

Spanning 14,830 acres (23.2 square miles), the land has \u201csignificant environmental, scientific and economic importance,\u201d according to a listing from agent Knight Frank. The archipelago is located between mainland Norway and the North Pole, and has taken on greater geopolitical importance as the sea ice melts, opening new shipping routes and increasing its strategic value. \u201cConsidering the geopolitical and strategical aspects, the commercial potential, the climate changes and the increasing interest of the arctic areas in general, the property represents a unique opportunity,\u201d according to the sellers. The land is found at Wedel Jarlsberg in western Svalbard and can be reached in three hours by boat from Longyearbyen, the largest settlement in the archipelago, which offers regular flights to the Norwegian capital Oslo, according to the listing. Located inside a fjord, the plot has five kilometers (three miles) of shoreline, as well as mountains, glaciers and \u201can abundance of wildlife,\u201d reads the listing. An eventual buyer will in fact acquire Aktieselskabet Kulspids, a privately owned Norwegian limited company which owns the land. Per Kyllingstad, a lawyer representing the sellers, told CNN that the company was formed more than a century ago by a group of wealthy industrialist families from Oslo, who explored the possibility of mining asbestos on the land. Since discovering that this is not feasible, there\u2019s been almost no activity there, Kyllingstad said Monday. The ownership of the company has evolved since, and the current owners have decided that increasing interest in the Arctic means now is a good time to sell, he explained. \u201cThis is the last private land on Svalbard,\u201d said Kyllingstad, who added that there is \u201chuge potential for a variety of activities.\u201d The lucky buyer will have permission to install \u201cwireless telegraphy installations,\u201d and the extreme northerly position of the property makes it an exceptional spot for satellite communications, he added. Potential buyers include nation states, government agencies or ultra high net worth individuals, Jonathan Webb, a lawyer for Zeiler Floyd Zadkovich, an international firm which is working with Kyllingstad on the sale, told CNN. \u201cIn terms of trophy properties, this is in a different league,\u201d said Webb. The purchaser will have to come from one of the 46 nations that have ratified the Svalbard Treaty, which established Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago. However, there are no restrictions on which nations can ratify the treaty, and all signatories have equal rights, said Kyllingstad. While the sellers thought it fair to offer the land to the Norwegian government, they will ultimately sell to the highest bidder on the open market, he added. While authorities in Oslo stepped in to buy another piece of land that was up for sale 10 years ago amid reported interest from China, the government cannot intervene to halt a sale to any treaty party, said Kyllingstad. \u201cThey are obliged to treat all the parties to the treaty equally,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/travel/svalbard-land-sale-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_14_china_xi-putin-china-summit-intl-hnk", "text": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping will welcome Vladimir Putin to China on Thursday for the Russian president\u2019s second visit in less than a year \u2013 the latest sign of their growing alignment amid hardening global fault lines as conflict devastates Gaza and Ukraine. Putin will arrive in China just over a week since entering a new term in office, extending his autocratic rule until 2030 \u2013 the result of an election without any true opposition. His visit, set to take place May 16-17, according to Chinese state media, mirrors Xi\u2019s own state visit to Moscow just over a year ago, where he marked the norm-shattering start of a new term as president \u2013 like Putin, after rewriting rules around how long leaders can serve. Their meeting comes months ahead of the American presidential elections and as Washington faces mounting international backlash over its support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. It\u2019s set to provide a platform for the leaders to discuss how all this can advance their shared ambition to degrade and offer an alternative to American power. The visit also comes as the two leaders operate within what observers say is a loose but growing coordination of interests between avowedly anti-American countries Iran and North Korea. Pyongyang \u2013 which has an economy almost entirely dependent of China \u2013 is believed by Western governments to be\u00a0aiding Russia\u00a0with war supplies.\u00a0So too, the US says,\u00a0is Tehran, which is being bolstered economically by Russia and China and is a powerful player in the conflict in the Middle East. Putin will arrive for the two-day state visit emboldened by the survival of his wartime economy and amid a major new offensive along key points of the front line in Ukraine. For Xi, freshly returned from a European tour, the visit is an opportunity to showcase that his allegiance to Putin has not broken his ability to engage with the West. But the optics of the strident allegiance belie a more challenging picture. Pressure is mounting on Beijing from Washington over its alleged support for Russia\u2019s defense industry. In Europe, Xi had to navigate sharp tensions in France \u2013 only welcomed with fanfare in Serbia and Hungary, while China\u2019s key partner, Russia, remains isolated on the world stage. Xi has ramped up his calls for Europe and other countries to help the world avoid a \u201cCold War,\u201d suggesting they resist what Beijing sees as US efforts to contain China. But the leader himself \u2013 including as he hosts Putin this week \u2013 is seen to be tightening relationships to underscore a growing global split that could deepen divisions with the West, whose technology and investment, experts say, China needs. \u201cWe live in a more dangerous world, authoritarian powers are increasingly aligned. Russia is receiving support for its war of aggression from China, Iran and North Korea,\u201d NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned last month. \u201cThis reminds us that security is not regional, security is global. And we must work with our like-minded partners around the world to preserve and protect transatlantic security.\u201d \u2018Grand strategy\u2019 Looming over Xi\u2019s meeting with Putin this week are Western threats of more sweeping actions against his country if it continues sending certain goods to Russia. The US government says dual-use exports are enabling Russia to build up its defense industry. \u201cThe pressures are arguably bigger than they were in the past two years,\u201d said Li Mingjiang, an associate professor of international relations at Singapore\u2019s Nanyang Technological University, pointing to a new raft of sanctions from the US earlier this month targeting Chinese firms \u2013 and the potential for more, including from the EU. China has said it closely monitors exports of dual-use goods and denies its trade with Russia is anything outside of normal bilateral exchange. Bilateral trade between the two countries reached a record $240 billion last year. Even close observers of Xi\u2019s opaque decision-making are divided on whether all this means the Chinese leader will seek to use his time with Putin this week to advocate for a settlement in the conflict soon. But China\u2019s official trade data from March and April both show declines in exports to Russia compared with the same periods the previous year \u2013 indicating Beijing may be taking steps to protect against Western sanctions hitting deeper into its commercial and financial sectors. Any recalibration there, however, is unlikely to stem deepening of cooperation across a range of areas between the two countries, who hold regular military drills and diplomatic exchanges. It\u2019s also unlikely to change Beijing\u2019s bottom line when it comes to Russia\u2019s war, analysts say. \u201cRussia is fundamental to China\u2019s grand strategy,\u201d said Manoj Kewalramani, who heads Indo-Pacific studies at the Takshashila Institution research center in Bangalore. While Beijing doesn\u2019t want escalation, \u201cthere is a deep interest in making sure that Russia doesn\u2019t lose the war,\u201d he said. \u2018Force multipliers\u2019 The war in Gaza \u2014 also expected to be a touchpoint in Xi and Putin\u2019s discussions \u2014 has opened opportunity for the two countries\u2019 shared goals, analysts say. Those goals, broadly speaking, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov put it during a joint presser with his counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing last month, include establishing a \u201cfair multipolar world order\u201d free from American \u201chegemony and neo-colonial\u201d practices, as well as working together to \u201cconsolidate the nations of the Global South.\u201d When it comes to Gaza, both powers have declined to condemn Hamas for its October 7 terror attack on Israel. They have also criticized Israel and the United States \u2013 converging with mounting global backlash, especially across the Global South against Israel\u2019s war. More than 35,000 have died in Gaza during the war, according to the health ministry there, and a mass humanitarian worsens with every week. China has limited hard influence in the region, while Russia has had some level of presence, but \u201cthey see each other as force multipliers,\u201d said Kewalramani in Bangalore, referring to the overlap in their response to this conflict. The conflict has also impacted how China and Russia view their relations with countries there, he added. That includes with Iran, which in the past year joined two Beijing and Moscow-founded international groups, BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. \u201cThey see Iran as part of the new order (they are working to create), whereas they see Israel as a proxy for the United States \u2026 that has become much sharper since October 7,\u201d he said. \u2018Privately and quietly\u2019 But as Xi continues to strengthen his relationship with Putin and Russia in an increasingly fractured world, this also raises questions \u2013 including from within China\u2019s policy circles and the public sphere \u2013 about where that leads the world\u2019s second largest economy. Unlike internationally isolated Russia or Iran, China is still viewed throughout the West as an important player and potential partner on global issues like climate change, despite concerns about its human rights record and aggression in the South China Sea and around Taiwan. \u201cChinese like me feel shameful to receive Vladimir Putin, because his country defies the UN charter \u2026 (and is viewed by) 141 countries as an aggressor,\u201d said Shanghai-based international scholar Shen Dingli. China \u201cwants to use Russia\u201d for its aims, but Russia is making China weak, he said. Popular suspicions and concerns about Russia were on show in China earlier this month, when an account on Chinese social media platform Weibo was set up in the name of prominent Russian ultranationalist thinker Alexander Dugin. Social media users flocked to the unverified page, where some voices called for Ukrainian victory and others pointed to the two countries\u2019 historical frictions, with one user comment that received hundreds of likes calling for Moscow to return lands in the Russian Far East ceded to the Russian empire in the 19th century. CNN was unable to confirm if the account, which garnered more than 100,000 followers, was authentic. Some observers argue that historical mistrust \u2013 linked to border tensions only formally resolved in the early 2000s and China\u2019s Cold War realignment with the US \u2013 mean even Xi and Putin\u2019s close relations are transactional in the face of shared tensions with the West \u2013 or at least lacking trust within their broader government ranks. All this comes into great focus ahead of the upcoming US elections, where the outcome could have a sweeping impact on the future of the war in Ukraine and US engagement with China \u2013 with the re-election of former president Donald Trump perhaps playing to Russia\u2019s benefit. \u201cWe know some Chinese policy analysts would quietly, privately make the argument that is despite American pressures on China and geopolitical contestations in the past few years \u2026 China could have maintained slightly better relations with the US and the West, at the same time, could have avoided developing relationship with Russia to the extent that is so close today,\u201d said Li in Singapore. But in Xi\u2019s China there appears to be little space for such questions. Instead, the summit this week is poised to underline the strength of the partnership \u2013 and an opportunity for both to check in on an aspiration Xi voiced to Putin during his state visit to Moscow just over a year ago. There, he proclaimed that \u201cchanges that have not happened for 100 years\u201d were afoot. \u201cTogether, we should push (these changes) forward,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/china/xi-putin-china-summit-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

The new law will apply only to prisoners who have no more than three years left of their original sentences and it will not cover those who have committed the most serious crimes. The Ukrainian parliament voted on Wednesday to amend the country\u2019s criminal code to allow the \u201cconditional early release\u201d of prisoners in return for \u201ctheir direct participation in the defense of the country, protection of its independence and territorial integrity.\u201d Prisoners who will not be eligible include \u201cthose who have committed premeditated murders, rapists and pedophiles, corrupt officials, those who have committed crimes against the foundations of Ukraine\u2019s national security, and those who held particularly responsible positions, including MPs and ministers,\u201d according to a statement by the ruling \u201cServant of the People\u201d party led by President Volodymyr Zelensky. The move follows a series of advances by Russian forces along the front lines and comes amid a wider initiative by Ukraine to address critical shortages of manpower and ammunition. Russia has been recruiting prisoners since the early months of the war and has deployed them in some of the fiercest battles yet \u2013 leading to accusations the Kremlin sees these troops as mere \u201ccannon fodder.\u201d Its recruitment of prisoners and their subsequent release back to civilian life has caused a backlash within Russia, as many have been re-arrested after committing fresh offenses. But Ukrainian officials hope the move will go at least some way towards addressing the imbalance it faces against an enemy whose pool of manpower is at least three times greater. \u201cIt is possible to withstand an all-out war against an enemy with more resources only by consolidating all forces. [This] is about our struggle and preservation of Ukrainian statehood,\u201d said Olena Shuliak, chairwoman of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Organization of State Power, Local Self-Government, Regional Development and Urban Planning. Ukraine\u2019s ruling party said the new law passed with a majority of 279\u00a0votes out of a total of 330. There were zero votes against it, 11 abstentions and 40 didn\u2019t vote. The new law requires that convicts join the military of their own free will. Those who leave the military before their contract is up face additional prison terms of between five and 10 years. It is unclear how long prisoners will have to sign up for. Shuliak said those released on parole to serve would have the status of \u201cmilitary personnel,\u201d and therefore be subject to the same restrictions governing their behaviour. \u201cThis includes, in particular, unauthorized leaving of a military unit or place of service, desertion, evasion of military service by self-harm or other means, unauthorized leaving of the battlefield or refusal to use weapons,\u201d as well as voluntary surrender, she said. Candidates must first submit an application for parole. They will then undergo a medical examination at the penitentiary institution to determine if they are mentally and physically fit to serve. A court will then decide on whether to grant the parole. If it agrees, the prisoner will then be transferred to a National Guard unit. Contracts can be terminated in some circumstances, such as ill health or if the former prisoner commits a new crime. They can also be terminated as part of a wider  demobilization.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/europe/ukraine-prisoners-parole-enlist-military-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Beside them, a rescuer lowers their baby brother, 2-year-old Arian, to the rooftop, a sheet tied around his waist that was used to pull him from the raging floodwaters below. \u201cTake it, let\u2019s get take off the rope from his body,\u201d the rescuer says on the video. \u201cBring his mother to hold him in her arms and be warm.\u201d In the past few days, at least 300 people have been killed in flooding in 18 districts across at least three provinces in northern Afghanistan, according to the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme (WFP), with at least 200 injured. Videos show raging torrents of mud washing away mud houses \u2013 and people, their limbs flailing, in the fast-moving brown current, as would-be rescuers watch from\u00a0higher ground, beyond reach. The rescued children, ages 3, 5 and 6, were among eight siblings who were at home with their parents in Folo, in the Bulka district of Baghlan, when the flooding hit. Their uncle Barakatullah, son of Haji Wakil Besmillah, the local school headmaster, told CNN something ominous seemed to be brewing late last week when severe wind swept through the district and neighboring areas, enveloping everything in darkness. \u201cVisibility was so poor that we couldn\u2019t even see each other,\u201d he said. Then the rain started falling gently during Friday prayers \u2013 an unusual event for locals, who say it doesn\u2019t rain very often so high in the mountain region, home to around 10,000 people, he added. As the rain got heavier, suddenly the situation \u201cturned dire.\u201d \u201cPeople fled to higher ground, seeking refuge in mountains and hills. Unfortunately, some individuals who were unable to leave their homes fell victim to the floodwaters,\u201d he said. Aerial photos show belongings piled in plastic bags on rooftops, among them the hooded figures of women forced to cover their entire bodies even in times of disaster. \u201cWomen who were rescued are forced to wear mud-soaked garments, while even infants as young as 2 to 3 months old are clothed in similarly soiled attire,\u201d Barakatullah said. In Folo, more than 100 people are believed to have been killed, he said \u2013 mostly women and children. Some burials began over the weekend, but many more are already believed to be buried deep beneath mud. From drought and hunger to flooding The torrent swept away animals and farmland in an area already facing severe food shortages, according to Timothy Anderson, head of the WFP in Afghanistan. He said the areas hit by floods had already been marked vulnerable to starvation after a difficult summer when searing heat brought drought. \u201cIt was already pretty grim. And now it\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d he told CNN. Most years, locals expect to see flash flooding, he said.\u00a0But this year, it\u2019s been far worse. The loss of the homes and their land is devastating for survivors, who were already among some of the country\u2019s most impoverished people, Anderson said. \u201cWhen people lose a bit of livestock, that\u2019s actually their livelihood,\u201d he said. Road access to the worst affected areas has been cut by floodwaters, forcing the WFP to use donkeys to send in supplies. Within the first day, the WFP had distributed high energy biscuits and food for children. They\u2019re also supporting local bakeries to supply free bread. In the next days, teams will start distributing food to feed families for a month \u2013 what happens next is unclear. Anderson said 17 joint assessment teams are being sent to the area, along with other UN partners.\u00a0He said it\u2019ll take four or five days for the teams to properly examine the impact of the floods on people, and their housing and infrastructure. \u2018Bearing the brunt\u2019 of climate crisis This latest natural disaster comes after drought in Afghanistan, and is being seen as an example of a climate crisis hitting those who have least contributed to rising global temperatures. \u201cThey\u2019re not net emitters of carbon,\u201d said Anderson of the WFP. \u201cThis is a subsistence agriculture community and society. So, they\u2019re bearing the brunt of it, without having necessarily contributed to the issue very much.\u201d He said during the recent dry months, efforts had been made to help the community capture rainfall in dams and irrigation canals to sustain crops. Now those efforts have been washed away, posing another challenge. \u201cThe need is massive, not just in Afghanistan. The world is seeing the impacts of much larger, more severe events, whether that\u2019s drought, rainfalls cyclones,\u201d Anderson said. Richard Bennett, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan said the recent floods \u201care a stark reminder of Afghanistan\u2019s vulnerability to the climate crisis.\u201d And\u00a0in a statement Sunday,\u00a0Teresa Anderson, the Global Climate Justice Lead at ActionAid International, said: \u201cThe climate crisis continues to rear its ugly head.\u201d \u201cWith the latest incident, Afghanistan joins a long list of Global South countries grappling with floods this year,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/asia/afghanistan-flooding-children-rescued-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_climate_2023-summer-hottest-2000-years-climate", "text": "Last summer, marked by deadly extreme heat and devastating wildfires, was the warmest in at least 2,000 years, according to new research, which analyzed weather data and tree rings to reconstruct a detailed picture of the past. The findings offer a stark insight into the \u201cunparalleled\u201d warming the world is experiencing today thanks to humans burning vast amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels, according to the authors of the study published Tuesday in the Journal Nature.\u00a0And it\u2019s an alarming signal as some scientists warn 2024 is on track to be even hotter still. Global warming is currently tracked by comparing temperatures to the \u201cpre-industrial era,\u201d before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels, widely defined as the period between 1850 to 1900.\u00a0\u00a0Under the Paris Agreement in 2015, countries agreed to restrict global warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Last summer, the world temporarily breached this threshold, according to the report.  Using data taken from temperature instruments during this period, the scientists found the Northern Hemisphere summer in 2023 was 2.07 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial period. But observational data from this period is sparse, uncertain and skews warmer. So, for a fuller picture of how the climate varied naturally before the start of the pre-industrial era, the study authors looked much further into the past. To do this, they used detailed sets of tree ring records from thousands of trees across nine regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including North America and Scandinavia, but excluding the Tropics which lack good tree data. Trees act as time capsules. The patterns of their rings \u2013 affected by sunlight, rainfall and temperature \u2013 provide a climate history for each year of their lives, going back centuries or even thousands of years. This complex tree ring data allowed the scientists to reconstruct annual temperatures for Northern Hemisphere summers between the years 1 and 1849 and compare them to last summer\u2019s temperatures. They found the summer of 2023 was warmer than any other summer during this period. It was at least 0.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the warmest summer during this period, the year 246 \u2013 when the Roman Empire still ruled over Europe and the Mayan Civilization dominated Central America. At the other end of the scale, last summer was nearly 4 degrees Celsius warmer than the coldest summer the study identified, the year 536 \u2013 when a volcanic eruption pumped out vast amounts of planet-cooling gases. Using this 2,000-year data set, they calculated that the summer of 2023 was 2.2 degrees Celsius hotter than the long-term pre-industrial average, before robust networks of instruments could measure the weather. The study follows a report published in November, which found humanity lived through the hottest 12-month period in at least 125,000 years. The study, and others like it, rely on data extracted from other proxies, such as ice cores and coral reefs, which don\u2019t give the same detailed yearly evidence as tree rings. This makes it hard to compare individual days or even years with those in the past, said Jan Esper, lead author of the study and professor of climate geography at Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany. It is possible \u2013 even likely \u2013 last year was the hottest in at least 125,000 years, he added, but \u201cwe don\u2019t have the data\u201d to say for certain. The deep dive into the year-by-year temperatures of Northern Hemisphere summers is a \u201cworthwhile endeavor,\u201d said Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Brown University who was not involved in the study. What\u2019s impressive, she told CNN, is \u201cwe have enough temperature reconstructions from enough places around the world to document the exceptional nature of a single year of large-scale temperature extremes.\u201d This \u201ctreasure chest of data\u201d can be used to \u201csharpen our projections of future climate extremes,\u201d she added. While the study can place the extraordinary Northern Hemisphere heat\u00a0into historical context, it cannot be applied on a global scale, Esper said. There simply isn\u2019t enough tree ring data from the Southern Hemisphere and the Tropics, he said. The study\u2019s findings are deeply worrying, Esper said. \u201cThere are potential irreversible processes in the system, and I am afraid not of myself. I\u2019m old,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m concerned for the kids.\u201d CNN\u2019s Laura Paddison contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_14_style_lotw-john-cleese-miu-miu", "text": "A black crewneck, mid-wash jeans, white blazer and a distressed denim Miu Miu cap. No, this isn\u2019t an off-duty look from Sydney Sweeney or Emma Chamberlain \u2014 it\u2019s the latest outfit worn by British comedian and octogenarian John Cleese. On Friday, Cleese \u2014 who is best known as a founding member of UK comedy troupe Monty Python, as well as the star and co-creator of British sitcom \u201cFawlty Towers\u201d \u2014 stepped out in the unseasonable London sunshine with a $550 appliqu\u00e9 denim logo cap from Miu Miu shielding his eyes. Of course, we have questions. In a mad dash to make a radio show appearance, did Cleese blindly reach for the nearest baseball hat? Was it simply left in the vestibule by his model-turned-comedian daughter, Camilla Cleese? Or is the senior a dedicated Miu Miu man? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time a comedian had a penchant for fashion. In the 1990s, Robin Williams was spotted on the red carpet in pieces from Jean Paul-Gaultier, Issey Miyake and Alexander McQueen. Miuccia Prada\u2019s second label, founded in 1992, has beat it\u2019s bigger sister Prada to the top spot on Lyst\u2019s Hottest Brand Index twice \u2014 a metric that measures the public\u2019s interest in luxury fashion houses. According to the platform, searches for Miu Miu this year have increased 57%, while the brand also reported significant growth in the first quarter of 2024 \u2014 with sales up a record 89%. Miu Miu informed CNN that the comedian is not an official brand ambassador, confirming that the hat is instead a rare instance of organic marketing. But perhaps he should be on the affiliate roster, because Cleese is a surprisingly fitting embodiment of the Miu Miu mantra. Originally billed as the spry, sometimes juvenile sibling to grown-up Prada, Miu Miu has not so much rebranded as redefined its vision of youth. \u201cI say to myself every single morning, \u2018I have to decide if I am a 15-year-old girl or a lady near death,\u2019\u201d Miuccia Prada said after the Fall-Winter 2024 show. The Italian label has succeeded in striking a balance between its Gen Z ambassadors (Emma Chamberlain, Ayo Edebiri, Emma Corrin, to name a few) and those above 50. In September, 63-year-old British actor Kristen Scott Thomas walked the runway for Miu Miu at Paris Fashion Week, along with 70-year-old Dr Qiu Huilan \u2014 who was promoted from loyal customer to catwalk model overnight after being invited to participate by the brand on Instagram. Instead of nailing itself to a literal interpretation, Miu Miu has cultivated an emphasis on youthful energy \u2014 of which Cleese oozes (somewhat literally, too, thanks to the \u00a317,000 cosmetic stem cell therapy treatment he has been receiving annually for the last 20 years). Speaking to host Chris Evans on Virgin Radio on Friday, the comedian recalled a recent meet-up with the other founding fathers of Monty Python, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam. \u201cI said it was 18 feet of Python,\u201d he told Evans. \u201cAnd it was good to see them again. We\u2019re very silly. We\u2019re disgraceful for old people.

{"id": "2024_05_13_china_china-covid-journalist-zhang-zhan-expected-release-intl-hnk", "text": "A Chinese citizen\u00a0journalist who has been behind bars for four years over her reporting on the initial Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan is due to be released Monday after serving her sentence, according to supporters and a court verdict. Zhang Zhan, a former lawyer, was one of the few independent Chinese journalists reporting in Wuhan after the metropolis of 11 million people went into a complete lockdown, offering a rare, unfiltered glimpse into the reality on the ground\u00a0as Chinese authorities imposed tight censorship on media coverage. She was detained in May 2020 and sentenced months later to four years in prison for \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble\u201d \u2013 a charge commonly used by the Chinese government to target dissidents and human rights activists. Zhang is due to finish her sentence on Monday, according to the court verdict on her case obtained and published by human rights groups. Supporters and rights groups have called on the Chinese government to free Zhang on schedule. \u201cSo far I have not received any confirmation that Zhang Zhan has left the prison and is home with her family. We are all still waiting,\u201d said Jane Wang, a UK-based advocate for the Free Zhang Zhan campaign. \u201cI understand that her parents and brother have been under enormous pressure and warned severely not to give media interviews. Friends\u2019 calls are also left without answers\u2026 these are extremely worrying signs,\u201d she added. Reporters Without Borders (RSF), which awarded Zhang its Press Freedom Award in 2021, called on \u201cthe international community to put pressure on the authorities to ensure her unconditional release on Monday,\u201d in a post on social platform X Friday. In early February 2020, just days after Wuhan went into lockdown, Zhang traveled some 400 miles from Shanghai to the central Chinese city to report on the spread of the virus and subsequent attempts to contain it, just as authorities tightened censorship on state-run and private Chinese media. For more than three months, she documented snippets of life under lockdown in Wuhan and the harsh reality faced by its residents, from overflowing hospitals to empty shops, as the world braced for the spread of the virus. She posted her observations, photos and videos on WeChat, Twitter and YouTube \u2013 the latter two of which are blocked in China. \u201cI can\u2019t find anything to say because everything is covered up. This is the problem this country is facing now: any opposing opinions from us might be (dismissed as) \u2018rumors,\u2019\u201d she said in a video two weeks after arriving in Wuhan, donning a face mask. \u201cEven our own voices are out of our control. They imprison us in the name of pandemic prevention and restrict our freedom\u2026If we cannot obtain the truth, if we cannot break their monopoly of the truth, the world will be meaningless to us.\u201d Her posts came to an abrupt stop in mid-May, and she was later revealed to have been detained by police and brought back to Shanghai. \u2018Continued harassment and surveillance\u2019 China\u2019s Foreign Ministry declined to confirm whether Zhang had been released from prison at a regular news conference on Monday afternoon. \u201cI don\u2019t know the relevant information, but what I can tell you is that China is a country governed by the rule of law. Anyone who violates the law should be punished by law,\u201d said ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin. \u201cAt the same time, China fully protects the legal rights of defendants and prisoners in accordance with the law,\u201d he added. Human rights advocates who have long worked on China say Zhang is likely to live under close surveillance from authorities even if she does walk out of prison. \u201cWhile Zhang is released from prison, it won\u2019t mean she will be free,\u201d said Yaqiu Wang, research director for China at advocacy group Freedom House. \u201cIf the Chinese government\u2019s past record is of any indication, she will face continued harassment and surveillance by authorities. But if Zhang Zhan\u2019s past actions are any indication, she will keep fighting against efforts to silence her.\u201d Sarah Brooks, Amnesty International\u2019s China director, said she was concerned that Zhang\u2019s ability to travel or to make contact with relatives and others, especially those outside China, may be severely restricted. \u201cZhang Zhan should never have been jailed in the first place; now, having served her time, our hopes are with her and her family for a safe reunion and road back to health and, if she chooses, her important human rights work,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s jailing of Zhang Zhan has been a shameful assault on her human rights, and her release must mark a new beginning.\u201d Failing health Supporters and rights groups are also concerned about Zhang\u2019s access to medical treatment upon her release, given her poor health conditions while in prison. The 40-year-old has been on multiple hunger strikes since being detained and was briefly hospitalized. In 2021, Zhang\u2019s mother said her daughter was so frail that she could not hold her head up for lack of strength and was in desperate need of medical care. During a previous hunger strike, Amnesty International alleged Zhang was shackled and force fed, treatment the group said amounted to torture. China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not previously respond to CNN on allegations of Zhang\u2019s mistreatment in detention. In a lengthy statement issued in July 2020, the Foreign Ministry denied the Chinese government had cracked down on journalists who \u201cexercised their right to freedom of speech on the Internet\u201d during the pandemic. \u201cIn China, no one gets punished or penalized simply because of making remarks,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Chinese government has all along conducted its Covid-19 response in an open and transparent manner, and has made widely recognized achievements.\u201d Zhang was one of a number of independent reporters who were detained or disappeared during the outset of the pandemic, as Chinese authorities clamped down on coverage of the virus and propaganda outlets went into overdrive portraying Beijing\u2019s response as effective and timely. China is the biggest jailer of journalists in the world, according to Reporters Without Borders, which ranks it at 172 out of 180 countries around the world in its annual Press Freedom Index. Authorities tightly control the press at home while blocking most foreign media outlets via the Great Firewall, its vast online censorship and surveillance apparatus.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/china/china-covid-journalist-zhang-zhan-expected-release-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_china_china-xi-jinping-europe-putin-intl-hnk", "text": "Xi Jinping may have started his recent European trip by fielding tough questions in France about trade and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, but the Chinese leader ended the sojourn late last week by projecting a stark message: that despite frictions with much of the continent, China still has fans in some European capitals. Beijing\u2019s pulling power was on show in Belgrade and Budapest, where streets were festooned with Chinese flags. As Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan touched down at both cities\u2019 airports, folk dancers performed on the tarmac and, in contrast to the subdued welcome the couple received in Paris, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban were on hand to greet them. Chinese state media played up the warm diplomacy, with headlines proclaiming China\u2019s \u201cironclad\u201d bond with Serbia and \u201cgolden friendship\u201d with Hungary. Both countries, major recipients of Chinese investment, announced upgrades of their relations with China during the visits \u2013 a symbolic win for Xi that analysts say could play a role softening European policy on China in fraught areas such as trade, security and human rights. But in the rest of Europe, the red-carpet welcome afforded Xi by Vucic and Orban \u2013 both widely seen as illiberal and Russia-friendly \u2013 may not play as well, analysts say, and emphasizes the shrinking number of European capitals where Xi would meet such a warm embrace. China-Europe relations have been frayed by the European Union\u2019s growing list of economic grievances with China, which could yet spiral into a full-blown trade war. Also in the mix are suspicions across Europe about Beijing\u2019s global ambitions and influence, especially over its support for Russia \u2013 including allegations it is supplying dual-use parts which help the Kremlin\u2019s war against Ukraine. Making his first visit to Europe in five years, Xi was pressed on these issues early last week\u00a0by French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Both are sure to closely watch any summit between Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin in China, expected to happen soon. In Paris, Xi stressed that China was playing no role other than \u201ccontributing to reaching peace\u201d in Ukraine, and denied there was industrial \u201covercapacity\u201d in China flooding the European market. Such tensions vanished when Xi met Vucic and Orban. His visits to Serbia and Hungary \u201csend a very good message to a Chinese (domestic) audience that \u2018we have close friends in Europe\u2026 Hungary and Serbia are real friends that we can do business with,\u2019\u201d said Philippe Le Corre, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute\u2019s Center for China Analysis, speaking at an event hosted by the center as Xi\u2019s tour got underway last week. But the countries\u2019 inclusion in his itinerary was \u201cembarrassing\u201d for Paris, because both Orban and Vucic attended the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing last October alongside Putin, Le Corre added. \u2018Shared future\u2019 Xi\u2019s visits to Serbia and Hungary helped him toward another goal \u2013 chipping away at a world order he sees as dominated by the United States. With the inking of a joint statement, Serbia\u2019s Vucic became the first European leader to commit to joining China in building a \u201ccommunity with a shared future.\u201d The loosely formulated concept calls for a collaboration on shared interests, suggesting countries shouldn\u2019t interact based on alliances, or be judged on their domestic politics and human rights record. \u201cThat is the highest level of cooperation of two countries and I am proud that as a president of Serbia I had an opportunity to sign that declaration with President Xi,\u201d Vucic said Wednesday of the accord, which came alongside a free-trade agreement and other pledges from Xi on expanding agricultural imports and direct flights. Xi also marketed a shared worldview during his meeting with Orban in Hungary, which is a member of both the EU and NATO. Orban, whose increasingly authoritarian rule has raised alarm within the EU, defied mounting concerns within both blocs to upgrade his country\u2019s relations to an \u201call-weather comprehensive strategic partnership.\u201d As well as being another symbolic win for Xi, this could encourage Orban to push back against efforts within the EU to \u201cderisk\u201d supply chains and slap tariffs on Chinese goods, analysts say. Speaking in Budapest Thursday alongside Orban, Xi appeared to allude to that, saying he hoped Hungary would use its rotating EU presidency beginning in July to \u201cpromote the stable and healthy development of China-EU relations.\u201d The two leaders also signed some 18 cooperation agreements, which Orban said covered sectors such as railways, IT, and nuclear energy. Xi declared the two countries would \u201cdeepen economic, trade, investment, and financial cooperation\u201d and advance \u201ckey projects,\u201d including the Budapest-Belgrade railway. Both Serbia and Hungary are already key destinations for Chinese investment, with Hungary emerging as an increasingly important production hub in Europe for Chinese automotive suppliers including electric vehicle (EV) makers. In France earlier this week, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told journalists that Chinese company BYD was \u201cwelcome\u201d to open a factory in France; but the EV giant appears to have already chosen its first foothold for car production in Europe, pledging late last year to open a plant in Hungary. Beijing may also be hoping other countries on the continent take note, with analysts saying all this plays into Xi\u2019s efforts to frame parts of Europe as benefiting from clearheaded views on China, versus others who are mimicking American efforts to contain it. \u201cBeing close to these countries fits China\u2019s domestic narrative that there are \u2018smart countries\u2019 in Europe who really understand China and do not support the United States \u2013 and China is working with these countries for the good of Europe,\u201d said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor of public and international affairs at Hong Kong\u2019s City University. Gateways to Europe But Xi\u2019s itinerary also underscores his limitations within Europe, others say, including in Central and Eastern Europe where Beijing previously made extensive efforts to deepen connections and win goodwill, including through Xi\u2019s flagship Belt and Road infrastructure drive. A Chinese mechanism to bolster relations with 16 Central and Eastern European nations has slowly lost support, in part because investments didn\u2019t materialize at the expected scale, and also because China\u2019s support for Russia soured relations in a region with a recent history of Soviet domination. \u201cThe unlimited partnership and Beijing\u2019s moral and material support to Moscow has infuriated many (Central and Eastern European) countries\u2019 leadership and population,\u201d said Tamas Matura, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. \u201cThis has definitely weakened China\u2019s position in Europe.\u201d Meanwhile, longstanding tensions with Nordic countries and Italy\u2019s exit earlier this year from the Belt and Road, as well as recent visits to China by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meant none of those countries were ideal for Xi to visit, Matura added. France, he said, was likely seen by Beijing as creating a potential for a diplomatic opening given its advocacy for Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy from the US. But there were few tangible signs from the trip that friction with Western European countries and the EU would abate, despite both Macron and Von der Leyen stressing the importance of dialogue and Xi\u2019s two-day visit with the French president, which included a more personal trip to the Pyrenees and the signing of 18 cooperation deals. And despite their limited economic heft \u2013 with 16 million people between them, and a combined GDP about a tenth of France\u2019s, according to IMF figures \u2013 Serbia and EU member Hungary may become increasingly valuable to Beijing as tensions with the bloc continue, and the threat of a trade war looms. \u201cOrban and Vucic are both the kind of illiberal leaders who are positioning their countries between the rivaling geo-political blocs, hoping to avoid too strong dependence on any one of them,\u201d said former Hungarian member of Parliament Gabor Scheiring, an assistant professor of comparative politics at Georgetown University in Qatar. \u201cThey don\u2019t care about democracy or human rights. For them, foreign policy is strictly pragmatically about economic interests.\u201d And that could be a boon for China. \u201cHungary and Serbia are strategic gateways for Beijing toward Europe\u2026\u00a0 the value of the two countries as gateways to Europe will increase as the trade war escalates,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/china/china-xi-jinping-europe-putin-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

The center, which is a division of the National Weather Service, observed conditions of an extreme geomagnetic storm at 6:54 p.m. ET on Friday evening, reaching a level 5 out of 5 severity. The last time a solar storm of this magnitude reached Earth was in October 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, according to the center. Signs of a severe geomagnetic storm, or level 4, were first observed by scientists at the center at 12:37 p.m. ET, when a major disturbance was detected in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Previously, the center issued a geomagnetic storm watch on Thursday evening, the first such watch issued since January 2005. But the forecast was upgraded after scientists observed G5, or extreme geomagnetic storm, conditions Friday evening. As the sun nears the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle, known as solar maximum, later this year, researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb. Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth\u2019s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky. The Space Weather Prediction Center tracked multiple strong flares emitting from a large cluster of sunspots on the solar surface since Wednesday. The cluster is 17 times the diameter of Earth. Scientists also observed at least seven coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, releasing from the sun in the direction of Earth. These significant outbursts are expected to continue through Sunday. The center\u2019s space weather scale covers three categories: solar flares that cause high-frequency radio blackouts, geomagnetic storms and solar radiation storms. The current solar activity is capable of producing a solar radiation storm, according to Shawn Dahl, the service coordinator for the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201cThat\u2019s the very low end of our scale,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cIt does mean things to some rocket launch operations and satellite operators. But at this point in time, it\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be handled as far as we understand it. The potential for stronger events of course does exist and we\u2019ll see if any materialize.\u201d The peak of the geomagnetic storm activity for Earth could occur between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. ET on Saturday, the center has forecasted. The center referred to this as \u201can unusual event.\u201d There have been three geomagnetic storms since December 2019, but all of them have been considered weak, according to the center. Geomagnetic storms driven by the sun in recent months have caused auroras to be visible in places where they are rarely seen, including as far south as New Mexico, Missouri, North Carolina and California in the United States, and the southeast of England and other parts of the United Kingdom. The solar storm caused a dazzling aurora australis to light up the sky over New Zealand around 6:20 a.m. local time. Depending on the location, the auroras may not always be visible overhead, but keep an eye on the horizon, experts say, because they may create a colorful display there as well. Even if auroras aren\u2019t visible in the sky, experts at the center recommend taking images of the sky with your phone because the images may capture what you can\u2019t see with the naked eye. \u201cA severe storm would mean that the aurora will likely be visible in southern Michigan,\u201d said Michael Liemohn, a professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, in a statement. \u201cGet away from city lights to a place with clear skies and you should be able to see the green or red glow of aurora across the sky.\u201d The effects of geomagnetic storms When coronal mass ejections are directed at Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of Earth\u2019s magnetic field. \u201cGeomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth\u2019s surface, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operations,\u201d according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201c(The center) has notified the operators of these systems so they can take protective action.\u201d The center has notified operators in these areas to take action to mitigate the potential for any impacts, which include the possibility of increased and more frequent voltage control problems. Other aspects operators will monitor include a chance of anomalies or impacts to satellite operations and frequent or longer periods of GPS degradation. In turn, the operators also make sure power lines are performing as expected, ensure that alternate equipment is available and functioning, and any maintenance is suspended, Dahl said. \u201cBut the key element here is that they know what\u2019s causing anything if the situation unfolds that will allow us to be able to take the proper steps to help mitigate and control any developing problems,\u201d Dahl said. When coronal mass ejections arrive, they carry their own magnetic field, which can overwhelm power lines and induce electrical currents, so operators will monitor for any signs of such activity, said Rob Steenburgh, space scientist at the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about impacts to the power grid, we\u2019re talking about the high voltage transmission lines. That\u2019s where these currents can develop. It\u2019s not on any line going from a small transformer to their home,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cIt\u2019s only really developing on the high voltage transmission lines, which creates problems for the major transformers that control distribution.\u201d Solar storms generated by the sun can also cause radio blackouts and even pose risks for crewed space missions. NASA\u2019s Space Radiation Analysis Group is dedicated to monitoring conditions for astronauts aboard the International Space Station. If there appears to be an increased radiation risk, the astronauts can move to parts of the station that are more well-shielded. \u201cDuring the recent solar weather activity that measured higher than originally predicted aboard the International Space Station on May 11, the Expedition 71 crew was told to avoid lower shielded areas of the space station out of an abundance of caution,\u201d according to a May 14 update released by the federal agency. The center warned that additional solar activity could cause geomagnetic storm conditions to be ongoing through the weekend. So far, researchers have obseverd only three severe geomagnetic storms during the current solar cycle, which began in December 2019, according to the center. Experts at the center say they are a \u201clittle concerned,\u201d but mainly because such events are rare. The team likened it to being prepared for a summer storm: Keep batteries and a weather radio on hand in the event of a power outage, but said that people don\u2019t need to \u201cdo anything out of the ordinary\u201d to prepare for space weather. No disruption to internet or cellphone service is expected. And any disruption to GPS is not expected to be prolonged, as long as providers can quickly lock back on to satellite signals, according to experts at the center. Tracking space weather Every 11 years or so, the sun experiences periods of low and high solar activity, which is associated with the amount of sunspots on its surface. The sun\u2019s strong and constantly shifting magnetic fields drive these dark regions, some of which can reach the size of Earth or larger. Over the course of a solar cycle, the sun will transition from a calm to an intense and active period. During the peak of activity, called solar maximum, the sun\u2019s magnetic poles flip. Then, the sun will grow quiet again during a solar minimum. Solar maximum is expected to peak through mid- to late 2024, but the sun will remain active for a couple of years afterward. Teams at the Space Weather Prediction Center use data from ground and space-based observatories, magnetic maps of the solar surface, and ultraviolet observations of the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere to determine when the sun is most likely to send out solar flares, coronal mass ejections and other space weather that could affect Earth. Solar flares can affect communications and GPS almost immediately because they disrupt Earth\u2019s ionosphere, or part of the upper atmosphere. Energetic particles released by the sun can also disrupt electronics on spacecraft and affect astronauts without proper protection within 20 minutes to several hours. The material sent speeding away from the sun during coronal mass ejections can arrive at Earth between 30 and 72 hours afterward, causing geomagnetic storms that affect satellites and create electrical currents in the upper atmosphere that travel through the ground and can have an impact on electric power grids. The storms also affect flight patterns of commercial airlines, which are instructed to stay away from Earth\u2019s poles during geomagnetic storms due to loss of communication or navigation capabilities. Extreme storms have occurred before, such as one that knocked out the power grid in Quebec in 1989 and the Carrington Event of 1859.The latter remains the most intense geomagnetic storm ever recorded, causing telegraph stations to spark and catch fire. If such an event were to occur today, it could cause trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage and bring down some power grids for a substantial amount of time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/world/solar-flares-storms-cme-auroras-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_middleeast_palestinian-young-amputees-us-intl", "text": "Ahed Bseso lay on the kitchen table in her home in northern Gaza, watching as her uncle amputated her injured right leg with a knife. Standing by, her mother cried, \u201cAhed is dead!\u201d But 18-year-old Bseso was very much alive, and she has survived to tell her story, from a hospital in Greenville, South Carolina. Bseso said that on December 19 last year, she went to the top floor of her house in Gaza to get a cellphone signal when an Israeli tank outside fired at her building. It destroyed part of her home\u2019s wall, which came crashing down on her leg, along with heavy debris. With her neighborhood under siege and no possibility of medical attention, her uncle, who used to work as an orthopedic surgeon, used kitchen supplies to amputate her leg below the knee and dress it with unsterilized gauze. The days that followed were horrifically painful. \u201cFor four days, I couldn\u2019t leave the house because the Israelis wouldn\u2019t let me,\u201d she told CNN through a translator, at the Shriners Children\u2019s hospital. \u201cThere was no medication I could take to inhibit the pain or to help me with my condition. So, I just sat in agony for four days.\u201d The video of her amputation\u202fwent viral\u202fand caught the attention of the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund (PCRF), a US organization that provides free health care to thousands of injured and ill Palestinian children in the Middle East. The organization worked for weeks to evacuate her from northern Gaza and bring her to the United States for medical care, according to Tareq Hailat, head of the Treatment Abroad program at PCRF. She is one of three Palestinians who received PCRF\u2019s help to come to the US for leg injury treatment. At least 1,000 children in Gaza have had one or both legs amputated, UNICEF reported\u202fin December. Though he couldn\u2019t give an exact figure, UNICEF spokesperson Joe English told CNN that the number has since grown. Nearly 26,000 children \u2014 or just over 2% of Gaza\u2019s child population \u2014 were  killed or injured in the Gaza Strip in the first six months of the Israel-Hamas war, according to international nongovernmental organization\u202fSave the Children. From October 7, 2023 \u2014 the date of the Hamas attack on Israel \u2014 to early April, more than 13,800 children were killed and at least 12,009 were injured, the organization said. Avoiding amputations Two-year-old Jood Damo\u2019s\u202fhouse was struck by a tank shell on December 26 last year, killing his mother and fracturing his right leg. His father, Ahmed Damo, who accompanied him to the US, told CNN that the toddler witnessed his mother dying. \u201cTo this day, he still has episodes where he asks about his mom,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, he wakes up in the middle of the night, just crying and screaming, and asking about his mother.\u201d Now, doctors at another hospital in Chicago are assessing whether his injured leg will respond to treatment and grow at the same rate as his left leg. If not, it could significantly delay his path to recovery and treatment plan, PCRF said. Ayham Musalm, 13, said his left leg was fractured and had glass shrapnel lodged in his knee when debris from a strike on a neighbors\u2019 house came straight into his home on December 10. He went months, however, without anyone identifying what was wrong. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to see any physician for a long time,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThen one physician just sewed my wound, and said it wasn\u2019t serious and sent me home.\u201d In the care of Shriners Children\u2019s hospital in Greenville, Musalm has had access to imaging and MRI processes, which helped American experts find the shards of glass inside his knee. That led to surgery and further treatment, and he avoided amputation. He is now in physical therapy. It took PCRF weeks and sometimes months to get children out of Gaza. Besides the time needed to secure their US visas, evacuating the children \u2014\u00a0or even moving them from one part of the strip to the other \u2014\u00a0required Israeli approval, which can be a complicated process, according to Hailat, who works on the evacuations. This delay in treatment for such injuries can result in grave repercussions, said Dr. Amber Alayyan from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders), an international aid NGO. \u201cThe longer they wait without care, the worse it\u2019s going to be,\u201d she said. Alayyan, who has traveled in and out of Gaza several times, said the enclave could have handled the care for such injuries before its\u202fhealthcare system was devastated\u202fby the war. \u201cWe see people who, despite their burns, walk into the clinic without a jaw because the healthcare system has completely collapsed and there are no spaces to take care of these people in the hospitals,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were 3,500 beds in the hospitals in Gaza before the war. But there are so many displaced people living, squatting, seeking shelter in hospitals, that there\u2019s not even space for the patients.\u201d \u201cAs a result, the wounds that these patients are suffering from are beginning to literally rot,\u201d she added. \u201cThey smell now.\u201d In these overwhelming conditions, doctors are struggling to identify infections and types of injuries, and the focus is entirely on saving lives. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to carry out these life-saving amputations because you would have had a system that functioned. You would have had reconstructive surgery. Possibly, you would have had immediate lifesaving surgery possible, and they would have been able to save these limbs,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now we are doing everything we can just to save lives in the moment.\u201d PCRF\u2019s Hailat said he doesn\u2019t know if Bseso\u2019s injury required an amputation either. But with Gaza under siege, and no immediate medical attention, hospital care, and sterilized equipment available, amputation was the only choice. When she arrived in the United States, the bone in her other leg was also deeply infected. Doctors feared that she may have needed both legs amputated, but with adequate care and treatment, she has avoided that outcome. An anxious wait to return home Evacuating to the United States is not the obvious answer for all injured children, Hailat said. The country has accepted 20 children from Gaza for treatment, but Hailat said he has rerouted 17 of them to other nations. Some injuries are so severe that Hailat said he has to choose medical care as quickly as possible \u2014 which means staying in the region \u2014 over expertise and the advanced level of care in the United States. He also said he wants to ensure that the children who are evacuated to the US need treatment that\u2019s specifically available in the country. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to limit how many people we bring to the United States. We would much rather bring people to local areas and local countries around Gaza,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, if specific treatment of that particular child is needed to be done in the United States, then we will go out of our way to ensure that happens. Culture is also important for care and recovery, Hailat said. \u201cCulturally, you don\u2019t want to separate them so far away from their homeland that it\u2019s difficult for them to adapt,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want them to be close to Gaza. This is a very sensitive time, and I don\u2019t want them to feel as though we are separating them from their country.\u201d Back home, Bseso said her mother fell sick as\u202fmalnourishment has plagued northern Gaza. She worriedly waits for more news and updates from home, and she knows that her family would be trying to make their way to the top of their residential building, to find a cell signal to contact her \u2014 the same ritual that put her in the Israeli line of attack. Her hope is to reunite with them in a safe place. \u201cWe really need our family to be with us together,\u201d she said. Musalm, too, wants his treatment to finish so he can return to Gaza and see his family. But there is no knowing when that may be. After their treatments, which Hailat said will most likely take a year, PCRF will ensure it is safe in Gaza before returning the children there. \u201cWe will not do that if it puts them in danger,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we will have to wait to ensure that Gaza is able to be a safe location for them to return.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/middleeast/palestinian-young-amputees-us-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

The two attended an event Saturday held by Nigeria\u2019s Defence Staff and \u2018Nigeria: Unconquered\u2019 \u2013 a local charity supporting wounded servicemembers inspired by the Duke of Sussex\u2019s Invictus Games Foundation. After arriving at an officer\u2019s mess late morning local time they were immediately taken to watch a sitting volleyball game. They were given scarves in the green and white colors of Nigeria as they took their seats\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0arena. Harry caused a lot of excitement when he joined in the game \u2013 his Invictus team on one side, the other led by a team of members of the Nigerian military, which won the game 25 to 21. Meghan watched from the side sat next to 9-year-old Tiwatope Akanbi, who told CNN: \u201cI\u2019m so happy I saw Meghan today and I will never forget it all my life.\u201d A group of women who called themselves the Sussex Squad Nigeria surrounded Meghan, saying: \u201cWe love you. Nigeria loves you. Welcome home.\u201d They presented her with a book and a Nigerian fabric. Meghan revealed in 2022 that she discovered she was 43% Nigerian from a genealogy test. Wounded service members shared their thoughts about the importance of the Sussexes visit. \u201cHonestly, Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s visit to Nigeria, it means a lot to me personally,\u201d flight sergeant Ifeoma Loveleen Nwagbo told CNN. \u201cThis [Invictus] initiative is very, very fantastic because it makes me understand that yes: I can actually achieve what I couldn\u2019t achieve before in my life. And then [Harry] coming to Nigeria \u2013 Wow! I\u2019m just feeling on top of the world, because I will meet him \u2013 it\u2019s fantastic!\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_05_13_middleeast_iran-filmmaker-mohammad-rasoulof-flees-iran-intl-latam", "text": "Acclaimed Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof says he has fled his home country to an undisclosed location in Europe after a court in Iran sentenced him to prison on national security charges. Rasoulof condemned the Iranian government in an Instagram post on Monday, calling it a tyrannical and oppressive regime, and posting a video that showed him crossing the country\u2019s mountainous border. \u201cIf geographical Iran suffers beneath the boots of your religious tyranny, cultural Iran is alive in the common minds of millions of Iranians who were forced to leave Iran due to your brutality and no power can impose its will on it. From today, I am a resident of cultural Iran,\u201d he said. In a separate statement dated May 12, Rasoulof said he had decided to escape Iran after his lawyers told him his prison sentence would be implemented on short notice. \u201cI had to choose between prison and leaving Iran. With a heavy heart, I chose exile,\u201d he said in that statement, which was provided by a spokesperson. CNN has reached out to Iranian authorities for comment. His lawyer Babak Paknia said last week that an Iranian court had sentenced Rasoulof to eight years in prison and flogging after it found his films and documentaries to be \u201cexamples of collusion with the intention of committing a crime against the security of the country.\u201d Rasoulof is among several high-profile artists to have been caught up in a widening crackdown on dissent by Iranian authorities since nationwide protests broke out over the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly. Rasoulof, whose recent films have been critical of the Iranian government, was among a group of artists and filmmakers who signed a letter criticizing the violent response of security forces to quell a 2022 protest over a building collapse in the southwestern city of Abadan that killed more than 40 people. Rasoulof\u00a0won a Golden Bear\u00a0for best film at the Berlinale festival in 2020 for \u201cThere Is No Evil\u201d and his film\u00a0\u201cA Man of Integrity\u201d\u00a0was recognized for a \u201cCertain Regard\u201d honor at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2017. The filmmaker\u2019s latest work, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig,\u201d is set to premiere at Cannes next week, but it\u2019s unclear if he will be able to attend. \u201cWe are very happy and much relieved that Mohammad has safely arrived in Europe after a dangerous journey,\u201d said Jean-Christophe Simon, the distributor for Rasoulof\u2019s latest film. The Films Boutique and Parallel45 executive added that he hopes that Rasoulof will be able to attend the Cannes premiere for his film \u201cin spite of all attempts to prevent him from being there in person.\u201d Rasoulof said on Instagram that he will now work to quickly finish the last technical steps of his film\u2019s post-production. \u201cMany people helped to make this film. My thoughts are with all of them, and I fear for their safety and well-being,\u201d he said, accusing the Iranian government of pressuring members of his production team with interrogations, court filings and travel restrictions. Rasoulof didn\u2019t specify how he escaped Iran, saying only that he did it secretly with the help of friends and acquaintances. In 2022, an Iranian court sentenced Rasoulof to one year in prison and banned him from making films for two years on the charge of \u201cpropaganda against the system,\u201d according to Human Rights Watch. Iranian authorities have previously arrested him multiple times and confiscated his passport because of his work, HRW said.

{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_georgia-foreign-agents-law-explained-intl", "text": "Georgia\u2019s parliament is set to pass a highly controversial so-called \u201cforeign agents\u201d bill that has triggered widespread protests across the former Soviet republic nestled in the Caucasus Mountains. Tens of thousands of people in capital city Tbilisi have been protesting the legislation. Critics warn that it mirrors a foreign agents law already passed in Russia and could jeopardize Georgia\u2019s bid to join the European Union. But Prime Minister\u00a0Irakli Kobakhidze has said the government is not planning any \u201csubstantial changes\u201d to the bill, and has vowed to get it passed on Tuesday, when lawmakers in the former Soviet country are expected to vote. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the proposed law and the uproar it has caused. What\u2019s in the law? The bill would require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cagents of foreign influence\u201d or face crippling fines. The legislation was drafted by the Georgian Dream party, which along with its allies controls parliament. The proposal will receive a vote on Tuesday and it is expected to pass. Georgia President Salome Zourabichvili called the bill \u201can exact duplicate\u201d of its Russian counterpart in an interview with CNN. She has vowed to veto the bill, but that won\u2019t mean much. Georgia\u2019s government is a parliamentary system, so Zourabichvili is effectively a figurehead. Real power lies with Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze. Georgian Dream\u2019s billionaire founder, former Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, also wields significant political influence. Why is it so controversial? A couple of reasons. The proposed law is modeled after a similar one in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society. Many Georgians fear their foreign agents bill will be used to the same way it has been in its northern neighbor: to quash dissent and free expression by going after nongovernmental organizations with financial ties overseas. Georgian Dream contends the legislation will promote transparency and national sovereignty and has hit back at Western criticism over the proposal. But the law\u2019s possible passage has touched on a more existential question: whether Georgia\u2019s future lies with Europe or Russia. Georgia has, like Ukraine, been caught between the two geopolitical forces since achieving independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Many Georgians feel deep hostility toward the Kremlin, which invaded Georgia in 2008 and occupies about 20% of its internationally recognized territory \u2013 about the same proportion that Russia occupies in Ukraine. Georgian Dream has long been accused of harboring pro-Russian sympathies, especially given that Ivanishvili made his fortune in the Soviet Union. How do most Georgians feel about it? Passionately. So much so that lawmakers at one point came to blows over the bill. Polling shows that about 80% of Georgians support joining the European Union rather than drifting further into the Kremlin\u2019s orbit, and many of those in favor of deepening ties with the West have taken to the streets. Mass demonstrations against the bill in Tbilisi have been going on nightly for a month. About 50,000 people came out Sunday evening in the capital, which is home to about 1 million people, to speak out against what they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cthe Russian law.\u201d There have been counter-protests as well. One saw the reclusive Ivanishvili deliver a rare speech to a crowd of supporters bussed in to Tbilisi from Georgia\u2019s rural regions, where Georgian Dream enjoys more support. The address showed deep paranoia and an autocratic streak. Ivanishvili claimed that Georgia was being controlled by \u201ca pseudo-elite nurtured by a foreign country\u201d and pledged to go after his political opponents after October\u2019s elections. Didn\u2019t Georgia already go through this? Yes, just last year. Georgia\u2019s government tried to pass the same law but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after a week of intense\u00a0protests, which saw citizens waving EU flags buffeted back by water cannons. The bill was reintroduced in March, about a month after Kobakhidze became Prime Minister. This time, authorities seem determined to push the legislation through. What have other countries said? White House national security adviser\u00a0Jake Sullivan wrote on X that Washington is \u201cdeeply alarmed about democratic backsliding in\u00a0Georgia.\u201d \u201cGeorgian parliamentarians face a critical choice \u2013 whether to support the\u00a0Georgian people\u2019s Euro-Atlantic aspirations or pass a Kremlin-style foreign agents\u2019 law that runs counter to democratic values,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stand with the\u00a0Georgian people.\u201d The Kremlin has claimed that the law was being used to \u201cprovoke anti-Russian sentiments,\u201d adding that protests against it were being stirred by \u201coutside\u201d influences. \u201cThis is now the normal practice of a huge number of states that are doing everything to protect themselves from outside influence, from foreign influence on domestic politics. And all countries are taking action in one form or another, but all these bills have the same goal,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in April. \u201cOnce again, there is no way to link this bill and the desire to secure Georgia\u2019s internal politics with some kind of Russian influence; this is not the case.\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement earlier this month that she was following the developments in George with \u201cgreat concern\u201d and reiterated Brussels\u2019 unease over the law. \u201cGeorgia is at a crossroads. It should stay the course on the road to Europe,\u201d she said. Could the law impact Georgia\u2019s ability to join the EU? Definitely. Georgia first applied for EU membership in 2022 and was granted candidate status in December, an important but still early step in the process of becoming a member of the bloc.

The proposed legislation would limit the capacity of civil society and media organizations to operate freely, could limit freedom of expression and unfairly stigmatize organizations that deliver benefits to the citizens of Georgia,\u201d EU officials said. \u201cThe EU urges Georgia to refrain from adopting legislation that can compromise Georgia\u2019s EU path, a path supported by the overwhelming majority of Georgian citizens.\u201d CNN\u2019s Anna Chernova contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/europe/georgia-foreign-agents-law-explained-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_russia-putin-reshuffle-shoigu-belousov-intl", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s weekend government shakeup appears to be the triumph of competence over loyalty: The Kremlin leader has replaced his camping-and-fishing buddy head of the country\u2019s\u00a0defense\u00a0ministry\u00a0with\u00a0someone widely seen as a competent technocrat. That, at least, seems to be the immediate takeway after the Kremlin announced that Andrey Belousov, a civilian economist and former first deputy prime minister, would take over the top slot at the Russian Ministry\u00a0of Defense\u00a0from\u00a0Sergei Shoigu, who had served in the post since 2012. Alexandra Prokopenko, a former adviser at Russia\u2019s Central Bank, put the shakeup down to the growing interrelationship between the war and Russia\u2019s economy. \u201cPutin\u2019s priority is war; war of attrition is won by economics,\u201d Prokopenko wrote in a thread on X. \u201cBelousov is in favor of stimulating demand from the budget, which means that military spending will at least not decrease but rather increase.\u201d Such a move makes sense when one views the war in Ukraine as a contest between the defense manufacturers of the West, which supplies Ukraine with ammunition and military hardware, and those of Russia. US and NATO officials already concede that Russia is massively outproducing the West when it comes to production of artillery ammunition:\u00a0NATO intelligence estimates of Russian defense production shared with CNN indicate that Russia produces roughly\u00a0three times more artillery shells per year\u00a0than the US and Europe for Ukraine. Having a competent economic manager at the top of the defense ministry can be an asset for Putin, especially when the US Congress has finally turned on the taps of more military aid to Ukraine and\u00a0as\u00a0Russia\u00a0presses\u00a0forward with a new advance along Ukraine\u2019s northeastern border. Whether that advance represents a new front for Russia or an effort to divert Ukrainian forces remains unclear, but it puts more pressure on Kyiv as its allies rush to deliver more weaponry. The appointment of Belousov could also represent house-cleaning at the Ministry of Defense. In recent weeks, the ministry has been hit by a corruption scandal that led to the sacking and arrest of a former deputy to Shoigu. A game of musical chairs Prokopenko,\u00a0who is one of the most perceptive observers of the Russian economy, described Belousov as \u201cwell-versed in military-industrial complex matters\u201d in her thread on X,\u00a0adding that\u00a0he \u201cembodies\u00a0Stolypin-esque statesmanship,\u201d a reference to the reformist Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin, who led an effort to overhaul and modernize Russia\u2019s inefficient economy after its humiliating military defeat by Japan in 1905. But the reality may be more complex. Putin has shifted Shoigu sideways to a post as the secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council, meaning that Shoigu is not completely out of the picture. Discussing Shoigu\u2019s new appointment, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the former defense minister would remain immersed in matters of military production.\u00a0But\u00a0competent management of the wartime economy\u00a0is now\u00a0key: Peskov noted that defense spending is approaching 7% of Russian GDP, close to the level seen in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, when military priorities and central planning strangled the consumer economy and stifled technological innovation. \u201cToday on the battlefield, the winner is the one who is more open to innovation,\u201d\u00a0Peskov said in\u00a0a call with reporters\u00a0Sunday.\u00a0\u201cAnd therefore, it is natural that at the current stage, the president decided that the Russian Ministry of Defense should be headed by a civilian.\u201d The appointment of a civilian to the defense ministry, then, does not signal a less hawkish approach to the war in Ukraine. General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia\u2019s General Staff and one of the architects of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, remains in place. The top echelons of power remain committed to Putin\u2019s brand of personalistic rule \u2014 and Putin\u2019s goal of subjugating Ukraine. Nevertheless, the newest government shakeup does hint at a\u00a0potential future\u00a0power struggle among Russia\u2019s\u00a0elite. With Shoigu\u2019s new appointment, Nikolai\u00a0Patrushev, the previous\u00a0Secretary of the Security Council, was relieved of his position and is \u201cdue to a transfer to another job,\u201d according to Peskov. Patrushev represents a class known as the\u00a0siloviki\u00a0\u2014 the men of power who graduated from the ranks of the Soviet security services. A former head of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, Patrushev has been one of the more hardline members of Putin\u2019s inner circle. And the Patrushev family name has often come up in speculation about who\u00a0may be\u00a0next in line\u00a0to\u00a0the throne after Putin dies \u2014 because, as the Russian president begins a fifth term of office, smart money has him staying on as president-for-life. Putin has no clear successor (if he dies or is incapacitated while in office, his duties will be assumed temporarily by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin), but Kremlin-watchers keep a running list of potential aspirants for a successor. Dmitry Patrushev, the son of the former security council chief, is sometimes described as one of the \u201cprincelings\u201d who are waiting; the younger Patrushev was just made a deputy prime minister in the latest reshuffle. Despite the changes at the top,\u00a0there is no sense that the overall goals\u00a0of the Kremlin \u2014 pursuing the war on Ukraine and continuing a confrontation with the West \u2014\u00a0have changed. \u201cPutin\u2019s primary objective is to enhance the state\u2019s capacity to support military needs more effectively, while most elements of the existing \u2018structure\u2019 will stay intact,\u201d wrote political observer Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder and CEO of the analytical group R.Politik, on X. So the music may be spinning faster inside the Kremlin, but the same loyal contenders are playing musical chairs.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/europe/russia-putin-reshuffle-shoigu-belousov-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_catalonia-elections-socialists-win-intl", "text": "Barcelona, Spain \u2014 Spain\u2019s Socialists won the biggest share of the vote in Sunday\u2019s Catalan elections, dealing a serious blow to more than a decade of separatist governance and the independence dreams still nursed by some in the wealthy northeastern region. The Socialists, led locally by Salvador Illa, had 42 seats in the 135-seat chamber with more than 99% of the vote counted, while hardline separatist party Junts was in second place with 35 seats, and the incumbent more moderate separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) had 20 seats. Spain\u2019s largest opposition party, the conservative People\u2019s Party, also had a good night, seeing the biggest increase since the last vote in 2021 from three seats to 15 on Sunday. Turnout for the vote was notably low at 58%. The result looks to be an existential threat for separatist governance in Catalonia which led a 2017 illegal independence referendum and declaration of independence that caused Spain\u2019s worst institutional crisis in more than 30 years but whose movement has lost energy and unity more recently. It also represents a vindication of Spain\u2019s Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s controversial bid to normalize relations with restive Catalonia, including issuing pardons for convictions over the independence drive and, more recently, a controversial amnesty including others still facing prosecution. Speaking as the voting count concluded, Illa hailed a \u201cnew era\u201d for the region. However, with no party holding a clear majority and deep ideological divisions between them, there remains the risk the vote will have to be repeated. The separatist parties combined of the ERC, Junts, far-left CUP and far-right Alianca Catalana, do not have the required 68 seats to be able to form a coalition government. Illa\u2019s Socialists will also need to forge an agreement - most likely with the ERC - but separatist parties until now have rejected any suggestion of helping the national ruling party govern in Catalonia. Illa might instead attempt to form an unorthodox alliance with not only far-left Sumar, its coalition partner in national government, but also the conservative People\u2019s Party and far-right Vox, with whom the socialists have long said they would not negotiate. On Sunday night, the ERC\u2019s leader Pere Aragones, Catalonia\u2019s outgoing president, told reporters that his party would move into opposition, effectively ruling out backing the Socialists. Junts\u2019 leader Carles Puigdemont said his party had performed well but turnout among separatist voters remained low and without a strong showing by the ERC, AC and CUP, his options were limited. He previously said that if he didn\u2019t win and the Socialists allied with the PP to lead the region he might withdraw his support from its minority national government - offered after inconclusive national elections in July, risking fresh instability on a national level. Political analyst and historian Joan Esculies said whatever came next, the night\u2019s headline was the tamping down of Catalan separatist sentiment: \u201cThe pro-independence movement has run out of ideas to convince or mobilize people as they did before.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/europe/catalonia-elections-socialists-win-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Daniel Duggan, 55, a naturalized Australian citizen, feared requests by Western intelligence agencies for sensitive information were putting his family at risk, the lawyer said in a legal filing seen by Reuters. The lawyer\u2019s filing supports Reuters reporting linking Duggan to convicted Chinese defense\u00a0hacker Su Bin. Duggan denies the allegations that he broke US arms control laws. He has been in an Australian maximum security prison since his 2022 arrest after returning from six years working in Beijing. US authorities found correspondence with Duggan on electronic devices seized from Su Bin, Duggan\u2019s lawyer Bernard Collaery said in the March submission to Australian Attorney General Mark Dreyfus, who will decide whether to surrender Duggan to the US after a magistrate hears Duggan\u2019s extradition case. The case will be heard in a Sydney court this month, two years after\u00a0his arrest\u00a0in rural Australia at a time when Britain was warning its former military pilots not to work for China. Su Bin, arrested in Canada in 2014,\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in 2016 to theft of US military aircraft designs by hacking major US defense contractors. He is listed among seven co-conspirators with Duggan in the extradition request. Duggan knew Su Bin as an employment broker for Chinese state aviation company AVIC, lawyer Collaery wrote, and the hacking case was \u201ctotally unrelated to our client.\u201d Although Su Bin \u201cmay have had improper connection to (Chinese) agents this was unknown to our client,\u201d Duggan\u2019s lawyer wrote. \u2018Overt intelligence contact\u2019 AVIC was blacklisted by the US last year as a Chinese\u00a0military-linked\u00a0company. Messages retrieved from Su Bin\u2019s electronic devices show he paid for Duggan\u2019s travel from Australia to Beijing in May 2012, according to extradition documents lodged by the United States with the Australian court. Duggan asked Su Bin to help source Chinese aircraft parts for his Top Gun tourist flight business in Australia, Collaery wrote. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and US Navy criminal investigators knew Duggan was training pilots for AVIC and met him in Australia\u2019s Tasmania state in December 2012 and February 2013, his lawyer wrote. ASIO and the US Navy Criminal Investigation Service did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the meetings. ASIO has previously said it would not comment as the matter was before the court. \u201cAn ASIO officer suggested that while carrying on his legitimate business operations in China, Mr Duggan may be able to gather sensitive information,\u201d his lawyer wrote. Duggan moved to China in 2013 and was barred from leaving the country in 2014, his lawyer said. Duggan\u2019s\u00a0LinkedIn profile\u00a0and aviation sources who knew him said he was working in China as an aviation consultant in 2013 and 2014. He renounced his US citizenship in 2016 at the US embassy in Beijing, backdated to 2012 on a certificate, after \u201covert intelligence contact by US authorities that may have compromised his family\u2019s safety,\u201d his lawyer wrote. His lawyers oppose extradition, arguing there is no evidence the Chinese pilots he trained were military and that he became an Australian citizen in January 2012, before the alleged offenses.

{"id": "2024_05_14_weather_canada-wildfire-smoke-air-quality-climate", "text": "Dangerous wildfires have scorched tens of thousands of acres and are closing in on multiple Canadian towns, forcing thousands of evacuations and degrading air quality. The country\u2019s wildfire season is off to a troubling pace as new fires ignite each day and dormant so-called \u201czombie\u201d fires reanimate. The 2024 fire season isn\u2019t yet on par with last year\u2019s record-shattering season but with wildfire behavior worsening in a warming world it\u2019s no wonder Canadian fire officials are warning of an \u201cexplosive\u201d season that may rival last year. Extremely dry and windy conditions have caused multiple fires to grow thousands of acres since the weekend. Despite wet weather on the horizon, firefighting will remain a challenge in several provinces through midweek due to gusty winds. Gusty winds caused the Parker Lake Fire in northeastern British Columbia to surge in size from 13,000 acres Monday to nearly 21,000 acres Tuesday. The blaze was just over a mile west of the town of Fort Nelson early Tuesday morning. At least 4,700 people are under evacuation orders, including in Fort Nelson and Fort Nelson First Nation, Bowinn Ma, British Columbia\u2019s minister of emergency management and climate readiness, confirmed Monday. All but 50 people have heeded the evacuation orders, Northern Rockies Regional Municipality Mayor, Rob Fraser, told CNN Tuesday morning. No deaths or injuries have been reported. Large wildfires have also prompted evacuation orders in Manitoba province and alerts in Alberta province. Evacuation alerts mean people should be ready to evacuate in case an evacuation order is issued. Manitoba is home to one of the largest active wildfires in the country, which had charred more than 86,000 acres as of Monday. More than 500 residents in the community of Cranberry Portage \u2013 less than a mile away from the fire \u2013 were evacuated as of Monday, according to Manitoba officials. A large fire about 10 miles southwest of Fort McMurray, Alberta \u2013 an area that was devastated by a wildfire in 2016 \u2013 had consumed over 23,000 acres as of Tuesday after growing significantly overnight. An\u00a0evacuation alert\u00a0was issued for residents in Fort McMurray, Saprae Creek, Gregoire Lake Estates, Fort McMurray 468 First Nation and Anzac, according to Alberta officials. All the fire activity is sending plumes of hazardous smoke across Canada and into the US. The threat of smoke will only continue as long as the fires burn. Hazy conditions and degraded air quality levels were in place Tuesday morning from the Dakotas through Kansas. The central US will remain the focal point for Canadian smoke through at least midweek. Warming climate is worsening wildfire behavior Gusty winds are driving ongoing fires Tuesday, but the seeds of fire activity were sown over the winter and in past years as the world continues to warm because of human-driven climate change. \u201cThis region has experienced multiple years of drought, with a below normal snowpack this past winter,\u201d said Ben Boghean, fire behavior specialist for the BC Wildfire Service. \u201cAs a result of this, our forests in the Fort Nelson zone are very receptive\u00a0to new fire ignitions and rapid rates of spread.\u201d Declining snow, increasing temperatures and worsening droughts are all hallmarks of climate change and are projected to keep driving larger and more intense fires across Canada,\u00a0according to Environment Canada. Last year was Canada\u2019s most devastating fire season on record, including in British Columbia, where fires burned through hundreds of homes and an area the size of Maryland, according to the\u00a0BC Wildfire Service. There are more than 130 fires burning across Canada, 40 of which are considered out of control,\u00a0according to the Canadian Interagency Fire Centre. Some of the blazes are so-called \u201choldover fires\u201d also known colloquially as \u201czombie fires,\u201d the smoldering remains of last season\u2019s epic blazes, burning deep in the ground throughout the winter and reigniting when exposed to warmer temperatures in the spring. \u201cIn the past, the winter conditions are what put out a lot of holdover fires,\u201d Ma said. \u201cIn this case, what we\u2019ve seen is that due to higher temperatures and persistent drought through the last year, many of these holdover fires were not put out like they normally are.\u201d Two \u201czombie\u201d fires, the Patry Creek Fire and the Nogah Creek Wildfire, are growing rapidly to the north and east of Fort Nelson and contributing to the evacuation orders.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/weather/canada-wildfire-smoke-air-quality-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.

{"id": "2024_05_10_middleeast_israel-sde-teiman-detention-whistleblowers-intl-cmd", "text": "At a military base that now doubles as a detention center in Israel\u2019s Negev desert, an Israeli working at the facility snapped two photographs of a scene that he says continues to haunt him. Rows of men in gray tracksuits are seen sitting on paper-thin mattresses, ringfenced by barbed wire. All appear blindfolded, their heads hanging heavy under the glare of floodlights. A putrid stench filled the air and the room hummed with the men\u2019s murmurs, the Israeli who was at the facility told CNN. Forbidden from speaking to each other, the detainees mumbled to themselves. \u201cWe were told they were not allowed to move. They should sit upright. They\u2019re not allowed to talk. Not allowed to peek under their blindfold.\u201d Guards were instructed \u201cto scream uskot\u201d \u2013 shut up in Arabic \u2013 and told to \u201cpick people out that were problematic and punish them,\u201d the source added. CNN spoke to three Israeli whistleblowers who worked at the Sde Teiman desert camp, which holds Palestinians detained during Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza. All spoke out at risk of legal repercussions and reprisals from groups supportive of Israel\u2019s hardline policies in Gaza. They paint a picture of a facility where doctors sometimes amputated prisoners\u2019 limbs due to injuries sustained from constant handcuffing; of medical procedures sometimes performed by underqualified medics earning it a reputation for being \u201ca paradise for interns\u201d; and where the air is filled with the smell of neglected wounds left to rot. According to the accounts,\u00a0the facility some 18 miles from the Gaza frontier is split into two parts: enclosures where around 70 Palestinian detainees from Gaza\u00a0are placed under extreme physical restraint, and a field hospital where wounded detainees are strapped to their beds, wearing diapers\u00a0and fed through straws. \u201cThey stripped them down of anything that resembles human beings,\u201d said one whistleblower, who worked as a medic at the facility\u2019s field hospital. \u201c(The beatings) were not done to gather intelligence. They were done out of revenge,\u201d said another whistleblower. \u201cIt was punishment for what they (the Palestinians) did on October 7 and punishment for behavior in the camp.\u201d Responding to CNN\u2019s request for comment on all the allegations made in this report, the Israeli military, known as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said in a statement: \u201cThe IDF ensures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, MPCID (Military Police Criminal Investigation\u2019s Division) investigations are opened when there is suspicion of misconduct justifying such action.\u201d \u201cDetainees are handcuffed based on their risk level and health status. Incidents of unlawful handcuffing are not known to the authorities.\u201d The IDF did not directly deny accounts of people being stripped of their clothing or held in diapers. Instead, the Israeli military said that the detainees are given back their clothing once the IDF has determined that they pose no security risk. Reports of abuse\u00a0at Sde Teiman have already surfaced in Israeli and Arab media after an outcry from Israeli and Palestinian rights groups over conditions there. But this rare testimony from Israelis working at the facility sheds further light on Israel\u2019s conduct as it wages war in Gaza,\u00a0with fresh allegations of mistreatment.\u00a0It also casts more doubt on the Israeli government\u2019s repeated assertions that it acts in accordance with accepted international practices and law. CNN has requested permission from the Israeli military to access the Sde Teiman base. Last month, a CNN team covered a small protest outside its main gate staged by Israeli activists demanding the closure of the facility. Israeli security forces questioned the team for around 30 minutes there, demanding to see the footage taken by CNN\u2019s photojournalist. Israel often subjects reporters, even foreign journalists, to military censorship on security issues. Detained in the desert The Israeli military has acknowledged partially converting three different military facilities into detention camps for Palestinian detainees from Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel, in which Israeli authorities say about 1,200 were killed and over 250 were abducted, and the subsequent Israeli offensive in Gaza, killing nearly 35,000 people according to the strip\u2019s health ministry. These facilities are Sde Teiman in the Negev desert, as well as Anatot and Ofer military bases\u00a0in the occupied West Bank. The camps are part of the infrastructure of Israel\u2019s Unlawful Combatants Law, an amended legislation passed by the Knesset last December that expanded the military\u2019s authority to detain suspected militants. The law permits the military to detain people for 45 days without an arrest warrant, after which they must be transferred to Israel\u2019s formal prison system (IPS), where over 9,000 Palestinians are being held in conditions that rights groups say have drastically deteriorated since October 7. Two Palestinian prisoners associations said last week that 18 Palestinians \u2013 including leading Gaza surgeon Dr. Adnan al-Bursh \u2013 had died in Israeli custody over the course of the war. The military detention camps \u2013 where the number of inmates is unknown \u2013 serve as a filtration point during the arrest period mandated by the Unlawful Combatants Law. After their detention in the camps, those with suspected Hamas links are transferred to the IPS, while those whose militant ties have been ruled out are released back to Gaza. CNN interviewed over a dozen former Gazan detainees who appeared to have been released from those camps. They said they could not determine where they were held because they were blindfolded through most of their detention and cut off from the outside world. But the details of their accounts tally with those of the whistleblowers. \u201cWe looked forward to the night so we could sleep. Then we looked forward to the morning in hopes that our situation might change,\u201d said Dr. Mohammed al-Ran, recalling his detainment at a military facility where he said he endured desert temperatures, swinging from the heat of the day to the chill of night.\u00a0CNN interviewed him outside Gaza last month. Al-Ran, a Palestinian who holds Bosnian citizenship, headed the surgical unit at northern Gaza\u2019s Indonesian hospital, one of the first to be shut down and raided as Israel carried out its aerial, ground and naval offensive. He was arrested on December 18, he said, outside Gaza City\u2019s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, where he had been working for three days after fleeing his hospital in the heavily bombarded north. He was stripped down to his underwear, blindfolded and his wrists tied, then dumped in the back of a truck where, he said, the near-naked detainees were piled on top of one another as they were shuttled to a detention camp in the middle of the desert. The details in his account are consistent with those of dozens of others collected by CNN recounting the conditions of arrest in Gaza. His account is also supported by numerous images depicting mass arrests published on social media profiles belonging to Israeli soldiers. Many of those images show captive Gazans, their wrists or ankles tied by cables, in their underwear and blindfolded. Al-Ran was held in a military detention center for 44 days, he told CNN. \u201cOur days were filled with prayer, tears, and supplication. This eased our agony,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cWe cried and cried and cried. We cried for ourselves, cried for our nation, cried for our community, cried for our loved ones. We cried about everything that crossed our minds.\u201d A week into his imprisonment, the detention camp\u2019s authorities ordered him to act as an intermediary between the guards and the prisoners, a role known as Shawish, \u201csupervisor,\u201d in vernacular Arabic. According to the Israeli whistleblowers, a Shawish is normally a prisoner who has been cleared of suspected links to Hamas after interrogation. The Israeli military denied holding detainees unnecessarily, or using them for translation purposes. \u201cIf there is no reason for continued detention, the detainees are released back to Gaza,\u201d they said in a statement. However, whistleblower and detainee accounts \u2013 particularly pertaining to Shawish \u2013 cast doubt on the IDF\u2019s depiction of its clearing process. Al-Ran says that he served as Shawish for several weeks after he was cleared of Hamas links. Whistleblowers also said that the absolved Shawish served as intermediaries for some time. They are typically proficient in Hebrew, according to the eyewitnesses, enabling them to communicate the guards\u2019 orders to the rest of the prisoners in Arabic. For that, al-Ran said he was given a special privilege: his blindfold was removed. He said this was another kind of hell. \u201cPart of my torture was being able to see how people were being tortured,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first you couldn\u2019t see. You couldn\u2019t see the torture, the vengeance, the oppression. \u201cWhen they removed my blindfold, I could see the extent of the humiliation and abasement \u2026 I could see the extent to which they saw us not as human beings but as animals.\u201d Al-Ran\u2019s account of the forms of punishment he saw were corroborated by the whistleblowers who spoke with CNN. A prisoner who committed an offense such as speaking to another would be ordered to raise his arms above his head for up to an hour. The prisoner\u2019s hands would sometimes be zip-tied to a fence to ensure that he did not come out of the stress position. For those who repeatedly breached the prohibition on speaking and moving, the punishment became more severe. Israeli guards would sometimes take a prisoner to an area outside the enclosure and beat him aggressively, according to two whistleblowers and al-Ran. A whistleblower who worked as a guard said he saw a man emerge from a beating with his teeth, and some bones, apparently broken. That whistleblower and al-Ran also described a routine search when the guards would unleash large dogs on sleeping detainees, lobbing a sound grenade at the enclosure as troops barged in. Al-Ran called this \u201cthe nightly torture.\u201d \u201cWhile we were cabled, they unleashed the dogs that would move between us, and trample over us,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cYou\u2019d be lying on your belly, your face pressed against the ground. You can\u2019t move, and they\u2019re moving above you.\u201d The same whistleblower recounted the search in the same harrowing detail. \u201cIt was a special unit of the military police that did the so-called search,\u201d said the source. \u201cBut really it was an excuse to hit them. It was a terrifying situation.\u201d \u201cThere was a lot of screaming and dogs barking.\u201d Strapped to beds in a field hospital Whistleblower accounts portrayed a different kind of horror at the Sde Teiman field hospital. \u201cWhat I felt when I was dealing with those patients is an idea of total vulnerability,\u201d said one medic who worked at Sde Teiman. \u201cIf you imagine yourself being unable to move, being unable to see what\u2019s going on, and being completely naked, that leaves you completely exposed,\u201d the source said.\u00a0 \u201cI think that\u2019s something that borders on, if not crosses to, psychological torture.\u201d Another whistleblower said he was ordered to perform medical procedures on the Palestinian detainees for which he was not qualified. \u201cI was asked to learn how to do things on the patients, performing minor medical procedures that are totally outside my expertise,\u201d he said, adding that this was frequently done without anesthesia. \u201cIf they complained about pain, they would be given paracetamol,\u201d he said, using another name for acetaminophen. \u201cJust being there felt like being complicit in abuse.\u201d The same whistleblower also said he witnessed an amputation performed on a man who had sustained injuries caused by the constant zip-tying of his wrists. The account tallied with details of\u00a0a letter authored by a doctor\u00a0working at Sde Teiman published by Ha\u2019aretz in April. \u201cFrom the first days of the medical facility\u2019s operation until today, I have faced serious ethical dilemmas,\u201d said the letter addressed to Israel\u2019s attorney general, and its health and defense ministries, according to Ha\u2019aretz. \u201cMore than that, I am writing (this letter) to warn you that the facilities\u2019 operations do not comply with a single section among those dealing with health in the Incarceration of Unlawful Combatants Law.\u201d An IDF spokesperson denied the allegations reported by Ha\u2019aretz in a written statement to CNN at the time, saying that medical procedures were conducted with \u201cextreme care\u201d and in accordance with Israeli and international law. The spokesperson added that the handcuffing of the detainees was done in \u201caccordance with procedures, their health condition and the level of danger posed by them,\u201d and that any allegation of violence would be examined. Whistleblowers also said that medical team were told to refrain from signing medical documents, corroborating previous reporting by rights group Physicians for Human Rights in Israel (PHRI). The PHRI report released in April warned of \u201ca serious concern that anonymity is employed to prevent the possibility of investigations or complaints regarding breaches of medical ethics and professionalism.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t sign anything, and there is no verification of authority,\u201d said the same whistleblower who said he lacked the appropriate training for the treatment he was asked to administer. \u201cIt is a paradise for interns because it\u2019s like you do whatever you want.\u201d CNN also requested comment from the Israeli health ministry on the allegations in this report. The ministry referred CNN back to the IDF. Concealed from the outside world Sde Teiman and other military detention camps have been shrouded in secrecy since their inception. Israel has repeatedly refused requests to disclose the number of detainees held at the facilities, or to reveal the whereabouts of Gazan prisoners. Last Wednesday, the Israeli Supreme Court held a hearing in response to a petition brought forward by Israeli rights group, HaMoked, to reveal the location of a Palestinian X-Ray technician detained from Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza in February. It was the first court session of its kind since October 7. Israel\u2019s highest court had previously rejected writs of habeas corpus filed on behalf of dozens of Palestinians from Gaza held in unknown locations. The disappearances \u201callows for the atrocities that we\u2019ve been hearing about to happen,\u201d said Tal Steiner, an Israeli human rights lawyer and executive director of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel. \u201cPeople completely disconnected from the outside world are the most vulnerable to torture and mistreatment,\u201d Steiner said in an interview with CNN. Satellite images provide further insight into activities at Sde Teiman, revealing that in the months since the start of the\u00a0Israel-Hamas war on October 7, more than 100 new structures, including large tents and hangars, have been built at the desert camp. A comparison of aerial photographs from September 10, 2023 and March 1 this year also showed a significant increase in the number of vehicles at the facility, indicating an uptick in activity. Satellite imagery from two dates in early December showed construction work in progress. CNN also geolocated the two leaked photographs showing the enclosure holding the group of blindfolded men in gray tracksuits. The pattern of panels seen on the roof matched those of a large hangar visible in satellite imagery. The structure, which resembles an animal pen, is located in the central area of the Sde Teiman compound. It is an older structure seen among new buildings which have appeared since the war began. CNN reviewed satellite images from two other military detention camps \u2013 Ofer and Anatot bases in the occupied West Bank \u2013 and did not detect expansion in the grounds since October 7. Several rights groups and legal experts say they believe that Sde Teiman, which is the nearest to Gaza, likely hosts the largest number of detainees of the three military detention camps. \u201cI was there for 23 days. Twenty-three days that felt like 100 years,\u201d said 27-year-old Ibrahim Yassine on the day of his release from a military detention camp. He was lying in a crowded room with over a dozen newly freed men \u2013 they were still in the grey tracksuit prison uniforms. Some had deep flesh wounds from where the handcuffs had been removed. \u201cWe were handcuffed and blindfolded,\u201d said another man, 43-year-old Sufyan Abu Salah. \u201cToday is the first day I can see.\u201d Several had a glassy look in their eyes and were seemingly emaciated. One elderly man breathed through an oxygen machine as he lay on a stretcher. Outside the hospital, two freed men from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society embraced their colleagues. For Dr. Al-Ran, his reunion with his friends was anything but joyful. The experience, he said, rendered him mute for a month as he battled an \u201cemotional deadness.\u201d \u201cIt was very painful. When I was released, people expected me to miss them, to embrace them. But there was a gap,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cThe people who were with me at the detention facility became my family. Those friendships were the only things that belonged to us.\u201d Just before his release, a fellow prisoner had called out to him, his voice barely rising above a whisper, al-Ran said. He asked the doctor to find his wife and kids in Gaza. \u201cHe asked me to tell them that it is better for them to be martyrs,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cIt is better for them to die than to be captured and held here.\u201d CreditsExecutive producer: Barbara ArvanitidisSenior investigations writer: Tamara QiblawiChief global affairs correspondent: Matthew ChanceOSINT reporter: Allegra GoodwinPhotojournalist: Alex PlattReporters: Abeer Salman and Ami KaufmanGaza journalists: Mohammad Al Sawalhi and Tareq Al HilouContributing journalist: Kareem KhadderVisual and graphic editors: Carlotta Dotto, Lou Robinson and Mark Oliver3D designer: Tom JamesPhoto editor: Sarah TilottaVideo editors: Mark Baron, Julie Zink and Augusta AnthonyMotion designers: Patrick Gallagher and Yukari SchrickelDigital editors: Laura Smith-Spark and Eliza MackintoshExecutive editors: Dan Wright and Matt Wells ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/middleeast/israel-sde-teiman-detention-whistleblowers-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_tech_tiktok-sues-us-app-ban", "text": "TikTok sued Tuesday to block a US law that could force a nationwide ban of the popular app, following through on legal threats the company issued after President Joe Biden signed the legislation last month. The court challenge sets up a historic legal battle, one that will determine whether US security concerns about TikTok\u2019s links to China can trump the First Amendment rights of TikTok\u2019s 170 million US users. The stakes of the case are existential for TikTok. If it loses, TikTok could be banned from US app stores unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells the app to a non-Chinese entity by mid-January 2025. In its\u00a0petition filed Tuesday at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, TikTok and Bytedance allege the law is unconstitutional because it stifles Americans\u2019 speech and prevents them from accessing lawful information. The petition claims the US government \u201chas taken the unprecedented step of expressly singling out and banning\u201d the short-form video app in an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power. \u201cFor the first time in history,\u201d the petition said, \u201cCongress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than 1 billion people worldwide.\u201d The White House referred questions about TikTok\u2019s legal challenge to the Justice Department, which didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit follows years of US allegations that TikTok\u2019s ties to China could potentially expose Americans\u2019 personal information to the Chinese government. Debate over data sharing TikTok has strongly denied that it has ever given Chinese government officials access to US user data and says it has taken steps to protect that information by hosting the data on servers owned by US tech giant Oracle. Those moves are part of a 90-page draft agreement before a government panel known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multiagency body that has been reviewing TikTok\u2019s US operations since 2019, the petition said. That same draft deal also includes the ability for the US government to shut down TikTok if it or ByteDance \u201cviolate certain obligations under the agreement,\u201d the petition said. But those assurances have not eased US officials\u2019 concerns, which include fears that China could use TikTok\u2019s data to identify intelligence targets, spread propaganda or engage in other forms of covert influence. The US government has not publicly presented any concrete evidence showing Chinese government access of TikTok data to date; US lawmakers have received classified briefings by national security officials behind closed doors, but they have not declassified any materials from those meetings. Reactions to the briefings have been mixed, with one House Republican saying there was \u201cno specific information \u2026 that was well-founded evidence\u201d and one House Democrat saying the issue comes down to a judgment call about curbing \u201cmalign influence\u201d from China. But Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, an advocate for the TikTok legislation, said in remarks on the Senate floor in April that the briefings provided critical insight into the risk TikTok poses. \u201cMany Americans, particularly young Americans, are rightfully skeptical\u201d of the legislation clamping down on TikTok, Warner said in his remarks. \u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019ve not seen what Congress has seen. They\u2019ve not been in the classified briefings that Congress has held, which have delved into more deeply some of the threat posed by the foreign control of TikTok.\u201d In March, those fears culminated in legislation giving TikTok roughly six months to sell or face a US ban. Passed by the House, it stalled in the Senate before an updated version of the bill was fast-tracked and attached to a major foreign aid package benefiting Israel and Ukraine. US policymakers have described the law at issue as a forced divestiture of TikTok, not an outright app ban. TikTok has insisted, however, that a ban would be the only probable outcome if the law is upheld. \u201cThe \u2018qualified divestiture\u2019 demanded by the Act to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States is simply not possible,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s petition said, \u201cnot commercially, not technologically, not legally.\u201d First Amendment implications TikTok and ByteDance called the national security fears at the heart of the TikTok legislation \u201cspeculative and analytically flawed,\u201d adding in the petition that the bill\u2019s swift passage reflects how its congressional authors relied on \u201cspeculation, not \u2018evidence,\u2019 as the First Amendment requires,\u201d to make their case. First Amendment scholars say TikTok\u2019s claims have some merit. The Supreme Court has held, for instance, that the US government cannot prohibit Americans from receiving foreign propaganda if they so choose. Underscoring the point, legislation known as the Berman amendment also forbids US presidents from blocking the free flow of media from foreign countries, even those considered hostile to the United States. \u201cNational security claims should not trump the First Amendment,\u201d said Evelyn Douek, an assistant law professor at Stanford University who studies online platform regulations. \u201cOtherwise, it would make the Constitution a paper tiger. At the very least, the government should be forced to provide evidence for its claims. That said, there is precedent of the [Supreme] Court neglecting these principles, especially in the context of counterterrorism and foreign speech.\u201d TikTok notched some early court victories last year as several US states tried to clamp down on the app, foreshadowing the battle to come over online speech. In Montana, the only state to have passed its own TikTok ban affecting personal devices, a federal judge temporarily blocked the legislation \u2014 saying the state law unconstitutionally \u201charmed [users\u2019] First Amendment rights and cut off a stream of income on which many rely.\u201d The bipartisan nature of the law Biden signed might convince\u00a0the courts of the seriousness of the national security concerns around TikTok, said Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic at Cornell University. Still, Hans said, \u201cwithout public discussion of what exactly the risks are \u2026 it\u2019s difficult to determine why the courts should validate such an unprecedented law.\u201d In addition to potentially infringing on US TikTok users\u2019 speech rights, the federal law TikTok is challenging also implicates the constitutional rights of Apple and Google, whose app stores would be prohibited from carrying TikTok if a ban went into effect. \u201cThis raises concerns about potentially unconstitutional government intrusion into the decisions of these platforms regarding what content to host,\u201d wrote Jennifer Huddleston, a research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, in an op-ed last month. \u201cFurther, it could set a dangerous precedent of government intervention in the online space that many would find anathema in the offline space.\u201d The US government and more than half of US states have restricted TikTok from government devices, however, reflecting the authority that governments have to manage their own property. Internationally, TikTok has been banned on government devices in Canada, the United Kingdom and at the European Commission. The app has been subject to a complete ban in the entire country of India since 2020. Some US officials have been trying to ban TikTok from the United States since 2020, when former President Donald Trump moved to block the app by executive order. (Trump has since reversed his position, saying a TikTok ban would only help Meta, a company Trump blames for his 2020 election defeat.) The outcome of the TikTok case is likely to have far-reaching consequences for how the US government regulates technology and other foreign speech, Douek said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to think of this not in terms of just TikTok, but in terms of all foreign platforms in the future,\u201d Douek said. \u201cIn a globalized world, this issue is going to come up again and again. And if the government is handed the power to simply ban a platform based on what seems at this stage mere concerns about potential for future harm, rather than actual clear and present dangers, that would be extremely worrying.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/tech/tiktok-sues-us-app-ban/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_australia_australia-david-mcbride-sentenced-intl-hnk", "text": "A former Australian Army lawyer who leaked classified documents to journalists exposing details of alleged crimes by Australian special forces in Afghanistan has been sentenced to more than five years in prison, a verdict criticized by press freedom advocates, who say it delivers a chilling message to potential whistleblowers. Cries of \u201cshame\u201d rang out in the courtroom in the Australian capital Canberra on Tuesday, as Justice David Mossop delivered the sentence to David McBride, in a punishment described by his lawyer as \u201coff the charts\u201d and a deterrent to anyone who felt motivated to expose wrongdoing. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s observed what\u2019s happened to McBride will be well advised to shut up, put your head down and get back to the workplace. That was pretty much the tone of the judgement today,\u201d lawyer Mark Davies said, adding his client was in \u201ctotal shock\u201d at the sentence and would appeal. Tuesday\u2019s sentencing ends a long legal battle between the former army lawyer and Commonwealth prosecutors who pursued charges against McBride over classified defense documents he admitted stealing between May 2014 and December 2015. McBride gave the material to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which in 2017 published a\u00a0seven-part series called \u201cThe Afghan Files,\u201d that detailed a string of alleged war crimes, including the killing of unarmed Afghans by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. The ABC\u2019s reporting was later vindicated by the findings of an investigation by the\u00a0Australian Defense Force\u00a0(ADF) which found\u00a0credible evidence that members of the Australian Special Air Service (SAS) had committed war crimes in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2013. Known as the Brereton report, the Afghanistan Inquiry Report found SAS members had in some cases planted \u201cthrowdowns,\u201d or weapons and other material, near the bodies of civilians to suggest they had been lawfully killed. McBride is the first person to be convicted of any criminal charge related to the accusations. However, during proceedings against McBride, the court heard that he did not bring the documents to the media\u2019s attention to highlight the alleged war crimes. In his ruling, Mossop said McBride had complained that soldiers were being investigated\u00a0\u201ceven in circumstances where there was no prospect that they had committed the war crime of murder.\u201d McBride believed soldiers were being targeted for investigation\u00a0\u201cto satisfy political concerns as to the death of civilians.\u201d McBride had planned to argue that he acted out of a sense of duty to the Australian public, but in a previous hearing, Justice Mossop indicated he wouldn\u2019t instruct the jury to that effect, so McBride pleaded guilty last November to three charges,\u00a0including theft of Commonwealth property and breaching the Defense Act. In his ruling, Mossop acknowledged McBride had not acted for financial gain or to assist Australia\u2019s adversaries but wrote \u201cthe offender has no remorse and still considers that he did the right thing.\u201d \u201cSelf\u2011confident people with strong opinions who are subject to legal duties not to disclose information must be deterred from making disclosures in order to advance their own opinions,\u201d Mossop wrote. \u201cThey must know that breaching their legal obligations to maintain the confidentiality which they have undertaken to protect will be met by significant punishment. That is particularly so when that information is secret and its disclosure has the potential to harm Australia\u2019s national security,\u201d the judge added. Supporters react McBride\u2019s supporters\u00a0had appealed to the Australian attorney general to drop the charges and reacted angrily on Tuesday to his sentence. Kieran Pender, acting legal director of the Human Rights Law Centre, called it a \u201cdark day for democracy\u201d and one that sent a \u201cchilling\u201d message to potential whistleblowers. \u201cDavid McBride leaked documents to our national broadcaster which contained credible evidence of war crimes committed by Australian forces in Afghanistan. That information is obviously in the public interest, I don\u2019t think anyone can deny that,\u201d he said. Pender and others pointed out that no one had yet been prosecuted over Australia\u2019s alleged war crimes in Afghanistan \u2013 except the man who had brought it to the country\u2019s attention. \u201cWill the next David McBride speak up about wrongdoing when they see that this is the outcome?\u201d he asked. Peter Greste, a journalist, author and fierce defender of press freedom, said he found the imprisonment of a whistleblower to be \u201cseriously troubling.\u201d He said he thought it would have a \u201cvery serious chilling effect\u201d on whistleblowing, with implications for press freedom. \u201cJournalists are supposed to be a conduit for this sort of thing,\u201d said Greste, who\u00a0was released by Egypt in 2015 after spending 13 months in prison on accusations he\u00a0produced false news to defame the country. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the democratic system that sources with evidence of wrongdoing in governments, when internal mechanisms fail, can go to journalists and give them the information they need to expose these stories and still have their identities protected,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThis undermines that principle to a serious and profound extent. I\u2019m very worried about that.\u201d \u201cDavid ought to be treated as a hero, not as a villain,\u201d Greste added. Australian Federal Police officers raided the ABC offices in Sydney in 2019 seeking documents as they pursued potential charges against the journalists behind the story. But ultimately no charges were laid.  The ABC declined to comment on McBride\u2019s sentencing.  If the sentence is upheld, he\u2019ll serve a non-parole period of 27 months in prison until August 2026. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declined to comment on the sentence due to the prospect of an appeal. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything here that interferes with a matter that is quite clearly going to continue to be before the courts,\u201d he said in parliament Tuesday. In a statement, a spokesperson for Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus said, \u201cThe decision to prosecute David McBride, and the conduct of that prosecution, was the responsibility of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.\u201d \u201cThe CDPP is independent of the Government of the day \u2013 a very important feature of our criminal justice system,\u201d he added. The Australian Federal Police is working with the Office of the Special Investigator (OSI) to investigate potential charges. Last year, a man in New South Wales was charged with\u00a0murder, in the first war crime charge against a serving or former ADF member under Australian law, according to the AFP. This story has been updated to clarify that the ADF inquiry began before the ABC\u2019s reporting of \u201cThe Afghan Files.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/australia/australia-david-mcbride-sentenced-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_africa_from-anonymity-to-empowerment-the-journey-of-diary-of-a-naija-girl", "text": "In the bustling world of social media, where everyone strives to be heard, few voices rise above the noise to truly make an impact. One such voice is that of Ifedayo Agoro, the founder of Diary of a Naija Girl (DANG), a platform that started as a simple Instagram page and has since grown into a thriving community of nearly one million followers across social media sites. The journey for the Nigerian former oil and gas executive began with a simple idea in 2006 \u2013 to share her stories and opinions authentically and without fear or shame. \u201cI realized the culture of shame had grown so much and I thought to myself, \u2018This is not how I grew up\u2026 I\u2019m gonna tell my story, the good, the bad, and the ugly, and I will not be ashamed,\u2019\u201d Agoro recalled. Candid conversations Through candid conversations and shared narratives, members of the DANG community confront taboo topics such as gender-based violence, discrimination, body image, mental health, and reproductive rights. \u201cWhat drives the content is the platform\u2019s values; to live our best life, never be suppressed by shame and our experiences, and learn and unlearn everything. Whatever falls under these values is what we put out,\u201d she explained. Agoro, 40, champions the message of self-worth and autonomy, inspiring women to embrace their individuality and make decisions based on their desires, not societal expectations. \u201cWomen are beginning to understand that they are worthy anyway, with marriage or without it,\u201d she said. She is often accused of being anti-men and marriage and Agoro was keen to clarify her stance on relationships. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-marriage\u2026 I just know that my life is still full without it. \u201cHusbands would write to me that I\u2019m spoiling their wives and teaching them to be rude and not submissive. Men would throw jabs at me on Twitter\u2026 they were just not happy that I was expressing\u2026 what other women are too scared to say,\u201d she told CNN. Although she admits the vitriol has lessened considerably. \u201cI would attribute that to not backing down. I\u2019m a person that\u2019s just going to do what I want to do.\u201d Undeterred by detractors, Agoro continues to amplify women\u2019s voices and create a safe space for women to share without limits. This ultimately led Agoro to create the #DangAfterHours series, a no-holds-barred discussion on sex and sexuality, a real taboo subject in Nigeria, Agoro says. \u201cWomen in Nigeria are not really able to talk about sex without being labeled promiscuous. I want to talk about sex in a hilarious way, we can learn from it and bond on that topic. The response shows that the conversation needed to happen.\u201d Creating impact Over the years, Agoro has used the DANG platform to transform the lives of hundreds of women. A self-described \u201cempath\u201d she finds herself getting involved in the lives of the women who reach her for help and advice, often \u201cbawling her eyes out,\u201d over their triumphs and tribulations, she says. However, one moment stands out for her. \u201cA few years ago, there was a lady who was sick in the hospital in Lagos and at the time doctors were on strike. She sent me a message saying \u2018I\u2019m losing blood, pregnant and sick. There\u2019s no one to attend to me. Please help me I don\u2019t want to die.\u2019\u201d Angered, Agoro says she took to her social media and posted about the woman\u2019s predicament. \u201cAfter I posted that, the office of the then First Lady reached me and resolved the issue immediately and the lady was attended to quickly and her tests were done. That was the day I realized the power of what we were doing.\u201d When she started posting her story on Instagram, Agoro initially chose to remain anonymous, to avoid the pressure of public scrutiny. However, as her platform gained traction, she confronted a pivotal moment when her identity was threatened to be exposed. Rather than succumbing to fear, she decided to reveal herself. \u201cI initially didn\u2019t see the need to put my face\u2026 and when the platform became bigger\u2026 I realized that this may not be sustainable. I have ambitions to write a book, to create a company. Then, someone threatened to reveal my identity, so I outed myself and it has been a blessing in disguise, so thank you to the person,\u2019 she joked. Soon after, she launched her DANG Lifestyle and skincare business which has grown largely through word of mouth through the DANG community, Agoro says. \u201cWe started with candles and went into skincare and we haven\u2019t done any campaign at all but have sold over 400,000 units. I owe the trajectory of the DANG lifestyle to the community. But It\u2019s a business that has to leave our comfort zone in Nigeria. Dang Lifestyle is already in the UK, USA, Ghana, and Kenya and we want to take it to more countries,\u201d she said. Despite aiming her message squarely at women, Agoro doesn\u2019t discount a future where men would be integrated into the community. \u201cI now get men commenting and saying to me, \u2018We are DANG men too, include us in the conversation.\u2019 We are happy to have them in the conversation. I can see that some of them want to learn and do better. I believe we have to tell them kindly and gracefully what we want or we don\u2019t get the change we want,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/africa/from-anonymity-to-empowerment-the-journey-of-diary-of-a-naija-girl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_africa_prince-harry-meghan-nigerian-visit-intl-scli", "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex landed in Nigeria on Friday, launching a three-day private visit to the West African nation, where they will meet with wounded soldiers and visit local charities, officials said. The Sussexes are visiting the country as it\u2019s now a \u201cpart of the Invictus community,\u201d Air Vice-Marshal Abidemi Marquis, director of sports for the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, said during a media briefing Thursday. Their first engagement was an event hosted at a school in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, where Meghan told students: \u201cI see myself in all of you.\u201d Outside the Lightway Academy, students lined up patiently to welcome the royal couple, alongside a troupe of dancers. They were there to kick off a two-day mental health summit run by the GEANCO Foundation, which supports girls and young women across the country with menstrual health products and education. \u201cWe\u2019re so honored to be with you. We have got to acknowledge those amazing dance moves! My husband was excited to jump up!\u201d Meghan told cheering students in the school\u2019s hall. Harry then jumped into the conversation, asking the children about their knowledge of mental health and reminding them to look after themselves and each other. \u201cWill you promise to us that after today, no more being scared, no more being unsure of mental health. If you are unsure, then ask. Ask your teachers. Ask your friends. Be there for one another,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see your friend in your class not smiling, what are you gonna do? You gonna check in with them? Are you gonna ask him if they\u2019re okay? \u2018cause it\u2019s okay not to be okay.\u201d As they were leaving, the couple were given a traditional wooden mask and a set of books about Nigerian heritage. \u201cI need to read these now,\u201d the duchess added. Prince Harry and Meghan were invited to Nigeria by the chief of defense staff, Christopher Musa, the country\u2019s highest-ranking military official. He formally welcomed them to Nigeria at a meeting Friday lunchtime at the defense headquarters in the heart of Abuja. The duke expressed gratitude to their hosts, commending Nigeria for recognizing the power of sport in the rehabilitation process for the injured or wounded. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first country to notice that it not only transforms lives but saves lives. I\u2019m eternally grateful to you all of you for joining the Invictus movement for Nigeria and for every single soul who\u2019s been injured protecting the freedoms of Nigeria,\u201d he said. Marquis said the duchess was keen to accompany her husband on the visit \u201cas part of her lineage and heritage.\u201d Meghan revealed in 2022 that she discovered she was 43% Nigerian from a genealogy test. The trip to Nigeria sparked a wave of excitement among the public when it was announced two weeks ago. Oyeyemi Aderibigbe, 38, a Lagos-based lawyer, told CNN, \u201cI have watched Harry\u2019s evolution and quest for personal expression\u2026 and I love how bold he is about living authentically. Meghan was my favorite character in the \u2018Suits\u2019 series. I love how she has spent so much time using her voice for good, openly sharing her experiences.\u201d \u201cTogether, they are using their influence to democratize opportunity and push causes for the advantage of underrepresented groups. I would love to see them at an event with young people in politics in Nigeria,\u201d she added. Entrepreneur Ife Durosinmi-Etti spoke of her joy that Meghan was \u201ccoming to a place that she\u2019s absolutely loved and welcomed.\u201d \u201cIt got me all giddy when I found out about her Nigerian heritage because Nigerian women are smart, resilient, multitalented, they go after what they want and that\u2019s exactly how I see her, so when I heard; I was like, \u2018Yup, that\u2019s it, it\u2019s the Nigerian Spirit in her,\u2019\u201d the 35-year-old said. A packed itinerary This is the Sussexes\u2019 first trip as a couple to Nigeria, where they will be heavily promoting Invictus as well as the themes of mental health and female empowerment.  Harry flew to Abuja after a quick visit to London, where he attended events marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games, a Paralympics-style event for wounded, injured and sick military personnel and veterans. Meghan flew in from Los Angeles, and together, they are following a busy schedule, which includes visiting a military rehabilitation center and local organizations dedicated to supporting veterans\u2019 welfare. On Saturday, the duke is also scheduled to join wounded veterans during a sitting volleyball game and later, his wife is expected to co-host a women\u2019s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director-general of the World Trade Organization. As it has been described as a private visit, the royal couple will not be meeting with Nigeria\u2019s president, Bola Tinubu. However, they will meet with the governors of Lagos and Kaduna State. The UK\u2019s high commissioner to Nigeria, Richard Montgomery, told local media that there wouldn\u2019t be a meeting with the Nigerian leader because \u201cthey are visiting in a private capacity, not an official one.\u201d Profound challenges Nigeria\u2019s military personnel face profound challenges, particularly as the country has been combating the Boko Haram insurgency since 2009. On Friday, Musa told the couple more about some of the issues \u2013 like terrorism and criminality \u2013 that the armed forces contend with, adding that IEDs present \u201cthe greatest challenge\u201d for them. In response, the duke shared that he was looking forward to visiting a hospital supporting military personnel in Kaduna, a city in the north of the country. The couple\u2019s hosts, the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, are eager to be involved further in the Invictus Games and to be part of the wider Invictus community. Recalling how the most recent games, which were held in Germany last year, saw Nigeria become the first African country to participate, Harry reminisced: \u201cThe team that turned up in D\u00fcsseldorf was small but mighty. They danced their way into the stage. They won medals and danced off the stage. They were the life and soul of those games. Our goal now is to help you grow that team and provide as much opportunity and resource here in Nigeria and for the games that are coming at the beginning of next year.\u201d Marquis said taking part in the Invictus Games recovery program has boosted the morale of Nigerian soldiers and Nigeria has expressed interest in hosting the games, which take place every two years. He added: \u201cEighty percent of our soldiers involved in these recovery programs have a better outlook in life and say it has given them the opportunity to improve their self-esteem and mental health.\u201d Cpl. Effiom Antigha, captain of Team Nigeria, told CNN last year that the games gave him a new lease on life. \u201cBefore now, I didn\u2019t think I could engage myself in any of these sporting activities. The Invictus Foundation has helped develop me physically and mentally.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/africa/prince-harry-meghan-nigerian-visit-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_americas_haiti-mss-unodc-guns-drugs-intl-latam", "text": "On the rare days that the hills surrounding Port-au-Prince fall silent, people notice. \u201cIf you can\u2019t hear shooting somewhere, the gangs are probably running low on ammunition,\u201d a police source in the\u00a0Haitian capital told CNN. \u201cBut when there\u2019s a lot of shooting, they\u2019ve definitely received a fresh shipment.\u201d For over two months, Port-au-Prince has been cut off from the world, its international seaport and airport shuttered following an explosion of gang attacks in late February. All major roads are blocked by gang checkpoints. For most people living here, there is no way out \u2013 and no way to bring in desperately needed food and medicine. Encircling the Caribbean nation is another closed perimeter, this one created by\u00a0Haiti\u2019s neighbors. The Dominican Republic has sealed the island\u2019s shared border and airspace. The Bahamas has launched\u00a0a naval blockade\u00a0to keep\u00a0Haitians from fleeing the crisis by boat; the UK has\u00a0sent a warship\u00a0to ward off anyone seeking refuge in Turks and Caicos, a British overseas territory; and the US state of Florida has\u00a0increased marine and aviation patrols. And yet guns, bullets and drugs keep pouring in, crossing international waters and airspace to reach the embattled country \u2013 most of the firepower originating from the US. \u201cHaiti\u00a0doesn\u2019t produce guns and ammunition, yet the gang members don\u2019t seem to have any trouble accessing those things,\u201d says Pierre Esperance, executive director of\u00a0Haiti\u2019s National Human Rights Defense Network. Since the start of the year, thousands of people have been killed in gang-related violence and hundreds kidnapped, including at least 21 children, UN figures show. Stopping the flow of guns to\u00a0Haiti\u00a0would likely have an immediate impact on the bloodshed, according to police and human rights experts. \u201cWe have to cut the gangs\u2019 weapons supply lines. This is absolutely the most important thing now,\u201d the police source told CNN. \u201cBecause when they don\u2019t have bullets, their machine guns become nothing more than clubs.\u201d And as a Kenyan-led multinational security support force (MSS) prepares to deploy to\u00a0Haiti, starving the gangs of ammunition should be a top priority for the US, says William O\u2019Neill, the UN Designated Expert of the High Commissioner on the situation of Human Rights in Haiti. \u201cAll of these countries that are contributing their young men and women (to the MSS), how can we make it safer for them to do their job? One way the US could help immediately and directly would be to really seriously crack down on the flow of illegal weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gangs have literally nothing else; their only currency is intimidation and fear.\u201d Defying a global arms embargo Eighteen months ago, the UN Security Council imposed\u00a0an arms embargo on\u00a0Haiti, which bans the export of weapons to anyone in the country other than the government. The US has also taken independent steps to crack down on illicit exports, appointing a regional coordinator for firearms prosecution in the Caribbean and a\u00a0special unit\u00a0to investigate transnational crimes in\u00a0Haiti. Yet the guns keep coming. In January, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) warned that\u00a0Haiti-bound firearms and ammunition were being \u201croutinely incorporated into outbound shipments at warehouses near seaports and airports\u201d in Florida, citing interviews with US customs officials. The following month,\u00a0Haiti\u2019s gangs put their weapons to devastating use, taking the country hostage in an explosion of coordinated violence that forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign, and led to the creation of a transitional governing council that has so far been mired in disagreement. \u201cThe planes have not stopped flying. There continue to be exchanges of both ammunition and arms across the border,\u201d Sylvie Bertrand, the UNODC regional representative, told CNN recently, urging the global community to enforce the arms embargo. But amid today\u2019s chaos, experts say it is likely becoming easier than ever for the gangs to resupply, as they now control major routes and infrastructure to bypass official controls. \u201cThere are always weapons coming in. There are always bullets,\u201d Vitel\u2019homme Innocent, leader of the Kraze Bary\u00e9 gang, told CNN in April, his masked entourage bristling with a globally manufactured assortment of firepower. Weapons experts who later analyzed some of CNN\u2019s images from the encounter said they could spot weapons and accessory parts originating from Israel, Turkey, the Czech Republic, probably Brazil \u2013 and, overwhelmingly, from the United States. An \u2018iron river\u2019 from the United States The guns\u00a0Haiti\u2019s gangs wield are a mix of stolen and smuggled, and the United States is by far the main source of the latter, according to UN experts. From 2020 to 2022, over 80% of the weapons seized in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0and submitted to US authorities for tracing were manufactured in or imported from the United States,\u00a0UNODC\u00a0reported in January,\u00a0citing the most-recent available tracing data. \u00a0They are typically purchased in the US from federally licensed retail outlets, gun shows or pawn shops through \u201cstraw man\u201d intermediaries, the agency also found. It\u2019s all part of a phenomenon that experts in Latin America and the Caribbean call the \u201ciron river\u201d \u2013 a flood of guns bought in US states with lax gun laws, and then shipped across the region to criminal groups. The Mexican government, which has been outspoken about the issue, currently has a $10 billion lawsuit pending against several US gun manufacturers whose products, it says, arm powerful cartels. A senior agent at the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which investigates the diversion of lawfully purchased guns to illegal ends, told CNN that Miami is a significant source of weapons sent to\u00a0Haiti, which have historically been trafficked in small freighters by family networks. \u201cThose are difficult to enforce because they\u2019re not your typical commercial freighter\u2026 it\u2019s relatively easy to conceal a small number of firearms in those shipments,\u201d he said. Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia are also sources of weapons trafficked to the Caribbean, where the ATF has a specialized gun intelligence unit to track and stop such flows, he added. Asked whether the US was doing enough, he emphasized that combatting gun trafficking was a top priority. \u201cIt is a very high priority of the United States government and ATF\u2019s role in that, to stem the flow of illegal firearms, whether domestic or international, and particularly places like\u00a0Haiti\u00a0where the rule of law is under extreme threat.\u201d In January, Joly Germine \u2013 leader of the gang 400 Mawozo \u2013 pleaded guilty to\u00a0US charges over a gunrunning scheme\u00a0that saw dozens of rifles, handguns and a shotgun purchased legally in Florida under false pretenses, and smuggled into\u00a0Haiti. Land of mountains From above, traces of Haiti\u2019s extensive smuggling networks come into focus: the scars of a clandestine airstrip in its sun-bleached Central Plateau, a dock jutting from gang-held territory into the still waters of the Gulf of Gonave. Sea and air are the main means of transport for the guns and the drugs trans-shipments that fund more weapons purchases, experts say. And while\u00a0Haitian authorities have seen some successes in seizing illicit cargo over the years, the dramatic peaks and plains of this \u201cland of mountains\u201d add difficulty for an already understaffed police force and customs agency. Haiti\u2019s secluded and sparsely populated rural areas are ideal for landings and take-offs by small planes aiming to avoid observation. There are at least 11 known informal or clandestine airstrips in the country, according to UNODC, many originally built for humanitarian purposes following the country\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake. \u201cHere, you don\u2019t have anything around you. So, you just go, probably in the middle of the night, with a couple vehicles parked on each side of the improvised runway so the pilot can identify the area. They land, drop off or pick up stuff, and take off again all outside of\u00a0Haitian jurisdiction,\u201d a\u00a0security expert in Port-au-Prince told CNN. The sea is the preferred option for arms smugglers given the weight of their cargo.\u00a0Haiti\u2019s roughly horseshoe shape offers\u00a0over 1,100 miles of coastline, a challenging distance to comprehensively patrol for\u00a0Haiti\u2019s coast guard. Haiti\u2019s south in particular has emerged as a strategic location for smugglers, the UNODC reported in April, offering entry points for cocaine from South America, cannabis from Jamaica and firearms from across the region. \u201cOne popular method of moving illegal products involves \u201cbanana boats,\u201d go-fast vessels that arrive at night, beach on coastal banana plantations, and are subsequently destroyed after unloading their cargo,\u201d the UNODC report details. Guns and ammunition that arrive in the south are frequently sent onward to Port-au-Prince via the gang-controlled Route National 3, it also said, identifying the Mariani gang, Grand Ravine gang, and 5 Segond gang as \u201cmajor players in the organization and distribution of arms, munitions and drugs.\u201d In 2022, 5 Segond group attacked\u00a0Haiti\u2019s largest flour mill. It would have been an incongruous target if not for its location, positioned right next to Port-au-Prince Bay with a large jetty to accept deliveries. Just about a mile inland lies a major highway, and in between the two is a massive warehouse; a perfect distribution set-up for any import entrepreneur. Today, the entire area is controlled by 5 Segond, with security sources telling CNN that they believe the mill has been taken over and no longer functions. \u201cIzo has the jetty, so he has access to the sea. And boats keep coming in and out of that area, which again is completely controlled by his gang\u2026 and is kept under tight control, with barricades in the surroundings,\u201d the same security expert said, referring to 5 Segond\u2019s rapper frontman\u00a0Andre Johnson, who often posts videos of gang members flashing guns and paramilitary gear set to music on social media. Containers and corruption Contraband arriving via secretive small boats and planes is just part of the picture. Last month,\u00a0Haitian National Police and Customs agents seized\u00a0more than two dozen firearms, including 12 assault rifles, and nearly a thousand cartridges\u00a0from a shipping container that had arrived\u00a0in Haiti\u2019s northern city of Cap\u00a0Haitien. Drugs and arms smuggling has a long history in\u00a0Haiti, much of it facilitated through official channels by government agents and even, in one 2022 case, by a rogue Episcopal church staffer who allegedly hid guns and thousands of rounds in a shipping container reportedly labeled as church donations, before it was seized by customs agents in Port-au-Prince. Customs officials\u00a0trying to do their job\u00a0on the front lines in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0can face threats to their lives. In 2018, local press reported that several customs agents at the Malpasse border crossing between the Dominican Republic and\u00a0Haiti\u00a0were burned alive after an argument erupted in the course of a cargo inspection. Allegations of smuggling and gang affiliations have also been made at the highest levels of\u00a0Haiti\u2019s government. Four former\u00a0Haitian senators\u00a0have been sanctioned by the US for alleged drug trafficking, as have multiple past presidents and prime ministers of\u00a0Haiti\u00a0for allegedly financing the country\u2019s gangs. They\u2019re part of what gang leader Innocent refers to as the country\u2019s \u201coligarchs,\u201d who historically created and armed local gangs to become their enforcers-for-hire as they profited from white-collar crime schemes. \u201cAs a\u00a0Haitian human rights defender, I can\u2019t say that all the responsibility for these guns is on the US \u2013 I think it\u2019s the\u00a0Haitian government too. They need to regain control of the port, they need to control customs. The problem is corruption,\u201d says Esperance, the human rights advocate. That\u2019s why, he says, the planned deployment of an international police force to restore calm to\u00a0Haiti\u00a0is destined to fail unless the US and global community also commit to fighting corruption, building frameworks for good governance, and closing legal loopholes abused by the country\u2019s elite. \u201cNow, of course, the government is completely destabilized, it\u2019s easy for the gangs to smuggle weapons themselves. But how did they begin? Just two years ago, smuggling was going through official channels, and it happened that way because everyone was corrupt,\u201d Esperance said. Bertrand, the UNODC representative, also emphasized the importance of building up\u00a0Haiti\u2019s institutions as its new government takes shape. Her agency is working to strengthen the country\u2019s customs authority and coast guard, for example, including providing much-needed equipment from protective gear to cargo scanners. \u201cIt\u2019s time for people in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0to live peacefully \u2013 for their kids to go back to school, for them to be able to eat every day.\u201d And that means, she says, ensuring that \u201cnational authorities are well-trained, well-equipped, and ready to face and curb down the level of violence.\u201d CNN reached out to Homeland Security Investigations, part of the US Department of Homeland Security; the US Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement, Haiti\u2019s National Police and Haiti\u2019s General Customs Administration for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/americas/haiti-mss-unodc-guns-drugs-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_style_kate-medley-photography-gas-stations-american-south", "text": "Two decades ago, when the photojournalist Kate Medley was in graduate school in Oxford, Mississippi, she would often frequent a local gas station with an off-menu offering: Tupperware containers full of home-cooked Indian food, made by the owners, for whomever knew to ask. Though it would be years before she began a long-term series on the gas stations and roadside stops of the American South, Medley\u2019s pit stops intrigued her; she grew to recognize the spaces as vital foodways in both urban and rural areas. Though many provide simple goods and services \u2014 like coffee, hot dogs or an oversized bathroom key \u2014 others offer diverse, unexpected offerings: crawfish etouff\u00e9e, tamales, Cajun-style b\u00e1nh m\u00ec, all-you-can-eat barbecue, or even an entire country ham to purchase along with your cigarettes. Often overlooked because of their perceived liminal nature, these quick stops can be lifelines for the communities they serve, Medley pointed out, as well as opportunities for people to strive for the so-called American Dream. (In 2013, the Fiscal Policy Institute reported that 61% of all fueling stations in the US are independently owned by immigrants.) \u201cIncreasingly, as I traveled, I felt like there was this big gap in scholarship that did not take seriously the role that these spaces play,\u201d Medley explained in a phone call. \u201cAnd I found it super compelling \u2014 the people who work there, the food that they\u2019re cooking and the community they\u2019re creating. I see as integral to who we are as Southerners and what this region has to offer.\u201d Now, \u201cThank You Please Come Again\u201d is both a photo book of 200 images, published late last year, and the subject of Medley\u2019s first museum exhibition at the Mississippi Museum of Art in Jackson, where she grew up. Scouting across the South For a decade, Medley took the images while on the road, at first on the side when she was on assignment, then as her main focus as the project progressed. She visited around 150 gas stations and quick stops in total, finding the unique curation of each space compelling. \u201cThere\u2019s this sort of mystery of these spaces,\u201d she said. \u201cAs you approach them, you open that little glass door and hear the bell jingle. What will be inside? What will it smell like? Who will be there? What\u2019s on the menu that day?\u201d These hidden gems include Saint Louis Saveurs in Greensboro, North Carolina, an outpost for Senegalese food in the back of a Circle K that serves up jollof rice and the grilled lamb dish dibi. The modest restaurant used to be a Dunkin Donuts, Medley noted \u2014 the door handle was still a \u201cD\u201d when she photographed the space. Then there\u2019s the Hammond, Louisana-based Icebox \u2014 a Punjabi dhaba, or gas station-adjacent foodery, that stripped out its convenience-store goods in favor of a full Indian buffet. The owners positioned Icebox at the intersection of two interstates in order to serve long-haul truckers, Medley learned after speaking with them \u2014 particularly those recruited from India, she explained. \u201cThey have found tremendous success,\u201d she said. \u201cBut actually, when I was there, they were telling me that their new business plan is to rip out the dhaba and return that to a convenience store. They\u2019re going to move the dhaba to a standalone restaurant building, because they decided that rich people will never eat in a gas station.\u201d Changing landscapes For every success story, there are businesses struggling \u2014 a lot of them, Medley noted, particularly in rural areas where the population has declined. In one station in Elaine, Arkansas, she said, the gas pumps have been discontinued and the grocery shelves are bare; a local farmer bought the space purely to offer hot food options to local farmworkers hot food each day, who bring in consistent revenue. \u201cThe closest gas is 30 miles away,\u201d Amanda Simonson, the general manager, told Medley when she walked in, according to Medley\u2019s book. \u201cBut I can offer you smothered pork chops.\u201d In Banner, Mississippi, the owner of Pop\u2019s gas station explained to Medley just how important his business was to nearby residents, pointing out a local customer who was there for the lunch plate. \u201cSince his wife died last year, he eats at Pop\u2019s for breakfast, lunch, and dinner,\u201d the owner, Jeff Poynor, told her. One of the advantages of these small businesses is their adaptability, Medley argued. Though not all have been able to stay in business over the years, she\u2019s found that many others have transformed. Gone are the Slim Jims and Red Bulls \u2014 instead you might find a little nightclub, or a ham-curing enterprise that ships out around the country. (She\u2019s seen both.) \u201cI feel optimistic that they\u2019re continuing to pop up,\u201d she said of the stores. \u201cI don\u2019t think these places are going away\u2026 What that\u2019ll look like, in 50 years with electric vehicles or self-driving cars or whatever\u2019s next \u2014 I\u2019m not sure.\u201d \u201cBut I feel confident it will be something,\u201d she added, \u201cthat these buildings will persist, and that entrepreneurs will persist in finding a way to make them work.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/style/kate-medley-photography-gas-stations-american-south/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_europe_russia-kharkiv-region-offensive-ukraine-intl", "text": "Ukraine\u2019s top general says the situation in the northern\u00a0Kharkiv region\u00a0has \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d after Russia claimed to have captured four further villages as it expanded its surprise cross-border offensive. A Ukrainian regional official insisted Russia\u2019s progress was not yet \u201csignificant\u201d but admitted ground fighting in the area was spreading. Meanwhile, speaking on British television, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron acknowledged it was an \u201cextremely dangerous moment,\u201d adding that Russia had effectively \u201cinvaded [Ukraine] again.\u201d The precise goal of Russia\u2019s new push \u2013 which began in the early hours of Friday morning \u2013 is unclear. It may be to create a buffer zone designed to reduce Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, or possibly even a renewed assault on the city of Kharkiv, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south. Equally, it could be an attempt to draw Ukrainian forces away from other key Russian objectives further south \u2013 which was the rationale Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered in his Sunday evening address. \u201cThe idea behind the attacks in Kharkiv region is to stretch our forces and undermine morale and the motivational foundations of Ukrainians\u2019 ability to defend ourselves,\u201d he said. According to information from the Defense Ministry in Moscow, Russia now claims control over nine Ukrainian border villages, which are clustered in two areas, now just a few dozen kilometers apart, to the northeast of Kharkiv city. A Ukrainian military blogger, Myroshnykov, said Sunday afternoon that Russian troops had now pushed south and entered the town of Vovchansk, though the pace of advance there had slowed in the face of Ukraine\u2019s defending forces. Myroshnykov went on to predict an attempt by Russia to make its numerical advantage count and throw large numbers of infantry soldiers into the battle. \u201cThey will try to seize the area with a lot of cannon fodder,\u201d he wrote on his Telegram channel, referencing previous Russian offensives which reports suggest have resulted in many Russian troops killed. A Ukrainian military spokesman later denied reports Russian forces were inside Vovchansk, saying Ukraine\u2019s armed forces had succeeded in keeping them at bay. Ahead of any stepped-up Russian actions, Ukrainian officials have been evacuating hundreds of local residents to safety. An idea of the destruction being wrought on the town and surrounding villages came from regional Ukrainian leader, Oleh Syniehubov, who said Saturday that Russia had dropped more than 20 huge glide bombs on the area in under two days. These bombs have a minimum weight of 250 kgs, but can go up to 1,500 kgs, and are among the most destructive mass-produced devices currently used by Russia in the war. They have previously been used as a precursor to a major attempt to seize ground. Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine\u2019s army chief, told readers of his social media channels on Sunday that defensive operations were ongoing and that battlefield conditions were difficult. \u201cThis week, the situation in Kharkiv Oblast has significantly worsened. Currently, there are ongoing battles in the border areas along the state border with the Russian Federation,\u201d he wrote on Telegram. Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration, insisted control over the border villages was still contested rather than ceded, however the influential DeepStateMap group \u2013 a Ukrainian organisation monitoring developments on the battlefield \u2013 showed seven Ukrainian villages under either full or partial Russian control. So far, Russian gains are not sufficient to put its big artillery pieces within range of Kharkiv city, but residents there admit the situation is frightening. One woman, Anna Ivanova, speaking to Reuters, said: \u201cOf course it is scary, we keep on monitoring the situation, following the news but we remain home and are not planning to go anywhere. All depends on what happens.\u201d Another Kharkiv resident, Olena Pidhirna, said: \u201cDespite all those attacks, air raid alarms, we live normal lives, everyone keeps going out, playing, going to school, enjoying themselves, working. Life goes on, as normal.\u201d It is not just in Ukraine\u2019s north that Kyiv\u2019s armed forces are losing ground. DeepStateMap also shows Russia making further gains in two other key areas, most notably towards the town of Chasiv Yar, which has become an important forward military position, and further south in the industrial town of Krasnohorivka, where Russian troops are now in control of the town\u2019s main facility, a brick factory. Meanwhile, Russian authorities say eight people are known to have died in an explosion in a residential building in Belgorod. CCTV video of the blast shows a huge plume of dark grey smoke emerging from one of the building\u2019s lower floors, before part of the building collapses on itself. Russian television later broadcast video of rescuers at work looking for survivors among the rubble. Russian officials said the blast was caused by a Ukrainian missile attack. And in a separate development, a fire briefly broke out at the\u00a0Volgograd\u00a0oil\u00a0refinery, the largest oil\u00a0refinery\u00a0in southern\u00a0Russia, after a Ukrainian drone attack overnight into Sunday, according to the region\u2019s governor. \u201cOn the night of May 12, air defense and electronic warfare forces repelled a UAV attack on the territory of the\u00a0Volgograd\u00a0region,\u201d Andrey Bocharov said in a post on Telegram. \u201cAs a result of the consequences of a UAV crash with subsequent detonation, a fire broke out at the\u00a0Volgograd\u00a0Refinery\u00a0site,\u201d he said. The fire has been extinguished and there were no casualties, he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/europe/russia-kharkiv-region-offensive-ukraine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_sport_eton-harrow-lords-cricket-spt-intl", "text": "At Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground in the quiet, well-heeled streets of northwest London, different architectural eras collide together in a mishmash of mismatching styles representing the old and the new. A grand 134-year-old pavilion, its sandy brown stone fa\u00e7ade covered in ornate embellishments, sits at one end, staring at a futuristic glass media center across the pitch which balances on white columns and peers like a giant oblong eye over the ground. And never is that collision between the old and new more evident than when Lord\u2019s, the self-styled \u201chome\u201d of cricket and one of its most prestigious grounds, hosts the annual schoolboys fixture Eton vs. Harrow. The fixture \u2013 in which two of England\u2019s most exclusive and expensive boys\u2019 private schools play one another \u2013 is older than the oldest brick at this ground, first played in 1805 before Lord\u2019s was even at its current location. But it has become increasingly controversial and somewhat emblematic of the attempts of British institutions to reconcile their pasts with the present after it was axed from Lord\u2019s schedule by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns the ground, in 2022. That provoked an uproar from its members and the warring factions eventually reached a compromise in which Lord\u2019s would host both the Eton vs. Harrow and Oxford vs.Cambridge fixtures for another five years, as well as the finals of the UK\u2019s school and university cricket competitions, before another consultation with members in 2027. Eton and Harrow both said in separate statements to CNN that it was a \u201chuge privilege\u201d to play at Lord\u2019s again this year and thanked the MCC. For those criticizing the fixture, it is steeped in elitism and serves only to perpetuate stereotypes that cricket is an upper-class sport, one in which public schoolboys play annually on its most hallowed ground where the England Women have never played a Test. \u201cGuaranteeing a tiny number of schoolboys the right to play at Lord\u2019s every year when millions of children are denied that right is completely unacceptable,\u201d said the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket in its 2023 report, which examined inequalities and discrimination within the English game. However, for those attending Friday\u2019s match \u2013 mostly relatives of the schoolboys on the pitch or alumni who have attended this fixture for decades \u2013 it is an important piece of history to preserve, a cherished tradition and another victim of \u201ccancel culture.\u201d \u2018Part of the season\u2019 The Romantic poet Lord Byron played in the inaugural Eton vs. Harrow match more than two centuries ago. Afterwards, he wrote, \u201cWe were most of us very drunk and we went together to the Haymarket Theatre where we kicked up a row, as you may suppose when so many Harrovians and Etonians meet in one place.\u201d On Friday, cheers and chants began from the moment the two teams walked out onto the sun-drenched pitch. \u201cLet\u2019s go, oi, oi, oi!\u201d shouted the Etonians as they rose to their feet from the first ball, shouting, clapping, and even waving their shoes in their air, as is tradition. In another section of the stands, the Harrovians reciprocated with a standing ovation at the first boundary, before the Etonians launched into a rendition of the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d theme song when a player called Jack Sparrow bowled his first over. \u201cThe atmosphere today has been incredible; everyone has been really friendly. I\u2019ve never known such a convivial atmosphere before,\u201d Mark McCullen, who attended Eton and whose son is now at the school, told CNN Sport. There is no qualification procedure for the fixture. Eton and Harrow play at Lord\u2019s because they have played here for 219 years, because they are schools that are held aloft on their centuries-old history and which still churn out a disproportionate number of the British establishment. Twenty of the country\u2019s 45 Prime Ministers, including two of its last five, went to Eton; another seven Prime Ministers went to Harrow. It costs \u00a349,998 ($62,620) per year to attend Eton, and \u00a350,550 ($63,310) to attend Harrow, though both offer bursaries and scholarships for a small number of students. For many spectators, this fixture is an intrinsic part of the schools\u2019 respective histories, a tradition that remains from a time when debutantes making their entrance into upper-class society had to attend it, along with Wimbledon and the Ascot Races. Times may have changed but the tradition remains, making it almost sacrosanct for those who observe it and out-of-touch for those who don\u2019t. \u201cI think it\u2019s rather disappointing that there are a lot of people at the MCC whothink this fixture should be abolished because it\u2019s elitist,\u201d Harry Wells, an OldEtonian who first came to this fixture 57 years ago and is this year supporting hisfriend\u2019s son in the Harrow squad, told CNN. \u201cI think our country is going to sell itself down the river if it abolishes everything we\u2019ve held dear over the millennia.\u201d As late as the 1960s, carriages would pull up outside the ground, depositing families there for one of the biggest events of the \u201cseason,\u201d spectators who had watched those matches recalled. The crowds are smaller now, drawing in less money for the MCC, and around 2,000 to 3,000 people were expected to attend this year. \u201cIt used to be a big social event \u2026 people in top hat and tails. It was quite part of the season as they used to say in those days,\u201d Wells added. \u201cEveryone dresses down now, we\u2019re not so formal in any form of society, though looking here, there are lots of people in jackets and ties.\u201d Despite the May sunshine, almost every man wandered around in their suits, the Eton boys wore their red striped blazers and matching hats, the Harrow boys their navy-blue blazers while women wore flowing dresses or blouses and many carried designer handbags. \u201cI don\u2019t feel a sense of exclusivity at all,\u201d one spectator told CNN, pointing to the \u00a320 ($25) ticket available for people to come and watch. \u201cThe boys work really hard to get here \u2026 You may as well get rid of history because it\u2019s traditional and backward and imperialistic and whatever,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have to learn from the past, and the successes of the past too.\u201d \u2018A turgid image of snobbery\u2019 The question of the Eton vs. Harrow match has become entangled in the wider conversations around cricket presently. The sport \u2013 long associated with the English upper classes \u2013 has been buffeted by accusations of racism, sexism and elitism in the country where it originated while it has millions of fans around the world, considered more popular than any other global sport except soccer. For actor, writer and comedian Stephen Fry, the Eton vs. Harrow match is indicative of an image that English cricket can\u2019t quite shake off, what he described as \u201ca turgid image of snobbery and elitism.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not what cricket is about,\u201d Fry, a former MCC president and longtime cricket fan, told the Times in October 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s the second most popular sport in the world and it needs people to understand what a wonderful game it is, and how it\u2019s available for everybody.\u201d In the end on Friday, Harrow coasted to victory by 91 runs, posting 321-5 before Eton could only respond with 230 all out. And there may not be too many more opportunities for Eton to retaliate. \u201cTimes change. And the world is so far removed from that world now,\u201d Mark Nicholas, the current MCC president, told the Telegraph in October. \u201cCommon sense will prevail over the next four years within this compromise\u2026 I can see it moving on from here now very naturally.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/sport/eton-harrow-lords-cricket-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_tech_us-export-licenses-china-huawei-hnk-intl", "text": "The United States has revoked licenses that allowed companies including Intel\u00a0and Qualcomm to ship chips used for laptops and handsets to sanctioned Chinese telecoms equipment maker\u00a0Huawei\u00a0Technologies, three people familiar with the matter said. A fourth person said some of the companies were notified on Tuesday that their licenses were revoked effective immediately. The U.S. Commerce Department earlier in the day confirmed it had revoked some licenses but stopped short of naming the companies. A spokesperson for Intel (INTC) declined to comment. Qualcomm (QCOM) did not respond to a request for comment, and\u00a0Huawei\u00a0did not immediately respond. The move comes after the release last month of\u00a0Huawei\u2019s first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro powered by Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra 9 processor. The laptop launch drew fire from Republican lawmakers, who said it suggested to them that the Commerce Department had given the green light to Intel to sell the chip to\u00a0Huawei. \u201cWe have revoked certain licenses for exports to\u00a0Huawei,\u201d the Commerce Department said in a statement, declining to specify which ones it had withdrawn. The Commerce Department\u2019s move, first reported by Reuters, comes after concerted pressure by Republican China hawks in Congress who have been urging the Biden administration to take tougher action to thwart\u00a0Huawei. \u201cThis action will bolster US national security, protect American ingenuity, and diminish Communist China\u2019s ability to advance its technology,\u201d Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik said in a statement. The move could hurt\u00a0Huawei,\u00a0which still relies on Intel chips to power its laptops, and could hurt US suppliers that do business with the company. Intel has also been facing weak demand for its traditional data center and PC chips. Last month, it lost $11 billion in stock market value after forecasting second-quarter revenue and profit\u00a0below market estimates. Licenses needed Huawei\u00a0was placed on a US trade restriction list in 2019 amid fears it could spy on Americans, part of a broader effort to handicap China\u2019s ability to bolster its military. Being added to the list means the company\u2019s suppliers have to seek a special, difficult-to-obtain license before shipping. Even so, suppliers to\u00a0Huawei\u00a0have received licenses\u00a0worth billions of dollars to sell goods and technology to the company, including one\u00a0particularly controversial authorization issued by the Trump administration, which has allowed Intel to ship central processors to\u00a0Huawei\u00a0for use in its laptops since 2020. Qualcomm has sold older 4G chips to handset makers since receiving a license from US officials in 2020. In a regulatory filing earlier this month, Qualcomm said it did not expect to receive more chip revenue from\u00a0Huawei\u00a0beyond this year. However, Qualcomm still licenses its portfolio of 5G technologies to\u00a0Huawei, which last year began using a 5G chip designed by its HiSilicon unit that most analysts believe is manufactured in violation of US sanctions. Qualcomm said in the filing this month that its patent deal with\u00a0Huawei\u00a0expires early in Qualcomm\u2019s fiscal 2025 and that it has started negotiations to renew the deal. Critics argue such licenses have contributed to the company\u2019s resurgence. Huawei shocked the industry last August with a new phone powered by a sophisticated chip manufactured by Chinese chipmaker SMIC, despite US export restrictions on both companies. The phone helped\u00a0Huawei\u00a0smartphone sales spike 64% year on year in the first six weeks of 2024, according to research firm Counterpoint. Its smart car component business has also contributed to\u00a0Huawei\u2019s resurgence, with the company notching its fastest revenue growth in four years in 2023.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/tech/us-export-licenses-china-huawei-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

The provinces of\u00a0Badakhshan, Ghor, Baghlan, and Herat have all experienced heavy flooding, which has also damaged nearly 2,000 homes, a communications officer from UN agency the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a statement a day earlier. \u201cFlash floods ravage Afghanistan, killing more than 300 people in Baghlan and destroying more than 1000 houses,\u201d the WFP said in a post on X. \u201cThis has been one of many floods over the last few weeks, due to unusually heavy rainfall. WFP is now distributing fortified biscuits to the survivors.\u201d The International Rescue Committee (IRC), which is preparing its emergency response to the flooding that spans seven provinces, said \u201cthousands\u201d of people have been stranded without access to services. \u201cThese latest floods have caused a major humanitarian emergency in Afghanistan, which is still reeling from a string of earthquakes at the beginning of this year as well as severe flooding in March,\u201d said IRC Afghanistan director Salma Ben Aissa. \u201cCommunities have lost entire families, while livelihoods have been decimated as a result,\u201d she said. More than half of the 600,000 people affected by the floods are children, Save the Children reported\u00a0in a statement, adding that it is sending a \u201ca \u2018clinic on wheels\u2019 with mobile health and child protection teams to support children and their families.\u201d On Saturday, video captured by news agency Reuters showed mourners burying the dead in Baghlan province. One man named Gulbudeen described losing several family members in the floods. \u201cI lost five members of my family, two sons, two daughters, and their mother as a result of these devastating flash floods, we were standing on the other side of the flood, but we could not help them, and eventually the flood took the lives of our loved ones,\u201d he recounted. Residents in the village of Laqayi, also in Baghlan, tried to clean up the rivers of mud outside their homes on Saturday, video filmed by news agency AFP showed. Villagers could be seen wading through the deep pools of mud that appeared to have wrought extensive damage to dwellings. The ruling Taliban acknowledged the \u201cgrievous toll\u201d caused by the flooding in a statement posted Saturday on X by spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid. \u201cRegrettably, hundreds of our fellow citizens have succumbed to these calamitous floods, while a substantial number have sustained injuries. Moreover, the deluge has wrought extensive devastation upon residential properties, resulting in significant financial losses,\u201d Mujahid said. The Taliban has tasked its interior ministry, the ministry of disaster management and local officials to \u201cuse all available resources\u201d to rescue the stranded, retrieve dead bodies and provide medical treatment to the injured, Mujahid added. The flash floods add to a string of recent natural disasters that the region has had to endure. In April, unseasonal rainfall and floods killed more than 100 people in Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to authorities. More than 600 animals also died. Flash floods also swept away dozens in Afghanistan in July, less than three months before thousands were killed by a powerful 6.3 magnitude earthquake that struck the western part of the country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/asia/flash-floods-kill-hundreds-afghanistan-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Spanish prosecutors are seeking a prison term of one year and 18 months respectively for the offenses, or a total of two years and six months.

Prince Harry arrived on Tuesday afternoon ahead of events and meetings related to the biennial sporting competition he founded a decade ago. \ufeffHuge cheers erupted from crowds gathered along police barriers in the spring sunshine outside St Paul\u2019s as the duke arrived. After waving to well-wishers, he was greeted at the cathedral\u2019s door by the Dean of St. Paul\u2019s before being escorted to his seat at the front of the congregation. Actor Damian Lewis recited the Invictus poem by William Ernest Henley at the service, and the Duke later delivered a reading from I Corinthians 12. 4-11. Harry was expected to attend a reception following the one-hour service. He was supported at the event by members from his late mother Princess Diana\u2019s side of the family. Earl Charles Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes sat directly behind their nephew, with Harry chatting with his aunt before the event got underway. A few miles away, the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season was taking place, hosted by the King and Queen. They were joined by several senior royals including Princess Anne and the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. The fifth in line to the British throne will not be catching up with his father during the visit home, however, due to \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s full program,\u201d according to his spokesperson. \u201cThe Duke of course is understanding of his father\u2019s diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon,\u201d the spokesperson added. Buckingham Palace has not commented on the duke\u2019s visit. Harry has had a difficult relationship with his wider family since he and his wife, Meghan, stepped back from royal duties and moved to the United States in 2020. He is also not expected to meet his brother, Prince William, during the visit. Harry, 39, does not appear to have been accompanied by the Duchess of Sussex for his visit to the UK. Their son, Prince Archie, turned five on Monday. The last time the duke was back in his home country was in February on a fleeting visit after his father\u2019s\u00a0cancer diagnosis\u00a0was announced. Charles is continuing with treatment for an undisclosed cancer but he returned to public duties last week after his doctors said they were \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by his progress. The past few months have been a tumultuous period for Britain\u2019s royal family. Harry\u2019s sister-in-law, Catherine, Princess of Wales, revealed her own cancer battle in March and has asked for privacy while she undergoes treatment. The inaugural Invictus Games, an international sporting competition for wounded veterans and members of the military, was held in London in 2014. Following the Invictus celebrations in London, Harry and Meghan will head to Nigeria at the invitation of the Nigerian Defence Headquarters. Nigeria became\u00a0Africa\u2019s first participant\u00a0in the games last year. The next Invictus Games will be held in Vancouver and Whistler in Canada in February 2025. More than 500 competitors from over 20 nations will compete in adaptive sports such as indoor rowing, sitting volleyball, swimming, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball. Last week, the cities of Birmingham in the UK and Washington, DC in the US were announced as the shortlist to host the event in 2027.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/uk/prince-harry-king-charles-invictus-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_tech_roblox-earnings-2024", "text": "Roblox shares slid more than 20% in early trading, as the gaming giant dialed back its forecasts for growth and first-quarter earnings showed player spending is slowing. Average daily active users (DAUs) were 77.7 million, up 17% year-over-year. But analysts said Roblox needs to prove to Wall Street there\u2019s new sources of revenue growth, up ahead. Its devoted fan base is mostly teens, so the company is taking aggressive steps to attract both younger and older players. \u201cOur teams have been hard at work identifying opportunities to drive DAUs, hours, and bookings growth rates back to 20% year-over-year, said\u00a0David Baszucki, founder and CEO of\u00a0Roblox, in a statement. \u201cBased on results since the middle of April, we believe that these steps are yielding positive results.\u201d In mid-morning trading shares stand at about $23. The stock had shuffled between $25 and $45 for many months after hitting a peak, just above $130 in 2021, the year the company went public. \u201cThe company has faced high operational costs and it needs to sustain rapid growth at the same time,\u201d said Matilda Beinat, an AR/VR analyst at tech intelligence firm ABI Research. \u201cInvestors have wondered if that can be feasible.\u201d Still, some analysts and investors remain moderately optimistic. Here are three reasons why. New revenue streams Roblox has evolved since its 2006 launch and so has its growth strategy. The platform allows users to both play user-created games and create their own games and it also blends elements of a social media network, so people can make friends and talk to developers as they explore virtual worlds. Last year, its Baszucki shared visions of Roblox becoming a place where people can date and form \u201creal-life relationships\u201d within the next five years. In February, the company said 19.7 million new \u201cfriendships\u201d are formed every day on the site. The company\u2019s vision has long been for Roblox to be everywhere, and in many ways, it\u2019s succeeding. The platform\u2019s active daily users are using the platform for an average of 2.5 hours a day \u2013 and those numbers continue to grow. About half of US youth, ages 12 to 17, use Roblox in the US monthly; and it continues to experience growth overseas, especially in Asia. Its biggest hits include Adopt me! (a pet simulator), Brookhaven RP (a functioning virtual town) and Tower of Hell. Although many of the games are geared toward teens, the company seeks to grow and monetize the number of older players. Just last week, the company announced it will show immersive video ads to players over the age of 13. Roblox\u2019s stock price has moved up a bit since that announcement. A new developer subscription offer allows developers to create monetary subscriptions to unlock certain experiences, a feature some analysts expect could help the platform grow even more among other generations. Brand interest and risks Brands have growing interest in Roblox, too. The company said it experienced the strongest brand engagements on its platforms during the fourth quarter of 2023, with more than 300 brand activations on the site including those from Ralph Lauren, Nike, Crocs and Lego. Walmart has even joined the Roblox metaverse, adding an experience that allows users to buy physical items and receive them in the mail. Although more brand involvement will likely continue this year, the company will need to ensure users don\u2019t suffer from ad fatigue, according to Mike Proulx, a research director at market research firm Forrester. \u201cAs the company doubles down on advertising as a way to lure in more brands, it needs to balance what might be seen as \u2018easy revenue\u2019 with user experience,\u201d he said. \u201cToo many ads risk user backlash. Brands that want to effectively reach Roblox\u2019s young user base should prioritize creating a value exchange. Programmatic ads alone won\u2019t cut it,\u201d Proulx said. Good timing Roblox\u2019s user growth and emergence as a public company possibly aligns with budding interest in two buzzy industries: artificial intelligence and extended reality (XR), a term that covers virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality. In February, Roblox introduced an AI chatbot that allows users to communicate with each other in real time, regardless of what language they speak. The tool works in 16 languages. The company also previously shared its vision for the expansion of AI on the platform with tools that will \u201cenable every user to become a creator.\u201d At the same time, major tech companies continue to invest in XR, with increased interest due in part to the launch of Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset. The metaverse is attracting renewed interest. \u201cWe can already start to see the performance of the company going up with these new strategy implementations, and I do believe that with the right advertising and the right timings, Roblox will soon be the communication and collaboration platform it is striving to be,\u201d Beinat said. Facing rivals But Roblox also faces challenges from its chief competitor, Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite, and that platform\u2019s Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), a tool that enables creators to build experiences and publish them directly into Fortnite. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely pushing hard to eat Roblox\u2019s lunch, even though the Fortnite player base tends to be older,\u201d said Lewis Ward, director of gaming at market research firm IDC. Epic has also been taking steps to creep in on Roblox\u2019s core user base. In February, the publisher announced it is teaming up with Disney to create open games and entertainment connected to Fortnite, offering users the ability to play, watch, shop and engage with content and characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar and other franchises. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that [Fortnite] intends to go after younger gamers in 2024 and 2025,\u201d Ward said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/tech/roblox-earnings-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_inappropriate-behavior-shuts-down-dublin-new-york-portal", "text": "That didn\u2019t take long. Less than a week after two public sculptures featuring a livestream between Dublin, Ireland, and New York City debuted, \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d in real-time interactions between people in the two cities has prompted a temporary shutdown. The two sculptures, \u201cThe Portals,\u201d are round, lens-like installations with a 24/7 video link to allow residents and visitors in the two cities to interact with each other. Social media videos have shown people flashing body parts to people on the other side. The installation does not include audio. The creators of the sculptures are now \u201cinvestigating possible technical solutions to inappropriate behaviour by a small minority of people in front of the Portal,\u201d according to a statement from the Dublin City Council. \u201cDublin City Council had hoped to have a solution in place today, but unfortunately the preferred solution, which would have involved blurring, was not satisfactory,\u201d the City Council said late Tuesday. The team behind the sculptures, Portals.org, is looking at other options. The City Council planned to switch off the live stream at 10 p.m. local time Tuesday and said that Portals.org expected to be able to turn it on again later this week. \u201cWe are delighted by how many people have been enjoying the Portal since it was launched last week,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt has become a global phenomenon and it is important to note that the overwhelming majority of people interacting with the Dublin Portal have behaved appropriately.\u201d Organizers in New York also underlined that the inappropriate behavior has come from \u201ca very small minority\u201d of visitors. \u201cIn New York, we have had a set of protocols in place since the Portal\u2019s launch, including 24/7 on-site security and barriers to prevent people from stepping onto the Portal,\u201d said a statement from Flatiron NoMad Partnership, one of the project\u2019s organizers in New York. While the creators and their partners in both cities work on \u201cadditional solutions to limit such behavior appearing on the livestream,\u201d the New York Portal will be turned off for a few days starting at 5 p.m. local time Tuesday, according to Flatiron NoMad Partnership. On the Dublin side, the portal is installed facing the capital city\u2019s main street, O\u2019Connell Street. In New York, the portal sculpture is located on the Flatiron South Public Plaza at Broadway, Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street. The Portals are the brainchild of Lithuanian artist Benediktas Gylys. The project\u2019s intention, according to Daith\u00ed de R\u00f3iste, Dublin\u2019s Lord Mayor, was to expand global connections. \u201cOne of my key aims as Lord Mayor is to make the City more inclusive. The Portals project embodies this, bringing together technology, engineering and art to bring communities from across the world closer together and to allow people to meet and connect outside of their social circles and cultures,\u201d de R\u00f3iste said in a news release on May 8 announcing the project\u2019s debut. The Lord Mayor noted the \u201cdeep historical and cultural bond\u201d between the two cities. In July, Dublin expects to connect to destinations in Poland, Brazil and Lithuania, according to de R\u00f3iste\u2019s statement. \u201cI would encourage Dubliners and visitors to the City to come and interact with the sculpture and extend an Irish welcome and kindness to cities all over the world,\u201d de R\u00f3iste\u2019s May 8 statement said. De R\u00f3iste said the portals project is part of events lined up to coincide with Dublin\u2019s 2024 EU Capital of Smart Tourism Designation. The Dublin-New York city pairing isn\u2019t the first real-time bridge between cities through these sculptures. The first Portals, according to the organization\u2019s website, linked Vilnius, Lithuania, with Lublin, Poland, in 2021.

{"id": "2024_05_07_tech_apple-unveils-new-ipad-lineup", "text": "Apple is hoping its latest iPad lineup will breathe new life into its sluggish tablet market. In a pre-recorded live streamed event from its Cupertino, California headquarters, the company introduced the latest versions of its iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets, and an all-new Apple Pencil Pro. CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday\u2019s announcement marked \u201cthe biggest day for iPad since its introduction.\u201d At the heart of the new iPad Pro is Apple\u2019s new custom M4 processor, which delivers 4 times the performance as its existing iPad Pro models. Considering Apple\u2019s latest MacBook lineup currently runs on the M3 chip, this is, as Cook put it, an \u201coutrageously powerful chip for AI.\u201d The company is expected to show off its first batch of AI-tools for the iPhone and iPad at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. The latest iPad Pro comes in two sizes: 11 inches and 13 inches. Apple said the 11-inch model is its thinnest yet, at 5.1 mm, and less than a pound. The display combines two OLED panels to maximize brightness. The iPad Pro comes in two finishes, silver and space black. Meanwhile, the iPad Air, for the first time, comes in the same two sizes: an 11-inch ($599) and 13-inch ($799) design. The bigger size, inspired by the iPad Pro with a larger screen, has 30% more screen real estate than the 11-inch display. The iPad Air is powered by Apple\u2019s custom M2 processor with faster GPU and neural engine that\u2019s 50% faster than the previous iPad Air. The company said it better supports AI-powered software. It also features a front-facing landscape camera. Meanwhile, an upgraded Apple Pencil ($129) comes with a new squeeze function that allows users to bring up tools, customize drawing layers of what they\u2019re working on and includes haptic feedback. It also supports Find My to locate the pencil when it inevitably goes missing. Apple also showed off a redesigned Magic Keyboard with a haptic trackpad to make the iPad more like a laptop. Some key apps, including Final Cut, also received substantial upgrades, including the ability to add AI-based audio or edit with AI. The new iPad lineup is available for pre-order starting Tuesday and in stores next week. The event comes just days after Apple reported its iPad revenue of $5.6 billion for its latest quarter, down 17% year over year. However, the company said it expects its iPad business to grow in double digits for the June quarter. Apple also reported last week a first-quarter revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% year over year, as the tech giant continues to struggle with growth challenges, particularly in China, amid an uncertain economic environment. It announced a $110 billion share buyback \u2013 the largest in the company\u2019s history \u2013 as iPhones sales declined 10%. Ben Wood, a chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight, said the unexpected introduction of the iPad Pro\u2019s new M4 chip and its significant performance jumps may be enough to ignite some excitement among consumers. \u201cWhile these new iPads are unlikely to return the category to growth immediately, they represent a much-needed reason to upgrade for customers with aging products,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emphasis on artificial intelligence was palpable with Apple determined to seize back the initiative in this area given the huge focus on this topic by all its rivals over the last 18 months.\u201d On the earnings call last week, Cook teased that generative AI tools could be coming to Apple products in the \u201cweeks ahead,\u201d at a time when it\u2019s currently behind competitors. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/tech/apple-unveils-new-ipad-lineup/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_09_europe_putin-red-square-victory-day-intl", "text": "Russia\u2019s President Vladimir\u00a0Putin said his forces were \u201calways ready\u201d to combat external threats, as he addressed crowds gathered at Moscow\u2019s Red Square on Thursday to celebrate the Soviet Union\u2019s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Russia\u2019s annual May 9 Victory Day procession has long been a key event in Putin\u2019s calendar as a chance for him to rally public support and show off his country\u2019s military power. While there were even fewer soldiers and military gear on display than last year\u2019s already subdued event, Victory Day this year comes with Russia making advances on the frontlines in Ukraine. Putin\u00a0gave his speech after inspecting the traditional display of tanks and columns of troops parading through the capital. \u201cRussia will do everything in order to not let a global confrontation begin,\u201d\u00a0Putin said, adding: \u201cBut we will not let anyone threaten us, our strategic forces are always ready.\u201d \u201cDear friends, Russia is going through a difficult period,\u201d\u00a0the Russian leader\u00a0continued, saying the \u201cfight of our motherland depends on every one of us.\u201d \u201cToday, on the Victory Day, we realize this even more so,\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0concluded, ending his speech with a minute of silence. Around 27 million people in the Soviet Union died in World War II, more than in any other country. Russia\u2019s defense minister, Army General Sergei Shoigu, said in a statement on Telegram that 9,000 people and 70 pieces of military equipment would participate in the main military parade on Red Square. This was less than last year, when Shoigu said more than 10,000 people and 125 items of military hardware would be involved. Several world leaders, mostly from ex-Soviet countries, were invited. Those scheduled to be there were Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev of Kazakhstan, Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan, Serdar Berdimuhamedow of Turkmenistan, Miguel Diaz-Canel of Cuba, Thongloun Sisoulith of Laos, and Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 of Guinea-Bissau. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova\u00a0told TASS in an interview that \u201cunfriendly countries\u201d were not invited for a third Victory Day since the war in Ukraine began. \u201cThey are pursuing an aggressive policy toward our country. They formulate it as inflicting strategic defeat,\u201d\u00a0Zakharova\u00a0said. Putin has portrayed his invasion of Ukraine in patriotic terms \u2014 as a response to a threat posed by the West, something flatly rejected by Kyiv and its allies. His Victory Day address comes just days after the Russian leader was inaugurated for a fifth term in office, in a carefully choreographed ceremony. The inauguration, held Tuesday in the Kremlin, was attended by Russia\u2019s top military and political brass, but the United States and many European nations declined to send a representative after dismissing Russia\u2019s elections as a sham. It further cemented Putin\u2019s grip on power in Russia, where he has served as either president or prime minister since his first inauguration in 2000, and tinkered with Russia\u2019s constitution to remove term limits and extend each term\u2019s length from four years to six.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/09/europe/putin-red-square-victory-day-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_12_europe_sergei-shoigu-putin-replaces-defense-minister-intl-latam", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has replaced his defense minister and a long-time close ally Sergei Shoigu with an economist, a major reshuffle of military leadership more than two years after Moscow\u2019s grinding war against Ukraine has sent defense spending soaring. Andrey Belousov, a civilian who served as former first deputy prime minister and specializes in economics, was appointed to the top defense post, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday. Peskov tried to downplay the move, but the reshuffle comes amid speculation about\u00a0infighting at the highest echelons of power. Just last month, one of Shoigu\u2019s long-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9s at the defense ministry was arrested and charged with corruption. Shoigu was \u201crelieved\u201d of his position by presidential decree, Peskov said, but he will remain an influential part of Putin\u2019s administration as secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council, replacing Nikolai Patrushev, a former head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who would \u201ctransfer to another job.\u201d Shoigu will also become the deputy in Russia\u2019s Military-Industrial Commission, Peskov said, as Putin embarks on a fifth term as president. The timing of Shoigu\u2019s exit is notable, coming off the back of several significant advances by Russian troops in eastern Ukraine. Russia has launched its most serious cross-border ground assault since Ukraine recaptured the northern Kharkiv region in the late summer of 2022. There have been several months of increased Russian air attacks on the city of Kharkiv amid a grinding advance in Donetsk in the east that has seen incremental but significant progress. Shoigu had helmed the country\u2019s defense ministry for 12 years and led the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russian troops initially caught Kyiv by surprise but were soon beaten back, exposing the weaknesses of Moscow\u2019s corruption-riddled military and its willingness to send waves of poorly trained and equipped soldiers into what Ukraine and Russian troops have both dubbed a \u201cmeat grinder.\u201d His critics have frequently described Shoigu as remote and out-of-touch with the realities of the conflict. His most forceful critic was the late Wagner chief\u00a0Yevgeny Prigozhin\u00a0who accused the Defense Ministry of starving his fighters of resources and bureaucratic incompetence before launching an unsuccessful mutiny last year and dying weeks later in a plane crash. Despite the criticism, Shoigu has remained a popular politician in Russia. Having spent two decades as the minister of emergency situations, he cultivated an image of a helpful official who brings help when it\u2019s needed. He is also a rare outsider in Putin\u2019s original inner circle, which consists mostly of the president\u2019s allies from his St. Petersburg political beginnings and his former KGB colleagues. Shoigu was born and grew up in the remote Siberian republic of Tuva and got into politics through his association with the former president Boris Yeltsin. Rising military spending and need for \u2018innovation\u2019 Belousov\u2019s appointment suggests Russia\u2019s strategy will continue to focus on outgunning Ukraine. Belousov was selected by Putin because of a need for \u201cinnovation,\u201d Peskov said in a press call, during which he highlighted the ministry\u2019s rising budget, saying it was approaching levels last seen during the Cold War. \u201cToday on the battlefield, the winner is the one who is more open to innovation,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cTherefore, it is natural that at the current stage, the president decided that the Russian Ministry of Defense should be headed by a civilian.\u201d In a reference to the war in Ukraine, Peskov said that due to \u201cwell-known geopolitical circumstances, we are gradually approaching the situation of the mid-80s when the share of expenses for the security bloc in the economy was 7.4%. It\u2019s not critical, but it\u2019s extremely important,\u201d Peskov said. The budget currently amounts to 6.7% of GDP, he said. Peskov highlighted Belousov\u2019s previous leadership experience and economic background. \u201cThis is not just a civilian, but a person who very successfully headed the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, for a long time he was aide to the president on economic issues, and was also the first deputy chairman of the government in the previous cabinet of ministers,\u201d Peskov said. Much has been made of Belousov\u2019s civilian status, even though Shoigu himself has limited hands-on experience with the military. He holds a rank of a general as a result of his official roles and has never served in active service. Peskov added that the new appointment did not signal a shift in Russia\u2019s current military system. \u201cAs for the military component, this appointment will in no way change the current coordinate systems. The military component has always been the prerogative of the Chief of the General Staff [Valery Gerasimov], and he will continue his activities. No changes are currently envisaged\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0regard,\u201d he said. In his new role, Shoigu will oversee Russia\u2019s military industrial complex, Peskov said. \u201cHe is deeply immersed in this work, he knows very well the pace of production of military-industrial products at specific enterprises and often visits these enterprises,\u201d he said. The news follows the arrest last month of one of Shoigu\u2019s close allies, deputy defense minister Timur Ivanov, who was charged with taking a bribe in what was the country\u2019s highest-profile corruption scandal since Putin launched his full invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. Ivanov has been accused of accepting a bribe of 1 million rubles (at least $10,800), according to Russian state media TASS. Former US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told CNN in an interview Sunday that Putin\u2019s reshuffle is an \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cinteresting move.\u201d \u201cThe bigger argument coming out of Moscow right now is that Russia is moving toward a war economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re on a war footing.\u201d Esper said that \u201cone of the disappointing things about Shoigu\u2019s tenure is we thought the Russian army, at least during my time at the Pentagon, we thought they were professionalizing, that they were modernizing all their equipment, their doctrine, how they train and fight, and we really haven\u2019t seen that on the battlefield.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/europe/sergei-shoigu-putin-replaces-defense-minister-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Chi Leung (Peter) Wai, 38, Matthew Trickett, 37, and Chung Biu Yuen, 63, are also accused of foreign interference,\u00a0the statement said, without specifying who the men were allegedly spying on. Relations between Hong Kong and its former colonial ruler Britain have soured in recent years following mass pro-democracy protests in the Chinese city in 2019 and 2020. The British government has criticized Hong Kong\u2019s Beijing-backed crackdown on almost all opposition in the years following the protests, while Hong Kong authorities have bristled at Britain providing a safe haven for pro-democracy leaders sought by the Hong Kong police. On Tuesday, Hong Kong\u00a0Chief Executive John Lee claimed the British charges against thre three men were a \u201cfabrication.\u201d \u201cThe Chinese side firmly rejects and strongly condemns the UK\u2019s fabrication in the so-called case and its unwarranted accusation against the Hong Kong government,\u201d Lee\u00a0said,\u00a0referring directly to a statement from the Chinese Embassy in London\u00a0that was also issued in response to the charges. On Monday, the Chinese Embassy statement, strongly condemned what it called the United Kingdom\u2019s \u201cunwarranted accusation against the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government.\u201d The charges against the three men allege that between December 20, 2023 and May 2, 2024, Yuen, Wai and Trickett agreed to undertake information gathering, surveillance and acts of deception that were likely to materially assist a foreign intelligence service, according to PA media. Police also alleged that on May 1, the three forced entry into a UK residential address, according to PA. All three were\u00a0granted\u00a0bail but\u00a0are\u00a0barred from traveling internationally, with District Judge Louisa Cieciora saying they must abide by a nighttime curfew and report weekly to their local police station. Hong Kong leader Lee noted\u00a0in his Tuesday news conference\u00a0that one of the men charged was the office manager of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London but did not directly address a question over whether it was involved in surveillance of Hong Kong dissidents in the UK. Lee, the city\u2019s former security chief, said Hong Kong\u2019s Economic and Trade Office exists to facilitate cultural and economic interactions with people and businesses in the UK and that \u201cAny attempt to make unwarranted accusations against the Hong Kong government is unacceptable.\u201d The Metropolitan Police said they had charged the men with assisting the foreign intelligence service under the UK National Security Act. \u201cA number of arrests were made and searches carried out across England as part of this investigation.

But it\u2019s not just the lagoon city, with its\u00a030 million visitors\u00a0a year, which is interested in trying out new tourism taxes. In the UK, a council in the county of Kent\u00a0has recommended\u00a0introducing a tourism tax on overnight stays in the county. In Scotland, it seems likely that\u00a0visitors to Edinburgh\u00a0will be paying a fee by 2026, and the Welsh government\u00a0plans to introduce\u00a0similar legislation later this year. There are more than 60 destinations around the world where this type of tax is already in place. These vary from a nationwide tax in Iceland to various towns across the US. Some have been in place for a long time (France was the\u00a0first in 1910), but most were introduced during the last decade or two. Before the pandemic really struck (and tourism was put on hold), 2020 was described by one newspaper as the\u00a0\u201cyear of the tourist tax,\u201d as Amsterdam joined an ever-growing list of destinations, which includes Paris, Malta and Cancun, to charge visitors for simply visiting. Introducing these tourist taxes has often been controversial, with industry bodies\u00a0voicing concerns\u00a0about the potential impacts on the tourist trade. And it appears that the link between such levies and visitor numbers is not simple, with several studies reaching different conclusions. For example, some have suggested that tourism levies have hindered\u00a0international tourism in the Balearics\u00a0and\u00a0the Maldives, and that they may dissuade people from participating in\u00a0domestic tourism. Yet in one of the world\u2019s most popular tourism spots with a levy, Barcelona, visitor numbers have\u00a0consistently risen, with hotel guests increasing from 7.1 million in 2013 to 9.5 million in 2019. In fact, the relationship between a visitor levy and tourist flow is so complex that there is no unified view, even within the same country. Italy has been one of the most studied, and results\u00a0are inconsistent\u00a0there too. Another study, looking at three neighbouring Italian seaside spots finds that only in one destination has the visitor levy\u00a0reduced tourist flow. And a study on the Italian cities of Rome, Florence and Padua shows that these cities\u00a0have not experienced any negative effects\u00a0either in terms of domestic or international demand. So the impact of tourism taxes on visitor numbers is inconclusive. But what about other effects, such as the potential benefits of spending the revenues raised? As part of an ongoing research project, we looked at seven different destinations in which tourist taxes are levied to look at how the money raised is then spent. For most places, tourism tax revenues were being used to fund marketing and branding \u2013 so invested directly into promoting more tourism. The income was also commonly used to fund tourism infrastructure, from public toilets and walking or cycling paths to a multi-billion dollar\u00a0convention centre\u00a0in Orange County, Florida. In\u00a0the Balearics, revenues tend to go to projects that mitigate the negative impacts of tourism on the environment, culture and society of the islands. These include waste management, conserving natural habitats and historical monuments, and social housing. But in general, tourism taxes have been implemented successfully across the destinations we looked at, and there is little evidence of tourists being put off from visiting. Research also suggests that when tourists are told what the levy is used for \u2013 and when it relates directly to\u00a0improving their experience\u00a0or\u00a0enhancing sustainable tourism\u00a0\u2013\u00a0tourists are willing to accept and pay\u00a0the levy. Day trippers For many tourism destinations, the major problem is not overnight tourists, but rather\u00a0day visitors\u00a0who use local resources while making little in the way of a financial contribution. For these reasons, taxes might also be used to deter day visits and instead encourage longer stays. Venice is at the forefront\u00a0of this shift. And in April 2024, after long discussions between the local authority, residents and business owners, Venice started a\u00a0trial\u00a0of a day visitor tax (a so-called\u00a0\u201caccess fee.\u201d) Back in Kent, it may take longer for any such radical plans to come to fruition. In contrast to Scotland and Wales, there are currently no national plans to\u00a0introduce tourist taxes\u00a0in England. This might be considered shortsighted, given the dire need of many destinations in England to improve local infrastructure that tourists rely on, including\u00a0clean bathing water\u00a0and\u00a0public transport. In\u00a0Manchester\u00a0and\u00a0Liverpool, businesses have implemented voluntary overnight charges on visitors, in the absence of the statutory basis to implement compulsory levies. Many other towns and cities will probably follow their lead. Tourism taxes are something we might all have to consider budgeting for in our future travel plans, wherever we choose to visit.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/tourist-taxes-do-they-work/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_asia_japan-ageing-population-women-opportunities-intl-hnk", "text": "With a history spanning more than 1,200 years, \u201chadaka matsuri,\u201d or the naked festival, is Japanese masculinity on full display. Quite literally. Across Japan, in freezing winter, thousands of men strip naked \u2014 except for a delicate piece of crotch-covering white loincloth \u2014 to jostle around their local shrines. Each participant tries to get as close as possible to a man playing the role of \u201cshin-otoko,\u201d a\u00a0god-man who wards off bad luck. On one hand, the ritual illustrates Japan\u2019s steadfast respect for tradition and cultural heritage. But on the other, its insistence on excluding women \u2014 only men are considered pure in the traditional Japanese culture \u2014 bears all the hallmarks of one of the country\u2019s greatest modern struggles: gender inequality. To this day, men hold the country\u2019s highest offices and most of the top jobs at prestigious private firms. Last year, the World Economic Forum ranked Japan 125th in its Global Gender Gap Index report, far below other G7 countries such as Germany, Britain and the United States. It was just a few spots ahead of India and Saudi Arabia \u2014 both notoriously poor performers on gender equality. Some women in Japan still battle deep-rooted cultural expectations that require them to take the role of \u201cshufu,\u201d or housewife, experts say. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s painstakingly long work hours and male-centric institutional culture conspire further against women who are already burdened disproportionately by more family duties than men. But in the naked festival, women have recently found hope. Even the country\u2019s most entrenched male-centric tradition was recently subverted by another wrinkle in the national fabric: a shrinking population. In February, as the number of male participants dwindled, the country\u2019s oldest hadaka matsuri, at the Konomiya Shrine in central Japan, welcomed 41 women to take part for the first time. \u201cOne reason to permit women to participate in such a traditional festival is due to the shortage of men,\u201d said Mikiko Eto, emerita professor who specializes in gender politics at Hosei University in Tokyo. \u201cThe number of young men is declining rapidly. Women should be welcome because of shortage of male participants, so we\u2019ve been very welcome.\u201d Haruhiko Nishio, 57, a member of an alumni club for shin-otoko involved in organizing the hadaka matsuri at the Konomiya Shrine, recalled: \u201cLast year, the festival had only 1,700 attendees, only one-fifth of pre-pandemic crowds.\u201d He said women had never been explicitly banned from taking part, but such mass participation was a first. The female group, known as Enyukai, was assigned a minor role on the day (and the women agreed they should keep their clothes on). But for those who took part, it was deeply symbolic. \u201cJapan can\u2019t help but put men at the front and women in the back. I want to unleash female power from now on,\u201d participant Atsuko Tamakoshi, 56, told CNN. For the organizer, it may be a practical decision. But vice president of Enyukai, Ayaka Suzuki, 36, said: \u201cIt\u2019s about gender equality.\u201d It does not end there, scholars say. With no easy solutions in sight, Japan\u2019s declining population may not only reshape the millennium-old festival, but also transform the world\u2019s fourth-biggest economy. \u201cThe impact of an aging society is very important for the Japanese economy. You need more working people, more active people. So why are women still at home? Let women participate in the labor market,\u201d Eto said. \u201cAging society is a chance for women to achieve gender equality because our society needs more able people,\u201d she said. \u2018Now or never\u2019 Japan\u2019s number of births dropped for the eighth consecutive year in 2023, plunging 5.1% from the previous year to an all-time low of 758,631, according to the Ministry of Health. With a fertility rate hovering around 1.3 in recent years \u2014 far below the rate of 2.1 required to maintain a stable population (Japan has very low levels of immigration) \u2014 the Japanese government has long described its mission to boost births as a question of \u201cnow or never.\u201d Eto, from Hosei University, said the consequences of a declining population aren\u2019t confined to small towns or traditional rituals. Japan\u2019s workforce totaled 66 million people in 2023, including foreign nationals, according to a report released in January this year by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). But the figure will plunge by more than half to about 32 million by the turn of the century if Japan\u2019s fertility rate continues to stagnate, the report predicted. And as the population crisis spirals, the government and many businesses have started asking why women are still bound by social expectation to stay home, Eto said. Amplified voices There have been improvements, according to Eto, though \u2014 as with the changes to the hadaka matsuri \u2014 the motives may have been more pragmatic than progressive. Many businesses are promoting greater gender equality in workplaces to make women feel more welcome. The government has also introduced a string of initiatives to lessen the burdens on mothers, including a vision to encourage 85% of male workers to take paternity leave by 2030, for a more even division of domestic labor. Examples of women leaders include Mitsuko Tottori, who took the helm of Japan Airlines on April 1 to become its first female president and CEO. Seasoned politician Yoko Kamikawa was appointed foreign minister last September, becoming the first woman to take up the role in two decades. But in general, women\u2019s representation in politics and management remains unsatisfactorily low, experts note. Only five of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\u2019s 20-member cabinet are women and, as of 2023, less than 13% of senior and leadership posts in businesses were held by women, according to the Global Gender Gap report. A lack of innovative policies, such as quota systems for women adopted by some European countries, is holding Japan back, Eto said. Kaori Katada, an associate social science professor at Hosei University, said Japan\u2019s improvement on gender equality has been incremental and nuanced. While women are given more opportunities, she said, bias and stereotypes persist. Women are mostly confined to junior positions and caretaking jobs, such as kindergarten care and nursing, and they are generally paid less than their male counterparts, she said. \u201c(This means) women have to take care of the house and children, which forces them into part-time work. They cannot accept high-responsibility management positions because they need to look after children too,\u201d she said. And not all social institutions are ready to embrace women as much as the hadaka matsuri at Konomiya Shrine, as the handful of women who try to set foot in the ring of sumo wrestling, another male-dominated sport, can testify. Hiyori Kon, 26, a top amateur sumo wrestler and the protagonist in the 2018 Netflix documentary \u201cLittle Miss Sumo,\u201d told CNN she is often confronted by disapproval, reminding her that Japan has a long way to go\u00a0on gender equality.\u00a0Once, she said, her male colleague told her: \u201cIf you continue sumo, you won\u2019t be able to marry, so you better quit soon.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/asia/japan-ageing-population-women-opportunities-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_14_europe_prison-ambush-france-intl", "text": "French authorities launched a manhunt on Tuesday after gunmen ambushed a prison convoy in Normandy to break out an inmate, killing two guards and wounding three others. The violent incident, extremely rare for that part of northern France, took place as the vehicle was transporting a prisoner from court to a nearby prison, French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said. Video from the scene showed a black SUV in flames that appeared to have crashed into a prison van near a motorway toll booth, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.\u00a0Two hooded individuals could be seen carrying what appeared to be long rifles. Dupond-Moretti told reporters that the incident was the first time a French prison employee had died while working since 1992. He added that one of the guards leaves behind a wife and two children, and the other a spouse who was five months\u2019 pregnant. Dupond-Moretti added that two of those hurt sustained life-threatening injuries. The gunmen are still at large, national police said on X. \u201cEverything, and I mean everything, will be done to find the perpetrators of this heinous crime. These are people for whom life means nothing. They will be arrested. They will be tried. And they will be punished for the crime they committed,\u201d Dupond-Moretti said. A manhunt is underway to find suspects who carried out the prison break and the inmate, a 30-year-old who had been convicted of burglary and is being investigated for a kidnapping related to death, according to the French national prosecutor in charge of organized crime, which has already opened an investigation into the incident. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on X he has mobilized the national gendarmerie and \u201cseveral hundred\u201d police officers for the manhunt.\u00a0Authorities on the scene are setting up roadblocks and establishing a perimeter, BFMTV reported. Vehicles found On Tuesday evening local time, French police said they had discovered two burnt out vehicles used by the attackers. Paris state prosecutor Laure Beccuau told a press conference that the two vehicles were found in Houtteville and in Gauville-le-Campagne, two towns in the d\u00e9partement of Eure where the attack took place near the Incarville tollbooth shortly before 11am local time (5aET). One of the vehicles, a Peugeot, had been used to ram the police van during the attack, Becuau said. The other vehicle, an Audi, had been following the van and carried the two gunmen. Forensic experts have been carrying out \u201cmeticulous tests\u201d at the scene of the crime, and police had been studying video of the attack filmed by eyewitnesses and posted on social media, Beccuau told the press conference. The prosecutor also revealed more details about the escaped inmate, identifying him as Mohamed Amra, and saying he is \u201cvery well known to the justice system,\u201d having sustained a total 13 convictions. Most of those convictions related to incidences of theft with aggravated offences, Beccuau said, adding that Amra had been incarcerated in various facilities since January 2022. A minimum of three police officers had been decided as the security level for the escort several weeks ago, Beccuau told journalists. In the end, five officers were involved in the escort. A 52-year-old officer and 34-year-old officer were both killed during the attack whilst their colleagues, a 48-year-old, a 52-year-old and a 55-year-old were all injured, she said. On May 10, Amra was found guilty on the charge of burglary by a court in \u00c9vreux and was also under investigation in Marseille for a kidnap which led to a death, Beccuau said. The prosecutor said the authorities\u2019 priority now is getting to the bottom of this \u201coutburst of violence.\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron said on X that \u201cevery effort is being made to find the perpetrators of this crime so that justice can be done in the name of the French people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/europe/prison-ambush-france-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

That\u2019s because five Boeing 747 passenger jets once operated by the South Korean flag carrier Korean Air have been purchased by the Sierra Nevada Corporation, the contractor for the replacements for the US Air Force\u2019s current fleet of strategic command and control military aircraft, more commonly known as \u201cDoomsday\u201d planes. Also known as the E-4B \u201cNightwatch,\u201d the Doomsday planes are designed to be command-and-control centers for the US military in the event of a national emergency that sees command facilities on the ground destroyed or incapacitated, such as nuclear war. They could become what amounts to a Pentagon in the sky, taking aboard the US president, secretary of defense and members of the Joint Chiefs among more than 100 other people with the ability to control US forces worldwide from the aircraft, according to an Air Force fact sheet on the E-4Bs. The Doomsday planes are built to withstand the effects of an electromagnetic pulse, the burst of energy released by a nuclear explosion that can \u201cdisrupt and permanently damage electrical components and entire systems within most critical infrastructure sectors and impact large-scale infrastructure,\u201d according to the US Department of Homeland Security. At least one Doomsday plane is on alert 24/7 at a US military base somewhere in the world, the Air Force says. On Friday, a spokesperson for the Colorado-based Sierra Nevada\u00a0confirmed the purchase of the Korean Air jets but would not give any further details. However, on April 26 the Air Force awarded Sierra Nevada a $13 billion contract to develop and produce the Survivable Airborne Operations Center, the official name of the new Doomsday plane. Work on the project is to be completed by 2036, according to a Defense Department release. On Friday, an Air Force spokeswoman confirmed the contract had been awarded in April. \u201cThe development of this critical national security weapon system ensures the Department\u2019s Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications capability is operationally relevant and secure for decades to come. To satisfy operational requirements, the weapon system will be comprised of a Commercial Derivative Aircraft that will be hardened and modified to meet military requirements,\u201d Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek told CNN. Last year, Sierra Nevada opened a 100,000-square-foot aircraft repair, maintenance and overhaul facility at Dayton International Airport in Ohio, and construction on a second hangar of similar size has begun. An artist\u2019s rendering of the Dayton facility showed a 747-800 inside. The 747-800s would be an upgrade on the older and smaller 747-200 airframes of the current Doomsday fleet, which entered Air Force service in the 1980s. Earlier this week, Korean Air announced the $675 million sale of five of its aircraft to Sierra Nevada. The decision to sell the jets was part of a \u201cmid- to long-term introduction plan for new aircraft,\u201d the airline said in a statement, adding it expects the deal to be completed by September 30, 2025. Korean Air had nine 747-800 passenger jets in its fleet as of October 2023, according to its website.

{"id": "2024_05_09_europe_missing-woman-henao-spain-husband-arrest-cec", "text": "About 9:30 p.m. on February 2, a man in a helmet entered Ana Maria  Knezevich Henao\u2019s apartment building in an exclusive neighborhood in Madrid. Henao, who was on vacation in Spain from south Florida, was in the building at the time and planning a trip to Barcelona with her friends in three days. A surveillance camera captured the man fastening the building\u2019s lock with duct tape to disable it. He looked straight into the camera as he spray-painted the lens, partially obscuring it. After about an hour in the building, he emerged from the elevator with a suitcase. Henao was reported missing soon after, and no one has seen her since. But the FBI said this week they\u2019ve arrested the mystery man who entered her Madrid apartment building that night: her estranged husband. David Knezevich, 36, was detained at Miami International Airport on Saturday for his alleged involvement in her kidnapping, the latest in an international mystery involving law enforcement officials from two continents. A can of spray paint, security camera footage, stolen license plates and rental car records helped tie him to the crime, according to a criminal complaint obtained by CNN. So did his messages to a woman he\u2019d met on a dating app \u2014 and a Google search by the woman\u2019s mother. Knezevich\u2019s attorney, Kenneth Padowitz, told CNN in February that his client is innocent and \u201chas never been to Spain.\u201d Padowitz declined to comment Wednesday after Knezevich\u2019s arrest.  The couple owned properties in Florida but had separated Knezevich and Henao lived in Florida, where records show they own several properties in Fort Lauderdale.\u00a0They are also listed as CEO and project manager of EOX Technology Solutions Inc., which provides computer support for businesses in south Florida. CNN contacted the company this week but did not immediately get a response. The couple was planning to divorce amid a separation that was contentious because Knezevich did not want to evenly split marital assets, court documents said. But Knezevich\u2019s attorney told CNN in February that their separation was amicable, \u201cwith anticipation of a divorce.\u201d Henao, 40, boarded a flight from Miami to Spain the day after Christmas, court records show. At the time of her disappearance six weeks later, her husband was in his native Serbia and had nothing to do with it, Padowitz said in February. Knezevich had spoken to Spanish police, provided his credit card details and other information and was cooperating in the investigation, the attorney said then. Padowitz is based in Florida. But federal officials said records show Knezevich flew from Miami to Turkey in January and then went to Belgrade, Serbia, where he rented a small Peugeot on January 29. The owner of the rental car agency told investigators that when the car was returned in mid-March, someone had tinted its windows and added a new license plate frame, and it had traveled nearly 4,800 miles, the criminal complaint said. Toll booth cameras captured images of the same model Peugeot, with tinted windows, near Madrid in the late night and early morning of February 2 and 3. It had license plates stolen from another vehicle on the Madrid street where Henao was living, the complaint said. FBI spokesperson James Marshall declined to answer questions this week, citing an ongoing investigation. \u201cWe appreciate the public\u2019s attention to our case and continue to encourage those with information, even if they\u2019re not certain of its value, to come forward,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cTo preserve the integrity and capabilities of the investigation, I cannot share details of the ongoing process.\u201d Her friend received puzzling texts from her phone Henao was last seen on camera entering her building in Madrid\u2019s upscale Salamanca neighborhood on the afternoon of February 2. At 9:27 p.m. that evening, records show the man in the helmet entered the building and tampered with the surveillance camera. He had \u201cphysical characteristics\u201d that resembled her husband, court documents said. Henao, a US citizen originally from Colombia, was in constant communication with her loved ones while overseas. She was planning a trip to Barcelona with her friends on February 5, her brother told CNN, making her sudden lack of contact more concerning. Two days before the trip, her friend Sanna Rameau received a puzzling WhatsApp message from Henao indicating she was running off for a few days with a man she\u2019d just met. The message, seen by CNN, read: \u201cI met someone wonderful!! He has a summer house about 2h (hours) from Madrid. We are going there now and I will spend a few days there. Signal is spotty. I\u2019ll call you when I get back.\u201d The man had approached Henao on the street a day earlier while she was walking, the message said, adding: \u201cAmazing connection. Like I never had before.\u201d Rameau said she\u2019d spoken with Henao by phone hours before she went missing and she had not mentioned meeting a man. Concern grew when Henao did not show up at a Madrid train station for the trip as planned. Spanish firefighters entered her apartment for a welfare check and she was nowhere to be found, court documents said. Her phone, laptop and chargers were also missing. Now federal officials allege the text messages sent from her phone actually came from her husband.\u00a0And they were written with the help of another Colombian woman Knezevich had met on a dating app months earlier, court documents said. On February 3 \u2014 the day after Henao was last seen alive \u2014 Knezevich sent the woman several English sentences to translate into \u201cperfect Colombian,\u201d according to the criminal complaint. He told her it was for a friend in Serbia writing a script that had a Colombian character. The message he sent to the unidentified Colombian woman to translate was the same one sent from Henao\u2019s phone saying she\u2019d met a new guy, court documents said. Investigators also identified other clues Investigators on both sides of the Atlantic searched for clues on what happened to the missing woman and who entered her building that day \u2014 and who might have abducted her. Then everything started coming together. Spanish investigators identified the brand of spray paint used to tamper with the camera and learned that a Madrid retailer had sold the same paint, along with two rolls of duct tape, to a man who resembled Knezevich the same day Henao was last seen, the criminal complaint said. And in a twist of fate, the woman Knezevich met on a dating app told her mother in Bogota about her new suitor, leading to yet another revelation. The woman\u2019s mother Googled his name and saw news reports about his missing wife. She notified her daughter, who realized that the text attributed to Henao before she vanished matched the exact wording of the message she\u2019d helped Knezevich put together, court documents said. Knezevich\u2019s next court hearing is scheduled for Friday. But a key question remains: What happened to his wife?

This should have come 12 years earlier, in a packed stadium with her family sitting proudly in the stands. Instead, all Monta\u00f1o could do was lie down and stare vacantly at the ceiling as the hours drifted\u00a0by. \u201cA stab in the gut, in the heart, really,\u201d is how she describes her supposed moment of triumph. \u201cI kind of felt a sinking feeling, to be honest.\u201d Monta\u00f1o initially placed fifth in the women\u2019s 800-meter final in London, about half a second outside the medal positions having led the race bravely through the first lap. In front of her were two Russian athletes \u2013 Mariya Savinova, who had streaked away from the rest of the field on the final straight, and Ekaterina Guliyev\u00a0(then known as Ekaterina Poistogova), who narrowly edged out Kenya\u2019s Pamela Jelimo for bronze. Both Savinova and Guliyev were identified in a 2015 report, commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency\u00a0(WADA), as having benefitted from Russia\u2019s state-sponsored doping program, though Monta\u00f1o\u2019s performance at the London Olympics is only just now receiving the recognition it deserves. Savinova was stripped of her gold medal in 2017, while Guliyev is also set to lose her silver, upgraded from bronze, after the Athletics Integrity Unit announced this month that her results from July 17, 2012 to October 20, 2014 would be disqualified. Guliyev, now competing for Turkey under her husband\u2019s surname, has been given a two-year ban\u00a0and has until May 13\u00a0to appeal the decision. She has previously served another two-year ban for doping violations, voiding her results back to October 2015, and attempted to argue in a tribunal that there was no evidence to bring further charges against her. CNN has contacted the Turkish Athletic Federation for further comment. In the days after learning that she could be awarded a bronze medal, Monta\u00f1o says that her emotions oscillated from joy to sadness to something akin to grief. Her despair is at its lowest when\u00a0she\u00a0thinks of her grandmother, who turned 100 days before the 800-meter final in London and celebrated by watching the race from a hospital bed, never to know that Monta\u00f1o\u2019s fifth place would later be upgraded. \u201cYou can\u2019t ever get that back,\u201d the 38-year-old Monta\u00f1o explains. \u201cThe loss is history lost; the loss is the moment lost; the loss is the people who were there to hug you and cheer for you; the loss is the homecoming parade. These things are very real.\u201d This is not a new situation for Monta\u00f1o, who was retrospectively awarded bronze medals for her performances at the 2011 and 2013 world championships after Savinova was stripped of gold in both races. While competing, she says that she was suspicious of her Russian rivals, partly after observing a sharp and unprecedented improvement in some athletes\u2019 results and partly from the ease with which they would pass her on the track. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re running against robots,\u201d says Monta\u00f1o. \u201cWhen you get beaten by a competitor, you can feel the huff and the puff of the two of you kind of going at it, or the three of you going at it. \u201cSticking your neck out there for just a second of time, or a millisecond of time, and it just isn\u2019t the same way. Anybody can go and watch those videos\u00a0[of past races]\u00a0and see: this is wild.\u201d In 2019, six and eight years after winning her two world championship medals, Monta\u00f1o and her family \u2013 her husband, parents and children \u2013 were invited to Doha in Qatar for a staging of the medal ceremonies she never had. But the crowd in the stadium was scant and the accompanying fireworks display, she thought, was underwhelming, making her feel \u201ceven more empty.\u201d Now, Monta\u00f1o hopes to receive her Olympic medal at the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, with family, friends, supporters and sponsors there to see the moment \u2013 unlike American shot\u00a0putter\u00a0Adam Nelson, who was handed his gold medal next to a Burger King, nine years later than intended due to a rival\u2019s doping violation. She also wants to recoup some of the financial losses she incurred by being denied an Olympic medal, and one of her current sponsors, Clif Bar, has already agreed to pay Monta\u00f1o an undisclosed financial bonus for finishing third in 2012, even though she partnered with the company after the London Olympics. Based on the contracts she had at the time, Monta\u00f1o estimates that she has missed out on payments amounting to \u201cwell over seven figures.\u201d However, the true sum is impossible to quantify; winning a medal at a major championship, she explains, increases an athlete\u2019s potential earnings when it comes to negotiating appearance fees or future contracts. \u201cEven now, I walk into a conversation and folks run through your accolades and you know the difference between being a medalist and not being one is a huge pay cut,\u201d says Monta\u00f1o. \u201cIt\u2019s like anybody who walks into a job interview and their experience gets them a difference with what their compensation is going to be. Coming off\u00a0[the 2011 world championships]\u00a0and being a bronze medalist, my bargaining power would have been through the roof,\u201d she added. She believes that some athletes competing at this year\u2019s Paris Olympics will end up suffering a similar fate to her \u2013 potentially being robbed of\u00a0their moment on the podium\u00a0and in the spotlight\u00a0\u2013 and wants to see harsher punishments introduced for those found guilty of doping offenses. \u201cWe need to have a much more difficult pathway for athletes who use performance-enhancing drugs to re-enter the sport,\u201d says Monta\u00f1o. \u201cWe also have to have much heavier repercussions, I think, from a financial aspect for athletes who choose to dope \u2026 There needs to be heavy fines, especially if you want to re-enter the sport. And right now, there\u2019s not enough repercussion.\u201d CNN has contacted US Olympic and Paralympic Committee about athletes being compensated if they are awarded a medal retrospectively. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) operates a medal reallocation process, enabling athletes to be recognized at a ceremony of their choosing once the reallocation has been approved. Missing out on medals and potential earnings has contributed towards what Monta\u00f1o describes as a sense of \u201cisolation\u201d from the sport of track and field during a career beset with challenges. In 2019, she told the New York Times that Nike said it would pause her contract and stop paying her if she wanted to have a baby, prompting the company to\u00a0later\u00a0adjust its maternity policy so that female athletes wouldn\u2019t be \u201cadversely impacted financially for pregnancy\u201d for 18 months, which was six months more than the previous policy. \u201cI definitely have felt a lot of trauma around the track and competing in the sport,\u201d says Monta\u00f1o, having last competed in an elite race in 2017. But her love for running remains undiminished. She still enjoys heading out on the roads and trails and strongly believes that the sport provides a powerful, positive influence, especially when it comes to her own struggles and frustrations. \u201cI feel like I leave all of that stuff behind once I lace up and I get going,\u201d says Monta\u00f1o. \u201cOnce my adrenaline starts rushing and my blood starts coursing through my body and my heart starts pumping, my head gains clarity.\u201d As for the prospect of being awarded an Olympic medal, 2028 will be a full 16 years after she raced in London and crossed the line in a state of exhaustion \u2013 an extraordinary and often painful expanse of time. For Monta\u00f1o, the moment should at least offer some sort of closure. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that it\u2019ll feel like a chapter on which we can turn a page,\u201d she says, \u201cinstead of being stuck on the same sentence.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/30/sport/alysia-montano-london-olympics-doping-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_africa_meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam", "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on what was officially dubbed a 3-day private visit to Nigeria, yet it unfolded with all the grandeur and attention typically reserved for royal tours. Their first day saw them receive a red-carpet welcome complete with cultural dancers following their arrival in the Nigerian capital\u00a0of\u00a0Abuja, where they kicked off a multi-day mental health summit at Lightway Academy. There, they also unveiled a partnership between their Archewell Foundation and the\u00a0GEANCO Foundation to provide students with school supplies and menstrual products. The pair had been invited to the West African nation by the country\u2019s highest-ranking military official, Christopher Musa. After meeting him at the\u00a0Nigerian Defence Headquarters, Meghan signed a guest book thanking officials for \u201cwelcoming me home.\u201d Despite the private nature of their visit, the couple\u2019s itinerary resembled previous official tours they carried out before stepping back as senior working royals in 2020. They were warmly received everywhere they went, with Nigerians showcasing their famed hospitality. The couple were showered with gifts, including\u00a0a touching portrait of a young Harry with his mum. For both Nigeria and the Sussexes, this visit held significant weight. It was an opportunity for Nigeria to demonstrate its capability to host such high-profile guests and dispel any doubts raised by skeptics, especially considering the country\u2019s standing in the eyes of the UK\u2019s Foreign Office as one of the most dangerous countries to visit in the world. Nigeria has security issues with a terrorist insurgency in the northeast and northwest.\u00a0However, it is a huge country \u2014\u00a0 larger than the US state of Texas\u00a0 \u2014 and the other areas\u00a0visited by the royal couple over the past several days are relatively safe. Meanwhile, for Prince Harry and Meghan, this marked their first major trip to Africa since relinquishing\u00a0their official royal duties. It was a chance for them to engage in a hearts-and-minds charm offensive, which they executed with aplomb. Meghan, in particular, embraced exploring her Nigerian ancestry\u00a0after discovering several years ago\u00a0that she is 43% Nigerian\u00a0through a genealogy test. On Saturday, she co-hosted a women\u2019s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, for about 50 leading women from across Nigerian society and politics, business, media, and culture. During a panel discussion, moderated by Nigerian media mogul Mo Abudu, the duchess\u00a0spoke passionately about uncovering\u00a0her Nigerian roots and its significance to her own identity. She described Nigeria as \u201cmy country,\u201d adding\u00a0that \u201cbeing African American, part of it is not knowing so much about your lineage or background, where you come from specifically. And it was exciting \u2026 to discover more and understand what that really means.\u201d It was here that Meghan\u2019s natural ability to connect really shone through. She chatted\u00a0effortlessly with attendees, posed\u00a0for selfies and engaged\u00a0in heartfelt conversations. At another event on Sunday at the prestigious Delborough Hotel in Lagos\u00a0- where the great and good of Nigerian society had gathered to welcome the couple\u00a0-\u00a0she appeared visibly moved when three powerful traditional rulers honored her with royal titles. The Obi of Onitsha, His Majesty Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe christened Meghan \u201cAda Mazi,\u201d which means \u201cthe daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace.\u201d While, the Oluwo of Iwoland, southwest, Nigeria,\u00a0Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi christened her with the Yoruba name of \u201cAdetokunbo\u201d which means \u201croyalty from across the seas.\u201d Their engagements during the three-day visit were centered around their core passions:\u00a0sports rehabilitation,\u00a0mental health, and women\u2019s empowerment. For Harry\u2019s part, the duke\u00a0demonstrated his compassion and connection to his late mother, Princess Diana, as he visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kaduna, 150 miles from Abuja. His first stop was to drop in on the governor of Kaduna state, Senator Uba Sani, where he was again welcomed by a troupe of dancers and a red carpet.\u00a0Governor Sani sat opposite him and praised Harry as a \u201csymbol of courage,\u201d and \u201cpraised his service to his country.\u201d He added, \u201cPlease give our regards to the Duchess of Sussex, Princess Meghan.\u201d Harry toured about six wards at the Nigerian Army Reference\u00a0Hospital and met young men recuperating from their injuries. Many had been shot, ambushed by Boko Haram, or lost limbs due to blasts. One moment captured by photographer Misan Harriman, showing Harry holding a wounded soldier lying on the hospital bed resonated deeply and went viral on social media. Corporal Yusef, 23, who had been shot through the knee, spoke with the duke, who\u00a0asked him about his rehab. \u201cAre you going to try for the Invictus Games team? Are you preparing for that?\u2026 We will see you there,\u201d Harry said. Their visit also extended to cultural experiences, such as witnessing a vibrant dance performance and a polo match at the historic Lagos Polo Club. Polo holds special significance for Harry and the event provided a platform to showcase his longstanding commitment to the sport and its charitable endeavors. Amid the festivities, the couple expressed gratitude for Nigeria\u2019s warm reception.\u00a0As they bid farewell to Nigeria, Meghan declared: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to come back!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/africa/meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

More storms in the coming days will raise the risk once again of flash flooding, damaging winds and hail over the hard-hit region. Powerful hurricane-force wind gusts and a possible tornado ripped through Louisiana, killing at least three people there.  A woman who was nine months pregnant and her unborn child were killed in West Baton Rouge Parish when a tree fell onto the woman\u2019s mobile home Monday night, according to the state\u2019s department of health. About 45 miles west, a woman was killed in St. Martin Parish after a camper was toppled due to high winds, the state\u2019s department of health confirmed. Storms were also responsible for killing one person and injuring another in Mississippi, according to the state\u2019s emergency management agency. The person has not been identified and emergency management officials did not release any information about the circumstances of the death in southwestern Mississippi\u2019s Wilkinson County. More than 100,000 homes and businesses were without power Tuesday from Texas to Florida, according to PowerOutage.us. Louisiana bore the brunt of the outages, with more than 58,000. The South has been battered by several rounds of rain and severe thunderstorms over the past week. Severe storms moved through Texas and into Louisiana on Sunday, bringing tennis ball-sized hail and damaging winds. On Monday, powerful winds, hail and tornadoes occurred from eastern Texas to Florida. On Tuesday, the most significant threat for severe thunderstorms and heavy rainfall is expected across northern Florida. Communities there could see damaging wind gusts, hail, rainfall between 3 to 5 inches and even a tornado. In Tallahassee, officials warned residents to \u201cstay weather aware in the coming days.\u201d The city, Florida\u2019s capital, is still recovering from Friday\u2019s deadly EF2 tornadoes and 100 mph winds which toppled hundreds of power poles and caused widespread damage. The storms also brought heavy rain to areas that don\u2019t need it. Between 3 and 6 inches of rain fell along the Gulf Coast in a stripe from East Texas to Mississippi and more heavy rain is expected as the storm tracks through the Gulf Coast. River gauges across eastern Texas and Louisiana are still running high from the rainfall over a week ago, including the Trinity River, which is\u00a0still in major flood stage northeast of Houston. Several other rivers across both states are at moderate flood stage. Another significant bout of heavy rain is expected over the same areas Thursday, raising the alarm for forecasters at the Weather Prediction Center who warned \u201cconsiderable and significant flash flooding\u201d was likely in an area stretching from East Texas across much of Louisiana and into Mississippi.

{"id": "2024_05_14_uk_georgia-melissa-laurie-crocodile-attack-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "British twin sisters Georgia and Melissa Laurie were enjoying a hot June day in Mexico on holiday three years ago, swimming in a river in Puerto Escondido, when Melissa spotted a crocodile in the water close by, panic set in and they began desperately swimming away. Georgia reached the bank, but as Melissa was being pulled up onto it by another member of the group the crocodile reappeared and dragged her under the water. Georgia, now 31, plunged into the water and twice fought off the reptile to save her twin sister, an extraordinary act of bravery for which she is now receiving the King\u2019s Gallantry Medal. The award from King Charles III recognizes acts in which civilians put themselves at risk in an attempt to save someone else. It is a \u201csilver lining to have come out of the terrible ordeal,\u201d Georgia told the UK\u2019s PA Media news agency. \u201cIt kind of softens the whole traumatic experience.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s made this story so incredible is Melissa\u2019s unwavering bravery throughout it all because she was so strong during it and I don\u2019t think I would be here without her, she really gave me the strength to keep fighting,\u201d she added. For both sisters, the scars from that day still linger. Georgia initially found Melissa floating unconscious face down in the water and revived her before the crocodile returned and attacked again, according to a Tuesday press release from the UK Cabinet Office. At first, Georgia was able to fend the animal off, punching it with one hand while keeping her sister\u2019s head above the water with the other, but the crocodile returned for a third time. This time, the reptile death-rolled Melissa \u2013 a maneuver in which a crocodile rolls over with its prey in an attempt to drown them \u2013 but Georgia was able to punch it, the release adds. She sustained bite injuries to her hand, but the impact was hard enough that the crocodile eventually released her sister. A passing boat rescued them from the water but there was still a 25-minute ride to the shore and a 20-minute journey to the hospital during which time \u201cMelissa fought her own battle for survival,\u201d the twins said on their JustGiving page. Melissa was left with a complicated open wrist fracture, severe puncture wounds to her stomach, bowel and intestines as well as several bite injuries to her leg, foot and glutes, according to the JustGiving page. She underwent emergency surgery before being placed in a medically induced coma. She developed sepsis in hospital but eventually made a full recovery, the page adds.

{"id": "2024_05_14_sport_2024-wnba-season-preview-spt-intl", "text": "Never before has there been such anticipation ahead of a WNBA season. With the established talent already in situ and an exciting crop of players arriving from the college scene, it promises to be an intriguing time. Here\u2019s everything you need to know ahead of the 2024 campaign. How to watch The season begins on Tuesday with the Washington Mystics and the New York Liberty raising the curtain at the Entertainment and Sports Arena in Washington, DC, at 7 p.m. ET. It\u2019ll be a busy opening day of action, with four games on the slate \u2013 including Caitlin Clark\u2019s Indiana Fever debut at 7:30 p.m. ET. The opening game between the Mystics and the Liberty will be available to watch on ESPN3 and the WNBA\u2019s League Pass platform. The League Pass will show games throughout the season. ESPN, Amazon Prime, ION, NBA TV, ABC, CBS Sports Network and CBS/Paramount+ will broadcast games across the year. Rising to the top? All eyes this season will be on the Fever after they selected Clark with the No. 1 pick in April\u2019s 2024 WNBA draft. Clark arrives in the WNBA with fanfare after enjoying a historic NCAA season with the Iowa Hawkeyes and announcing herself on a wider stage with high-profile sponsorship deals. She is at the forefront of a new wave of interest in women\u2019s basketball; ticket prices to watch the Fever more than doubled even before the draft and TickPick told CNN back in March that 83% of total tickets sold for the Fever\u2019s upcoming season came after her announcement declaring for the draft. Her two preseason games for her new team have been sellouts, too. Clark\u2019s No. 22 Fever jerseys sold out within hours of going on sale, breaking the record for draft pick sales on draft night for any player in any sport, a Fanatics spokesperson told CNN; that record was subsequently broken days later by Caleb Williams after he was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the 2024 NFL Draft. But now Clark will lace up her shoes for her WNBA debut when she and her Indiana teammates travel to Connecticut to face the Sun. Her debut will be another sellout after the Sun announced on Monday that all 8,910 tickets at Mohegan Sun Arena had been snapped up. The Sun last sold out the venue more than 20 years ago in 2003. \u201cThis is what you\u2019ve kind of worked for and dreamed of, and now you get to put your jersey on for the first real time and go out there and play, so I think more than anything, just soak in the moment,\u201d Clark told reporters ahead of her debut. \u201cWe get to play on the biggest stage, there\u2019s going to be a lot of people there, it\u2019s going to be loud, but you only play your first WNBA game once.\u201d The Fever had a disappointing 2023 campaign, missing the postseason and winning 13 games all season. There were reasons for optimism, though, in particular through the play of 2023 Rookie of the Year, Aliyah Boston. The 22-year-old center had 14.5 points, 8.4 rebounds and 1.3 blocks in her debut campaign. But now, paired with Clark at point guard, they could make for a terrifying combination for opposing defenses. The Fever have not played in the playoffs since 2016 and the dominant years the franchise had under former head coach Lin Dunn \u2013 during which time they won one title \u2013 seem a long way away. But with the pairing of the two budding potential stars in Clark and Boston, Indiana could be looking at a much more promising season in 2024. New additions There are plenty of fresh faces to be excited about heading into this new season. The Los Angeles Sparks \u2013 who missed out on the playoffs last year \u2013 have had an intriguing injection of college talent in the forms of Cameron Brink and Rickea Jackson, who were drafted with the second and fourth picks of the draft respectively. For a team which historically was one of the WNBA\u2019s postseason regulars, the Sparks have missed out on the playoffs in the last three seasons but the addition of Brink and Jackson could give Los Angeles the defensive rigidity to blossom into a contender once again. Another team which has two potentially game-changing draft pick additions is the Chicago Sky. The Sky selected Kamilla Cardoso and Angel Reese with the third and seventh picks respectively in this year\u2019s draft. Both bring defensive and offensive traits to Illinois, playing starring roles in their respective college teams\u2019 title-winning runs in the last two years. Reese helped LSU to the NCAA women\u2019s basketball title in 2023, while Cardoso did the same this year for South Carolina. Often it\u2019s tough for rookies to make a meaningful impact in their first year in the professional league, but many members of the 2024 class are predicted to excel and help their new outfits in the wins column. Can anyone stop the Aces? The Las Vegas Aces have become the team to beat in the last two seasons. The Aces have won back-to-back WNBA titles and possess a star-studded roster, headlined by two-time WNBA MVP A\u2019ja Wilson, Kelsey Plum and last year\u2019s Sixth Player of the Year Alysha Clark. The team\u2019s roster was depleted by the retirement of Candance Parker last month, but the two-time WNBA MVP missed the majority of Las Vegas\u2019 title run last season with a foot injury, a sign the team can function in her absence. The question now moves to who can stop the Aces from winning three titles in a row? The New York Liberty, the team which lost to Las Vegas in the WNBA Finals last year, look best placed to do so with their collection of superstar talent; Sabrina Ionescu, Breanna Stewart, Courtney Vandersloot and Jonquel Jones all ply their trade in the Barclays Center. The Liberty have a poor record in the WNBA playoffs so far, however, having never won a title and lost in the Finals five times. But with head coach Sandy Brondello heading into her third year in the job, New York could be best placed to once again challenge Las Vegas for the title. Elsewhere, the Connecticut Sun have title aspirations after losing in the semifinals of last season\u2019s playoffs. Their roster is led by Alyssa Thomas and DeWanna Bonner, with the team drafting Leila Lacan out of Angers in France with the 10th pick in this year\u2019s draft.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/sport/2024-wnba-season-preview-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_middleeast_israel-restarts-fighting-north-gaza-military-strategy-mime-intl", "text": "The Israeli military has renewed its fighting in northern Gaza where it previously claimed to have dismantled Hamas\u2019 command structure. But it now says the Palestinian militant group is trying to \u201creassemble\u201d in the area, raising doubts about whether Israel\u2019s goal to eradicate the group in the enclave is realistic. Israel\u2019s renewed ground operation began on Saturday, with intense shelling and gunfire gripping much of the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza. The Israeli military also began operating in the area of Zeitoun in central Gaza, as it continues its offensive in eastern Rafah and near the Rafah crossing with Egypt. Israel\u2019s return to pockets it had supposedly cleared of Hamas renews questions about its long-term military strategy, which after more than seven months of war has left more than 35,000 Palestinians dead and much of Gaza in ruins \u2013 but more than 100 hostages from Israel still in captivity and Hamas\u2019 top leadership still at large. The resumption in fighting in the north comes as talks aimed at reaching a ceasefire-for-hostages deal have stalled, and as the Biden administration signals that the United States is losing patience with its closest ally in the Middle East. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave a scathing assessment of Israel\u2019s conduct in the war. In an interview on Sunday with CBS News, Blinken said any initial success in Israel\u2019s invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah \u2013 which Washington has strongly opposed \u2013 is \u201cnot sustainable.\u201d The top diplomat criticized Israel for neither having a \u201ccredible plan to protect civilians,\u201d nor a post-war plan for Gaza. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing parts of Gaza that Israel has cleared of Hamas, where Hamas is coming back, including in the north, including in Khan Younis,\u201d Blinken said, adding that a ground offensive in Rafah will leave Israel \u201cholding the bag on an enduring insurgency because a lot of armed Hamas will be left no matter what they do in Rafah.\u201d \u201cOr if they (Israel) leave and get out of Gaza as we believe they need to do, then you\u2019re going to have a vacuum and a vacuum that\u2019s likely to be filled by chaos by anarchy, and ultimately by Hamas again.\u201d Some Israeli experts say that Netanyahu\u2019s current war strategy, which is aimed at the complete destruction of Hamas in Gaza, is flawed and unrealistic as it lacks a long-term vision. \u201cIsrael\u2019s strategy is not a good one,\u201d said Danny Orbach, a military historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The tactic of endless clearing and degrading of Hamas\u2019 capabilities while avoiding the responsibility of governing Gaza will not work, he said. Netanyahu has previously said Israel will have the \u201coverall security responsibility\u201d in Gaza for an \u201cindefinite period\u201d after the war ends, a position that is at odds with that of the US. With no viable alternative government in place, Netanyahu \u201cas usual decides not to decide,\u201d Orbach said, adding that the ongoing strategy of \u201cclearing and degrading\u201d allows the prime minister to avoid making difficult decisions about post-war Gaza, while preventing Hamas from re-emerging as strong as it was before October 7. The Israeli leader is yet to present a post-war plan for the enclave. The US has pushed for a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA) to rule Gaza, which Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected. The PA is a government-in-waiting for a future independent Palestinian state it seeks in the occupied West Bank, occupied East Jerusalem and Gaza as part of a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Netanyahu has repeatedly said the military is on track to eliminate Hamas, and in an interview with Dr. Phil on Friday claimed that 14,000 Hamas fighters have so far been killed. Israel estimated Gaza to have 30,000 fighters before October 7. CNN cannot independently verify the figures provided by either the Palestinian health ministry or Israel due to reporting restrictions on international media. Former and current Israeli officials, including a top military figure, have sounded alarms at the direction Israel is heading with its war. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Major General Herzi Halevi over the weekend reportedly criticized Netanyahu\u2019s strategy. \u00a0\u201cAs long as there is no political move that will bring forth a governing body other than Hamas in the strip, we will have to operate again and again there and in other places to dismantle the Hamas infrastructure,\u201d Israel\u2019s Channel 13 cited Halevi as saying. \u201cIt will be a Sisyphean task,\u201d he said, suggesting that it may never be accomplished. Senior IDF officials have urged the prime minister to make decisions and formulate a strategy for the war, Channel 13 added. Israel\u2019s former head of military intelligence, Tamir Hayman, has also urged Israel\u2019s leadership to strike a hostage deal that includes an indefinite ceasefire and work with a reformed Palestinian Authority to restore order in Gaza. Hayman, who now heads the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, told CNN earlier that Israel risks falling into a perpetual war of attrition, where there is \u201cendless friction\u201d with its neighbors. A prolonged war, he said, risks either leaving Gaza under Hamas rule or at the mercy of a power vacuum where various armed groups may compete for authority. Others say the re-emergence of Hamas \u201cpockets\u201d is not unusual, and that the Israeli military will have to keep re-entering areas in Gaza until no more fighters emerge. \u201cThis process will happen again and again,\u201d Amir Aviv, former deputy commander of the Gaza Division of Israel\u2019s military, told CNN, until all \u201cpockets of resistance\u201d are removed. The former deputy commander believes it is possible to eradicate Hamas though. \u201cGaza is not endless, it is not so big,\u201d he said. \u201c(Israel) has reached the last stronghold (Rafah), and now Hamas is with their backs to the wall.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/middleeast/israel-restarts-fighting-north-gaza-military-strategy-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Al Aqsa hospital said it had received 29 bodies from one strike, nine of whom were children, while Al Awda hospital said it had received 11 bodies after the second strike. The strikes occurred at about 1 a.m. and 2:45 a.m. on Tuesday morning local time (6 p.m. and 7:45 p.m. Monday ET), according to witnesses. Rescue workers have continued efforts to find bodies underneath the rubble of a four-story building in Nuseirat that was demolished in the first strike. Witnesses said dozens of people had been sheltering in the building\u2019s yard. CNN video showed those injured and killed being brought into Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, while other video shows the bodies of several children being retrieved from the wreckage. Desperate family members surround the piles of rubble, waiting to see if anyone is rescued alive, the footage showed. But the workers at the scene clearly lack equipment to remove the concrete. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the two strikes. Some of those killed had recently arrived from Rafah, according to people at the scene. One witness, Ashraf Al Jalees, told CNN at the site: \u201cI swear these are innocent civilians \u2026They are all buried under the ground, including children. There are seven girls here. What fault did they have?\u201d He said he had set up a tent for a friend \u2013 Hassan Obeid \u2013 whom he said had \u201cno affiliation with Hamas or anyone else.\u201d Calling out Obeid\u2019s name, Al Jalees added: \u201cHe stayed to sleep here tonight, and the house collapsed on all of them \u2026 Over 50 people are under this, I swear to God they are all innocent civilians. God will question me one day if I am lying.\u201d Another man, Hamdan Karaja, told CNN: \u201cMy children, both girls and boys, are under the rubble. My wife as well.\u201d Karaja said he had seven children. He said the body of his father had been retrieved. \u201cWe have over 100 displaced individuals, with some comprising 20 family members. They are all trapped under the rubble. We were targeted while we were asleep, without any prior warning,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also have displaced people\u2019s tents in the yard. We have 10 martyrs here and 20 over there.\u201d Rami Al Aida, a Civil Defense spokesperson in Central Gaza, said crews were \u201coperating in extremely challenging conditions due to a lack of fuel and equipment. We hope to find people alive. We appeal to all international organizations to provide the Civil Defense with the necessary tools, bulldozers, and fuel.\u201d Al Aida agreed with the assessment of others at the site that dozens were still under the rubble. \u201cThere are over four families trapped under the rubble, in addition to the displaced families seeking shelter in and around the building. There are more than 100 people.\u201d A girl who gave her name as Sama Alousha said they had heard a detonation at about 1 a.m. \u201cWe all panicked and came to see what happened. I saw my friend\u2019s house completely destroyed. We are unable to rescue anyone. I have five friends trapped under this place.\u201d One unnamed man said he and his family had been displaced several times. \u201cWe were displaced from Shajaiya. We moved to Khan Younis and then to Rafah, and from Rafah, we came here. My brother rented a place here and stayed there with his family. \u201cSuddenly, I received a call informing me that the place where my brother was staying was hit. There are no tools to retrieve them. They are a family of six, all innocent civilians. My brother, his wife, and four children.\u201d He then called out the names of his brother\u2019s family, but there was no response. One tearful woman at the scene, Um Mahmoud, told CNN: \u201cMy brother arrived from Rafah three days ago after being forcibly displaced, and now we do not know his whereabouts. He, along with his wife and five children, has no connections with anyone. He is simply a displaced person who came from Rafah and was still searching for a place to stay in Deir el Balah. \u201cHis name was on the list of those supposed to leave Gaza through the Rafah border, but fate intervened,\u201d she added. A man called Salah Abu Jarada said his brother had also come from the Rafah area. \u00a0\u201cThey were hit, with three floors collapsing on top of them. They have not been rescued yet.\u201d A second strike occurred at the UNRWA school in Nuseirat about two hours after the first, according to witnesses. Ismail Abu Ghosheh said: \u201cEverything is burnt, and seven people were killed.\u201d Another man at the school, Najah Abu Daher, said: \u201cThere is no safe place to go. They follow us wherever we go. My son was killed, along with three of my relatives. They struck us in the dead of night, causing children to run everywhere and glass to shatter.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/14/middleeast/israel-airstrikes-gaza-hospitals-tuesday-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_weather_brazil-rain-floods-scli-intl", "text": "People in southern Brazil, already reeling from deadly floods, are bracing for more disruption after heavy rainstorms pummeled the area on Friday and meteorologists warned of more to come throughout the weekend. The death toll in the floods that have ravaged parts of the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul has inched up to 113, the state\u2019s civil defense agency said, as relentless downpours sweep the region and spread to parts of neighboring Uruguay. Officials are urging those who have been rescued from the floods not to return to their homes. Intense rain is expected to continue in parts of the state\u2019s center and east until Sunday, with some areas expecting 150 mm over that time, the national meteorology institute INMET said. North of the state capital, Porto Alegre, 100 millimeters of rain is expected to fall in 24 hours. \u201cIt is important to highlight that the predicted volumes of rain may cause new disruptions in areas already affected previously,\u201d a statement from INMET read. The storms have affected more than 1.9 million people in Brazil, and displaced hundreds of thousands, many of whom are staying in temporary shelters. Over 140 people are still missing. Scenes of the devastating weather event have been beamed all over the world, including video footage of a horse that had to be rescued after being stranded for several days on a rooftop. The animal was rescued on Thursday by members of Sao Paulo\u2019s military. According to state run Agencia Brasil, the horse \u2013 which has been baptized on social media as Caramelo \u2013 was sedated prior to being placed on a boat as part of the rescue. It had been stuck on the roof for four days surrounded by flood water in the municipality of Canoas in the Brazilian state Rio Grande do Sul. Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva posted a video on X of the moment he learned of the horse\u2019s rescue. Agencia Brasil, the sate-run news agency, has reported the rescue of more than 2,000 animals since the floods impacted Rio Grande du Sol, including dogs, cats, chickens, and pigs. Uruguay has also been flooded by the storms. More than 1,300 people there have been displaced there, while thousands more are without electricity, the national emergency system said on Wednesday night, without specifying if there were casualties. There are growing concerns that gangs may take advantage of the abandoned homes and businesses. At least 47 people have been arrested for crimes related to the catastrophic floods, 41 of whom are suspected of looting establishments. Six were allged to have committed sexual abuse in shelters, Agencia Brasil reported. The record rainfall has been linked to El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate phenomenon that warms waters in the Pacific and tends to bring heavy rainfall to southern Brazil. Long-term global warming, caused primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, has also exacerbated extreme weather in the region. Rio Grande do Sul \u2014 Brazil\u2019s southernmost state, and until recently a tranquil agricultural region \u2014 has seen repeatedly extreme weather events in recent years. According to the state government, 19 billion Brazilians reals ($3.7 billion US dollars) will be needed for rebuilding. Recent satellite mages from the state show entire neighborhoods of roads turned to rivers, a football pitch in a cavernous stadium submerged and an airport runway under water.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/weather/brazil-rain-floods-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
