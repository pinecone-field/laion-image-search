It was an explosive gamble and the\u00a0final\u00a0results took the country by surprise:\u00a0France\u2019s left-wing alliance coming in first with 182 seats and the far-right trailing in third place - a shocking reversal of last Sunday\u2019s first-round results. On Place de la Republique in Paris news of the projected results was met with rapturous applause and fireworks as people embraced one another, breathing a collective sigh of relief:\u00a0in their eyes,\u00a0France had been pulled back from the brink. Turnout on Sunday was the highest in a parliamentary election for more than 20 years as French citizens took to the ballot box to make their feelings known: they did not want the far-right to govern. However, with the left falling short of the 289 seats needed for a majority and with a weakened\u00a0president, the national assembly is expected to be more fractured than ever. What\u2019s certain is that France is set to enter a prolonged period of instability as three opposing blocs with competing ideas and agendas try to form coalition or find themselves stuck in a state of paralysis. Visibly disappointed, the far-right National Rally (RN) leader Jordan Bardella argued that\u00a0his\u00a0party\u2019s defeat was only made possible by the tactical voting orchestrated by\u00a0Macron and the\u00a0left-wing\u00a0NFP\u00a0coalition that\u00a0decided to withdraw 200 candidates from the race this week in an effort to block the far right. Though the RN didn\u2019t do as well as expected, it is still a victory for French far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen with her party\u00a0getting more votes with each passing election. 8 in 2017, 89 in 2022, 143 in 2024 \u2013 the latter with the help of allies. For the left-wing\u00a0NFP alliance,\u00a0it is\u00a0going to have a tough time speaking with one voice. The last time\u00a0it formed a bloc under the name of Nupes, in 2022,\u00a0it\u00a0fell apart\u00a0because of personal differences as well as policy. The bloc brings together five different parties. Far-left France Unbowed and the\u00a0Communist party\u00a0has\u00a0joined with the center-left parties, the socialists and the greens to form\u00a0a\u00a0New Popular Front. Now\u00a0the challenge\u00a0is no longer whether\u00a0the left\u00a0can unite against the far right, but rather can\u00a0the different groups\u00a0work together to agree first on who might be prime minister from their camp \u2013 and then on the policies they might pursue? How instability might impact internationally With such a divided parliament there is no hope for major structural reforms at a domestic level, the best\u00a0the leftists can hope for are\u00a0ad hoc alliances to vote through individual pieces of legislation. It\u2019s equally hard to imagine how the current constellation would allow France to play an important role regarding Ukraine.\u00a0Macron in the past has vowed to continue supporting Ukraine militarily while\u00a0Le Pen has said her\u00a0party would prevent Kyiv using French-supplied long-range weapons to strike inside Russia\u00a0and would oppose sending French troops. The left has remained relatively quiet on Ukraine - different parties from the coalition have slightly different stances - France Unbowed is against what\u00a0it\u00a0calls\u00a0\u201cescalation\u201d\u00a0with Russia. Macron\u2019s central bloc seems to have held up quite well,\u00a0winning 163 seats. Even though it lost roughly\u00a0100\u00a0MPs, it\u2019s a much better result than what the polls were suggesting, although we will see a shift in power from the Elys\u00e9e to the National Assembly. Macron\u2019s gamble may have prevented the far right from coming to power, but it could\u00a0yet\u00a0plunge the country into chaos. And with no parliamentary elections\u00a0scheduled\u00a0for another year, France is in for\u00a0anuncertain time with the eyes of the world firmly on Paris as it prepares to welcome the Olympics in three weeks\u2019 time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/europe/france-election-results-gamble-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_world_king-charles-australia-samoa-visit-intl", "text": "Britain\u2019s King Charles III and Queen Camilla are planning to head down under. The royal couple will travel to Australia in October as part of a tour that will also see them visit Samoa for this year\u2019s Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Buckingham Palace announced on Sunday. The forthcoming visit to Australia will be the 75-year-old British monarch\u2019s first trip to a Commonwealth realm since he ascended the throne. In addition to the United Kingdom, Charles is also head of state in 14 realms including Australia, New Zealand and Canada, though his role is largely ceremonial. Charles and Camilla are visiting the nation \u201cat the invitation of the Australian government, where their program will feature engagements in the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales,\u201d the palace said. He last visited Australia with his wife six years ago, when they traveled to the Gold Coast for the opening of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings \u2013 or CHOGM as they are known \u2013 are held every two years, with member states taking turns as host.\u00a0The theme of this year\u2019s event in Samoa, Charles\u2019 first as head of the organization, is \u201cOne Resilient Future: Transforming Our Common Wealth,\u201d and will see delegations from the 56 member states come together. \u201cTheir majesties\u2019 state visit to Samoa will celebrate the strong bilateral relationship between the Pacific Island nation and the UK,\u201d the palace added. Charles, who resumed public-facing duties in April as he continues his treatment for cancer, has had a busy calendar in recent months. Last month, he attended D-Day commemorations in France. More recently, he appointed Keir Starmer as prime minister after the Labour Party won a landslide victory at the polls, traveled to Scotland for the annual \u201cHolyrood Week\u201d celebrating Scottish culture and on Thursday visited the Welsh parliament in Cardiff to mark 25 years since Welsh devolution. On Monday, the royal couple are headed to the Channel Islands for a two-day visit. Further details on the king and queen\u2019s tours are expected to be revealed in the coming months. However, a palace spokesperson said that similarly to all of Charles\u2019s recent engagements, \u201chis program in both countries will be subject to doctors\u2019 advice, and any necessary modifications on health grounds.\u201d Some may wonder why the royal couple are not going to New Zealand while they are in the region. The palace spokesperson said that decision was made in consultation with the king\u2019s medical team who advised that \u201csuch an extended program should be avoided at this time\u201d in order to prioritize his continued recovery. \u201cIn close consultation with the Australian and New Zealand prime ministers, and with due regard for the pressures of time and logistics, it has therefore been agreed to limit the visit to Samoa and Australia only,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cTheir majesties send their warmest thanks and good wishes to all parties for their continued support and understanding,\u201d they added. The king\u2019s absence from undertaking any visits to any of the Commonwealth realms since his accession had raised eyebrows. There was much surprise when his first overseas tours as monarch were announced as France and Germany. Those were followed by travel to Kenya, which is a Commonwealth member but not a realm. Charles\u2019 visit to Australia will be a key test of his popularity as head of state. The nation \u2013 which was colonized by the British in 1788 \u2013 has long debated whether a long-distance monarch is still needed. A 1999 referendum on the issue saw voters opt to remain a constitutional monarchy, 55% to 45%. In other Commonwealth nations, Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s death renewed rumblings \u2013 some louder than others \u2013 of moves to sever ties with the crown and become republics. But in Australia, despite Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s pro-republic views, there has been no immediate push in that direction. Albanese had proposed to hold a referendum over whether the nation should become a republic if he secured a second term in 2025. However, those plans appear to have been shelved to focus on more pressing challenges at home like the cost-of-living crisis.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/world/king-charles-australia-samoa-visit-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_12_africa_dead-seals-cape-town-beaches-intl", "text": "Dead seals are washing up along beaches in South Africa\u2019s port city of Cape Town, a coastal management official told CNN Friday, amid an outbreak of rabies in the marine animals. \u201cWe believe this to be the first spread of rabies within a marine mammal population and that is concerning for us,\u201d said Cape Town\u2019s coastal manager Gregg Oelofse. Rabies in seals is rare and the only known case of the viral disease in a seal was\u00a0detected in the Svalbard islands of Norway\u00a0in 1980. Cape Town, home to\u00a0dozens of beaches\u00a0and a coastline extending over 300 kilometers (186 miles), harbors thousands of Cape fur\u00a0seals, a seal species\u00a0native to\u00a0southern Africa. The city has recorded \u201c11 positive rabies cases in seals so far,\u201d with the last positive case detected in a seal tested 10 days ago, according to Oelofse. He urged calm however, saying it is normal to find carcasses of Cape fur\u00a0seals\u00a0along the shoreline. While \u201clots\u201d of dead seals have washed ashore this week, many of them have died naturally, he said. He added that laboratory investigations were ongoing to determine how the seals were infected with the disease. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet where it started. They are genetically sequencing the rabies virus found. We will know when they are done with that,\u201d he said. The Western Cape provincial health department\u00a0alerted residents of a rabies risk\u00a0last month, warning of \u201cthe potential for rabies cases along the entire coastline where seals are present.\u201d Authorities said in late June that they had\u00a0confirmed seven cases of the disease\u00a0in seals from seven beaches in Cape Town and elsewhere on the Western Cape, urging residents to avoid contact with the animals. The first case was detected in October 2023, they noted. \u201cThere is no cause for panic,\u201d Cape Town city authorities stated at the time, adding that \u201cwhile rabies is new in Cape fur seals, it is endemic in many wildlife populations in South Africa.\u201d The area has witnessed many seal deaths in recent years. In November 2021, Western Cape provincial officials said they buried\u00a0close to 200 dead seals in a single day\u00a0after their carcasses washed ashore from suspected malnutrition. Rabies, which\u00a0is almost always fatal\u00a0once symptoms appear, is an infectious viral disease that affects the brain and central nervous system. According to the World Health Organization, dogs are the main source of\u00a0rabies transmission to humans. The virus is transmitted to humans through animal bites or scratches and can take between three and\u00a012 weeks\u00a0to begin showing symptoms. Oelofse said there was yet to be a seal-to-human transmission of rabies in Cape Town and the city\u2019s authorities were working to prevent it. \u201cWe have a lot of people\u00a0that are\u00a0coming into contact with seals daily such as surfers, kayakers, scuba divers, and others. So, one of the things that we want to avoid is the potential of transfer of rabies to a person and so far, that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/africa/dead-seals-cape-town-beaches-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_middleeast_mohammed-deif-hamas-commander-israeli-strike-intl", "text": "Israel has targeted Hamas\u2019 military chief Mohammed Deif in a strike on a designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza which killed at least 90 Palestinians. It is not clear yet if Deif was among the dead. But who is he? An elusive and powerful figure, Deif is understood to be one of the masterminds behind the October 7 attacks. He has led the Palestinian militant group\u2019s armed wing for more than two decades. If his death is confirmed, Deif would be the highest profile Hamas leader killed since the war in Gaza began nine months ago. Israel has been seeking to dismantle Hamas following the October 7 attacks but with fighting ongoing and senior Hamas figures at large, that goal has seemed distant. Deif is thought to have been born in the 1960s in the Khan Younis refugee camp, one of a number of such camps established in Gaza at the end of the 1940s for displaced Palestinians denied the freedom to return to their homes by the newly-created state of Israel. Born as Mohammad Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, he later became known as \u201cEl Deif\u201d or \u201cthe Guest\u201d due to his habit of staying in different houses every night for decades to avoid being tracked and killed by Israel. Deif has been at the top of Israel\u2019s most wanted list for decades, with Israel holding him responsible for the deaths of dozens of its citizens. Both the US and the EU have him on terror blacklists. He joined Hamas during the first Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, which began in 1987. He became a founding member of Hamas\u2019 armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, in the early 1990s. The military unit was established to support Hamas in its armed resistance against Israel and has since carried out numerous attacks, including suicide bombings. From the beginning, Deif has been a key architect in Hamas\u2019s strategy against Israel. He was behind a wave of suicide attacks in 1996 that killed 65 people in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, as well as other acts intended to derail the Israel-Palestine peace process. Deif rose through the ranks of the Qassam Brigades to be named its leader in 2002, after the previous commander was killed by Israel. Considered a highly-skilled bomb maker, he has played a significant role in developing Hamas\u2019s network of tunnels and bomb-making expertise. Over the years, Deif has survived numerous assassination attempts \u2013 a total of seven, according to Reuters. This includes a 2014 Israeli strike that killed his wife, his seven-month-old son and three-year-old daughter. He was seriously injured in one of the assassination attempts, sustaining serious leg injuries and losing an eye. Deif is understood to have played a role in orchestrating Hamas\u2019s brutal cross-border raids on October 7, which saw around 1,200 Israelis killed. Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has since killed more than 38,000 people. Soon after the attacks, he called for a general uprising. \u201cIf you have a gun, get it out. This is the time to use it \u2013 get out with trucks, cars, axes, today the best and most honorable history starts,\u201d he said in a recorded message. In May, the International Criminal Court (ICC) said it was seeking arrest warrants for Deif, as well as Yehiya Sinwar, Hamas\u2019s leader in Gaza, and Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas\u2019s political bureau head, saying they had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe they bore responsibility for the October 7 attacks. Deif, a man who lives his life in the shadows, has managed to survive for decades while running Hamas\u2019s armed wing. This achievement has earned him the nickname \u201cthe Cat with Nine Lives.\u201d It remains to be seen, however, whether Deif has survived this latest attempt on his life.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/middleeast/mohammed-deif-hamas-commander-israeli-strike-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_travel_buckingham-palace-east-wing-opening-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "Buckingham Palace\u2019s famous balcony room, where the monarch and other members of the royal family gather on special occasions before waving at cheering crowds in the streets below, is opening to the public for the first time. For royal fans who have waited for hours on The Mall in central London to get a glimpse of the clan as they make their brief balcony appearance during events such as Trooping the Colour, this could be an opportunity to see things from the royal perspective. Sadly, visitors will not be able to step out onto the balcony itself, so a peek through the net curtains will have to suffice. The 45-minute guided tours, running from July 15 to August 31, have already sold out, despite a hefty \u00a375 (around $97) price tag. They follow more than five years of renovation work to the East Wing of Buckingham Palace, which aims to preserve and improve access to the historic building for future generations, according to the Royal Collection Trust. \u201cBe one of the first visitors to enjoy an exclusive guided tour of the highlights of the East Wing of Buckingham Palace,\u201d the Royal Collection Trust says on its website, adding that visitors will get to discover the \u201cspaces beyond the famous fa\u00e7ade\u201d of the palace. The wing\u2019s Centre Room, as the room behind the balcony is officially known, will probably be the most anticipated part of the guided tour. Last month, Catherine, Princess of Wales joined other royals on the balcony to celebrate the King\u2019s official birthday, in her first public appearance since being diagnosed with cancer. In the Centre Room, a lotus flower-shaped glass chandelier will be on display, alongside two 18th-century Chinese silk wall hangings, which were given to Queen Victoria by the Emperor of China to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee in 1897. In the Yellow Drawing Room, hand-painted Chinese wallpaper from the 18th century, as well as two Chinese porcelain pagodas, will be on display. Visitors on the new tour will also be able to amble down the wing\u2019s main corridor and admire works by English painters Thomas Gainsborough and Thomas Lawrence and German painter Franz Xaver Winterhalter. The influence of Asian art on the interior design and displays of the East Wing can be traced to 1850, when the Brighton Pavilion,\u00a0 a seaside residence owned by George IV \u2013 Queen Victoria\u2019s uncle, was sold off to fund the building of the new royal wing. George IV\u2019s collection of Asian art and ceramics, which he had previously kept at the property on the south coast of England, was moved to the palace, where it remains to this day. Victoria and Prince Albert were the first royals to use Buckingham Palace as a family home, following their marriage in 1840. The East Wing was built shortly after, between 1847 and 1849, to accommodate their growing family. Today, Buckingham Palace is mainly used for official meetings and events. Britain\u2019s new prime minister, Keir Starmer, recently met with King Charles III at the palace, where the King formally asked him to form a new government. The East Wing refurb is part of a much broader \u2013 and more expensive \u2013 renovation of the palace at large, which is expected to take 10 years. In the process, floorboards have been taken up, new elevators have been installed, and thousands of artworks and artifacts have been temporarily removed to allow the restoration work to get underway. With its \u00a3369 million budget ($478 million), the extensive program of works has left a dent in royal finances. Official figures showed that the royal household spent more money than it made in 2022-23, partly because of what it described as the \u201csignificant\u201d renovation work at the palace. The East Wing tours are now fully booked for the summer, but if you\u2019re still wanting to check out the royal pad, tickets to visit Buckingham Palace\u2019s state rooms are still available, with tours running seven days a week until September 29. Tickets booked in advance for the state rooms tour cost \u00a332 ($41) for adults and \u00a316 ($21) for children between the ages of 5 and 17.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/travel/buckingham-palace-east-wing-opening-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Kyle\u00a0Clifford, 26, was found by officers in Enfield, north London, on Wednesday following an extensive manhunt. He was in serious condition in hospital, then arrested on Thursday, police said. \u201cA man has now been arrested in connection with a triple murder which happened on Tuesday evening,\u201d Hertfordshire Constabulary said Friday. Carol Hunt, 61, the wife of BBC horse racing commentator, John Hunt, and their daughters, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, were named as the victims of the attack. The three were found seriously injured at a house in the town of Bushey and later died in hospital. A crossbow was recovered as part of the investigation, which police believe was used in a \u201ctargeted incident.\u201d Detective Superintendent Rob Hall, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said Friday: \u201cOur thoughts remain with the victims\u2019 family at this tragic time.\u201d \u201cThe investigation is moving at pace and as a result, we have now arrested a man.

{"id": "2024_07_14_sport_spain-england-euro-2024-final-spt-intl", "text": "Spain won a record-breaking fourth European Championship, defeating England 2-1 following a drama-filled second half in the Euro 2024 final on Sunday in Berlin. Nico Williams \u2013 one of Spain\u2019s breakout performers at the tournament \u2013 gave La Roja the lead minutes into the second half when he smartly finished in the bottom corner from a perfectly-weighted pass from the team\u2019s other emerging star, freshly turned 17-year-old Lamine Yamal. England equalized midway through the second half through a brilliantly placed left-footed effort from Cole Palmer from outside the box to restore parity at the Olympiastadion in the German capital. But with just under five minutes remaining in regulation time, Spain took a late lead when Mikel Oyarzabal tapped home an inch-perfect pass from Marc Cucurella to cap off a victory and a terrific tournament for La Roja. It is Spain\u2019s fourth Euro title \u2013 having previously won in 1964, 2008 and 2012 \u2013 while for England, it is heartbreak for a second straight European Championship having been beaten by Italy on penalties at Euro 2020. The game began in tight fashion befitting a major final, with both teams feeling one another out as the players overcame any pre-match nerves. As predicted by many, Spain enjoyed the majority of the possession in the opening 30 minutes, however, it did so without producing any real goalscoring opportunities. While La Roja dominated the ball as it strived to create an opening, it was England which had the first shot on target on the stroke of halftime with a Phil Foden snapshot from close range, but it flew straight at Unai Sim\u00f3n in the Spanish goal. Spain was delt a major blow at halftime when one of its most important players, Manchester City midfielder Rodri, was forced off through injury. He was replaced by Real Sociedad\u2019s Mart\u00edn Zubimendi. But the Iberians didn\u2019t seem dismayed by the loss of their star midfielder when a sweeping move two minutes after the break was expectedly finished by Williams to give La Roja a deserved lead. At the age of 22 years and two days old, Williams became the second youngest player to score in a Euro final. The goal seemed to kick Spain up a gear, with Dani Olmo coming inches away from extending the lead a minute later, but his effort flew wide of the post. England was on the ropes in the aftermath of Williams\u2019 goal, first with captain \u00c1lvaro Morata\u2019s deft dink being cleared away by John Stones before the Athletic Bilbao man fired just wide as he searched for his second of the game. As the Three Lions sought a way back into the game, manager Gareth Southgate made the bold decision to bring off captain and all-time record goalscorer Harry Kane and replace him with Ollie Watkins, fresh off scoring a last-gasp winner in the semifinal against the Netherlands to book the team\u2019s spot in the final. The substitution seemed to galvanize the English, with the team playing with more verve and pace. Jude Bellingham fired an effort wide of the post which had the England fans on their feet for the first time in a while. But just when England was building a head of steam, Spain almost got a second through Yamal \u2013 who became the youngest player ever to feature in a Euro or World Cup final when he stepped onto the field on Sunday night \u2013 but Jordan Pickford stuck out a big hand to deny the Barcelona prodigy. England did eventually get its goal \u2013 and it came from one of Southgate\u2019s substitutes. Chelsea midfielder Palmer, who had been introduced into the game for 19-year-old Kobbie Mainoo just minutes before, latched onto a neat set-up from Bellingham and caressed an inch-perfect effort into the bottom corner to level the score. Spain built itself back into the game and came close to retaking the lead with 10 minutes remaining after some intricate build-up play left Yamal one-on-one with Pickford, but the 17-year-old\u2019s effort was parried away by the England goalkeeper. As time ticked away and extra-time loomed, Spain finally got its deserved late goal through another flowing move which ended with Cucurella sliding in an appealing cross for Oyarzabal to steer home and spark wild celebrations. England had become renowned for late heroics at Euro 2024, and the squad needed yet another moment of magic if it had any hopes of getting back into the game. As the clock hit 90 minutes, a corner was headed towards goal by Declan Rice, with Sim\u00f3n parrying it out to Guehi whose effort was cleared off the line by RB Leipzig man Dani Olmo as Spain\u2019s defense celebrated thwarting another English attack. The Three Lions threw everything they could to take it to extra time, but after four additional minutes, referee Fran\u00e7ois Letexier blew the final whistle and Spain\u2019s players dropped to the ground before joining the sea of fans clad in red and yellow inside the stadium in celebration. Royal support Ahead of the lifting of the trophy, Rodri was named the Euro 2024 player of the tournament, while Yamal was named the young player of the tournament. Yamal, who turned 17 the day before the final, appeared in every one of Spain\u2019s seven games in Germany, providing a tournament-high four assists and scoring one goal: a stunning, record-breaking effort in the semifinal against France which made him the youngest ever scorer in Euro history. For England, its 58-year search for a major men\u2019s international trophy goes on after winning the World Cup in 1966. Afterwards, King Charles III released a message of support for the England players on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cAlthough victory may have eluded you this evening, nevertheless my wife and I join all my family in urging you and your support team to hold your heads high. All those who have participated in sporting activities at any level will know how utterly despairing such a result can feel when the prize was so near \u2013 and will join me in sending heartfelt sympathy, even as we congratulate Spain. \u201cBut please know that your success in reaching the European Championship final is a really great achievement in itself, and one that brings with it the pride of a nation which will continue to roar for the Three Lions today \u2013 and in the many triumphs which I have no doubt lie ahead.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/sport/spain-england-euro-2024-final-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_13_middleeast_mawasi-deif-israel-hamas-gaza-intl", "text": "At least 90 Palestinians have been reported killed in an Israeli strike on a displacement camp in southern Gaza which Israel said targeted Hamas\u2019 military chief, who was an alleged mastermind of the October 7 attacks. Footage from Al-Mawasi, which has been designated as a safe zone for Palestinians fleeing the fighting elsewhere, shows bodies in the street and destroyed tents. A senior staffer at UNRWA, the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees, described the Nasser hospital, which took in victims of the strike, as \u201cthe most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.\u201d \u201cI saw toddlers who are double amputees, children paralyzed and unable to receive treatment, and others separated from their parents.\u201d Mohammed Deif \u2013 the leader of Qassam Brigades, Hamas\u2019 military wing \u2013 was the figure targeted, alongside the head of the Khan Younis brigade, Rafe Salama, an Israeli security official told CNN. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference in Tel Aviv Saturday that he was not certain whether Deif and his deputy had been killed, but said he had given his blessing for the head of Shin Bet \u2013 Israel\u2019s security agency \u2013 to carry out the operation after being assured there were no hostages in the area. The strike left scenes of devastation, with the Gaza Health Ministry reporting at least 90 people killed and 300 people injured. It said women and children accounted for half of those killed and dozens of those injured. CNN has no way of verifying the casualty numbers reported by the ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants killed. The Kuwait and Nasser Hospitals on the ground said they were struggling to cope with the high numbers of dead and injured civilians coming in, the ministry said. \u201cI was sitting in the bathroom, and before I heard explosions from the strike, the bathroom flew off,\u201d a young boy called Hammoud told a CNN stringer on the ground. \u201cThen, the whole area became filled with smoke, and then the shells began to fall.\u201d Hammoud\u2019s young brother was killed in the strike whilst his sister is currently in hospital receiving treatment for her injuries, his family told CNN. Another resident named Aida Hamdi told CNN: \u201cWe suddenly heard missiles hitting. I was baking bread, I took my daughter and we started running outside. \u201cI threw all the dough away, it was mixed with sand. We heard three hits, people around me were martyred, women, men, and children.\u201d Hamas denied Israeli claims it had targeted Deif and Salama, calling the killings a \u201chorrific massacre.\u201d \u201cThe occupation\u2019s claims of targeting leaders are false claims, and this is not the first time the occupation has claimed to target Palestinian leaders, only for its lies to be exposed later,\u201d a statement read. At least one US-made munition was used in the airstrike. In a video shared on social media, CNN identified the tail fin of a Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), a Boeing-manufactured GPS-guided kit which can be added to so-called \u2018dumb bombs\u2019 to direct them at a specific target. Trevor Ball, a former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, confirmed the identification of the JDAM tail at the scene for CNN. Similar CNN analysis has found US-made munitions were used in a strike on a school complex near Khan Younis and in other Israeli strikes on Gaza. A shadowy figure Israeli security and intelligence first received intelligence about a potential opportunity to strike Hamas\u2019 top military commander in recent days, but a clear window of opportunity to strike Deif only crystallized in the last 24 hours, an Israeli official said. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Israeli military chief of staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and top Shin Bet officials held multiple discussions overnight to assess the viability of a strike before the green light was given, the official said. A key focus of the discussions was assessing Israeli intelligence indicating that there were no hostages in the area, the official added, as well as the effect that carrying out such a significant strike might have on ongoing ceasefire and hostage deal negotiations. US officials said that Israel informed the United States that they had targeted senior Hamas officials in an airstrike Saturday but did not give advance warning of the operation. Little is known about Deif. Thought to have been born in the 1960s, Deif is a bomb maker was behind a wave of suicide attacks in 1996 that killed 65 people in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and other outrages intended to derail the peace process. His full name is Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, but he became known as El Deif (the Guest), because, for decades, he stayed in different houses every night to avoid being tracked, and killed, by Israel. Deif has been the target of Israeli assassination attempts before. A 2014 Israel strike killed his wife, seven-month-old son and three-year-old daughter. In May, the International Criminal Court said it was seeking arrest warrants for Deif and other senior Hamas figures, saying they had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe they bore responsibility for the October 7 attacks, which saw around 1,200 Israelis killed. Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza - aimed at destroying Hamas and rescuing hostages still being held - has since killed more than 38,000 people. Pressure on ceasefire deal The strike comes at a delicate time in negotiations for a possible ceasefire and hostage release deal. While killing Deif would be seen as a major victory for Israel, it could encourage Hamas to harden its position on a three-phase Israeli proposal that was laid out by US President Joe Biden at the end of May. Talks to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages are ongoing. A Hamas political official denied reports on Sunday that Hamas is halting ceasefire negotiations due to Saturday\u2019s strike. Izzat Al-Rishq also called the strike an \u201cescalation\u201d and claimed one of the Israeli government\u2019s goals \u201cis to block the path to reaching an agreement that stops the aggression against our people.\u201d Meanwhile, at his press conference Saturday, Netanyahu insisted he would not move \u201cone millimeter\u201d from the framework laid out by Biden. He claimed Hamas had requested 29 changes to the proposal, but he refused to make even one. \u201cI\u2019m not adding conditions or removing conditions,\u201d he said. Hamas has not yet publicly commented on Netanyahu\u2019s claims. However, a diplomatic source involved in the negotiations said the ceasefire talks were still scheduled to take place in Doha, Qatar, next week despite the strike. In Israel on Saturday, protesters and families of hostages took to the streets of several cities to demand the government secure a deal to release all the hostages. In Jerusalem, masses outside the Knesset demanded the government accept the hostage release deal and bring everyone home now. Some protesters also gathered outside Netanyahu\u2019s office. In Tel Aviv, Andrey Kozlov, who was held hostage in Gaza for eight months before the Israeli military rescued him in June, addressed the crowd. \u201cI want to share that every day in Gaza was a living hell; every day felt like it could be my last on earth. Take it from me, every day matters, every minute, even every second,\u201d Kozlov said from the Hostage Square in Tel Aviv. \u201cI may look okay to you from the outside, but the pain weighs on me more than anyone can see, more than anyone can imagine,\u201d he added. \u201cI was one of the lucky ones since I wasn\u2019t held in a tunnel. So, I endured harsh conditions and abuse (but) what about the remaining 120 hostages?\u201d Kozlov said. Kozlov also urged Netanyahu to bring the rest of the hostages back home saying, \u201cPlease sign a deal!\u201d The Hostage and Missing Families Forum reminded Netanyahu there would be \u201cno victory\u201d before all the 120 hostages were brought home. The \u201cdeal is in the final stages before signing and returning the hostages home; it is time to instruct the negotiation teams to reach agreements and bring everyone home,\u201d\u00a0it said in a statement. \u201cWe have been waiting for them for 281 days.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_ammo-arrests-turks-and-caicos", "text": "All five Americans arrested in recent months in Turks and Caicos under gun control laws that make bringing firearms or ammunition into the territory without prior permission from police a crime has been sentenced. Michael Lee Evans, of Texas; Sharitta Grier, of Florida; Bryan Hagerich, of Pennsylvania; Ryan Tyler Watson, of Oklahoma; and Tyler Wenrich, of Virginia, were all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to Turks and Caicos, a 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. All have said the ammunition recovered from their luggage was not intentionally packed, according to American lawmakers who went to the British Overseas Territory in May as part of efforts to petition for their expedited release. Though the infractions had carried a mandatory 12-year prison sentence and fine \u2013 with reductions only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d \u2013 a mid-June revision clarified courts may impose a fine, a custodial sentence or both in exceptional circumstances, a member of the territory\u2019s House of Assembly said June 14. All five Americans arrested under the law have pleaded guilty, been sentenced and returned to the US. Here\u2019s what we know about the laws in Turks and Caicos and the affected Americans: No constitutional right to carry firearms in Turks and Caicos Though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased \u2013 and that\u2019s a worry, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said. While it is legal to fly in the US with unloaded firearms and ammunition in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration, taking firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d The mandatory sentence was in place to protect those on the islands, Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam has said, adding judges could use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said: \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly.\u201d Even so, the \u201camendment was introduced to address concerns about the rigidity of the previous sentencing framework, which mandated both imprisonment and financial penalties for all firearms offenses, regardless of the specific context or severity,\u201d House of Assembly member\u00a0Edwin\u00a0Astwood said in a statement. \u201cThis often resulted in disproportionately harsh sentences that did not always fit the nature of the crime or the circumstances of the offender.\u201d US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials have said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick has said, and none got a 12-year sentence. While Turks and Caicos collaborates with the US in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d Sharitta Shinese Grier Grier was sentenced July 11 to a suspended\u00a023-week sentence and fined $1,500 following her\u00a0arrest in mid-May, her attorney Sheena C. Mair\u00a0confirmed to CNN. Grier planned to pay the fine and board a same-day flight from\u00a0Turks\u00a0and Caicos to the United States, Mair said. She arrived in Florida later that evening, CNN affiliate WKMG reported. \u201cIf she behaves for 12 months, nothing will happen. But if she gets in trouble in (Turks and Caicos) in those 12 months, she will serve 23 weeks,\u201d the attorney told CNN. Grier told WKMG her ordeal was \u201can emotional rollercoaster.\u201d \u201cI had ups and downs. Some days, I\u2019d be OK. The next day, I\u2019m down,\u201d she said. Grier offered a warning to travelers: \u201cBe very careful because other countries got different laws than we do, so that\u2019s very serious.\u201d The Florida mother had no idea two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, she told CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen because I couldn\u2019t believe it was in there,\u201d she said in May. \u201cThey went through my bag and said they found rounds at the bottom of my carry-on.\u201d Grier had been released on bail but couldn\u2019t leave the island until her case concluded and had to report to a local police station weekly, the station reported. \u201cI\u2019m just broken,\u201d Grier said in May. Bryan Hagerich Hagerich was the first of the five to return to the United States after he received a suspended 52-week sentence in late May, which meant he didn\u2019t face immediate incarceration, his representatives said. He was also given a $6,700 fine. The father of two pleaded guilty to possession of 20 rounds of ammunition, according to the Turks and Caicos government.  Hagerich paid the fine and was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory. He got home May 24, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign, a group that helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. Arriving at Pittsburgh International Airport, Hagerich told reporters he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d to have his two children jump into his arms, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WTAE. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Hagerich said. \u201cA lot of memories to make together. Just so elated to see them. They\u2019ve been so strong through all this.\u201d Before Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, his wife had packed two suitcases \u2013 one if he was sentenced to prison and another if he were allowed to return home \u2013 they said in an exclusive interview with \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cIt was dark; you have no concept of time,\u201d Hagerich said about his week-long stay in jail in Turks and Caicos. \u201cI was with three folks that were accused of murder. It was scary.\u201d Tyler Wenrich Wenrich pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. He was sentenced May 28 to three weeks time-served in jail and fined $9,000, said Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, a Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands spokesperson said that day in a statement. He returned home to Virginia on May 30. The Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case, saying, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Wenrich was charged with possession of two 9 mm rounds, according to the Turks and Caicos government. Michael Lee Evans Evans pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9 mm rounds of ammunition and appeared before the court on April 24 via video conference. He was allowed to return to the United States on bail due to a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation and to attend his June sentencing hearing virtually, said his attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel. Evans got a suspended 33-month sentence, and his attorney believes it is unlikely he will have to serve time in jail. \u201cIf he has no problems in (Turks and Caicos) within 12 months, he will not have to do any time,\u201d Smith told CNN on June 24. Ryan Tyler Watson Watson was visiting Turks and Caicos with his wife in April to celebrate several friends\u2019 40th birthdays when he was charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition. He plead guilty in May. The first of the Americans to be sentenced under the amended firearms law, he got a suspended 13-week sentence and a $2,000 fine, or $500 per bullet, a spokesperson for the Turks and Caicos Islands Supreme Court told CNN on June 21. Watson soon returned home and reunited with his family, US Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said on X. US lawmakers tried to free Americans The Americans\u2019 arrest has stoked tension between US officials and their counterparts just a few hundred miles away. A request by a US congressional delegation to the islands in May for charges against the five Americas to be dropped did not yield the desired result. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today,\u201d Republican US Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said May 20 in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now, (where) every third week an American is being detained wrongfully (in) Turks and Caicos,\u201d Republican US Rep.\u00a0Guy Reschenthaler told ABC News the same week. Meanwhile, the prison on Turks and Caicos has been flagged by the United Nations for humanitarian concerns, Reschenthaler told CNN. In a House of Assembly address, the islands\u2019 Misick said, \u201cThe (accusations) of congressman (Reschenthaler) against the government and people of the Turks and Caicos Islands are nothing more than diabolic falsehoods.\u201d Reschenthaler, for his part, wanted to see a \u201cresolution here where the Americans get zero amount of jail time. They should be given time served and be sent home to the United States,\u201d the congressman told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on May 20. \u201cThey were innocent mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny other nation would handle this with a fine in sending that person back to the country of origin. Here, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d On May 28, Mullin welcomed the news of Wenrich\u2019s release, calling it \u201canother step in the right direction,\u201d according to a post on X. \u201cI again encourage TCI to address the unintended consequences of their law to prevent this from happening again.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_07_11_tech_apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets", "text": "Apple has yielded to pressure by European regulators to give rivals access to the contactless payments technology on iPhones, meaning that their users will no longer be limited to the Apple Pay mobile wallet. The development on the tap-to-pay technology underscores mounting regulatory scrutiny of Apple (AAPL) in the European Union, where it is also facing a potential huge fine for allegedly breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, announced this and other changes to Apple\u2019s business practices Thursday, saying they would open up competition in mobile payments on iPhones. \u201ciPhone users will (now) be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores\u2026 while enjoying all the iPhone functionalities, including double click, tap-and-go and Face ID,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager told journalists. The tech giant has until July 25 to implement the changes, which will remain in force for 10 years and apply throughout the 30 countries in the European Economic Area. Under the agreement, third-party mobile wallet developers will gain free access to the standard technology used for contactless payments with iPhones, known as near-field communication (NFC) technology. Apple will also allow iPhone users to choose which mobile wallet to make the default wallet on their phones. \u201cApple is providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and\u00a0contactless\u00a0transactions for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets\u00a0from within their iOS apps,\u201d Apple said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cApple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the European Economic Area for users and developers.\u201d The European Commission first raised objections against Apple\u2019s tap-to-pay practices in 2022, having opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple Pay two years earlier. The regulators found that Apple had abused its dominant market position by restricting access to the NFC technology needed to make payments on mobile devices. That means rivals wanting to create apps or wallets using the tap-to-pay features on iPhones have been unable to do so and users have been forced to use Apple Pay for mobile payments. \u201cFrom now on, Apple can no longer use its control of the iPhone ecosystem to keep (competing) mobile wallets out of the market,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cCompeting wallet developers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice while keeping payments secure.\u201d The commitments do not extend to Apple Watches, however. \u201cOur impression was that the number of people who use Apple Watches for payments is rather small,\u201d said Vestager, adding that there was \u201climited harm done\u201d from excluding those devices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/tech/apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_08_europe_ukraine-russian-strike-childrens-hospital-intl", "text": "A Russian missile strike partially destroyed a children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv on Monday, causing terrified patients and their families to flee for their lives. Moscow launched a brazen daytime aerial assault on targets in cities across Ukraine during morning rush hour, killing at least 43 people, according to the latest figures released by authorities on Tuesday. Search and rescue operations continued into Tuesday after the large-scale bombardment struck the capital, as well as in Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. The death toll includes 33 people in Kyiv, Ukrainian interior minister Ihor Klymenko said in an update Tuesday. Earlier, Ukraine\u2019s State Emergency Service said four children were among the dead after a boy\u2019s body was found under the rubble in the capital\u2019s Shevchenkivskyi district. Two people were killed and at least 16 others injured in the strike on Kyiv\u2019s Okhmatdyt hospital. The facility is Ukraine\u2019s largest children\u2019s medical center and has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country. Every year, around 7,000 surgeries \u2013 including treatments for cancer and hematological diseases \u2013 are conducted at the hospital, according to Ukraine\u2019s human rights ombudsman\u00a0Dmytro Lubinets. Footage from the children\u2019s hospital showed volunteers working with police and security services to sift through the rubble as smoke billowed from the facility, as staff described how they tried to rush children to safety in the wake of the attack. Two floors of the hospital were demolished, comprising\u00a0an area of 400 square meters (4,300 sq. ft.), the emergency service said, while Ukraine\u2019s health minister Viktor Liashko said intensive care units, oncology departments and surgery units had been damaged. \u201cNow we have evacuated all the children. Those who came for routine treatment have gone home, consulted with their doctors, and will decide where they will continue their treatment,\u201d he told CNN Tuesday. \u201cThe rest of the children who were on oxygen support and connected to life support devices are now in hospitals and are being provided with adequate medical care.\u201d The attacks were part of a rare daylight bombardment on Ukrainian cities, some of which are heavily populated areas far from the front lines. It came a day before US President Joe Biden was set to host a crucial NATO Summit in Washington, where announcements over the alliance\u2019s military, political and financial support for Kyiv are expected. Biden called the strikes a \u201chorrific reminder of Russia\u2019s brutality.\u201d \u201cIt is critical that the world continues to stand with Ukraine at this important moment and that we not ignore Russian aggression,\u201d Biden said, noting that he would meet with Volodymyr Zelensky during the summit \u201cto make clear our support for Ukraine is unshakeable.\u201d Meanwhile, seven people were killed in a Russian attack Monday on a private medical facility in Kyiv belonging to the Adonis network, the company said. Of those killed, five were staff members and two were patients, Adonis said. Russia\u2019s defense ministry on Monday claimed that Moscow had struck \u201cmilitary industrial facilities of Ukraine and air bases of the Ukrainian armed forces\u201d using long-range, high-precision weapons. At a special meeting of the UN Security Council on Tuesday called to discuss the Russian strike, Russian UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia denied targeting the children\u2019s hospital. \u201cWe have not bombed the children\u2019s hospital,\u201d Nebenzia said\u00a0when responding to an accusation that Russia committed a war crime for allegedly striking the hospital. Eyewitnesses recount hospital strike Eyewitnesses recalled scenes of chaos moments after the Russian missile slammed into the children\u2019s hospital. Ophthalmologist Lesya Lysytsia told CNN: \u201cYou see the light, then the sound, then everything falls down and then over the next several seconds you think, \u2018are you still alive or is it the end and what to do? Where are the patients? How are the patients? How are the children?\u2019\u201d Natalia Sardudinova, a senior nurse, described the strike as \u201cscary,\u201d when \u201cwindows were crunching.\u201d She told CNN that two children were in operating theaters at the time of the blast, and they were relocated to a shelter in the basement once their procedures were completed. \u201cEverything was in smoke, there was no air to breathe. The doctor was cut by shrapnel. The windows and doors were blown out. One nurse in the hospital was heavily injured,\u201d Sardudinova added. \u201cMy hands are still shaking. They don\u2019t let anyone in now, they are afraid it will collapse.\u201d Yulia Vasylenko, the mother of an 11-year-old cancer patient at the hospital, said her son Denys was evacuated outside following the strike. \u201cMy son is on painkillers. He has cancer. He has been without medication for half a day. He was brought down the stairs from the third floor. There was smoke (and) heavy dust,\u201d she said. Iryna Filimonova, a senior nurse at the pediatric urology department, told CNN an operation on a 2-year-old was underway when the strike happened. \u201cThe lights went out, everything went out. We pulled out the instruments, shining flashlights. Everything was sewn up quickly,\u201d Filimonova said. \u201cThe baby was brought down (to the shelter)\u2026 Some of my nursing colleagues who worked in the operating theaters and some doctors were cut by glass fragments. Our department was destroyed.\u201d Another operating theater nurse, Oksana Mosiychuk, said one medical team tried to extinguish a blaze that broke out in their department, including an operating table which had caught fire. Air raid sirens continued to ring out over Kyiv in the aftermath, with CNN video showing people who had been evacuated pushing children on stretchers to safety. Scores of volunteers later dropped off much-needed supplies and donations \u2013 including water, food, medicine and diapers \u2013 to the hospital. A UN team who visited the site later saw children \u201creceiving treatment for cancer in hospital beds set up in parks and on streets, where medical workers had quickly established triage areas, amongst chaos, dust and debris,\u201d the UN\u2019s human rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. In the hospital\u2019s newer building, 12 departments were damaged, and a section of Ukraine\u2019s only oncology and hematology laboratory was completely destroyed, according to the Kyiv military administration. UN holds special meeting Zelensky had called for an emergency assembly of the UN Security Council after the strike while vowing retaliation over the attacks. At the special meeting Tuesday, Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador, alleged, without any proof, that a\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0anti-aircraft missile is what struck the hospital. \u201cIf this had been a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building at all. All the children and most of the adults would have been killed, not wounded,\u201d Nebenzia said. Ukraine shot down 30 out of 38 missiles launched by Russia during the Monday attack, the commander of the Ukrainian Air Force said in a statement, adding that Moscow used ballistic, cruise, guided and air-launched ballistic missiles. Ukrainian defense minister, Rustem Umerov, appealed for more air defense systems to support the war-torn country. Zelensky has repeatedly called on the West to provide it with more air defense systems to better protect its cities. Last month, he praised Biden for prioritizing a delivery after the two presidents signed a security agreement. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general sent evidence of Monday\u2019s Russian attacks to the office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court on Monday. It came as several European nations denounced the shelling, with France urging for the attack to \u201cbe added to the list of war crimes for which Russia will be held to account.\u201d Germany and Slovakia have agreed to take in children from Ukraine for treatment. German health minister Karl Lauterbach said a rescue flight will leave on Wednesday, according to a post from the German embassy in London on X. Meanwhile, the Czech foreign minister said he summoned the Russian ambassador in Prague over the attack on the hospital. Monday\u2019s attack is the tragic but all too familiar reality for many of Ukraine\u2019s civilians over the past two and a half years since Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion. Since February 2022, the conflict has claimed the lives of 11,126 people and injured 21,863 others, according to data in May from the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. Additionally, the heavy fighting has caused an estimated 3.7 million people to be driven from their homes and internally displaced while nearly 6.5 million people have fled to neighboring countries, the UNHCR has said. According to the World Health Organization, there have been more than 1,600 instances of heavy weapons attacks impacting medical facilities in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion, with 141 people killed in these attacks. Health minister Liashko told CNN on Tuesday that of the impacted facilities, \u201cmore than 250 have been completely destroyed and cannot be restored. Only new ones can be built.\u201d Last December, 12 pregnant women and four newborn babies had a fortunate escape from a maternity hospital in Dnipro that had been extensively damaged in an airstrike. Previously, the bombing of a maternity and children\u2019s hospital in Mariupol less than a month after Russian troops flooded across the border sparked international condemnation.

{"id": "2024_07_12_uk_starmer-nato-biden-interview-tapper-gbr-intl", "text": "Winston Churchill, often considered Britain\u2019s greatest leader, resigned at 80 in the face of mounting health problems. Keir Starmer, Britain\u2019s newest leader, wants to force lawmakers in the country\u2019s upper chamber to step down at the same age. Does this mean he thinks octogenarians like President Joe Biden should step back from politics? \u201cObviously in America, it\u2019s for the American people to decide who they want to be their president,\u201d Starmer told\u00a0CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper\u00a0in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington, a week after he became prime minister of the United Kingdom. Despite growing questions about Biden\u2019s mental acuity and fitness for a second term, Starmer said the 81-year-old president had been \u201cin good form\u201d when the two met for talks,\u00a0but \u201cof course\u201d he would say if he was concerned about him. In the interview on CNN\u2019s The Lead,\u00a0Starmer also reaffirmed his new government\u2019s \u201cunshakable support\u201d for the NATO alliance,\u00a0described King Charles III as \u201cincredible,\u201d\u00a0and discussed how he \u201cdragged\u201d his party back to the center ground in British politics, a feat which helped him consign the Conservative Party to its worst-ever defeat in last week\u2019s election. Starmer, 61, is the latest in a series of world leaders who have been asked whether Biden is too old to campaign and govern effectively. But he spoke positively about their discussions at the summit on Wednesday. \u201cWe were billed for 45 minutes. We probably went on for the best part of an hour, covered a lot of ground \u2013 and he was in good form,\u201d Starmer\u00a0told Tapper. Starmer said the talks were \u201ca really good opportunity\u201d for him to \u201cspeak to the president about the special relationship\u201d between their two countries. He said Biden \u201cdeserves credit\u201d for presiding over a summit that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called a success. Zelensky\u2019s comments were made before Biden mistakenly introduced the Ukrainian leader as \u201cPresident Putin,\u201d having to correct himself hastily. In a press conference later Thursday evening, Biden also mistakenly called his Vice President, Kamala Harris \u201cVice President Trump\u201d when discussing if she could beat the former president. On his plan to force lawmakers in the House of Lords \u2013 which scrutinizes the government and makes recommendations on laws \u2013 to step down after turning 80, Starmer said the policy was \u201cmore to do with the size\u201d of the unelected upper chamber than the fitness of elderly politicians. \u201cOur second chamber is the biggest second chamber in the world. We\u2019ve got over 800 members. We\u2019ve got to get the size down,\u201d he said. Starmer is not alone in trying to downplay concerns about Biden\u2019s age. French President Emmanuel Macron, attending the summit in a weakened position with his country in political limbo after a snap parliamentary election, said Biden remained \u201cin charge\u201d and \u201cclear on the issues he knows well.\u201d Starmer was\u00a0also\u00a0asked\u00a0by Tapper\u00a0to clarify comments made by David Lammy, a longstanding Labour politician who became Britain\u2019s foreign secretary last week. In 2018, Lammy called then-President Donald Trump \u2013 who will also turn 80 in office if re-elected to a second term in November \u2013 a \u201cwoman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath\u201d and a \u201cprofound threat to the international order.\u201d Starmer said his government will \u201cwork with whoever is elected\u201d in November, but stressed \u201cI\u2019m a progressive and we\u2019re sister parties with the Democrats.\u201d Starmer\u2019s comments echoed his previous remarks on a potential Trump presidency; he told the BBC last year he would \u201chave to make it work,\u201d though that doesn\u2019t mean \u201cwe would agree on everything.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s threats to leave NATO and cut a deal with Putin, likely ending the war in Ukraine on terms favorable to Russia, Starmer praised the \u201cclarity of purpose\u201d that other members have shown in the alliance during the summit. He also said Britain remains \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to raising its defense spending to 2.5% \u2013 above the NATO guideline of 2% \u2013 but did not provide a timeline for this. \u201cMy position as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom could not be clearer, which is an unshakable support for NATO,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were proudly one of the countries that was there at the founding of NATO\u2026 We\u2019re proud of that history.\u201d Tacking to the center A week ago, Starmer guided the Labour Party to a historic victory, winning a majority of 172 seats in the House of Commons and bringing to an end 14 years of Conservative rule. But, almost immediately, Starmer\u2019s victory was described as hollow and his mandate fragile, with critics pointing out Labour\u2019s relatively low share of the popular vote, despite its commanding victory under Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system. Asked if his victory was fueled more by anger towards the Conservatives than enthusiasm for Labour, Starmer hit back, saying his team deserved praise for turning the party around after it slumped to a dismal defeat in 2019 under the left-wing leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cI took over the Labour Party four and a half years ago. We\u2019d just had the worst general election result since 1935. The pessimists were saying, \u2018The Labour Party will never win a general election again.\u2019 The optimists said, \u2018Well you might, but it will take you 10 years,\u2019\u201d Starmer said. \u201cI said, \u2018No, we\u2019re going to do it in one parliamentary term. But we\u2019ve got to be ruthless, we\u2019ve got to be steely, we\u2019re going to change the Labour Party, we\u2019re going to turn it inside out and make sure it\u2019s a party that always says: Country first, party second.\u2019\u201d He said he had managed to pull his party back to the center ground, shunning the extremes. \u201cBrits are reasonable, tolerant \u2013 they don\u2019t much like the extreme left, they don\u2019t much like the extreme right. And we underestimate that,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the phrases I used in the election was we need a politics that trod more lightly on people\u2019s lives. And that\u2019s very important in Britain.\u201d Although he ruled out trying to rejoin the European Union, Starmer said he wanted to \u201creset\u201d Britain\u2019s relationship with the bloc. Starmer\u2019s \u201cnumber one mission,\u201d he said, is to restore Britain to economic growth, which has virtually flatlined since the 2008 financial crisis Starmer has softened his view on the British monarchy, having once talked about abolishing it, and said he was looking forward to his weekly audience with King Charles III, now he\u2019s become prime minister. \u201cIt is always valuable to listen to what he has to say. He\u2019s incredibly interested in politics, in the affairs across the United Kingdom, and global affairs,\u201d said Starmer. \u201cThey\u2019re a really good frank exchange of views and long may they continue.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/uk/starmer-nato-biden-interview-tapper-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_mona-gallery-australia-women-only-exhibit-hnk-intl", "text": "A museum in Australia is being forced to allow men into art exhibit originally conceived for women only, after a tribunal ruled it \u201cdiscriminatory,\u201d following a complaint by a disgruntled man who was denied entry. Tasmania\u2019s Museum of Old and New Art\u00a0(MONA)\u00a0has been ordered to stop refusing entry to \u201cpersons who do not identify as ladies,\u201d to its Ladies Lounge exhibit within 28 days, after a ruling was made by the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal on Tuesday. The experiential artwork by artist and museum curator\u00a0Kirsha Kaechele\u00a0is billed by the museum as a \u201ctremendously lavish space\u201d where women can indulge in \u201cdecadent nibbles, fancy tipples, and other ladylike pleasures \u2014 hosted and entertained by the fabulous butler.\u201d Jason Lau, a visitor from New South Wales,\u00a0who had paid the museum\u2019s $35 AUD ($23 USD) entry fee, was barred from entering the exhibit\u00a0on\u00a0April 1 last year. According to tribunal documents, Lau believed he experienced direct gender discrimination. \u201cHe felt strongly enough about this to file a complaint with Equal Opportunities Tasmania,\u201d read the notes. During proceedings, Kaechele told the tribunal that denying men entry to the mysterious room is indeed part of the art \u2014 giving\u00a0them\u00a0a taste of the discrimination and exclusion many women have experienced through history. Kaechele said she believed that women\u00a0\u201cdeserve both equal rights and special privileges in the form of unequal rights,\u201d as a means of restitution for historical injustices, \u201cfor a minimum of 300 years.\u201d In its judgment, the tribunal recognized that the art exhibition had \u201ca pointedly participatory component that is intentionally discriminatory, for a good faith artistic purpose that many might not only appreciate but sympathise with or endorse.\u201d However, it also asserted that Australia\u2019s 1998 anti-discrimination act \u201cdoes not permit discrimination for good faith artistic purpose per se.\u201d An extension of the art Throughout the proceedings Kaechele and her supporters treated the tribunal as an extension of her art, wearing matching dark blue suits and synchronizing their movements. In her witness statement to the tribunal, the artist said: \u201cWe are so deeply embedded in the dominion of man that we do not even see the myriad ways in which we adhere to and multiply his reign.\u201d She added this is why the Ladies Lounge was needed as \u201ca peaceful space women can retreat to; a haven in which to think clearly, and relish the pure company of women \u2014 to escape the invisible story woven through history.\u201d Kaechele in an earlier interview with ABC\u2019s The Project, told the program she was \u201cgrateful\u201d for Lau\u2019s complaint, as it gave her the chance to test out the argument legally, but warned that a ruling in Lau\u2019s favor would mean the Ladies Lounge would have to close. \u201cBecause the requirement is that it will have to open to men, and that\u2019s not happening,\u201d she said. After Tuesday\u2019s ruling, MONA\u2019s official spokesperson told CNN that the institution was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the tribunal\u2019s decision. \u201cWe will take some time to absorb the result and consider our options,\u201d they said, adding: \u201cWe request that the artist\u2019s privacy is respected at this time.\u201d The museum\u2019s official Instagram\u00a0account posted a more explicit response: a photo of a velvet-clad hand, adorned with the initials KK, giving the middle finger, to which one user commented, \u201cI visited in 2021 with my husband and loved the novelty of being able to go into a space that no man was allowed into.

The Abuja-based Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Court of Justice imposed a financial penalty on the country for forcefully cracking down on peaceful protesters who demanded that a notorious police unit known as the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, or SARS, be shut down. Around two weeks into the 2020 protests, Nigeria\u2019s security forces opened fire on young people demonstrating peacefully at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos, killing and wounding several people. \u201cThe court found credible evidence of disproportionate use of force and violations of the right to liberty and security, assembly, free speech, and dignity,\u201d said a court statement, which highlighted \u201cparticularly its (Nigeria\u2019s) disproportionate use of force at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos on October 20, 2020.\u201d In a ruling delivered on Wednesday, the regional court ordered the Nigerian government to pay N2 million (around US$ 1,200) in compensation to each victim named in the suit. The case was brought before the court by three Nigerians who were at the protest: Perpetual Kamsi, Dabiraoluwa Adeyinka and Obianuju Catherine Udeh. Udeh live-streamed the shootings on her Instagram page.

The court also ordered the country to investigate and prosecute the operatives responsible for the human rights abuses and provide an update in six months on the investigation and payment of compensation to those affected. The #EndSARS movement started in 2020 as a protest against police brutality and violence.

{"id": "2024_07_12_style_anant-ambani-radhika-merchant-wedding-mumbai-intl-hnk", "text": "After seven months of extravagant pre-wedding celebrations, Anant Ambani, the son of India\u2019s richest man, completed his long-awaited marriage to pharmaceutical heiress Radhika Merchant before thousands of guests on Friday. Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra and former British prime ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson were just some of the famous faces who flew in to Mumbai to attend the star-studded event. The wedding also attracted many of the biggest names in Indian entertainment, sport, business and politics, from Bollywood stars like Rajinikanth and Sanjay Dutt, to former president Ram Nath Kovind, the chief ministers of various states and numerous members of the country\u2019s revered cricket team. No expense was spared by the Ambanis, the family behind India\u2019s largest private corporation, Reliance Industries. Founded by Anant\u2019s grandfather, the conglomerate is now run by his father Mukesh, who is worth over $122 billion, according to Forbes. In a rain-soaked Mumbai, police closed roads in the area surrounding the Ambani-owned, 16,000-capacity Jio World Convention Center ahead of a red-carpet-style arrival event. Attendees dressed the part, streaming past photographers in custom sarees, lehengas and kurtas at an event that may set forthcoming trends in Indian wedding fashion. International guests also honored the traditional dress code, with many seen wearing designs by major Indian fashion designers. John Cena walked the red carpet in an embroidered sky blue sherwani and white pants, while Jonas sparkled in a\u00a0baby pink version \u2014 made from a boucl\u00e9-style woven fabric embedded with sequins\u00a0\u2014 and matching satin trousers. Jonas arrived with his wife and actor, Priyanka Chopra, who opted for an intricately embellished sunshine yellow sari. The fashion crowd were out in full force too. Zendaya\u2019s longtime stylist Law Roach arrived in a mauve velvet jacket, purple tunic and a pair of Schiaparelli gold toed shoes, while designer and New York Fashion Week staple Prabal Gurung wore a rose-colored sherwani and aviator sunglasses. Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, who skipped the red carpet entirely, were seen on social media dressed in gold and red saris respectively. Kim\u2019s ensemble featured an off-the-shoulder tasseled bodice, whereas Khlo\u00e9 opted for long, ornate sleeves, stacked necklaces and an opulent maang tikka. In an Instagram story, Kim teased that their film crew was in tow for an episode of their show \u201cThe Kardashians.\u201d Once inside the venue, which was transformed into a miniature version of the holy Indian city of Varanasi, celebrities including Chopra and Cena were seen dancing and letting loose. Footage widely shared on social media also showed members of the Ambani family dancing on stage with Indian singer, Daler Mehndi. The night\u2019s other performers included Afrobeats star Rema, who performed his hit song \u201cCalm Down.\u201d As for the couple itself, the groom first arrived on the red carpet in a golden sherwani paired with sneakers, which he later changed for the ceremony. The bride dazzled in hand-embroidered bridal couture by the Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. Merchant followed the Gujarati tradition of wearing red and white in an opulent red-trimmed ivory ensemble. It featured a 16-foot-long veil adorned with stones and sequins and a long ghagra, or traditional skirt, with a nearly seven-foot-long detachable train, according to her stylist Rhea Kapoor, who shared a first look on Instagram. Ahead of her \u201cvidai,\u201d the ceremony in which Indian brides symbolically bid farewell to their\u00a0relatives before joining their groom\u2019s family, Merchant changed into an\u00a0opulent red and gold outfit\u00a0featuring a woven blouse, lehenga, veil and embroidered\u00a0head covering. In a video posted to social media on Friday morning, Anant\u2019s mother Nita Ambani recounted a recent trip to Varanasi, in India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state, where she sought blessings for the pair. She said she hoped to \u201creimagine and present the purity, positivity and beauty of Varanasi at the wedding,\u201d adding that the event would \u201cpay a tribute to India\u2019s glorious culture and heritage, brought to life by thousands of artisans\u2026 weavers and craftspeople.\u201d It was also revealed that the gown Nita Ambani wore on the event red carpet took more than 40 days to create. The custom peach silk ghagra was designed by couture house Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and artisans Vijay Kumar and Monika Maurya. A lavish affair The Ambani family has remained tight-lipped about proceedings in the build-up to Friday\u2019s wedding, though rumors about the guest list and the identity of star performers have swirled in recent weeks. Local press and Indian social media users have also pored over speculation over everything from the dinner menu to the items of jewelry that might be on display from the family\u2019s sizable collection. One of India\u2019s best-known fashion designers, Manish Malhotra, served as the event\u2019s creative director. The celebrated couturier produced bespoke outfits for various members of the Ambani family throughout the month-long wedding celebrations. \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event \u2026 is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he told CNN via e-mail ahead of the wedding. In the days leading up to Friday\u2019s ceremony, the couple took part in several traditional pre-wedding rituals. Justin Bieber performed at the pair\u2019s \u201csangeet,\u201d a night of music and dance, last Friday. The couple then attended a private \u201chaldi\u201d ceremony, which traditionally sees friends and family bless the bride and groom by applying a turmeric paste to their heads, faces or bodies. As per Hindu tradition, the wedding dates were reportedly chosen according to auspicious days on the bride and groom\u2019s birth charts. A Brown University graduate, 29-year-old Anant Ambani is Mukesh\u2019s youngest child and serves as director at an energy business operated by Reliance. His bride Radhika Merchant, also 29, is the daughter of Viren and Shaila Merchant, the founders of pharmaceutical company Encore Healthcare. It is not known precisely how much money the Ambani family has spent on the pair\u2019s wedding celebrations. Industry estimates have placed the total firmly in the hundreds of millions of dollars, with musical performers reported to be receiving seven- or even eight-figure sums. On the streets of Mumbai, residents spoken to by Reuters had mixed feelings about the extravagant event \u2014 and the wealth on display. \u201cIt\u2019s their wealth but it is beyond ridiculous what they are doing,\u201d said preschool teacher Devanshi Zaveri, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to show off that much.\u201d Banker Jenica Kothari meanwhile welcomed the boost to local businesses: \u201cIt\u2019s helping the economy, it\u2019s helping everyone\u2026 So, I think if they have the money, they should spend it.\u201d Local hotel rates reportedly soared as the thousands of guests prepared to jet to Mumbai, a financial hub that serves as India\u2019s commercial capital. Months of celebrations Festivities are set to continue through the weekend at the Ambani family\u2019s soaring 27-story Mumbai residence, Antilia. Saturday is expected to see a \u201cShubh Ashirwad,\u201d or divine blessings ceremony, while a Sunday reception (with an \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code) will give guests a final chance to celebrate with the couple. The weekend schedule concludes seven months of build-up to what has been described as India\u2019s wedding of year. Celebrations kicked off with a celebrity-filled engagement party in January. Two months later, the Ambanis hosted a communal dinner for more than 50,000 villagers and a 1,200-guest pre-wedding bash \u2014 attended by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump \u2014 featuring a rare live performance by Rihanna. In May, the family then chartered a cruise ship to take guests on a four-day trip around the Mediterranean. The schedule included multiple stops through Europe and on-deck concerts from the Backstreet Boys and Pitbull, among others. Anant\u2019s older sister, Isha, also held a lavish wedding in 2018. Her marriage to businessman Anand Piramal was watched by celebrities, politicians and business tycoons, while her pre-wedding bash featured an intimate private concert by Beyonc\u00e9.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/style/anant-ambani-radhika-merchant-wedding-mumbai-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_asia_south-korea-antidrone-lasers-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "South Korea is beginning the mass production of a low-cost laser weapon that has successfully shot down small drones during testing, the country\u2019s key arms agency said Thursday. The laser weapon, called Block-I, \u201ccan precisely strike small unmanned aerial vehicles and multicopters at close range,\u201d a news release from South Korea\u2019s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) said. The release did not give a cost for the weapon, but said each shot fired would only cost about $1.50. Imagery supplied by the agency appears to show a weapon around the size of a shipping container with a laser mounted on top and what appears to be a radar or tracking device mounted on one side of the platform. DAPA said the unit measures 9 meters by 3 meters by 3 meters (29.5 feet by 9.8 feet by 9.8 feet), and fires laser rays that are difficult if not impossible to detect before impact. \u201cIt is invisible and noiseless, does not require separate ammunition and can be operated only when electricity is supplied,\u201d the DAPA release said. Future versions could be developed to take out much bigger targets, including aircraft and ballistic missiles, which would be a potential \u201cgame changer,\u201d according to the release. DAPA will develop \u201ca laser anti-aircraft weapon (Block-II) system with improved output and range compared to the current one,\u201d the release said. But the Block-I weapon itself comes online at an important time. In Ukraine, the Middle East and elsewhere, small drones - some available off the shelf - have shown the ability to disable or destroy multimillion-dollar pieces of military hardware, including tanks. Militaries have typically responded by trying to take out low-cost drones with defensive systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars per strike. A weapon that could do the same for practically pennies would be a big boost to the country that can deploy it. \u201cLow-cost drones and rockets have swung the economic calculus of offense and defense in favor of those using large volumes of cheap unmanned systems and munitions to overwhelm more-sophisticated air and missile defenses,\u201d James Black, assistant director defense and security for the RAND Europe think tank, wrote in a blog post in January. DAPA said the Block-I weapon has been in development for five years, with more than $63 million invested. The Korea Institute for Defense Analyses led the system development with participation from Hanwha Aerospace, it said. The system was evaluated suitable for combat in April 2023 after achieving 100% success in shooting down targets in live-fire tests, according to DAPA. The agency said South Korea is the first country to publicly acknowledge it will deploy a mass-produced laser weapon. Earlier this year, Britain showed off a new laser weapon that its military says could deliver lethal missile or aircraft defense at around $13 a shot. But no possible deployment date for that weapon had been announced. In 2022, the US Navy successfully tested a high-energy laser system against a target representing a cruise missile. But a Navy account of that test said there was no plan to get it into the hands of warfighters, adding that it \u201coffers a glimpse into the future of laser weapons.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/asia/south-korea-antidrone-lasers-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

The search for Kyle Clifford, 26, began on Tuesday evening when police were called to a house in Bushey, Hertfordshire, where they found three seriously injured women. Carol Hunt, 61, wife of BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt, and their daughters, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, later died from their wounds, according to statements Wednesday from police and Britain\u2019s public broadcaster. A crossbow is believed to have been used in the \u201ctargeted incident,\u201d police said, adding that other weapons may also have been used. Clifford, who police warned may have been armed with a crossbow, was found in Enfield, North London on Wednesday afternoon, Hertfordshire Police said in a statement. \u201cA man wanted in connection with a triple murder in\u00a0Bushey\u00a0has been traced to a location in North London. Following an extensive search, Kyle Clifford, aged 26, was found in the\u00a0Enfield area by officers this afternoon (Wednesday, July 10),\u201d the statement said. \u201cAt this stage, we believe the suspect was known to the victims.\u201d The suspect is hospitalized in a serious condition and is yet to speak with officers, police said in an update Thursday. Clifford left the British army in 2022 after a short period of service, a source in the British defense ministry told CNN. He joined the forces in 2019 and served in the Household Cavalry, his former military boss told CNN. The killings sent shock waves through Britain, where mass murders are rare but violence against women has been labeled a national threat by the government. A woman is killed by a man every three days in the United Kingdom and one in four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime, the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, Reem Alsalem, said earlier this year. \u201cEntrenched patriarchy at almost every level of society, combined with a rise in misogyny that permeates the physical and online world, is denying thousands of women and girls across the UK the right to live in safety, free from fear and violence,\u201d Alsalem said in February. \u2018Utterly devastating\u2019 The BBC\u00a0described the women\u2019s killings as \u201cutterly devastating\u201d in a statement to staff. The\u00a0broadcaster said it would give Hunt \u201call the support we can\u201d as part of a note sent to\u00a0BBC\u00a0Radio 5 Live staff. \u201cThe news today about John Hunt\u2019s family is utterly devastating,\u201d it said. \u201cOur thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.\u201d British Home Secretary Yvette Cooper expressed her condolences following the killings. \u201cThe loss of three women\u2019s lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been killed and with the community,\u201d Cooper wrote on X Wednesday. \u201cI am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support Hertfordshire Police with any information about this case.\u201d A neighbor of the women said she \u201cwould see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\u201d according to PA Media. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad what\u2019s happened, very shocking,\u201d she added. In Britain, it is legal for a person to buy or own a crossbow if they are over 18, though anyone who carries one in public without a reasonable excuse can face imprisonment. In February, the previous government launched an eight-week review of the rules and the possibility of introducing a licensing scheme.

{"id": "2024_07_11_australia_russian-born-couple-charged-australia-intl-hnk", "text": "Australia has charged two Russian-born Australian citizens with preparing for an espionage offense after allegedly obtaining military information that they planned to hand to Russian authorities. The married couple had been in Australia for more than 10 years and were arrested Thursday at their home in Everton Park, a northern suburb of Brisbane, according to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). The Russian-born woman, 40, was an army private working as an information systems technician with the Australian Defence Force (ADF) for several years, the agencies said in a joint news conference on Friday. She became an Australian citizen in 2016, and her Russian-born husband, 62, a self-employed laborer, obtained Australian citizenship in 2020, they added. \u201cThe AFP will allege the individuals worked together to access Australian Defence Force material that related to Australia\u2019s national security interests,\u201d said AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw. \u201cNo significant compromise,\u201d had been identified and no other individuals appeared to be involved, Kershaw added, though he said the investigation was in its early stages. The couple appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday and were remanded in custody to next appear in court on September 20. Australian Federal Police will allege the woman went to Russia without notifying Australian authorities while she was on long-term leave from the ADF last year. \u201cWe allege that while she was in Russia, she instructed her husband, who remained in Australia, on how to log into her official work account from their Brisbane home,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cWe allege her husband would access requested material and would send [it] to his wife in Russia. We allege they sought that information with the intention of providing it to Russian authorities.\u201d Kershaw said a key focus of the investigation is whether that information was handed over to Russian authorities. If it was, the charge could be upgraded to espionage. The investigation will include how the woman obtained security clearance to access sensitive ADF material, and how she was able to bypass systems to apparently travel undetected to Russia. \u201cThere was some misleading on her behalf of where she was allegedly at and what country,\u201d Kershaw said. It\u2019s the first time an espionage offense has been used since new laws were introduced in 2018. The charge of preparing for an espionage offense carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.\u00a0An upgraded charge carries a maximum term of 25 years in prison to life. ASIO Director-General Mike Burgess said the arrests demonstrated the strength of Australia\u2019s national security culture, not its deficiency. \u201cThe espionage threat is real. Multiple countries are seeking to steal Australia\u2019s secrets.

{"id": "2024_07_08_europe_china-belarus-military-exercises-poland-intl", "text": "Belarus and China kicked off 11-day joint military training exercises Monday, Belarus\u2019 defense ministry said \u2013 with activities taking place just miles from the border of Poland, a NATO and European Union member. The joint anti-terrorist training \u201cAttacking Falcon\u201d exercises in Belarus would see military personnel from both countries \u201cact together\u201d as one unit in certain stages, Maj. Gen. Vadim Denisenko of the Belarusian military said in a Telegram post. \u201cEvents in the world are complex, the situation is complex, therefore, having studied new forms and methods of conducting warfare, here we will work out all these moments considering all that is new that has been learnt in the past two years,\u201d Denisenko said. The joint exercises are being held at a training ground\u00a0near the\u00a0city of Brest on the\u00a0Belarus-Poland border and some 40 miles from Belarus\u2019 border with Ukraine. They come as Russia\u2019s invasion of that country more than two years ago has hardened geopolitical divisions and continues to threaten broader regional security. Beijing and Minsk have tightened their ties in recent years under Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, both autocrats and strong allies of Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. The start of the anti-terrorism exercises coincided with a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Warsaw, where he signed a security agreement with Polish Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. They also began on the eve of NATO\u2019s 75th\u00a0anniversary\u00a0summit in Washington \u2013 a gathering where leaders will look to shore up support for Ukraine. NATO and the EU have long accused Belarus of weaponizing the border by pushing asylum-seekers from third countries to its\u00a0borders, and the joint exercises will no doubt be seen by some as a further provocation. CNN has reached out to NATO for comment. Belarus has been a critical Russian ally in the Kremlin\u2019s war on Ukraine. Moscow partly used Belarus as a launching pad for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 after amassing troops on the Ukrainian border during what it said were joint military exercises. Last year Putin also announced Russia would place tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus. China has emerged as a key diplomatic and economic lifeline for Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, and been accused by Western leaders of bolstering Moscow\u2019s war effort through the provision of dual use goods \u2013 a charge Beijing denies. Belarus\u2019 Ministry of Defense said troops from China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army arrived in\u00a0Belarus\u00a0over the weekend. It published a series of photographs showing Chinese troops offloading equipment from a military cargo aircraft and said the drills will last until July 19. China\u2019s Ministry of Defense said on Sunday that the drills would include \u201chostage rescue operations and counter-terrorism missions.\u201d \u201cThe training aims to enhance the training levels and coordination capabilities of the participating troops, as well as deepen practical cooperation between the armies of the two countries,\u201d it added. Over the weekend, a delegations from China\u2019s Central Military Commission also held talks with counterparts in Minsk where the two sides discussed \u201cprospects for Belarusian-Chinese cooperation on military personnel training\u201d and outlined new areas of cooperation, according to Belarus\u2019 defense ministry. This latest showing of their security cooperation comes\u00a0just days after Belarus joined the Beijing- and Moscow-backed Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) on Thursday. Founded in 2001 by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to combat terrorism and promote border security, the SCO has grown in recent years as Beijing and Moscow drive a transformation of the bloc from a regional security club with a focus on Central Asia to a geopolitical counterweight to Western institutions led by the United States and its allies. Belarus\u2019 entry in the bloc \u2013 hailed by Xi and Lukashenko in a meeting on the sidelines of an SCO summit in Kazakhstan last week \u2013 was widely seen by observers as another mark of that transformation. Then, Xi hailed the \u201cgreat strides\u201d in the relationship between the two countries \u2013\u00a0a sentiment echoed in a meeting between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his newly appointed Belarusian counterpart Maksim Ryzhenkov on Monday in Beijing. Wang and Ryzhenkov agreed that the two sides would \u201cfirmly support each other\u201d on issues concerning their core interests and major concerns, according to a readout from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, which also noted their ambition to \u201creject unilateral hegemony\u201d \u2013 a reference to their shared opposition to a world order they see as dominated by the United States.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/europe/china-belarus-military-exercises-poland-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_asia_pakistan-extends-visas-afghans-intl-hnk", "text": "Pakistan is extending the stay of nearly 1.5 million registered Afghan refugees \u2013 but its mass deportation of \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d will continue, authorities said. Afghan refugees in Pakistan with Proof of Registration (POR) cards will be able to stay in the country until June 30, 2025, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s office said Wednesday. The fate of 1.45 million refugees whose PORs expired at the end of June had previously been in doubt, with many fearing they\u2019d be deported. News of the extension came one day after the United Nations\u2019 high commissioner for refugees visited Afghanistan and urged Pakistan to extend the POR cards. \u201cGlad that Pakistan\u2019s tradition of hospitality is maintained,\u201d Filippo Grandi wrote on X Thursday. But Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs disputed the UN\u2019s claims that Islamabad had put on hold its plan announced last October to deport undocumented Afghan refugees. The \u201c(Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan) remains in place and is being implemented in an orderly and phased manner,\u201d spokesperson Mumtaz Baloch told CNN Thursday. Pakistan is home to one of the world\u2019s largest refugee populations \u2013 most of them from Afghanistan. But the country has not always welcomed Afghan refugees, subjecting them to hostile living conditions and threatening deportation over the years. More than 3 million Afghan refugees, including registered refugees and more than 800,000 undocumented people were living in Pakistan as of March 2024, according to UNHCR data. Some fled their home country decades ago during the Soviet invasion, while other Afghans sought refuge in Pakistan when the Taliban retook Afghanistan in 2021, implementing its oppressive rule. Last October, Pakistan gave undocumented Afghans weeks to leave or face deportation, claiming Afghan nationals carried out 14 of 24 major terrorist attacks in Pakistan last year.\u00a0Between September 15, 2023 and the end of June, about 650,000 Afghans had returned home, according to the UNHCR. Some 32,000 of them were deported. They\u2019re returning to a country under the control of a militant regime that has imposed a form of gender apartheid and where millions live in poverty. A UN report published Tuesday detailed human rights violations by the Taliban\u2019s so-called morality police \u2013 which have disproportionately targeted women and girls \u2013 creating a \u201cclimate of fear and intimidation\u201d in Afghanistan. Moniza Kakar, a lawyer who helps Afghan migrants navigate Pakistan\u2019s legal system, said the POR card extension will not provide stability for all refugees. \u201cAfghan communities that I have spoken to are still concerned since there are many instances of households where a man might have a POR card and his wife and kids would have no documentation,\u201d Kakar told CNN. \u201cThere is still a huge worry amongst families of being split because of these issues of documentation.\u201d Thyagi Ruwanpathirana, regional researcher for South Asia at Amnesty International, said the human rights group had \u201cdocumented extensive delays and barriers refugees face in obtaining POR cards.\u201d The status of 80,000 Afghan Citizen Card holders, another form of registration for Afghan refugees in Pakistan, was also uncertain, Ruwanpathirana added. \u201cWe urge the government of Pakistan to formally suspend its \u2018Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan,\u2019 stop all deportations, and develop a national legal framework to regulate access to refugee status in line with international refugee law,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_07_13_americas_avocado-cartel-us-mexico-intl-latam", "text": "When two US avocado inspectors were assaulted and detained at a police roadblock in the Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n last month, it sparked a costly international crisis. The US paused all avocado imports from the state for more than a week, leaving Mexican growers out of tens of millions of dollars and temporarily sending the price of a carton of the fruit in the US soaring by 40 percent, according to analysis firm RaboResearch Food & Agribusiness. Weeks later, after diplomats and agricultural officials from both countries negotiated new security guidelines around inspections, the massive cross-border trade has stabilized, with the US Department of Agriculture saying that export levels returned to normal at the beginning of July. But the episode underscored the precarious nature of the industry and the immense volatility in a region that provides most of the world\u2019s avocados, one of Mexico\u2019s most dangerous states and a nexus of cartel power. US and Mexican officials are now considering new changes to the strict processes that direct how the fruit can make its way to American kitchens to meet ever-increasing demand, with industry groups and advocates urging for more oversight. \u2018Green gold\u2019 Avocados, the creamy fruit with the industry nickname \u201cgreen gold,\u201d are big business. Of the amount exported from the nearly 2.7 million metric tons of the fruit grown last year in Mexico, 81 percent went to the US, at a value of $2.7 billion. Nearly three-quarters of Mexican avocados come from Michoac\u00e1n, a state along the country\u2019s Pacific coast with a volcanic belt running through it that makes its soil ideal for farming. The state\u2019s deepwater port has also been critical for the flourishing of drug cartels, which moved into Michoac\u00e1n in the 1980s, fueling a homicide rate that is today more than twice the national average. The expansion of the avocado market in the state around the same time has been \u201cdeeply intertwined\u201d with the violent groups and corrupt public authorities, researchers at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime said in a report this year. Citing interviews with growers in the state, the researchers described how criminal groups illegally burn and log protected forests and bribe local officials to change permissions around the use of the land to allow for commercial activity. According to an academic article published by the Mexican government cited in the report, 80 percent of the avocado orchards in Michoac\u00e1n were established illegally, \u201cinitially through unauthorized land use that was then turned into legal parcels thanks to corruption of public authorities.\u201d Cartels today also regularly extort producers in protection schemes, the report found. Local police forces in turn commonly rent themselves out as security for producers, and heavily armed militias known as \u201cautodefensa\u201d groups have formed to patrol farms. \u201cThis is the core of the mafia-style relationships that exist in Michoac\u00e1n around avocado production,\u201d Romain Le Cour, one of the report authors and a senior expert at the initiative, said in an interview. \u201cYou need criminal actors in a way to stir up the business, you need business entrepreneurs to run the business, and you need corrupt authorities to make sure that what you\u2019re doing becomes legalized or laundered.\u201d Mexican officials in the aftermath of the detention of the inspectors in June were quick to downplay the incident, claiming it was nonviolent and unrelated to organized crime and the inspectors\u2019 work in the avocado industry. The inspectors, who were Mexican citizens working for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, were stopped and taken from their car after attempting to cross a barricade on a highway set up by police officers who were protesting a pay issue, according to Alfredo Ram\u00edrez Bedolla, the Michoac\u00e1n governor. US Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar has said, however, that the men were assaulted. The office of the Michoac\u00e1n state prosecutor told CNN last month that they\u2019ve opened an investigation into the incident. A dangerous job Since the US first allowed imports of avocados from Michoac\u00e1n in 1997, APHIS employees in the country have inspected avocado orchards to ensure they are free of pests that could harm US avocado crops. About 100 inspectors from the agency operate within the state, according to Ram\u00edrez, visiting avocado groves and packing facilities to check the fruit before issuing a certification. That close contact and pivotal responsibility leaves them \u201cextremely exposed to corruption and violence,\u201d said Le Cour, the GI-TOC expert. In 2022, exports of Mexican avocados were similarly halted for several days after one of the US inspectors working in Michoac\u00e1n received a threatening phone call. In the wake of both incidents, Mexican leaders have pushed to change the bilateral agreement regulating the trade to allow for the Mexican government to take over the inspections, with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador criticizing the US decision to halt the export as \u201carrogance.\u201d In a news conference last month, Mexican Agriculture Minister Victor Villalobos said the Mexican government was \u201cperfectly prepared\u201d to do the work, which he said would be valuable to \u201cavoid having to stop the export.\u201d Officials at the US State Department and USDA have considered the possible change, according to Ken Melban, the vice president for industry affairs and operations at the California Avocado Commission, which represents growers in the state. In a statement, Melban called it \u201cunimaginable the US government would consider abdicating inspection responsibilities to Mexico.\u201d Such a change, he told CNN, would leave him doubtful of the integrity of certifications that the exported avocados are actually pest-free. \u201cUS farmers will not be protected under such a program, one intended and designed specifically to protect US farmers\u2019 economic interests,\u201d he said. An APHIS spokesperson declined to comment on the thinking around the policy. US and Mexican officials have also recently resurfaced discussions around a policy to block the export of avocados from Mexico grown in orchards on illegally cleared lands, according to Brad Adams, the executive director of Climate Rights International, an advocacy group that used satellite imagery last year to document the widespread deforestation behind the market. Leaders in both countries have voiced support for such a policy, but have so far been unable to decide on a legal mechanism to enact it. In a letter this spring to a group of US senators who had pushed for the change, the USDA noted that its inspectors don\u2019t have the regulatory authority to certify around the issue, according to a copy obtained by CNN. Instead, the agency pointed towards training and technical assistance that the US Forest Service has provided to Mexico \u201cto support real-time deforestation monitoring of priority regions.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve exposed something that is illegal and therefore indefensible,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThey have an obligation that they recognize at a governmental level in Mexico, and the US can\u2019t keep importing illegally harvested produce.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/americas/avocado-cartel-us-mexico-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_irish-pub-reconnected-romance-chance-encounters", "text": "Years after they\u2019d broken up, Tom Giuliani found himself thinking about the role of timing in his relationship with Susan Hall. Tom and Susan were on the same flight from the US to Ireland in the summer of 1989. But they never saw one another. Then, Tom and Susan were staying in the same hotel in Dromoland, County Clare, on Ireland\u2019s west coast. But they never crossed paths. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because the first thing I did when I arrived was take a walk, and everybody else went to bed \u2013 and now I know Sue also went for a walk,\u201d Tom tells CNN Travel today. But Tom and Susan walked in opposite directions, and so they remained strangers. The two Americans were visiting Ireland via the same organized tour company. But they were on separate tours, to opposite coasts. \u201cI was on the west coast of Ireland, she was going to the east coast of Ireland,\u201d says Tom. While the tours were heading in different directions, both began with a stop off at Bunratty Castle, a 15th-century tower house in County Clare. Inside the stone walls, the US visitors were treated to a banquet, accompanied by Irish musicians and interspersed with folk storytelling. But Tom and Susan didn\u2019t share a dinner table that evening. \u201cShe had the early dinner, I had the late dinner,\u201d says Tom. The two kept almost \u2013 but not quite \u2013 meeting. And that was only the beginning. Looking back four years later, Tom felt this series of almost-meetings \u2013 and how they\u2019d eventually crossed paths, connected, reconnected and then dated \u2013 was all a bit \u201ccosmic.\u201d But then he and Susan broke up. And while the split was amicable, with no ill-feelings, they hadn\u2019t spoken since. \u201cStill, she was always in the back of my mind,\u201d says Tom. \u201cI dated those four years. But I didn\u2019t forget her, at all.\u201d It was during one of these moments of nostalgia that Tom spontaneously decided to call Susan. It was late 1993, Susan\u2019s birthday. Tom figured he\u2019d pass on some birthday wishes, and see where she was at in life. It was a bit daunting, keying those digits into his landline phone four years later, but Tom figured he had nothing to lose. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t even pick up. But she did. Tom\u2019s heart skipped a beat when he heard Susan\u2019s voice again. \u201cHey,\u201d he said into the phone. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d A trip to Ireland Tom and Susan both joined the tour to Ireland in 1989 on the spur of the moment. Back then, Tom was in his early 30s. He was laser-focused on building his career, but also dreamed of traveling the world, at one point joining an airline travel club to try to get flight deals. \u201cEvery week they\u2019d send you a telegram, which would list flights they had for cheap. And you could sign up and leave the next weekend. Then this trip popped up,\u201d recalls Tom. \u201cIt was my first time in Europe. I\u2019d never been before. And so that\u2019s how I ended up in Ireland.\u201d As for Susan, she was a bit younger than Tom \u2013 in her 20s, still unsure what direction her life might take. \u201cI had just left a job,\u201d Susan tells CNN Travel today. \u201cAnd my mom and my older sister were hopping on this tour to Ireland, and I just decided to go with them \u2013 at the very last minute, probably with a week left or so. \u201cI had never really traveled that much before that. So it was very magical, to me, to go with them. That\u2019s how I ended up going on the tour.\u201d That first night in Ireland, Susan\u2019s tour party headed to Bunratty Castle for the early dinner. Afterward, they decamped to a nearby pub, Durty Nelly\u2019s, a yellow, thatched-roof building in the shadow of the castle\u2019s towers. Inside, tourists sampling Guinness mixed with pub regulars, including an older man playing an accordion and singing. Susan watched him play and, in between sips of her pint, cheered along with the music. The evening \u2013 with the castle, the dinner, the pub, the music \u2013 felt like the perfect start to her vacation. \u201cI thought Ireland was so incredible,\u201d says Susan. \u201cIt was so green and just beautiful. I thought the people were really friendly.\u201d When the accordion player finished a song, Susan took the opportunity to find the restroom. She was searching through the low-roofed building when she collided with a tall guy. Susan remembers meeting his eyes and being struck by him right away. This \u2013 of course \u2013 was Tom. \u201cI thought he was handsome,\u201d recalls Susan. \u201cVery cute.\u201d \u201cShe thought I was Irish,\u201d says Tom. \u201cI did think he was Irish,\u201d recalls Susan, laughing. \u201cBut I\u2019d had a few drinks. We just spoke really briefly.\u201d Over the noise of the other pub revelers, Susan and Tom chatted about the banquet dinner at Bunratty Castle. Tom mentioned his group were heading there shortly, and Susan realized he was also an American tourist. \u201cI told him the dinner was fun,\u201d recalls Susan. \u201cAnd that was pretty much it.\u201d As Susan descended into the throngs of people in the pub \u2013 still hunting for the restroom \u2013 Tom watched her walk away. \u201cShe was obviously beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s 5 feet 9. Beautiful. She caught my attention.\u201d Over the next few days, as Susan toured the east coast of Ireland \u2013 admiring castles, craggy landscapes and beaches \u2013 she thought about Tom a little bit, half wondering if they might run into each other again. \u201cHe definitely made an impression,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought he was really cute, handsome.\u201d And on the other side of the country, Tom, in between admiring \u201cthe greenest countryside and endless stone walls along the roads,\u201d also found his thoughts turning to the woman he\u2019d run into at the pub. \u201cI thought about Susan too,\u201d says Tom. \u201cBut I never thought I\u2019d run into her, because she said she was on the other coast.\u201d A second meeting When her Irish tour concluded, Susan boarded a plane home to the US at Dublin Airport, along with her mother and sister. After filling up half the aircraft in Dublin, the plane then stopped over at Shannon Airport to collect more passengers. Among them: Tom. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we saw each other for the second time,\u201d says Tom. As he boarded the aircraft, Tom spotted a glimpse of Susan, already seated. Later, he got up to stretch his legs and walked past Susan, who was sitting with her mother and sister. \u201cHe stopped for a minute to talk to us. And we made some small talk,\u201d recalls Susan. \u201cI was very surprised to see him and a little flustered too.\u201d A few hours later, the airplane halfway across the Atlantic, Tom and Susan ended up in the restroom line together. They talked a bit about their time in Ireland. There was something between them, they both felt it. And as they chatted, Susan wondered if Tom might ask for her number. \u201cI was hoping he would and was disappointed when he didn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought that was it.\u201d Tom wanted to ask Susan out. He almost did, there and then. But he worried he\u2019d misread the signs, and he didn\u2019t want to make the atmosphere on board awkward. So he said nothing. As soon as he sat back down in his seat, Tom regretted this decision. \u201cBut we\u2019ll probably see each other in customs,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cI\u2019ll ask her out when I see her at JFK.\u201d As soon as the airplane landed in New York, Tom realized this was never going to happen. The airport arrivals area was huge, and packed with people. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever been to JFK customs, that thing\u2019s like three football fields long,\u201d says Tom. \u201cSo, needless to say, I didn\u2019t see her. So I didn\u2019t ask her out.\u201d Swallowing his disappointment, Tom focused on getting through the customs line and getting to the bus stop. He was heading back to his home in Pennsylvania a couple of hours away. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll never see her again,\u201d he thought, as he grabbed his bag from the luggage carousel and exited the building. After all, it was 1989. There was no option to look Susan up on social media \u2013 and he didn\u2019t know her last name anyway. Tom walked out of the building, he glanced around and spotted the bus stop. There was a bus that looked ready to leave. Tom started running, hopeful he might just make it. \u201cAnd as I was running to the bus, there she was \u2013 standing with her mom and sister, just getting ready to get on another bus,\u201d says Tom. Tom couldn\u2019t believe it. And Susan, about to board, couldn\u2019t believe it either. Tom reached Susan just in time. Slightly breathless, he dug out a business card from his pocket and passed it to her. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018if I saw you one more time, I\u2019d give you my card,\u2019\u201d said Tom. \u201cCall me.\u201d Susan \u2013 feeling slightly giddy in disbelief \u2013 took the card. A first date Back home in New Jersey, Susan played it cool and didn\u2019t call Tom right away. But while she was trying to project nonchalance, internally she was thrilled. \u201cI just remember being so excited,\u201d she says today. \u201cWhen he gave me his card, he didn\u2019t really have time to talk to me because he had to catch the bus. And I was just like, \u2018Oh my gosh.\u2019 He went his way, I went mine. Eventually I called him a few weeks later.\u201d Tom and Susan lived around two hours from one another, in neighboring states. Talking on the phone, the two decided Tom would come to New Jersey, and they agreed to go to an Irish pub. It felt appropriate, given where they\u2019d first met. \u201cI was very excited to call him and very nervous,\u201d Susan recalls. \u201cAnd then it was exciting seeing each other again. We each brought our Ireland photos and exchanged stories of our trips. We went to an Irish pub and played darts.\u201d From there, Tom and Susan started dating. Over the next few months, they saw one another pretty regularly. But then things started to dwindle. While they both really liked one another, it was clear they were in different stages of life. \u201cI just wanted to go out and have fun. Tom was very focused on advancing in his career,\u201d says Susan. \u201cThe timing was off.\u201d They went their separate ways. Cut to late 1993, when Tom called Susan out of the blue, on her birthday. Susan was pretty thrown when she heard his voice again. But it was good to hear from him, nice to speak with him. They talked for a little while. Then, Tom asked Susan if she\u2019d be interested in meeting up sometime. Susan hesitated. \u201cI was seeing someone else at the time,\u201d says Susan. \u201cI was in the process of breaking off that relationship. The timing just wasn\u2019t great.\u201d She said no. But in the weeks that followed, Susan \u2013 now officially single \u2013\u00a0found herself regretting turning Tom down. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, I really liked that guy. I really messed that up,\u201d she says. Susan confided in her mother, who\u2019d always liked Tom \u2013 she\u2019d never quite forgotten the joy on Susan\u2019s face when Tom found her at the JFK bus stop. \u2018My mom said, \u2018Listen, just call him. He\u2019s either going to say yes or no, you have nothing to lose, just call him and see what happens.\u2019\u201d So eventually, Susan called Tom. She invited him to join her as her date at a friend\u2019s black tie New Year\u2019s Eve party. Tom said yes. \u201cI was thrilled,\u201d he says today. \u201cI was thrilled Tom agreed to go with me,\u201d says Susan. \u201cHe picked me up at my family home. I walked down the stairs and he was standing there in black tie looking incredibly handsome.\u201d \u201cShe looked stunning coming down the stairs,\u201d recalls Tom. \u201cI knew I was a goner.\u201d The party was hosted by one of Susan\u2019s colleagues. When Susan turned up with Tom, her coworkers told he was a \u201cdefinite keeper.\u201d \u201cWe had a really great time at the party,\u201d says Susan. \u201cWe started dating from there.\u201d Timing aligned For Susan and Tom, timing seemed to have finally aligned. \u201cAfter we started dating the second time, I figured she had to be the one,\u201d says Tom. \u201cWe were definitely soulmates,\u201d says Susan. \u201cBut also, timing has to be there, too. So once the timing was there, we really realized that, \u2018This is the person.\u2019\u201d A few months later, in the spring of 1994, Tom and Susan returned to Europe together. \u201cWe started out in London and drove to Scotland,\u201d Susan recalls. She had a feeling Tom might propose on the trip. And she was right. \u201cI had the ring ready,\u201d says Tom. \u201cI was waiting for the perfect opportunity.\u201d In Scotland, the couple stayed at Culcreuch Castle, near Loch Lomond. At the time, the castle doubled as a hotel. It was a little reminiscent of Bunratty Castle, and Tom decided it was the perfect spot for the proposal. \u201cHe arranged for the ring to be put on top of my dessert after dinner at the castle,\u201d recalls Susan. \u201cThe staff was so lovely, they played Marvin Gaye for us.\u201d Tom and Susan planned their wedding celebrations for June 1995. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t want to wait and ended up eloping to Las Vegas on November 22, 1994,\u201d says Susan. \u201cIt was crazy and super fun. We ended up having a vow renewal and reception at our original reception spot in June of 1995.\u201d A year later, Tom and Susan \u2013 who took Tom\u2019s name, becoming Susan Giuliani \u2013 welcomed a son, Evan. And in 1999, their daughter Paige was born. \u201cWe were so excited to start a family together,\u201d says Susan. When their kids were 10 and 12, Tom and Susan returned to Ireland. They called into Durty Nelly\u2019s, the place they\u2019d met 20 years previously and told the manager their story. Susan couldn\u2019t believe it when she realized the same accordion player was still there, still playing. \u201cWe were so excited to share with our children where we first met,\u201d says Susan. 35 years later Today, Susan and Tom are retired and living in New Jersey, focused on family and travels. They\u2019re currently planning an extended trip to Ireland next year and intend to once again return to the site of their first meeting. In the meantime, they\u2019re making travel plans for their 30th wedding anniversary this year \u2013 they\u2019ll be heading on a river cruise followed by a transatlantic cruise. Susan will chronicle the trip on her social media account. She started posting regularly in 2022, under the handle @suzanhall.overfiftygenx. For Susan, Instagram and Tiktok have become unexpected creative outlets. \u201cIt has really given me an opportunity to express myself and talk about the things I enjoy,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve monetized my account and feel incredibly proud of what I have accomplished with it.\u201d Occasionally Tom helps Susan film her posts. She calls him her \u201cbiggest cheerleader and best friend.\u201d It\u2019s for this, and many other reasons, that Susan and Tom are thankful timing eventually aligned for them. They can\u2019t imagine a world in which they didn\u2019t cross paths in Ireland, didn\u2019t spot one another in JFK airport, didn\u2019t reconnect four years later. \u201cThe timing of getting out of customs at the right time to see Susan\u2026It\u2019s the cosmos at work\u2026\u201d reflects Tom. \u201cI believe that things happen for a reason,\u201d says Susan. \u201cAnd the timing has to be right \u2013 somebody could be your soulmate, could be the right person for you. But if you\u2019re not at a place in your life for you to receive that, or see that, then you might just miss your soulmate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/irish-pub-reconnected-romance-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Authorities are now on the hunt for a Colombian man thought to be linked to the case. Investigations have been underway since two suitcases were found on Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of the capital, on Wednesday. They contained the remains of two men, police previously said. The Metropolitan Police said in a statement that officers believed the newly discovered body parts \u201care connected to the human remains found in Bristol.\u201d It added that a 36-year-old man arrested in London over the grisly find has been released without charge. They are now on the hunt for another man believed to be linked to the case. Officers said their priority is to find Yostin Andres Mosquera, a 24-year-old Colombian national, naming him for the first time. They released a photo of Mosquera clad in a black Adidas baseball cap, black jeans, a black jacket, black trainers with thick white soles, with a black backpack. Officers also believe they know the identity of the two male victims, but \u201cformal identification is yet to take place,\u201d they said. Police are trying to locate and inform their next of kin. \u201cBoth victims are thought to have been known to Mosquera and the Met is appealing for information on his whereabouts,\u201d the statement added. \u201cThis is a fast-moving enquiry with detectives in London and Bristol actively pursuing a number of lines of enquiry,\u201d Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine said. The investigation began when Avon and Somerset Police received a call late on Wednesday about a man with a suitcase \u201cacting suspiciously\u201d on the bridge in Bristol. The suitcases were later found in the area, the force said on Thursday. Authorities later said a \u201cman wanted in connection with the incident had traveled to Bristol from London earlier the same day.\u201d Police previously did not identify the individual, despite a large-scale search involving a police helicopter and coastguard. They arrested the unnamed 36-year-old early Friday but said the person was not the same individual as the one police were initially looking for.

{"id": "2024_07_11_europe_crossbow-attack-violence-women-bbc-journalist-intl-gbr", "text": "Figures from across the United Kingdom have offered their condolences to a BBC sport commentator, after his wife and two daughters were killed by an alleged crossbow attacker, in deaths that again drew attention to the epidemic of violence against women. Carol Hunt, 61, wife of BBC horse racing commentator, John Hunt, and their daughters, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, died from injuries sustained in an attack in Bushey, just northwest of London, on Tuesday, according to police and Britain\u2019s public broadcaster. A 26-year-old suspect wanted in connection with the killings, and named as Kyle Clifford, was found by British police in Enfield, north London, on Wednesday, following a sprawling manhunt. There were no previous reports to the force over Clifford, who is in serious condition in hospital and is yet to speak with officers, Hertfordshire Police said in a statement. A crossbow was recovered as part of the investigation, which police believe was used in a \u201ctargeted incident.\u201d Epidemic of violence against women The killings of the three women rocked Britain, where mass murders are infrequent but violence against women and girls has been officially labeled as a national threat. A woman is killed by a man every three days in the UK and one in four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime, the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, Reem Alsalem,\u00a0said earlier this year. Charities and human rights organizations have subsequently reiterated urgent demands to tackle femicide in the UK. \u201cMale violence against women and girls is at epidemic levels,\u201d said SafeLives, a UK-based charity working to end domestic abuse, adding: \u201cDomestic abuse is a major public health crisis. It should be given the same priority as terrorism.\u201d Refuge, a UK-based non-profit providing support for survivors of domestic abuse, posted on X: \u201cOur thoughts are with Carol, Hannah and Louise Hunt and their family and friends following the devastating incident in Bushey.\u201d British Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called the attack \u201ctruly shocking,\u201d adding that she is \u201cbeing kept fully updated\u201d by authorities. The country\u2019s new Labour government campaigned on a manifesto to \u201ctackle the scourge of violence against women and girls\u201d in Britain, including a review of the sentencing process, and requiring forces to target repeat offenders with tools used for counter-terror and serious organized crime investigations. \u2018His life was ripped apart\u2019 An array of BBC journalists paid tributes to their colleague, in an outpouring of grief across the organization and wider sports industry. BBC Sport presenter Mark Chapman said: \u201cJohn\u00a0Hunt\u00a0is our colleague, and our friend, not just to the current 5 Live Sport team, but to all of those who have worked here with him over the past 20 years. \u201cOn behalf of everybody connected to 5 Live Sport, our love and thoughts and support are with\u00a0John\u00a0and his family,\u201d Chapman said live on air. Dan Walker, who used to host the BBC show Football Focus,\u00a0posted on X\u00a0that: \u201cJohn\u00a0Hunt\u00a0is one of the best and his life was ripped apart yesterday.\u201d Tim Peach, a producer for BBC Cricket, described\u00a0Hunt\u00a0as \u201cone of the kindest, most thoughtful people I\u2019ve ever worked with.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s peerless at his job,\u201d Peach said on X, \u201cbut he\u2019s always happiest talking about \u2018my Carol\u2019 and \u2018my girls.\u2019\u201d Michael Owen, a former soccer player and racehorse owner,\u00a0also posted\u00a0on X following England\u2019s soccer win at the European Championship, writing that \u201cwhile the country celebrate(s), spare a thought for\u00a0John\u00a0Hunt. I can\u2019t remember feeling so utterly horrified in years. Those poor girls. Truly horrific.\u201d The British Horseracing Authority (BHA)\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0that its thoughts are with\u00a0Hunt, his family, and friends. \u201cIt is impossible to comprehend the horror that has been inflicted upon them by this dreadful event,\u201d Julie Harrington, the BHA chief executive, said. Ascot Racecourse, one of Britain\u2019s most famous horse-racing grounds, said that it echoed the BHA\u2019s words and posted that\u00a0\u201cour thoughts are with\u00a0John\u00a0Hunt\u00a0at this tragic time.\u201d Crossbow legislation in the UK The strength of crossbow laws in the UK was called into question last year, after a British man was incarcerated for breaking into Windsor Castle and planning to assassinate the late Queen Elizabeth II with the weapon in 2021. At the time, the former Conservative government did not change the legislation, despite launching an eight-week review of the rules and the possibility of introducing a licensing scheme. In Britain, it is legal for a person to buy or own a crossbow if they are over 18, though anyone who carries one in public without a reasonable excuse can face imprisonment.  Crossbow attacks in the UK are rare, with fewer than 10 homicides by crossbow between 2011 and 2021, according to the government. The British home secretary is now re-examining the country\u2019s crossbow laws, according to her colleague, security minister Dan Jarvis. \u201cWe are seized by the seriousness and the importance of this,\u201d Jarvis told the BBC\u2019s Today program on Thursday, adding that the new government has \u201cmade a manifesto commitment\u201d to halve violence against women and girls in Britain over a 10-year period. \u201cWe will move as quickly as we possibly can to reach a judgement about whether we do need to amend the existing legislative framework,\u201d he added.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_style_dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon", "text": "Pristine, crisp and all-white \u2014 tennis whites have been a tradition dating back centuries. The distinctive look has not only made the racquet sport stand out, it has also become a sartorial mainstay off the courts, too. And even though most of the major tournaments have done away with the hueless uniformity, Wimbledon, the very first of them, has remained strict in its policy (as have many private clubs around the world). The prestigious championship even clamped down on the rule a decade ago, prohibiting colorful accents that had become increasingly common \u2014\u00a0 the year after Roger Federer\u2019s now-infamous pair of orange-soled sneakers were banned after his first round in 2013. The rules once called for \u201cpredominantly white\u201d outfits, allowing some competitors to play with color combinations, such as Serena Williams\u2019 tribute to Wimbledon treat strawberries and cream in 2010. But the crackdown changed the wording to \u201calmost entirely white,\u201d per the organizers: no off-white, no panels of color, no varying colorways on sneakers. The only recent loosening of rules was in 2023, to allow women to wear dark-colored shorts on the court following criticisms that the rules weren\u2019t accommodating for menstruation leaks. But why did tennis whites become the standard? The reasons often cited are practical ones, from heat reflection to sweat-masking. But senior curator Kevin Jones of the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (FIDM) museum in Los Angeles, who organized the recent traveling exhibition \u201cSporting Fashion: Outdoor Girls 1800 - 1960,\u201d said it really comes down to a long history of clubs enforcing social status, starting when lawn tennis skyrocketed in popularity in Victorian-era England as a leisure sport \u2014 and a rare one that allowed women, too. \u201cIt\u2019s completely elitist because white clothes are difficult to maintain,\u201d he said in a phone call with CNN. \u201cAnd the types of materials that these dresses were made of, which were cottons and linens, creased easily, so to keep them nice and freshly starched was also an aspect of that care.\u201d Challenging the rules Of course, tennis style has drastically changed in a century-and-a-half since it first became a recreational sensation for the upper class, hot off the heels of croquet (and utilizing the same neatly trimmed lawns). Early tennis attire was more akin to 19th-century leisurewear: women wore striped and patterned garments with long skirts, corseting and wide-brimmed hats; men donned wool pants, button-downs or sweaters. Because spectators and players have often adhered to similar styles, fashion and tennis have had a \u201cmutual exchange over time, where various tennis trends have seeped into wider culture as well,\u201d said sports journalist Ben Rothenberg, author of \u201cTennis: The Stylish Life\u201d as well as a recent biography on Naomi Osaka. That\u2019s been more than apparent in the past few months as Zendaya turned out a series of tennis-inspired high-fashion red-carpet looks matching the on- and off-court drama of the film \u201cChallengers,\u201d and recently faced Federer in an \u201cair tennis\u201d match for a campaign by the sportswear brand On. The close alignment with fashion has also led to the success of classic tennis-born labels such as Lacoste and Fred Perry, as well as radical new fashion innovations introduced on the court, like Elsa Schiaparelli dressing Spanish player Lil\u00ed de \u00c1lvarez in culottes, a split skirt, for Wimbledon in 1931, to onlookers\u2019 shock. Like with De \u00c1lvarez, dress codes in tennis have often changed after an initial scandal. The French player Suzanne Lenglen was one of the earliest and most memorable cases, when she did away with layered, long dresses and wore a more airy calf-length skirt and shorter sleeves at Wimbledon in 1919. A muse to the designer Jean Patou, Lenglen became tennis\u2019 first fashion icon with her signature headscarf and then-provocative shorter hems. At the US, French and Australian Open, players have challenged definitions of what tennis clothes can be thanks to looser rules (subject to referee opinion). None have done so more than the Williams sisters, with Serena wearing a denim mini, tutus and cape-like silhouettes and Venus\u2019s lacy black-and-red ensemble that drew comparisons to lingerie. More recently, Serena Williams\u2019 Nike kit became the topic of conversation at the 2018 French Open when she opted for a black compression catsuit that didn\u2019t feature the compulsory tennis skirt. Though she cited its circulation benefits following a severe blood-clot scare with the birth of her child, the French Open said it would bar the style in the future. However, the Women\u2019s Tennis Association formally allowed it, and Williams continued to wear versions of the bodysuit at the 2019 and 2021 Australian Opens, normalizing the agile and simplified cut for the tennis court. \u201cI love wearing skirts,\u201d she told CNN in April while reflecting on the controversy. \u201cBut I wanted to make sure that my blood was always circulating and I had been in a near-death experience.\u201d \u201cSo I think there should have been\u2026 understanding around that whole outfit,\u201d she added. Brand distinctions Most of the Grand Slam tournaments dropped the all-white rules decades ago, likely in a bid to attract more television viewers and advertisers in an age of increased visibility for the sport. \u201cColor is vital to draw the eye and especially for those sports companies to be able to advertise their logos and their colors,\u201d James explained. Sports and luxury brands advertise through fashion in multiple ways, from dressing star players in custom statement pieces to promoting merchandised designs on competitors. Wimbledon\u2019s restrictive rules have been \u201cfrustrating\u201d for brands trying to sell their tournament collections, Rothenberg said. When Fila introduced Bjorn Borg throwback shirts in 2001, replicating what the tennis star wore during his five-time-winning Wimbledon streak from 1976 to 1980, Wimbledon officials said they no longer adhered to the rules. The decision sent the sports brand \u201cscrambling\u201d to get new shirts to the players wearing them, Rothenberg explained. And, after Federer\u2019s orange-soled shoes were banned, Nike had to act fast to spin their brief appearance, advertising them as \u201cOne Match Wonders\u201d in a print ad. For players, the smallest infractions have proved controversial, and some players have outright refused to play along, as Andre Agassi did from 1988-90 when he boycotted Wimbledon entirely. In 2017, Jurij Rodionov was told to change blue underwear that was peeking out of his shirts, while Sabine Lisicki recently said that she and women were often required to switch out their skin-colored bras. But Rothenberg doesn\u2019t see more leniency happening anytime soon from Wimbledon\u2019s decision-makers. \u201cI think Wimbledon sees its anachronisms as a big part of its brand and its value,\u201d he explained. \u201cWimbledon has clung on to it as a way to be distinct and different \u2014 and I think it\u2019s largely been successful. It doesn\u2019t look like any other tournament.\u201d There have been criticisms levied against the major tournaments whenever women players seem to be disproportionately affected by their dress codes, and though Rothenberg agrees, he also points out that women\u2019s styles have been more creative. Men\u2019s tenniswear has deviated less from shorts and lightwear polos or shortsleeve athletic shirts since they were introduced. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of men\u2019s short length getting markedly shorter over the last 12 months though, especially players who really have hiked up their shorts a lot,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe someday there will be rules against that if they start showing too much cheek.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/style/dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_middleeast_israeli-military-inquiry-kibbutz-beeri-intl-latam", "text": "An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) internal investigation into the failures to protect the kibbutz of Be\u2019eri on October 7 found that the Israeli military \u201cfailed in its mission to protect the residents\u201d and \u201cwas not prepared for the extensive infiltration scenario\u201d by Hamas that day, which involved \u201cmultiple infiltration points by thousands of terrorists attacking dozens of locations simultaneously.\u201d Be\u2019eri, located in southern Israel, was one of the hardest hit communities in the October 7 attacks\u00a0when Hamas militants stormed the kibbutz, killing 101 of its residents, including children. Thirty people were abducted from the kibbutz that day. The inquiry said the military had trained for isolated and specific infiltrations. \u201cAs a result, there were no additional reserve forces in the area that could have been sent to Kibbutz Be\u2019eri,\u201d the inquiry said. Responding to the inquiry\u2019s report, the Chief of the General Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said it \u201cclearly illustrates the magnitude of the failure and the scale of the disaster that befell the residents of the south who defended their families with their bodies for many hours while the IDF was not there to protect them.\u201d The inquiry found that \u201cthe IDF struggled to create a clear and accurate situational assessment of what was happening in the kibbutz until the afternoon of October 7,\u201d even though the local emergency team had provided an updated assessment. \u201cCombat in the area during the initial hours was characterized by a lack of command and control, a lack of coordination, and a lack of order among the different forces and units. This led to several incidents where security forces grouped at the entrance to the kibbutz without immediately engaging in combat,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe inquiry found that the security officials did not provide sufficient warning to the residents of Kibbutz Be\u2019eri about the infiltration of terrorists during the initial hours of the terrorist attack,\u201d the report continued. The inquiry concluded that the turning point came only when a senior officer was appointed to coordinate forces in the area, leading to the regaining of operational control of the kibbutz. \u201cDespite operational errors and mistakes in force deployment, the inquiry team noted that the combat in Be\u2019eri included a series of acts of heroism and supreme courage by the fighting forces, commanders, and security personnel who fought in the kibbutz, saving many residents,\u201d the report said. It also said \u201cthe bravery of the Be\u2019eri residents and the members of the kibbutz\u2019s civilian rapid response team is commendable and was crucial in stabilizing the defensive line during the first hours of combat, preventing the attack from spreading to other parts of the kibbutz.\u201d The inquiry also found that the security forces who fought in the area \u201coperated with great bravery and heroism.\u201d 31 security personnel were killed in the area after some \u201c340 terrorists infiltrated the kibbutz,\u201d of whom about 100 were killed, it said. At a briefing Thursday, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said more findings would be presented in the coming months. \u201cThis investigation is not the end of a process, it is the beginning.\u201d Timeline of attack The inquiry team found that that the attack on Be\u2019eri began at around 7 a.m. local time on October 7 and that Hamas controlled the kibbutz for about four hours. During this period, the \u201cfirst IDF soldiers arrive, are hit, evacuate the wounded, exit the kibbutz, and, positioning themselves at the entrance of the kibbutz, engage in combat with the terrorists who reached the gate.\u201d By 4.15 p.m., the 99th\u00a0Division had established itself at the kibbutz and began organizing command and control. By 6 p.m., \u201cabout 700 IDF soldiers and security forces are operating in the area of the kibbutz,\u201d the inquiry found. The Chief of the General Staff, Lt. Gen. Halevi, accepted the conclusions of the inquiry, and acknowledged that \u201cthe IDF did not fulfil its mission to defend the residents in the most grave manner and failed in its mission.\u201d Halevi noted that \u201cfrom the afternoon hours onwards, forces were waiting outside the kibbutz while the massacre continued inside. This situation is extremely grave and cannot occur.\u201d \u201cThe reasons for this were found to include that commanders who arrived with forces entered the kibbutz with a part of the force to better understand the situation; some forces did not initiate contact since they did not understand the severity of the situation and the lack of adequate forces; some of those waiting outside were support forces providing a perimeter for those engaged in combat inside the kibbutz,\u201d he said. As for prioritizing the evacuation of wounded soldiers, Halevi said that civilian protection was the highest-priority mission. \u201cSoldiers must always give priority to assisting civilians in evacuation, defense and any other need that arises in a combat zone,\u201d he said. Separately,\u00a0Halevi told a graduation ceremony Thursday for new officers that the IDF had worked with all partners \u201cto understand in detail and depth what happened and what we must learn to prevent it from happening again in the future.\u201d Be\u2019eri kibbutz survivors were presented with the findings of the report earlier Thursday. \u201cIt can be said that the investigation was thorough and helped the members of the kibbutz understand a little the depth and complexity of the fighting in the various sectors of the kibbutz,\u201d a statement released by Be\u2019eri spokesperson Michal Paykin said. But he said some important questions remained unanswered. \u201cFor example: Why did the many military forces who gathered at the gate not enter the kibbutz for many hours, when the kibbutz was burning, and its residents were crying for help?\u00a0What caused the intelligence failure that enabled the Hamas invasion plan, and how was the border fence breached without an immediate response from the IDF?\u201d he said. Members of \u201cKibbutz Be\u2019eri did not need the results of the investigation to feel the failure of the IDF\u201d that morning. \u201cThe failure of the army has been burned into our bodies and in our hearts for nine months,\u201d the statement adds. Former residents are now calling for a state commission of inquiry to \u201cexamine the conduct of all the parties and provide us with answers with which we can begin to recover,\u201d the statement added. \u201cFinally, and most importantly, we demand to deal with the abandonment that is happening right now across the border - the abandonment of the hostages to their fate for nine months.\u00a0 The ongoing failure to return them to this day must stop,\u201d the statement ends. Speaking about a state inquiry, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Thursday at the officers\u2019 graduation ceremony: \u201cIt should check all of us: decision-makers and executive officers, the government, the army and the security agencies, in this government, and in the governments of the last decade that led to the events of October 7.\u201d \u201cIt should examine me, the Minister of Defense, it should examine the Prime Minister, the Chief of Staff and the head of the Shin Bet, the IDF, and the national bodies subordinate to the government,\u201d Gallant said. A commission \u201cmust examine the intelligence and operational failure of the events of the 7th October,\u201d as well as examine \u201cthe errors made in assessing the enemy\u2019s capabilities and in warning of its intentions\u00a0 - that culminated on the 7th of October,\u201d Gallant said. Focus on 13 hostages One focus of the inquiry into events at Be\u2019eri on October 7 was the effort to save 13 people held hostage in a house at the kibbutz. There had been speculation that the hostages had been killed by tank fire from the Israeli military as it tried to force entry to the house, but the inquiry found that Hamas operatives at the house probably killed the hostages. \u201cAfter gunfire was heard from within the house and the terrorists communicated their intent to commit suicide and kill the hostages, the security forces decided to breach the house to attempt to save the hostages, and conducted combat operations under difficult conditions,\u201d the inquiry concluded. It said that\u00a0\u201ccommanders and forces made professional and responsible decisions, and fully exhausted negotiation efforts. The tank fire towards the area near the house was carried out\u00a0professionally, with a joint decision made by commanders from all the security organizations after careful consideration\u2026 with the intent to apply pressure to the terrorists and save the civilians held hostage inside.\u201d \u201cThe team determined that, based on the information reviewed and to the best of their understanding, no civilians inside the building were harmed by tank shell fire, except for an isolated incident outside the building where two civilians were injured by shrapnel,\u201d \ufeffit continued. \u201cThe team determined that most of the hostages were likely murdered by the terrorists, and further inquiries and reviews of additional findings are necessary.\u201d Regarding the conclusions, Halevi said,\u00a0\u201cIn such events, the commander on the ground must make difficult decisions with the goal of saving as many civilians as possible. The inquiry revealed that this value guided the decision-making of the commanders on the ground during this event.\u201d Hagari said later Thursday that the IDF had been trying to carry out negotiations with Hamas but those failed. \u201cThe decision to carry out a rescue attempt under fire was made after all attempts to hold negotiations to rescue the hostages were exhausted, and after a long burst of gunfire was heard from inside the house, which raised the suspicion that the hostages were being murdered,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/middleeast/israeli-military-inquiry-kibbutz-beeri-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_13_middleeast_israel-gaza-netzah-yehuda-human-rights-abuses-investigation-intl", "text": "Former commanders of the Netzah Yehuda battalion, an Israeli military unit that has been accused by the United States of gross human rights violations against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank prior to October 7, have been promoted to senior positions in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and are now active in training Israeli ground troops as well as running operations in Gaza, a CNN investigation has found. Among CNN\u2019s findings was rare whistleblower testimony from a former soldier of the unit who described a command that encouraged a culture of violence, an issue identified by US State Department investigations. In April, the State Department said that it had determined five Israeli security units had committed gross violations of human rights prior to the outbreak of the war with Hamas in Gaza. The department said that four of the units had \u201ceffectively remediated,\u201d or reformed themselves, in the wake of those violations, but that it was still deciding whether to restrict US military assistance to the remaining unit: The Netzah Yehuda battalion, originally created to accommodate ultra-Orthodox Jews in the military. The news that the US might withhold assistance from the Israeli military unit triggered a furious response at the time from top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said: \u201cIf anyone thinks they can impose sanctions on a unit of the IDF, I will fight with all my strength.\u201d In a letter obtained by CNN, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told House Speaker Mike Johnson that the US was working with Israel \u201con identifying a path to effective remediation\u201d for the Netzah Yehuda battalion. The letter did not name the unit, but current and former US officials confirmed to CNN that Blinken was referring to Netzah Yehuda, which has been accused of a string of abuses in the occupied West Bank over the last 10 years, including in the death of a 78-year-old Palestinian-American man in 2022. Using facial recognition technology and other open-source techniques, CNN has found that three former commanders of the Netzah Yehuda battalion \u2013 who were in charge of the unit at the time of alleged abuses in the West Bank \u2013 have risen through the ranks of the IDF. CNN tracked these commanders by matching their faces to publicly available imagery over the years, ranging from photographs of military ceremonies to battlefield updates. CNN has spoken with a former member of the unit, who detailed instances of cruel and excessively violent treatment of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. The whistleblower said that commanders actively supported vigilante violence and that promoting them into senior IDF positions risked bringing the same culture to other parts of the military. \u201cA lot of us probably did not see Arabs, Palestinians in particular, as someone with rights \u2013 okay, like they\u2019re really the occupier of some of the land and they need to be moved,\u201d he said. The former soldier, who asked not to be named due to fears about his security, told CNN that the unit was well known for carrying out what he described as the \u201ccollective punishment of Palestinians.\u201d He gave an example of the battalion\u2019s forces assaulting a Palestinian village, going door-to-door with stun grenades and gas grenades as retribution for some local children throwing rocks. While he was in Netzah Yehuda, he said, the battalion\u2019s commanders played a key role in perpetuating a culture of violence, both by standing by as it happened and promoting it. Responding to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the allegations of abuse by Netzah Yehuda, the IDF said that the battalion \u201coperates in a professional and ethical manner\u201d and that its soldiers and commanders \u201cact according to the orders and protocols expected of soldiers in the IDF.\u201d The IDF added that it investigates \u201cevery exceptional incident,\u201d and takes command and disciplinary measures against those involved when appropriate. It did not comment on the subsequent promotion of some commanders. In the course of its month-long investigation, CNN spoke with several current and former US officials, who revealed the intense frustrations within the Biden administration at the perceived special treatment that Israel receives from the US when it comes to addressing human rights violations by its security forces. The former US officials said the fact that Netzah Yehuda\u2019s former commanders have continued to be promoted through Israel\u2019s military ranks was a worrying result of America\u2019s inaction and could have devastating consequences. The US determined that four of the five Israeli units under scrutiny were remediated on the basis that Israel had taken steps to \u201cbring to justice\u201d responsible service members, according to an internal memo sent by the State Department to Congress and obtained by CNN. Israeli military veterans from Breaking the Silence, an anti-occupation advocacy group, told CNN that the IDF often scapegoats junior soldiers or officers, arguing that abuses are the fault of a few bad apples rather than reflective of institutional problems stemming from longstanding military practices or government policies. That approach should not meet the bar for effective remediation, US officials said. A State Department spokesperson told CNN that they do not discuss the circumstances of individual cases, but its experts had \u201cconcluded that several Israeli security force units were credibly implicated in gross violations of human rights (GVHRs),\u201d and that for four of those, the Israeli government had \u201ctaken effective steps to bring those responsible to justice.\u201d \u201cWe continue to assess reports of GVHRs by Israeli security forces, in accordance with the law, and all US security assistance to Israel is provided consistent with domestic and international law,\u201d the spokesperson added. Current and former US officials also told CNN that the five Israeli units were not the only ones the State Department had been examining. The special State Department panel had reached unanimous consensus at a working level that three additional units had been guilty of abuses prior to October 7, the officials said. Only Blinken or the Deputy Secretary of State can make a final determination on whether units remain eligible to receive US military assistance and it is unclear if the matter has come before them. The findings by the expert panel would have been enough to disqualify a military unit from any other country, the officials said. The incidents include the killing of Ahmad Jamil Fahd, who was allegedly shot by forces from the Israeli police counterterrorism unit, the Yamam, near Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, in May 2021; the killing of a Bedouin man identified as Sanad Salaam al-Harbad, who was allegedly shot by the Israel Border Police in the southern Israeli city of Rahat in March 2022; and the alleged rape of a 15-year-old boy by an interrogator from the Israeli Internal Security Forces at the Russian Compound (Moscobiyya detention center) in Jerusalem in January 2021. One US official CNN spoke with said these were among \u201cthe most flagrant abuses looked into.\u201d CNN reached out to the Israel Border Police and Shin Bet, the country\u2019s domestic security agency, for comment on the State Department\u2019s findings. Josh Paul, who as a former director in the State Department\u2019s political-military affairs bureau spent more than 11 years working on US defense diplomacy, security and weapons assistance before resigning in October 2023 over the transfer of arms to Israel, told CNN that there was \u201cnot even the slightest basis\u201d to suggest that the three further units identified to CNN \u2014 the Yamam, the Israel Border Police and Internal Security Forces connected to the Moscobiyya detention center \u2014 had done anything to reform. Paul had previously referenced the Moscobiyya rape allegation in an interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, adding that a charity had drawn it to the attention of a State Department vetting panel he was on. The allegation was believed to be credible and raised with Israel\u2019s government, he said. \u201cAnd do you know what happened the next day? The IDF went in to the (charity\u2019s) offices and removed all their computers and declared them a terrorist entity,\u201d he told Amanpour. Two of the units have been linked to deadly incidents in the wake of October 7. The Yamam was involved in Israel\u2019s hostage rescue operation in Nuseirat refugee camp, in northern Gaza, on June 8, which freed four Israelis and, according to local health authorities, killed more than 270 Palestinians and injured over 700. The IDF has disputed those numbers, claiming that casualties from the operation were \u201cunder 100.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the casualty figures given by either side. Meanwhile, the Israel Border Police shot and killed a 3-year-old Palestinian girl in the occupied West Bank in January and a 12-year-old Palestinian boy in occupied east Jerusalem in March. The fact that the US has never imposed sanctions on any Israeli military unit shows \u201cthe lack of political will and moral courage to hold Israel accountable,\u201d Paul added. \u2018Culture of impunity\u2019 The US is by far the biggest supplier of weapons to Israel, and its military assistance has helped shape Israel\u2019s operations in Gaza. But it has increasingly come under international pressure over its support as the war drags on. Nine months since Hamas militants killed around 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped more than 250 people, Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities. US President Joe Biden has called for the war to end, and laid out a US-backed Israeli ceasefire proposal, but his administration has continued to supply Israel with billions of dollars\u2019 worth of weapons. Paul told CNN that Israel\u2019s prosecution of the war in Gaza would look far different if the US had enforced legislation known as the Leahy law. The 1997 law, named for former Sen. Patrick Leahy who authored the legislation, prohibits the US from providing assistance to any foreign security units that are credibly implicated in human rights violations. \u201cHad the US used the leverage that Leahy laws provide over the years to encourage the IDF to crack down on misbehavior and to snuff out its current culture of impunity, we would have seen at the very least a much stronger unit discipline (than what we see in Gaza right now) at a tactical level,\u201d said Paul, who was a member of the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum \u2013 created in 2020 to identify Israeli units that should be barred from receiving US aid. Under the Leahy law, in cases where an entire unit is designated to receive assistance, the State Department vets not only the unit but also its commander. Charles Blaha, the former director of the State Department\u2019s Office of Security and Human Rights, and also a former member of the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum, said that the panel pays \u201cspecial attention\u201d to commanders. \u201cThey set the tone for the units. When a commander from a tainted unit goes on to another unit, he can render the new unit ineligible for US assistance too,\u201d said Blaha, who retired from the State Department last year. \u2018Moral failure\u2019 The Netzah Yehuda battalion was created by the Israeli military in 1999 for ultra-Orthodox Jews, to accommodate their more stringent religious practices, like the separation of men and women. Since it was established, the battalion has also attracted religious nationalists from the West Bank settler movement, according to those familiar with the unit. It forms part of the Kfir Brigade, the largest infantry brigade in the IDF. One of the most shocking and widely reported incidents involving the Netzah Yehuda battalion was the death of a 78-year-old Palestinian-American man, who was detained in his home village of Jiljilya in the occupied West Bank in January 2022. Omar Assad was held gagged and with his hands tied for a period before being freed and left unresponsive by soldiers from the unit, according to an IDF investigation. An autopsy report determined that Assad had died from a heart attack after he was detained. The IDF investigation concluded that the incident resulted from \u201ca moral failure and poor decision-making on the part of the soldiers.\u201d Following the initial probe, the IDF said that it would reprimand the commander of Netzah Yehuda \u2013 Lt. Col. Mati Shevach \u2013 and remove the platoon commander and company commander from their positions, barring them from commanding roles for two years. But no criminal charges were brought against the soldiers, because the military said there was no causal link found between Assad\u2019s death and their conduct. The IDF referred CNN to its findings when questioned about Assad\u2019s death. Current and former US officials told CNN that the Assad case reflects a broader trend of the types of cases that the US examines. To date, the only incidents in which the US has implicated Israeli units in gross human rights violations were cases in which Israeli courts had already ruled. \u201cThe State Department has never made an independent determination of a gross violation of human rights by an Israeli unit. Ever,\u201d Blaha said. Speaking further about the special treatment that Israel gets from the US, he added: \u201cOf course, we treat Israel differently and that really undermines our human rights advocacy in the rest of the world.\u201d Shevach, Netzah Yehuda\u2019s commander at the time of Assad\u2019s death, was promoted to the role of deputy commander of the Kfir Brigade, which oversees Netzah Yehuda, soon after his two-year stint in charge of the ultra-Orthodox battalion ended in August 2022. And now, Shevach is training soldiers who are about to enter combat, according to an IDF press release and media reports. Shevach has been running drills for Israeli forces at the military\u2019s Urban Warfare Training Center, a mock city in Tze\u2019elim military base in the Negev desert, preparing them to go into Gaza. In an October interview with US broadcaster CBS at the center, Shevach explained how he was readying soldiers to fight Hamas, adding that \u201cthe major concern for most of the soldiers\u201d was that at a certain point they would get \u201can order that the war ends, and we didn\u2019t finish our mission.\u201d CNN put its findings on Shevach\u2019s career trajectory to Blaha, who said that it \u201cstrongly suggests that the types of tactics, the types of abuses, the type of violations that the Netzah Yehuda have committed are going to metastasize to the new units because if that person is in charge of training, he is going to promulgate the same lack of ethos regarding human rights.\u201d CNN found that two other commanders who oversaw Netzah Yehuda \u2013 also known as the 97th Battalion of the Kfir Infantry Brigade \u2013 at the time of alleged abuses in the occupied West Bank were also promoted. Lt. Col. Nitai Okashi oversaw the Netzah Yehuda battalion from 2018 to 2020. In January 2019, soldiers from his unit were captured on video beating and taunting a Palestinian father and son after their arrest in the occupied West Bank. Four were later convicted of aggravated abuse. Okashi, according to Israeli media reports, asked the judge for mercy, saying the soldiers had learned their lesson. In another incident, in October 2019, 14 soldiers from his unit were arrested, according to the Israeli military, after they were caught on video assaulting Bedouin men at a gas station in the West Bank. Since leaving the battalion, Okashi has been promoted into a number of commanding roles in the IDF. He has operated in Gaza since the beginning of the war as the commander of the Jerusalem Brigade and taken reporters from international media, such as German magazine Der Spiegel and Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper on military embeds into the strip. The IDF announced a further promotion for Okashi in March. \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc Lt. Col. Uri Levy was in charge of Netzah Yehuda from 2014 to 2016. During that time, a Netzah Yehuda soldier was indicted for abuse under aggravated circumstances by a military court in Israel, after he allegedly administered electric shocks to Palestinian suspects in two separate incidents in October 2015. After leaving the unit, Levy was promoted to work in the Kfir Brigade. Levy retired from the military in 2023 and now regularly appears on Israeli talk shows as a pundit. In April, when news broke that the US could be poised to sanction Netzah Yehuda, he told Israeli Channel 7: \u201cAnyone looking to find some kind of flaw in an IDF unit like this can find it, and I suggest looking at the glass half full \u2026 the operational successes, the achievements, the hard work night after night.\u201d CNN reached out to the IDF for comment on the alleged abuses carried out by Netzah Yehuda over the past decade. In response, the IDF said: \u201cIt should be noted that in relation to the events that took place in 2015 and 2019 \u2026 the involved had been indicted and the military court had imposed prison sentences in both cases, along with additional punishments.\u201d Men forced to strip naked In late 2022, Netzah Yehuda, which had been stationed in the occupied West Bank since its inception, was reassigned to the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. The IDF said it was an extended operational deployment, but Blinken, in his letter to Speaker Johnson, wrote that it was an acknowledgement that the battalion had \u201cengaged in conduct inconsistent with IDF rules.\u201d Still, that track record has not stopped the IDF from deploying Netzah Yehuda soldiers to Gaza, where they have been fighting since the start of the war. On April 16, under the leadership of then-commander Lt. Col. Shlomo Shiran, Netzah Yehuda was involved in an operation at the Mahdiyya Al-Shawwa school in Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza, where thousands of displaced Palestinians were sheltering, according to eyewitnesses, local journalists and IDF statements. Eyewitnesses said that the soldiers surrounded the school, \u201cfired excessively\u201d on the complex and forced men to strip naked before detaining them. The IDF said intelligence indicated Hamas fighters were in the area. A voice note allegedly recorded by Palestinians inside the school as the attack unfolded, obtained by CNN, captured panic as the civilians remained trapped inside and gunshots rang out. A video posted on social media showed a Palestinian man forced to strip naked in front of an IDF tank. The IDF did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the incident. In turning a blind eye and failing to take action against Netzah Yehuda and other units in the past, Paul said that the US has contributed to a continuing culture of impunity whose \u201ceffects we see in every outrageous TikTok video recorded and published by Israeli soldiers on the ground as they plunder, pillage, and mock their way across Gaza.\u201d That Netzah Yehuda has been allowed to fight in Gaza after having been pulled from the occupied West Bank in the wake of violent incidents is \u201cironic\u201d and concerning, the whistleblower who served in the Netzah Yehuda told CNN. In the strip, he said: \u201cThey pretty much get a carte blanche, where they can do more or less whatever they want.\u201d In the rare interview, he told CNN that he has felt compelled to speak out about the mistreatment of Palestinians by the force after reflecting on his time as a soldier. After he joined the unit at age 19, he recalled, he heard about soldiers being rewarded for killings. \u201cIf you kill a terrorist, you get two weeks off as a compensation \u2026 which is quite an attractive reward for someone that\u2019s spending a lot of time in the military,\u201d he said. The IDF said in a statement to CNN that the claim soldiers are rewarded with early leave for killing terrorists was \u201cfalse and baseless.\u201d \u201cSoldiers are going to do what their commander is expecting them to do and follow orders. And so, if these commanders don\u2019t put their foot down and punish them for their behavior, then they are in fact condoning their behavior,\u201d the whistleblower said. But, he added, \u201cMost of the commanders couldn\u2019t care less (about abuses), as long as it didn\u2019t end up on video.\u201d Credits Investigative Reporter: Katie PolglaseInvestigative Producer & Writer: Pallabi MunsiInvestigative Producer: Benjamin BrownExecutive Producer: Barbara ArvanitidisSenior Photojournalist: Alex PlattInvestigative Video Editor: Mark BaronSenior Digital Video Producer: Augusta AnthonyVisual Editor: Alberto MierPhoto Editor: Toby HancockOSINT Editor: Gianluca MezzofioreFeatures Editor: Laura Smith-SparkSenior Investigations Editor: Eliza MackintoshExecutive Editors: Dan Wright & Matt Wells Ami Kaufman and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/middleeast/israel-gaza-netzah-yehuda-human-rights-abuses-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_08_europe_zelensky-modi-putin-visit-hospital-strike-intl-hnk", "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized his Indian counterpart\u2019s visit to Moscow as a \u201chuge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts,\u201d on the same day that a Russian missile smashed into a children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Russian President Vladimir Putin at his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo outside Moscow on Monday, while less than 600 miles away Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities in a morning rush hour assault that killed\u00a0at least 39 people. Modi\u2019s two-day trip marks his first visit to Russia since Putin began his full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly two and a half years ago, with images and video Monday showing the two leaders hugging, chatting over tea, riding in an electric vehicle and watching a horse show. \u201cIt is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day,\u201d Zelensky said in a post on X on Monday, referring to the deadly Russian attacks. Modi did not address the strikes directly during a meeting with Putin at the Kremlin on Tuesday though he did say solutions to conflict are unlikely to come through war, but rather peace and dialogue. \u201cWhether it\u2019s conflict war or terror, any person who believes in humanity is troubled when there are deaths, especially when innocent children die,\u201d Modi told reporters while seated alongside the Russian president, appearing to deliver his most critical comments to date against Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. \u201cAs a friend, I have always said that peace is necessary for the prosperity of future generations, but I also know that on the battlefield, solutions aren\u2019t easy to come by between guns, bombs and bullets. We have to adopt a path to peace through dialogue,\u201d Modi said. The Indian prime minister said the \u201cworld is watching this current visit and interpreting it in various ways.\u201d He added: \u201cIndia is ready to support you in every possible way to achieve peace. I assure you and the world that we are in favor of peace and, after talking to my friend Putin yesterday, I have hope.\u201d Modi said the two leaders had discussed Ukraine when he made a five-hour visit to Putin\u2019s Novo-Ogaryovo residence late Monday. Putin also confirmed to reporters Tuesday that the pair had discussed Ukraine, thanking Modi for his attempts to find a solution to the conflict. Earlier Tuesday, Modi praised relations between the two countries while addressing the Indian diaspora in Moscow. He also announced the opening of two new consulates in the Russian cities of Yekaterinburg and Kazan to \u201cfacilitate travel and business.\u201d \u201cNo matter if the temperatures in Russia are in minus, Russia-India friendship has always been in plus,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a relationship built on a foundation of mutual trust and mutual respect.\u201d The large-scale daylight bombardment struck\u00a0the capital Kyiv, and cities including Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Slovyansk and Kramatorsk \u2013 some of which are heavily populated areas far from the front lines. In Kyiv, 29 people were killed, according to Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko on Tuesday. Two people were killed and at least 16 others were injured in the strike on Kyiv\u2019s\u00a0Okhmatdyt hospital. The facility is Ukraine\u2019s largest children\u2019s medical center and has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country. Videos from the scene showed volunteers working with police and security services to dig through the rubble as smoke billowed from the hospital. Search and rescue operations for people potentially trapped beneath the debris continued on Tuesday. Hospital staff said they tried to rush children to safety in the wake of the attack. Two children had been in the operating theaters at the time of the blast, and both were relocated to the basement shelter once their procedures were completed, a senior nurse told CNN. Another senior nurse said an operation on a 2-year-old was underway when the strike happened. \u201cThe lights went out, everything went out. We pulled out the instruments, shining flashlights. Everything was sewn up quickly,\u201d Iryna Filimonova said. \u201cThe baby was brought down (to the shelter). I immediately ran to help clear the rubble.\u201d United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said the blast forced medical workers to treat sick children outside the facility. Patients were \u201creceiving treatment for cancer in hospital beds set up in parks and on streets, where medical workers had quickly established triage areas, amongst chaos, dust and debris,\u201d he said in a statement. Russia\u2019s defense ministry on Monday claimed that its forces struck \u201cmilitary industrial facilities of Ukraine and air bases of the Ukrainian armed forces,\u201d with long-range, high-precision weapons. Without providing evidence, the Russian ministry also claimed that photos and videos from the hospital blast confirmed the damage was caused by a Ukrainian air defense missile. Modi\u2019s Russia visit Meanwhile, in the Russian capital on Tuesday, Putin and Modi held official talks at the Kremlin. Earlier in the day, they visited an exhibition center hosting a pavilion on the nuclear industry, according to Russian state news agency TASS. Putin had welcomed the Indian leader to his Novo-Ogaryovo residence late Monday, where the Russian president greeted him as a \u201cdear friend\u201d and said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d to see him, TASS reported. Modi thanked Putin for hosting him at his suburban property, saying in a post on X: \u201cLooking forward to our talks tomorrow as well, which will surely go a long way in further cementing the bonds of friendship between India and Russia.\u201d The trip is a sign that New Delhi and Moscow remain close despite Russia\u2019s deepening dependence on China and is widely seen as the latest dent in efforts by Western leaders to cast Putin aside. India has longstanding ties to Moscow and\u00a0remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment. It has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin\u2019s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces isolation from the West. Ahead of the visit, a statement from Modi\u2019s office said the Indian leader would review \u201call aspects of bilateral cooperation with my friend President Vladimir Putin and sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues. We seek to play a supportive role for a peaceful and stable region.\u201d The United States has raised concerns with India about its relationship with Russia, a US State Department spokesperson told reporters in a media briefing Monday. \u201cI will look to Prime Minister Modi\u2019s public remarks to see what he talked about, but as I said, we made quite clear directly with India our concerns about their relationship with Russia,\u201d spokesperson Matthew Miller said. \u201cWe would hope India and any other country, when they engage with Russia, would make clear that Russia should respect the UN Charter, should respect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d While India has called for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and restoration of peace, it has also abstained from all resolutions on Ukraine at the United Nations and stopped short of condemning Russia\u2019s invasion. Trade between the two countries was worth nearly $65 billion in 2023-24, primarily due to strong energy cooperation,\u00a0but most of that total flowed toward Russia, according to India\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. Reducing the trade imbalance would be a \u201cmatter of priority\u201d in Modi\u2019s discussions with Putin, he said, ahead of the trip. The visit is also Modi\u2019s first bilateral trip since winning a rare third term in India\u2019s mammoth elections last month. Russian Presidential Aide Yury Ushakov said the Kremlin attaches \u201cprimary importance\u201d to Modi\u2019s visit, Russian state-run news agency TASS reported. The Russian attacks in Ukraine came a day before\u00a0US President Joe Biden\u00a0hosts a crucial NATO summit in Washington, where new announcements over the alliance\u2019s military, political and financial support for Kyiv are expected. Biden called Russian missile strikes in Kyiv\u00a0\u2013 including on the children\u2019s hospital \u2013 a \u201chorrific reminder of Russia\u2019s brutality,\u201d in a statement Monday evening. \u201cIt is critical that the world continues to stand with\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0at this important moment and that we not ignore Russian aggression,\u201d Biden said.

{"id": "2024_07_13_americas_five-jailed-murdering-presidential-candidate-ecuador-intl", "text": "A court in Ecuador on Friday handed down prison sentences for five people found guilty of murdering presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio. Journalist and former legislator\u00a0Villavicencio was shot\u00a0while leaving a rally in August 2023, becoming the most prominent victim of Ecuador\u2019s\u00a0spiraling violence. The ruling, read out by Milton Maroto, one of the court\u2019s three judges, can be appealed by both the prosecution and the defense. The trial started at the end of June. Prosecutors accused at least two of those tried of belonging to the Los Lobos crime gang, among 22 criminal gangs designated as terrorists by President Daniel Noboa in January. According to the attorney general\u2019s office, Carlos Edwin Angulo Lara, known as \u2018El Invisible\u2019 (\u2018The Invisible\u2019), gave the order to murder Villavicencio from prison, while Laura Dayanara Castillo was in charge of logistics. Both Angulo and Castillo were sentenced to 34 years and eight months. Erick Ramirez, Victor Flores and Alexandra Chimbo were sentenced to 12 years. Villavicencio, whose journalism exposed corruption and connections between organized crime and politicians, had long faced threats. Prosecutors are undertaking a separate investigation into who requested the murder.

{"id": "2024_07_12_weather_houston-texas-power-outages-heat-friday", "text": "Half a million Houston-area homes and businesses may not have their power restored until next week amid sweltering summer heat, even as many in the region struggle to access fresh food, air conditioning and safe drinking water. More than 1 million power customers in southeast Texas \u2013 mainly between Galveston and north of Houston \u2013 are still without power after Hurricane Beryl hurtled into the Gulf Coast on Monday, leaving at least 10 people dead in Texas, two dead in Vermont and one dead in Louisiana. The outages have debilitated infrastructure across the region, including hospitals, assisted living facilities and water treatment plants, leading to mounting frustrations from residents that Houston\u2019s main utility, CenterPoint Energy, was not more prepared for the storm. Though the utility is racing to make repairs, a CenterPoint executive said roughly 500,000 customers will not have electrical power restored until sometime next week. The fatal destruction wrought by Hurricane Beryl extended to Vermont, where more than 100 people in Vermont had to be rescued. Two people were found dead in floodwaters there after the storm brought dramatic flooding to the state on Wednesday. John Rice, 73, was found dead Thursday after he drove into a flooded street in Lyndonville, and a current washed the car off the road into a hay field flooded with 10 feet of water, Lyndonville Police Chief Jack T. Harris told CNN in an email. The body of Dylan Kempton, 33, was also recovered from floodwaters early Thursday morning by first responders, according to a\u00a0Vermont State Police news release. He was riding a UTV that was washed off the road when a culvert breached. In Texas, the sustained power outages and devastating heat come even as many residents face substantial repairs of homes damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Beryl and the disastrous flooding it wrought along the coast. Waters were still receding from some coastal communities and roadways on Thursday, Texas Emergency Management Chief\u00a0Nim\u00a0Kidd said in a news conference. Houston area resident Frankie Thibideaux said her home remained swamped with water for days and became moldy in the heat. After two days, the 57-year-old couldn\u2019t stand to stay there any longer and left the residential building in Missouri City to stay in a hotel. \u201cWe can\u2019t live in a place like that,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t even let my dog live like those people are.\u201d The conditions have had life-threatening \u2013 and at times deadly \u2013 consequences. A 71-year-old woman died near Crystal Beach after her oxygen machine ran out of battery power and her generator shut down. And at least two people have died from carbon monoxide poisoning in Harris County, where fire departments have responded to more than 200 carbon monoxide poisoning calls from people attempting to use generators. Scores of homes are also without drinking water as storm damage and power outages have left 135 wastewater treatment plants offline, according to Kidd. Boil water notices stretch across eight counties in the Houston and Galveston areas, he added, noting water is being distributed across impacted communities. Adding to residents\u2019 distress are 90-degree temperatures that have baked the area every day this week and will continue into next week. The heat index \u2013 a measurement of how the body feels under both heat and humidity \u2013 could reach\u00a0106 degrees\u00a0in some areas Friday, a life-threatening scenario for people without adequate cooling. Tensions are running high as people become desperate for relief. Fort Bend County Sheriff Eric Fagan called for calm after the department received a report a man pulled a gun on a CenterPoint Energy worker \u2013 behavior the sheriff\u2019s office \u201cwill not tolerate.\u201d A dozen Houston area hospitals are in a state of \u201cinternal disaster\u201d and more than 40 dialysis clinics are struggling with outages, Kidd said. City officials are working to move dialysis patients to other locations and distribute generators to in-need facilities \u201cas fast as possible,\u201d he added. After Houston area hospitals determined it would be unsafe to discharge patients to homes without power, several locations became backed up, prompting city officials to organize overflow beds in an indoor sports stadium, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said Tuesday. Residents who are elderly or suffer from chronic illnesses are particularly at risk for heat-related illnesses, creating a dire scenario for the network of nursing homes and assisted living facilities still without power in the Houston area. Some such facilities are relying on an improvised patchwork of portable A/Cs and generators to protect their most vulnerable residents, some of whom rely on electronic medical devices to live. \u201cEvery day, it just seems to get worse and worse and worse,\u201d said Matthew Marchetti, co-founder of CrowdSource Rescue, a non-profit founded during Hurricane Harvey primarily serving as a search-and-rescue group. Marchetti\u2019s group of volunteers has helped deliver generators and supplies to 16 independent living facilities for seniors, but they\u2019ve identified roughly 120 facilities in need of help. \u201cThe whole city is hurting and suffering. That\u2019s what it feels like right now, from my vantage point,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think for the seniors, they\u2019re taking the brunt of it. So we\u2019re trying to do everything we can.\u201d Martin Cominsky, President and CEO of Interfaith Ministries for Greater Houston, oversees the Meals on Wheels program in the area, which serves 4,500 people over the age of 60 with hot meals every day. He said most of their clients don\u2019t have power right now, and staff who deliver food are offering their own cell phones to help seniors connect with loved ones, since many of their phones are dead. \u201cWe keep going back day after day,\u201d he said. \u201cNo job is too small or too hard in times like these.\u201d Utility faces barrage of criticism Houston\u2019s primary utility company, CenterPoint Energy, is responsible for a majority of the outages and is fielding growing frustration from residents and local officials who say the utility should have been more prepared for the storm. Though the utility said it had restored service to more than 1.3 million customers by Thursday night, roughly 500,000 will remain in the dark until sometime next week, according to a CenterPoint Energy executive who spoke Thursday before the Texas Public Utility Commission. The homes and businesses most deeply affected by the outage are those suffering massive electrical infrastructure damage from Hurricane Beryl, including the southern side of Houston and up through the Interstate 45 corridor, said Jason Ryan, one of the utility\u2019s executive vice presidents. \u201cWe know we still have a lot of work to do,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cI know customers are frustrated.\u201d Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has requested an investigation into how CenterPoint and other power companies responded to Hurricane Beryl, Patrick, the lieutenant governor, said Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m sure we will find that there are things they could have done better,\u201d Patrick said. Some residents have complained of a lack of communication from the utility, leaving people with little idea when they will have power again. The company responded to customer complaints its outage map shows areas have power when, in reality, they don\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019re working on the accuracy right now,\u201d CenterPoint Vice President of Operations Darin Carroll told CNN affiliate KHOU. \u201cWe track it constantly. We\u2019re making adjustments to the map as we speak. The other thing I want customers to know is even if you see yourself in that green on the map, don\u2019t worry; we know you\u2019re out of power, and we are gonna get to you.\u201d In an interview with the Houston Chronicle, CenterPoint CEO Jason Wells said he is proud of the progress the company has made toward restoration but acknowledged customers\u2019 frustrations about not knowing when they will have power again. \u201cI think we could do a better job of communicating expectations with our customers, and I personally own that,\u201d Wells told the Chronicle. CNN has reached out to CenterPoint Energy for comment. Ryan, the CenterPoint Energy executive, said the company started tracking Hurricane Beryl nine days before the storm made landfall. Just after July 4, days before the storm hit the Texas coast, the company put out its first request for 3,000 \u201cmutual assistance\u201d workers to pre-position ahead of the storm. As the path of the storm shifted closer to the Houston area before landfall, CenterPoint increased the request to 10,000, he said. In response to growing anger toward CenterPoint, several members of the Texas Public Utility Commission urged the utility\u2019s leadership to improve its communication and \u201crebuilding trust\u201d with customers in the hurricane-damaged areas. \u201cInfrastructure is going to break. Things are going to happen. But if people feel like they\u2019re being effectively communicated with, it makes it a lot easier to go through. And so, I\u2019d say get out into the community and go talk to your customers,\u201d said commission chairman Thomas Gleeson. The ongoing outages have also prompted renewed discussions about Texas\u2019 power grid. During a news conference Thursday, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick was asked by a reporter if the state is considering modifying the power grid, which\u00a0has encountered several issues over the years\u00a0due to severe weather. \u201cThe grid is a whole different issue which we\u2019re addressing, have been addressing, and will continue to address,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThe power is down because the lines are down, and the transmission lines are down primarily because trees fell on them.\u201d Patrick addressed a report by a local media which mentioned burying the lines, which he said would be \u201cprohibitively expensive.\u201d Scorching summer shows no sign of stopping Texas is not alone as it suffers from a brutally hot summer. The US is experiencing a historically hot and deadly summer \u2013 and the hottest days are yet to come. This has so far been the hottest summer on record for around 100 US cities from Maine to California, and heat is suspected in the deaths of at least 37 people in July alone. That number is likely an underestimate, given the amount of time it takes to attribute a death to nature\u2019s\u00a0deadliest form of extreme weather. Many of the deaths have been in the West, where cities have shattered all-time record high temperatures during an unprecedented and long heat wave \u2013 exactly the kind of conditions scientists expect in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Heat is being investigated in the deaths of at least 19 people in Santa Clara County, California, alone, the county\u2019s medical examiner office told CNN. Everyone is vulnerable to heat, but\u00a0some are more at risk\u00a0than others. Children, the elderly, pregnant people, people with heart or blood pressure issues, outdoor workers or anyone without access to reliable cooling are more likely to succumb to heat-related illnesses than others. At least three of the people who may have succumbed to heat in Santa Clara County were unhoused without adequate access to cooling. Nine were over the age of 65, the county medical examiner told CNN. The extreme levels of heat in the West will begin to subside this weekend, ushering in a slow return to near \u2013 or slightly above normal \u2013 summer temperatures. Even without hitting record-high daily temperatures, the region gets quite hot in July. Heat will be a consistent companion for many Americans through the end of July, as hotter than average temperatures are likely through the end of the month and into at least early August, according to the Climate Prediction Center.

The area has been cordoned off as a crime scene, and \u201cpreliminary investigations suggest a similar mode of killing of the deceased,\u201d the statement said. The bodies were found wrapped in \u201cnylon papers and reinforced with nylon ropes\u201d and have been transported to a mortuary where \u201cthey await postmortem examinations,\u201d police added. The identities of the dead or how long the bodies had been at the quarry were not immediately clear. \u201cIt appears to be a dumping site for bodies and I suspect there could be more,\u201d Hussein Khalid, executive director of human rights group Vocal Africa told CNN. \u201cThey were all women, all tied with the same color of ribbons, and same color of sacks,\u201d he said. Angry residents who marched to the nearby Kware police station were dispersed by teargas as shots rang in the air. CNN has reached out to the police for comment. The horrifying scene comes after weeks of anti-government protests over a since-scrapped finance bill. The protests resulted in scores of civilian deaths amid a heavy-handed response from Kenyan police. Human rights groups have also accused security forces of abducting Kenyans during the protests. The discovery of the bodies on Friday has sparked fresh public anger and brought a new spotlight to Kenya\u2019s femicide crisis, just months after thousands of women marched on the streets with banners reading: \u201cStop killing us.\u201d Fallout from protests Dozens of people were killed in police shootings across the country in just one day of the anti-government protests in June, according to\u00a0Kenya\u2019s Police Reforms Working Group (PRWG). A CNN team outside the\u00a0Kenyan parliament on June 25\u00a0witnessed security forces shooting at unarmed protesters. The CNN crew also filmed\u00a0Kenyan police beating and later arresting some paramedics who were helping injured protesters in Nairobi. Kenya\u2019s presidency announced that Japheth Koome, the country\u2019s police chief, resigned on Friday. His deputy, Douglas Kanja, has been named acting police chief. Friday\u2019s move comes after nearly all of President William Ruto\u2019s cabinet was fired, with the exceptions of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua and Prime Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi. The decision was taken \u201cupon reflection, and a holistic appraisal\u201d of his cabinet, he told reporters from State House Nairobi.

{"id": "2024_07_13_weather_beryl-houston-texas-power-outages-heat-saturday", "text": "Hundreds of thousands of southeast Texas residents are entering the sixth day in a row suffering brutal heat without air conditioning and many are scrambling to find cool shelters, food, safe drinking water and health care resources. More than 760,000 power customers in southeast Texas remain without power after Hurricane Beryl slammed the Gulf Coast Monday, leaving at least 10 people dead in Texas, two dead in Vermont and one dead in Louisiana. Hospitals, assisted living facilities, schools and water treatment plants are scraping for resources after the outages debilitated infrastructure across the region. That has led to mounting frustrations from residents that Houston\u2019s main utility provider \u2013 CenterPoint Energy \u2013 was not more prepared for the storm and renewed concerns over the state\u2019s power grid. Pregnant Houston resident Jordyn Rush, 32, worries for her health as the intense heat deprives her of sleep and her fridge sits empty while the outage drags on, making life difficult as she prepares to undergo a C-section in 12 days. \u201cIt\u2019s been an absolute nightmare,\u201d Rush said. \u201cI\u2019m on the verge of like a mental breakdown. At this point, I can\u2019t tell you the last time I was able to get a full night of sleep because it\u2019s so hot. The lack of sleep is definitely wearing on me.\u201d CenterPoint Energy says it\u2019s hoping to restore power to an additional 350,000 customers by Sunday, according to a statement Friday evening. Still, half a million Houston-area homes and businesses may not have their power restored until next week, the utility company said, even as triple digit heat indices remain in the forecast. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick criticized the utility in a post Friday, saying \u201cwe should not have roughly a million homes and businesses without power this far out.\u201d \u201cWe should not have had almost every traffic light down through yesterday, with many still down. We should not have had nine fire stations without power,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cSeniors in assisted living and nursing homes should have been more of a priority for power restoration.\u201d Since Beryl pounded the region, heat advisories have been issued every day for the greater Houston area, with high temperatures in the 90s and triple-digit heat indices. Combined with power outages, alarmingly dangerous consequences have ensued. As residents desperately try to cool their homes with generators, carbon monoxide poisoning has become a serious concern. In Fort Bend County, a neighboring suburb to Houston, more than 41 people suffered carbon monoxide poisoning, Judge KP George said at a news conference Friday. In Harris County, at least two people have died from carbon monoxide poisoning and fire departments received more than 200 carbon monoxide poisoning calls in 24 hours, local officials said. The US Department of Health and Human Services on Friday declared a public health emergency for Texas. \u201cThe combination of severe heat and limited access to electricity is dangerous, especially for vulnerable populations and those relying on electricity-dependent durable medical equipment and certain healthcare services,\u201d said Dawn O\u2019Connell, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, in a news release. Senior care facilities and residents who rely on electric medical devices are particularly at risk. A 71-year-old woman woman died near Crystal Beach after her oxygen machine ran out of battery power and her generator shut down. CrowdSource Rescue, a nonprofit primarily serving as a search-and-rescue group, identified roughly 120 senior living facilities that need assistance and helped deliver generators and supplies to 16 so far. A dozen Houston area hospitals are in a state of \u201cinternal disaster\u201d and more than 40 dialysis clinics are struggling with outages, Texas Emergency Management Chief\u00a0Nim\u00a0Kidd said in a news conference Thursday. Backed up hospitals prompted city officials to organize overflow beds in an indoor sports stadium, Lt. Gov. Patrick said Tuesday. In addition to health care facilities feeling the strain, residents at home are struggling to find food and water. Countless families have lost food in their warming fridges as many stores are shuttered, leaving government offices, food banks and other public services scrambling to distribute food to underserved areas. Scores of homes are also without drinking water as storm damage and power outages have left 135 wastewater treatment plants offline, according to Kidd. For Rush, who has gestational diabetes, it\u2019s been difficult to stay on the strict diet she needs to be on. \u201cI have to go in next week to do a pre-anesthesia lab draw and I\u2019m hoping that my labs aren\u2019t crazy from like a lack of nutrition and water,\u201d she said. \u201cMy heart burn is out of control. I feel like I\u2019m getting dehydrated.\u201d Beryl swept through the Houston area in an unusually early start to hurricane season, knocking out power for more than 2 million customers, only about two months after a powerful derecho in the area damaged skyscrapers, downed transmission towers and left downtown dark. The Federal Emergency Management Agency granted Harris County and 14 other Texas counties financial assistance for impacted families as they face substantial repairs for homes damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Beryl. In the meantime, officials are racing to find ways to help residents beat the sweltering heat. Galveston, located south\u00a0of\u00a0Houston, is using transit buses to give some residents an \u201cair conditioned respite\u201d as portions of the city remain without power after Hurricane Beryl, according to City Manager Brian Maxwell. The city has also been distributing ice and providing portable showers. In Fort Bend County, emergency medical services is providing oxygen refills, electricity to power oxygen concentrators and rides to cooling centers. Frustration mounts with Houston utility provider The crisis comes more than three years after massive power outages hit the state. In February 2021, a deep freeze killed more than 200 people and left millions of customers without power and heat for days. Now, the ongoing outages have turned attention back to the state\u2019s power grid. Gov. Greg Abbott has requested an investigation into CenterPoint Energy and other electric companies in the wake of the outages, Patrick said at a news conference Thursday. Patrick on Friday criticized CenterPoint Energy\u2019s communication with customers and said they should have been ready for any storm hitting the Houston area. \u201cPeople have a right to be extremely frustrated with CenterPoint. People are suffering through terribly oppressive heat, a lack of food and gasoline availability, debris everywhere, and much more,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThe poor and most vulnerable are suffering the most.\u201d CenterPoint in a statement Friday said it had been tracking Beryl\u2019s trajectory and preparing for its impact nine days before it made landfall. The company said it had increased crew members from 3,000 to 12,000 in response to the storm. CenterPoint CEO Jason Wells told the Houston Chronicle he is proud of the progress the company has made toward restoration but acknowledged customers\u2019 frustrations about not knowing when they will have power again. \u201cI think we could do a better job of communicating expectations with our customers, and I personally own that,\u201d Wells said. During a news conference Thursday, Patrick was asked by a reporter whether the state is considering modifying the power grid, which\u00a0has encountered several issues over the years\u00a0due to severe weather. \u201cThe grid is a whole different issue which we\u2019re addressing, have been addressing, and will continue to address,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cThe power is down because the lines are down, and the transmission lines are down primarily because trees fell on them.\u201d Displacement brings back memories Houston resident Destinee Rideaux, 33, is displaced for the second time after a hurricane \u2013 and this time it\u2019s because her home is too hot to live in. Because her apartment gets as hot as 96 degrees during the day, she\u2019s been forced to stay at different friends\u2019 apartments each night and carry around her belongings in her car. And Rideaux says she\u2019s \u201cexhausted.\u201d It brings back her memories of being displaced from her home in Iowa, Louisiana, during Hurricane Laura in 2020, she said. \u201cWe evacuated the day she hit. The next morning, we were able to get footage of the home and it was flattened. It was picked up and thrown across the yard and flattened. And everything we had was thrown across the yard,\u201d she told CNN. For Rush, the crisis is a repeat of the derecho in May, when her home didn\u2019t have power for six days. \ufeff\u201cWe had to clear our fridge completely for the second time in less than two months. It\u2019s our second time in less than two months of being displaced from our home,\u201d Rush said. \u201cWe are left without any communication or updates, so we have no idea what kind of plans we need to make or if we need to make preparations to find a hotel because most of the hotels here are completely booked.\u201d After Rideaux\u2019s Louisiana house was destroyed, she stayed with friends in the Houston area, and then decided to stay there permanently for a fresh start. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to be back in this position of just displacement,\u201d Rideaux\u00a0said. \u201cDuring Laura, every day I didn\u2019t know what that day would bring, where I was going to go. You also have the mental thing going on of like becoming a burden on other people.\u201d But Rideaux said this time isn\u2019t nearly as difficult because she\u2019ll be able to return to her home eventually. \u201cOnce the power comes back on, I have a home to go to,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/weather/beryl-houston-texas-power-outages-heat-saturday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_14_middleeast_hamas-commander-killed-khan-younis-intl", "text": "Israel has announced that a Hamas commander was killed in Saturday\u2019s strike on southern Gaza, but the fate of the major target, Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, remains uncertain. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Sunday that Rafe Salama, the head of the Khan Younis brigade and Deif\u2019s deputy, was \u201celiminated\u201d in the attack. According to the statement, Salama was \u201cone of the closest associates\u201d of Deif, as well as \u201cone of the masterminds\u201d of Hamas\u2019 attack on October 7. It remains unclear if Deif himself died in Saturday\u2019s strike. The Israeli military is verifying whether he was killed while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also acknowledged it is uncertain whether he died. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said the strike killed at least 90 Palestinians  and injured 300 others in Al-Mawasi, a designated humanitarian zone. The UN\u2019s Scott Anderson described what he saw at a nearby hospital in the aftermath of the strikes as \u201cthe most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.\u201d An elusive and powerful figure, Deif is understood to be one of the architects behind the\u00a0October 7 attacks. He has led the Palestinian militant group\u2019s armed wing for more than two decades. If his death is confirmed, Deif would be the highest profile Hamas leader killed since the war in Gaza began nine months ago. Israel has been seeking to dismantle Hamas following the October 7 attacks but with fighting ongoing and senior Hamas figures at large, that goal has seemed distant. Israeli intelligence services said this past week they killed a total of 25 Hamas operatives involved in the October 7 attacks. Ronen Bar, the head of Israel\u2019s intelligence agency, the Shin Bet announced the figure during a meeting with commanders from the IDF\u2019s Southern Command and 162 Division held in Rafah on Saturday. Bar commended the results of the Shin Bet\u2019s \u201cintensified activity\u201d within Gaza. Meanwhile, a fresh Israeli airstrike that hit a UN agency school in a camp for displaced people in central Gaza on Sunday has killed at least 15 and injured more than 100 others, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza and officials at a nearby hospital. Video from the scene\u00a0in\u00a0Al-Nuseirat\u00a0camp shows bodies and\u00a0injured people \u2014 some bleeding and covered\u00a0in\u00a0rubble \u2014 being rushed to ambulances.

{"id": "2024_07_13_europe_paris-olympics-sex-education-pleasure-spt-intl", "text": "The City of Love has a message as it prepares for the Olympics: Performance is not always the priority. Rather, when it comes to sex, pleasure takes first place. As Paris starts welcoming athletes to the Olympic Village in the coming days, organizers of the 2024 Games are set to launch a comprehensive sexual health campaign that champions pleasure and consent as well as the traditional emphasis on safety. It is an important message, backed by research, that is rarely endorsed on a stage with a global spotlight as influential as the Olympics. Prioritizing pleasure in sexual health refers to the approach of celebrating the physical and mental benefits of sexual experiences as well as minimizing the risks. It aims to rewrite fear and shame narratives that cast sex as taboo, with sexual health organizations promoting the sex-positive method as fundamental for unlocking greater agency over sexual rights and well-being. A systematic review by the World Health Organization and advocacy group The Pleasure Project found that pleasure-inclusive sex education is a more effective sexual health intervention strategy than abstinence programs and risk-focused messaging. The findings show that it increases condom usage and enhances knowledge and self-esteem, which are crucial to promoting safer choices in the bedroom. The decision to focus on pleasure-inclusive messaging at the Olympics is especially significant at a time when sex education is increasingly under attack in many countries. In the United States alone, 2024 has seen a surge in restrictive state-level sex education proposals that aim to limit what can be taught in the classroom, such as by removing guidance around contraception or advocating for abstinence. History of Sex Ed at the Olympics Paris\u2019s focus on pleasure and consent is part of the Olympics\u2019 long-running history of promoting safe sex, with organizers of the 1988 Seoul Games first making headline-grabbing hand-outs of condoms to competitors to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS. Since then, the International Olympic Committee has encouraged host cities to roll out condom initiatives at all summer and winter games, from a record-breaking 450,000 condoms at the 2016 Rio Olympics - equivalent to 42 per athlete - to keeping up the tradition at the 2022 Beijing Olympics despite COVID-19 social distancing rules. This year, organizers in charge of first aid announced that over 200,000 male condoms, 20,000 female condoms, and 10,000 dental dams would be made available at the Paris Olympic Village, which will host around 14,500 athletes. They will also have numerous sexual health testing centers on site for athletes, in addition to the sexual health awareness messaging. While one athlete - a gold medallist - once suggested sex was \u201c\u200b\u200bpart of the Olympic spirit \u2026 Why do you think they give away so many condoms?\u201d the massive number of condoms distributed is not just a reflection of the competitors\u2019 extra-athletic activities. Instead, the initiatives are intended to be used as a springboard for sex education. Anne Philpott is the founder of The Pleasure Project, an international organization that has spent the past two decades advocating for pleasure-inclusive sex education. She applauds Paris\u2019 decision to pair its condom initiative with pleasure and consent messaging. \u201cSo far the public health world has not done a good job of promoting safe sex,\u201d Philpott said, explaining that promoting condoms \u201cpurely for avoiding negative consequences,\u201d is not effective. Rather, she says the most productive way to encourage safe sex is to flip the script from the beginning by focusing on why people have sex. \u201cPeople think pleasure is a bit frivolous or the icing on the cake. But we now know that if we had integrated pleasure considerations into sexual health interventions from the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, we would have saved considerably more lives,\u201d Philpott explained. Philpott told CNN that the need to shift the narrative in safe sex conversations is as urgent as ever. She says if there is a failure to do so, people could instead shape their opinions from the misinformation and harmful explicit content running rampant online. \u201cThere\u2019s been a big rise in choking being seen as a normal part of sexual activity when it\u2019s actually very dangerous,\u201d Philpott gave as an example, as she urged sex education curriculums to catch up with what people are able to access online. Turning sport into a sex ed classroom The need to learn about one\u2019s sexual desires, needs, and boundaries is a constantly evolving process, with the Olympics\u2019 spotlight on safe sex also highlighting the opportunity for wider sporting communities to become trusted spaces for such conversations. In the coastal town of Kilifi in Kenya, Deogratia Okoko sees the value of expanding sex education beyond the classroom, using soccer to teach young boys about issues such as consent and contraception. The scheme to which he contributes, known as \u201cMoving The Goalposts,\u201d works directly with community leaders, fathers, and young boys to provide resources on sexual health, sexual rights, gender, and positive masculinity. \u201cWe found that one of the places that they spend a lot of their time is the football pitch,\u201d Okoko said. \u201cWe began to design our sessions based on soccer drills to explain certain issues,\u201d Okoko said, adding: \u201cYou\u2019ll find that sometimes they get so engrossed in the debrief discussions that they forget that they were supposed to actually train and play.\u201d Okoko explained that the initiative also provides a safe space for boys to access condoms and HIV testing kits, with societal shame often creating barriers for boys to buy these products directly from the shops. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just let\u2019s play football, let\u2019s practice and go away \u2026 these spaces are now a community used by them to talk about issues that they\u2019d not normally talk about,\u201d Okoko said. \u201cOne of the things that really came clearly to me was how using this strategy helped in mental health,\u201d Okoko told CNN. \u201cThey feel like they can talk about anything, if there\u2019s a challenge that they\u2019re going through, they come to the pitch.\u201d Reflecting on the Paris organizers\u2019 decision to include pleasure and consent in their sexual health messaging, Okoko says it is \u201cimperative\u201d to have high-profile platforms set the example. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental. It\u2019s important. It\u2019s good if we, to the best of our abilities, find great ways of passing that message across,\u201d Okoko said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/europe/paris-olympics-sex-education-pleasure-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_europe_france-election-what-next-explainer-intl", "text": "On Sunday night, joy: French voters had, once again, kept the far right out of power. On Monday morning, uncertainty: A hung parliament, shaky alliances and the threat of turbulent years ahead. President Emmanuel Macron called France\u2019s snap parliamentary election to \u201cclarify\u201d the political situation. But after the shock second-round results, the waters are more muddied than they have been in decades. While a surge in support for the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition foiled Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party, French politics is now more disordered than it was before the vote. So, what did we learn last night, who might be France\u2019s next prime minister, and has Macron\u2019s gamble \u201cpaid off?\u201d A shock victory, but not a decisive one After leading the first round of voting last Sunday, the RN was closer to the gates of power than ever before, and was on the cusp of forming France\u2019s first far-right government since the collaborationist Vichy regime of World War II. But after a week of political bargaining, in which more than 200 left-wing and centrist candidates withdrew from the second round in a bid to avoid splitting the vote, the NFP \u2013 a cluster of several parties from the extreme left to the more moderate \u2013 emerged with the most seats in the decisive second round. The NFP won 182 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest group in the 577-seat parliament. Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance, which trailed in a distant third in the first round, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. And the RN and its allies, despite leading the first round, won 143 seats. Does that mean the NFP \u201cwon\u201d the election? Not quite. Although the coalition has the most seats, it fell well short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, meaning France now has a hung parliament. If this was a victory for anything, it was the \u201ccordon sanitaire,\u201d the principle that mainstream parties must unite to prevent the extreme right from taking office. The far right kept at bay, but more potent than ever It was meant to be a coronation. Crowds of supporters had crammed into election night events at the RN party HQ in Paris and at outposts all over the country, to watch the moment many felt had been decades in the making: Confirmation that their party, and its long-taboo brand of anti-immigrant politics, had won the most seats in the French parliament. That wasn\u2019t to be. The fervent atmosphere soured as supporters saw the RN had slumped to third place. Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old leader handpicked by Le Pen to freshen the party\u2019s image and purge it of its racist and antisemitic roots, was dyspeptic. He railed against the \u201cdangerous electoral deals\u201d made between the NFP and Ensemble which had \u201cdeprived the French people\u201d of an RN-led government. \u201cBy deciding to deliberately paralyze our institutions, Emmanuel Macron has now pushed the country towards uncertainty and instability,\u201d Bardella said, dismissing the NFP as an \u201calliance of dishonor.\u201d Still, the RN\u2019s success should not be underestimated. In the 2017 elections, when Macron swept to power, the RN won just eight seats. In 2022, it surged to 89 seats. In Sunday\u2019s vote, it won 125 \u2013 making it the largest individual party. That unity means it will likely remain a potent force in the next parliament, while the solidity of the leftist coalition remains untested. Will the left remain united? A month ago, the NFP did not exist. Now, it is the largest bloc in the French parliament and could provide France with its next prime minister. It chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. Sunday\u2019s results mean it has done so again. But while it achieved its founding purpose, it is unclear whether this capacious \u2013 and potential fractious \u2013 coalition will hold. The hastily assembled bloc comprises several parties: the far-left France Unbowed party; the Socialists; the green Ecologists; the center-left Place Publique and others. This many-headed hydra does not speak with a single voice. Each party celebrated the results at their own campaign events, rather than together. Two of its most prominent figures \u2013 Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the populist France Unbowed leader, and Raphael Glucksmann, the more moderate leader of Place Publique \u2013 are barely on speaking terms. Disagreements over economic and foreign policies could spill over, as the NFP\u2019s expansive spending plans \u2013 which include raising the minimum wage, capping the price of certain foods and energy and scrapping Macron\u2019s pension reforms \u2013 collide with the European Union\u2019s restrictive fiscal rules and France\u2019s need to rein in its ballooning deficit. A better night for Macron than expected, but he emerges weakened Macron once said his thoughts are \u201ctoo complex\u201d for journalists. Still, his decision to call a snap election \u2013 three years earlier than necessary, and with his party way behind in the polls \u2013 baffled the sharpest of political analysts, caught even his closest allies off guard and left many French voters confused. He called the vote minutes after his party was trounced by the RN in last month\u2019s European Parliament elections. Although European results need have no bearing on domestic politics, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent to him by voters and wanted to clarify the situation. But Sunday\u2019s results suggest he has achieved the opposite. \u00c9duoard Philippe, France\u2019s former prime minister and an ally of Macron, said what was \u201cintended as a clarification has instead led to great vagueness.\u201d Although Macron\u2019s party recovered from the first round, it lost around 100 seats compared to the 2022 election. Where does France go from here? Macron\u2019s first decision is to appoint a new prime minister. He has already delayed this process by declining Gabriel Attal\u2019s resignation, asking him to stay in office for now. Typically, the French president appoints a prime minister from the largest bloc in parliament. But it is unclear from which party within the NFP this will be. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s party won the most seats within the NFP, but Macron\u2019s allies have repeatedly refused to work with France Unbowed, saying it is just as extreme \u2013 and therefore as unfit to govern \u2013 as the RN. In order to reach the majority needed to pass laws, the NFP will likely have to enter into alliances with Ensemble \u2013 as two coalitions enter an even larger coalition, straddling vast ideological ground. Finding common ground will be a fraught task, meaning gridlock is likely. Without a clear majority, a minority government faces the risk of no-confidence votes as soon as this month, which could lead to several governments replacing each other. One way out could be a \u201ctechnocratic\u201d government, which would involve Macron appointing ministers with no party affiliation to manage day-to-day matters. But these can come to seem undemocratic and can further fan the flames of populism. Just look at Italy: after the premiership of Mario Draghi, the technocrat par excellence, the country elected its most far-right government since Benito Mussolini. While France avoided a far-right government for now, the RN threat is likely to remain strong.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/europe/france-election-what-next-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Created as a celebration of women and justice, the statue\u2019s hair was braided into two ram horns (a symbol of strength, according to Madison Square Park\u2019s exhibition guide) and features a large hoop skirt \u2014 inspired by the stained-glass ceiling dome at the courthouse\u00a0\u2014 smattered with shards of painted mosaic pieces: A woman decorated by a broken glass ceiling. But these artistic features, particularly the braided horns and abstract branch-like arms, have drawn criticism and attention.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

Two paintings and a drawing by Pablo Picasso  were originally featured in American artist and museum curator  Kirsha Kaechele\u2019s \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d installation at Tasmania\u2019s Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) \u2013 \u00a0which opened in December 2020 \u2013 \u201cto any and all ladies.\u201d The experiential artwork was billed by the museum as a \u201ctremendously lavish space\u201d where women can indulge in \u201cdecadent nibbles, fancy tipples, and other ladylike pleasures\u201d served by a male butler while they peruse art in a green velvet-draped room. But MONA was ordered to stop refusing entry to \u201cpersons who do not identify as ladies\u201d after the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ruled in April that the show violated Australia\u2019s 1998 Anti-Discrimination Act. Kaechele told the tribunal that denying men entry to the mysterious room was indeed part of the art \u2014 giving\u00a0them\u00a0a taste of the discrimination and exclusion many women have experienced through history. The Picasso pieces are now displayed in an upgraded restroom with a fully functional toilet dubbed \u201cLadies Room,\u201d located within the art venue, Kaechele said in an e-mail. \u201cWhile the Ladies Lounge undergoes a series of reforms to meet the exemptions required for reopening, I\u2019ve been doing a little redecorating. I thought a few of the bathrooms in the museum could do with an update,\u201d she added. \u201cSome Cubism in the cubicles.\u201d On Monday, Kaechele posted on Instagram a video and images of the relocated works in situ, and pointed out that the gendered restroom was also a first for the museum. She encouraged \u201call ladies\u201d to enjoy the new exhibition. \u2018Ladies Lounge\u2019 closed \u201cWe never had female toilets at Mona before, they were all unisex.

Jason Lau, a visitor from New South Wales was barred from entering the \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d exhibit on April 1 in 2023. Lau, who had paid the $35 AUD ($23 USD) entry fee, believed he experienced direct gender discrimination. \u201cHe felt strongly enough about this to file a complaint with Equal Opportunities Tasmania,\u201d read the tribunal\u2019s notes. After the judgment, Kaechele said she would challenge the court\u2019s decision in the state\u2019s Supreme Court and offered several possibilities to revive the \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d concept. Among those ideas included finding loopholes under Section 27 of the Anti-Discrimination Act which lists exceptions on when discrimination against gender would be permitted. In the meantime the lounge closed so that it wouldn\u2019t have to open to men.

{"id": "2024_07_13_asia_malayan-tiger-deaths-malaysia-extinction-intl-hnk", "text": "A recent spate of alarming deaths has heightened fears for the Malayan tiger, wildlife authorities and conservationists say, with some calling the threat to Malaysia\u2019s emblematic animal a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d Native to the jungles of peninsular Malaysia, the majestic feline subspecies is critically endangered, with fewer than 150 believed to be left in the wild due to habitat loss, illegal poaching and a decline in prey. Found on Malaysia\u2019s coat of arms and considered a national heritage symbol, its numbers have plummeted since the 1950s, when around 3,000 roamed the Southeast Asian country, officials say. Against that already grim backdrop, photos and videos of a dead Malayan tiger went viral on social media in late June. The carcass, found bloated and floating in a stream in the rural northern state of Kelantan, was discovered by forest rangers. There was no sign of injury from snares or gunshots, and state forestry officials are conducting a post-mortem examination. The images provoked strong reactions from many in Malaysia, who noted the urgency of saving their national symbol from extinction. \u201cThe plight of Malayan tigers is a national crisis that requires the full attention and commitment of all Malaysians,\u201d Henry Chan, director of conservation at the World Wildlife Fund Malaysia (WWF), told CNN. Stronger conservation efforts are needed, he added, such as enhancing patrols in critical tiger habitats and leveraging advanced technology such as camera traps and drones for monitoring and surveillance. \u201cThese magnificent creatures continue to teeter on the brink of extinction,\u201d Chan said. \u201cLosing just one tiger brings the entire species closer to extinction, making every individual tiger\u2019s life extremely critical to the survival of the species.\u201d \u201cThe Malayan tiger is on the brink of extinction with fewer than 150 remaining in the wild,\u201d said Mark Rayan Darmaraj, country director of Wildlife Conservation Society Malaysia, who noted that suspected poachers were arrested in a separate case in the nearby state of Pahang the following day, \u201cin possession of the skull and bones of a tiger.\u201d \u201cThey suffer from habitat loss, prey depletion and retaliatory killings stemming from human-tiger conflicts,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditionally, the construction of roads through their habitats increases the risk of fatal vehicle collisions as seen in several recent incidents.\u201d On July 6, authorities in the western state of Perak were alerted to a dead tiger found in a storm drain off a major highway. Estimated to have been around 4 years old, the adult male had been hit by a car, officials said. A month earlier, the body of another adult tiger was found by an expressway in Pahang state. Officials believe the tiger, believed to have been 5 years old, was run over by a vehicle while trying to cross the road from a nearby forest reserve. It was the fourth Malayan tiger killed by a vehicle collision between November 2023 and May 2024, according to authorities. Eight-year plan The Malayan tiger was recognized as a subspecies in 2004. Like all tigers, they are excellent swimmers and powerful apex predators. Smaller than Indonesia\u2019s Sumatran tigers and the Bengal tigers found across South Asia, Malayan tigers can grow to about 2.5 meters (about 8 feet) long and weigh up to 130 kilograms (about 280 pounds), experts say, and need large swaths of forest to roam. Their slightly darker, reddish-orange coats also distinguish them from other tiger species. In an eight-year National Tiger Conservation Action Plan released in collaboration with non-profit groups in 2020, Malaysian officials outlined priorities such as conservation tools and a \u201cNational Physical Plan\u201d to aid conservation efforts. \u201cBy implementing a suite of concerted actions, backed by political commitment and public support, we as a nation and as part of the global conservation community can ensure that one of the most majestic and charismatic animals with which we share the planet will not vanish,\u201d the report said.

Charity group M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said on Wednesday that it was forced to shut its last health facility in northern Gaza after Israel\u2019s evacuation order. \u201cTeams continued to provide patient care until the last minute, before fleeing the area that came under heavy fire,\u201d MSF said on X.  Residents could be seen walking down Salah Al-Din Street from northern Gaza with their belongings. Some held white flags made of sticks and white shirts. Baraa, a young man pushing a bicycle, said he was staying alone with his brother in northern Gaza, but \u201cthe situation became very difficult, there is no food.\u201d A woman from Shajaiya, one of Gaza City\u2019s biggest neighborhoods, said the area had come under persistent shelling, adding that she saw many people dead in the streets. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned the directive for residents to leave Gaza City threatened to intensify the plight of already displaced communities. The IDF has been issuing evacuation orders affecting large parts of Gaza City since Sunday, urging 250,000 residents to head to \u201csafe zones\u201d further south, in Deir al-Balah and al-Zawaida. The IDF has said that evacuation orders are necessary so that civilians don\u2019t get caught up in its renewed operations in areas where Hamas is seeking to re-establish a presence. The IDF insists it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. Hamas has said the evacuations threaten to return negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage deal to \u201cpoint zero.\u201d \u201cEvery day they would tell us to evacuate and we are displaced from one place to another while quadcaptors are shooting at us,\u201d Mahmoud Al Shaqra, a resident of Gaza City, told CNN as he evacuated southwards. \u201cGaza City is completely destroyed, it is unlivable,\u201d Al Sharqa said. \u201cThere is no food or drink or anything here.

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

At least five passages near Panama\u2019s border with Colombia have been shut using barbed wire installed by\u00a0the country\u2019s border agency (Senafront). Meanwhile, Panama\u2019s navy is patrolling areas in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean. The government said the navy is instructed to stop and detain people traveling by boat with \u201cirregular migrants\u201d and to hand them over to police or immigration authorities from Colombia. On land, border authorities have closed irregular access areas with the goal of rerouting people through established border points. The United States and Panama signed\u00a0an agreement this month on immigration issues that aimed to \u201cclose the passage of illegal migrants\u201d through the Dari\u00e9n Gap. Panama\u2019s President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino has also vowed to stop the Central American country from being a transit route for migrants. \u201cI will not allow\u00a0Panama\u00a0to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,\u201d Mulino\u00a0said at his swearing-in ceremony on July 1. Mulino visited the Dari\u00e9n Gap days before Thursday\u2019s announcement, saying 300 border agents were going to be deployed to monitor the area and declaring that no one would enter\u00a0Panamanian territory without a passport or a valid document. Colombia\u2019s Ombudsman\u2019s Office has criticized Panama\u2019s latest move saying that the barbed wires affect at least one Colombian town\u2019s commercial and cultural exchange with areas in\u00a0Panama. \u201cThe barbed wires in the jungle will only bring drowned people into the sea. Migration is stopped by removing economic blockades and improving the economy of the south,\u201d Colombia\u2019s President Gustavo Petro wrote on X. The Dari\u00e9n\u00a0Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, has seen an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the\u00a0Dari\u00e9n\u00a0Gap\u00a0brings migrants from Colombia to\u00a0Panama\u00a0and is a crucial passage for those \u2013 many of whom come from other Latin American countries \u2013 hoping to reach the US and Canada. Panamanian figures show at least 174,513 migrants crossed the treacherous Dari\u00e9n\u00a0Gap, from January to June 6 of this year. The latest figures are higher than around the same period in 2023, when more than 166,000 crossings were reported, according to\u00a0Panama\u2019s National Migration Service. According to migration service figures, a record 520,000 people crossed the jungle last year. Other countries along the migration route have also taken steps to restrict people\u2019s movement. In June, Ecuador said it would temporarily suspend a visa waiver agreement with China over what it called an increase in irregular migration flows of\u00a0Chinese\u00a0citizens.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/americas/panama-darien-gap-barbed-wire-migrants-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Microsoft took a\u00a0non-voting, observer position\u00a0on OpenAI\u2019s board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company, which operates the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT. The seat meant it could attend OpenAI\u2019s board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors. The observer seat and Microsoft\u2019s more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the US over how much control it exerts over OpenAI.

{"id": "2024_07_09_europe_how-macron-lost-france-intl-cmd", "text": "It feels like a lifetime ago. Emmanuel Macron marched on to the stage in 2017, a boyish spring in his step and a breathless excitement in his victory speech: The grand entrance to his presidency. He\u00a0promised\u00a0to be France\u2019s centrist hope after decades of division, the great reformer who would jolt France to the forefront of global business.\u00a0He\u2019s now staring at what will certainly be his real legacy: Macron opened the door to the far right in France. After a shattering defeat in May\u2019s European Parliament election, his decision to call a snap election has, at least partially, backfired. In a surprise result, the New Popular Front (NFP), a cluster of left-wing parties, won 182 seats in the National Assembly, short of a majority but ahead of both Macron\u2019s centrist bloc and the far right. The far-right bloc was widely expected to come first, but a country-wide effort to hold it back, with both leftists and centrist candidates standing down to concentrate the anti-far-right vote, succeeded. A relief for Macron, who should be saved from forced cooperation with a far-right prime minister. But the political chaos of a hung parliament awaits: A far-cry from the landslide he won in 2017. Bold is how many distilled his rocketing ascent into the French presidency; arrogant is how many now view his Icarus-like fall from grace. Macron demolished the architecture of French politics in his meteoric rise to the Elysee Palace. Carving out a new, centrist party from the political right and left, his landslide victory in 2017 \u2013 after just a short stint as a government minister - set him up to suffocate the political landscape, trying to satisfy anti-immigrant border policies with fiscally loose environmental and social protections. With Macron dominating the middle ground, political oxygen was sucked to the extremes. That\u2019s seen a polarization of policy proposals \u2013 from neutering France\u2019s sacrosanct secularism on the left to hounding out \u201cIslamist ideologies\u201d on the right \u2013 and a deepening, painful division in French society. His political star has burnt bright but is already collapsing on itself. This is an end of his own making. Love or hate relationship Never afraid to chart a difficult course, early in his presidency he plowed into his project of reform: slashing taxes for the rich and hiking diesel prices. The proposals were typically Macronian: Fiscally sound, business-minded and poorly marketed. The public reaction too\u00a0became\u00a0classic for Macron: Fiery outrage on the streets of France. The diesel tax sparked the worst protests France \u2013 perhaps the spiritual home of street anger \u2013 had seen in decades. The\u00a0\u201cyellow vest\u201d movement swept the country\u00a0in 2018, bringing hundreds of thousands of everyday French people on to the streets, braving harsh policing and succeeding in holding the country\u2019s political agenda hostage. \u201cI think that no country moves forward if it does not also hear this part of the legitimate anger of our people,\u201d he said, a couple of months after protests began. \u201cI think that they\u2019re reconcilable and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d It took the longest street protest in 50 years, but Macron eventually\u00a0did\u00a0listen to the anger of the yellow vests, or gilets jaunes. For a former banker-turned-economy minister, with little relatable experience of everyday France, his solution was a bold stroke of PR: A nationwide tour of town halls, a chance to hear and be heard. A man never far from accusations of being an ivory-tower politician\u00a0offered a humble face. Political stormtrooper Then came Covid-19. Macron deployed the all-or-nothing approach he favored, with one of the strictest lockdown regimes in Europe, in repeated waves, and a rigid vaccination protocol. \u201cWe are at war,\u201d he told the nation in March 2020. \u201cDay and night, nothing must distract us from it.\u201d He embraced a similar philosophy post-pandemic, as the global economy struggled to rebound and tensions over Ukraine threatened to throttle economic growth. Macron spent big, shielding French businesses and consumers from the worst of energy prices hikes, just months after massive post-Covid spending. By 2024, France was running one of the highest deficits in the Eurozone but the former economy minister had got what he paid for. French growth is\u00a0projected to be 0.7%\u00a0in 2024, and gain momentum next year, showing\u00a0striking resilience\u00a0since the pandemic. Inflation is\u00a0also\u00a0set to\u00a0fall significantly. Macron and his supporters point to his economic record as reason enough to vote for him.\u00a0But\u00a0the French are rarely so generous with their sitting presidents \u2013 gratitude is in short supply. Today, Macron\u2019s approval ratings\u00a0sit at 30%, down from nearly 50% when he stepped into office but his disapproval ratings (now at 65%) have not dropped below 50% since his first months in office, according to Ipsos-Le Point polling. The French love to hate their politicians and Macron is no different. The country\u2019s two-term\u00a0constitutional\u00a0limit means Macron can\u2019t run again for president in 2027. One lawmaker from Macron\u2019s party said that the public disappointment in the French president stemmed from how publicly invested he had been in the country\u2019s direction, making it clear that his four prime ministers were strictly following his lead. \u201cHe was ultimately very active in his two five-year terms, unlike other presidents who took a back seat and let their prime minister take the hits,\u201d the member of parliament said, requesting anonymity to speak frankly. \u201cWe felt (the PMs) were very dependent on him,\u201d they added. Under pressure at home,\u00a0he\u2019s enjoyed playing the statesman, whether rallying forces behind the European project or going head to head with combative counterparts, be they Putin or Trump. He was a crusader for European military and industrial sovereignty from American patronage long before the war in Ukraine made them fashionable. And he has been a critical ally to Kyiv in the face of Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion, leading the charge with supplies of light tanks, then long-range missiles and French-made fighter jets, while keeping European allies in lockstep with Ukraine. In the invasion\u2019s early days, critics slammed him for his efforts with Putin \u2013 later revealed to be at Kyiv\u2019s request. But later, he looked to outmanoeuvre Putin with force, raising the issue of NATO-member troop deployments and cementing the West\u2019s unwavering support for Ukraine. Unheeded warnings? With the (arguably haughty) self-assuredness that has come to define his image,  Macron issued warnings time and again over the menace of the far-right. \u201cI don\u2019t want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers, I don\u2019t want to belong to a generation that\u2019s forgotten its own past or that refuses to see the torments of its own present,\u201d he told the European Parliament in 2018. Finally, after years of inching far-right advances, the 2024 European Parliament elections saw his centrist politics submerged by a call from the far\u00a0right. As Marine Le Pen and her lieutenant Jordan Bardella of National Rally hammer home, too many French voters \u2013 struggling with economic pressures and anti-immigration narratives - felt ignored or unheard, those that in his own inauguration speech Macron had called the \u201cFrench men and French women who feel forgotten by this vast global movement.\u201d Unheard and ignored was how many working French citizens felt in 2023, as anger at a hike in the retirement age sparked months of protests. It was a gordian knot of Macron\u2019s own making. Solving pensions\u2019\u00a0fatal funding dilemma was sound policy on paper but woefully sold to the public. It was finally driven into law without lawmakers\u2019 consent: The government ruling by decree. Stripped of his parliamentary majority in 2022 and stung by a rejection of his vision at the 2024 European elections, he gambled on his faith in the French electorate. \u201cIt is above all, an act of trust,\u201d Macron said as he called snap parliamentary elections, \u201cin the capacity of the French people to make the most just decision.\u201d Many in France wondered why.\u00a0Among MPs of Macron\u2019s party, there was \u201clots of incomprehension,\u201d the lawmaker told CNN. Struggling with unfavorable parliamentary arithmetic, \u201cit was going to happen in any case,\u201d the MP said. \u201cI think what made it harder for me compared to the others is that the person who pressed the button is the president, so obviously it\u2019s him who is at fault.\u201d The result was\u00a0effectively\u00a0a referendum on Macron himself.\u00a0His centrist Ensemble alliance now holds 163 seats, far fewer than the 245 seats it took in 2022, and he presents a weakened figure abroad and at home. The far right argue they pose no threat to France. \u201cWe don\u2019t represent any danger, apart from making (Macron) lose power,\u201d Marine Le Pen told CNN last week. But there is a real fear of a return to power of identity politics in many parts of today\u2019s culturally rich, but complicated, France. Now that the far right have stormed to legislative power \u2013 and have their sights set on the Elysee Palace in 2027\u00a0\u2013 the threat posed by the National Rally\u2019s victories is not limited to Macron\u2019s ego. For countless communities in France - French or\u00a0immigrant\u00a0- the legacy of one man\u2019s gamble, and the uncertainty that is his legacy, will exact a far higher price.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/europe/how-macron-lost-france-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}

Finland has accused neighboring Russia of weaponizing migration by encouraging scores of migrants from countries such as Syria and Somalia to cross the border, an assertion the Kremlin denies. Helsinki believes Moscow is promoting the crossings in retaliation for Finland joining NATO, which backs Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion. The right-wing government of Prime Minister Petteri Orpo has said the bill is vital to stop future arrivals, despite the law being at odds with Finland\u2019s international human rights commitments. \u201cThis is a strong message to Russia, a strong message to our allies, that Finland takes care of its own security, we take care of the security of the EU border,\u201d Orpo told a press conference after the vote. More than 1,300 asylum seekers crossed over from Russia since last summer but there had been no new arrivals since March until Thursday. The Finnish Border Guard released a statement after the parliament vote saying one person had crossed the border illegally on Thursday and when caught by a border guard, applied for asylum. Finland shut its land borders with Russia late last year. Interior Minister Mari Rantanen told the press conference after the bill passed that no decision had been taken on when to re-open the border crossings with Russia. Finland\u2019s move is similar to steps taken in recent years in other European countries, including Poland and Lithuania, to make it more difficult for migrants to cross the border from Russia and Russia-ally Belarus. The Finnish bill was passed with 167 votes in favor, 31 against and one abstention. To pass, the proposal needed a two-thirds majority of given votes in the 200-seat parliament. Orpo urged migrants who were considering coming to Europe through Russia not to embark on the journey. \u201cDon\u2019t go with the smugglers,\u201d he told the news conference. \u201cFinland takes care of its borders. The access to the borders orchestrated by Russia will not lead to access to Finland or Europe.\u201d Moscow has denied such an intention.

Israel had previously agreed to allow Palestinians unrestricted access to northern Gaza during an eventual ceasefire, but the prime minister told his negotiating team this week to demand that armed men be barred from northern Gaza as part of any ceasefire and hostage deal, the source said. The new demand could potentially upend progress in hostage negotiations and raises further questions about Netanyahu\u2019s commitment to Israel\u2019s own proposal for a deal that has become the basis for detailed negotiations.

{"id": "2024_07_14_americas_venezuela-migrants-maduro-biden-intl-latam", "text": "A small corner of Venezuela is spreading slowly along 77th\u00a0Street in Bogota, the capital of Colombia. Municipal maps formally refer to that neighborhood as\u00a0Unir II (\u201cunite\u201d), but to many of its inhabitants it is known as Barrio Hugo Chavez, after the late Venezuelan president. Many of the more than seven million Venezuelans who fled their country over the past decade or more now call Bogota home. The city is brimming with informal communities where migrants come together to help each other integrate and combat the ever-present melancholy and homesickness. Maria Alvarez is one such migrant. A 27-year-old single mother from Valencia, Alvarez left Venezuela in 2017 when her son Gabriel was only one. They haven\u2019t returned since. Gabriel knows his grandparents only from the photos on his mother\u2019s phone and the occasional video call. \u201cEveryone left\u2026 I\u2019ve got family in Brazil, the US, here in Colombia, in Ecuador, in Chile too. We are all abroad: uncles, aunts, cousins\u2026 only my mom and my dad, and one of my brothers remain in Venezuela,\u201d Alvarez told CNN. Most of those seven million migrants left Venezuela after 2014, according to the United Nations, amid an economic and political crisis brought about by a crash in the price of oil \u2013 a key export for Venezuela \u2013 combined with chronic corruption and mismanagement at the hands of government officials. Almost two million of them have been granted work permits to work in Colombia, where life is working out well for Alvarez and many others like her. After the Covid pandemic, she helped create a foundation in\u00a0Unir II\u00a0to provide Venezuelans and Colombians with professional classes and psychological counseling. She now makes a living as a manicurist and has met a new partner. Even so, she still feels the draw of Venezuela. \u201cI just dream of going home and building a life there. Colombia has been good, I feel welcome here, but well, I long to go back,\u201d she told CNN, tearfully. An election and a credible opposition But with the authoritarian government of Nicolas Maduro firmly ensconced in power, for many years those dreams of returning have remained just that. Until now. This month, for the first time in a decade, Venezuela will hold an election in which Maduro\u2019s government is being challenged by an opposition candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, who has a credible chance of winning. In October last year, Maduro formally pledged to grant free and fair elections in 2024 at the end of a long and secretive negotiation process with the US State Department. That pledge was at least partially compromised amid a new spat between Washington and Caracas: the leading opposition candidate, Maria Corina Machado, was barred from running earlier this year, as was her immediate replacement Corina Yoris. The Venezuelan government has accused the White House of not lifting all economic sanctions against government officials, and in recent weeks opposition supporters and members of Machado\u2019s team have been detained. Even so, many experts believe that come the July 28 election the opposition has a real chance of pushing Maduro out of power. Recent polls put Gonzalez more than twenty percentage points ahead of Maduro and, for the first time in years, electoral observers from the Carter Center and the UN have been invited to monitor the election. Such a lead would make Gonzalez the heavy favorite if this were almost any other democratic country. Yet in Venezuela, the government has a habit of clinging to power. Critics have long accused it of rigging votes and silencing the opposition. Opposition protests were repeatedly repressed in 2014, 2017 and 2019, and hundreds of opposition leaders have been arrested, or exiled. Still, to many, this year feels different. \u201cI personally find it difficult to believe Maduro will just give up power,\u201d said Laura Dib, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office for Latin America. \u201cHowever, you know, if there\u2019s massive participation with international observation and, of course, with pressure from inside the government itself and international pressure\u2026 that could create some avenues,\u201d she told CNN. Alvarez and many other migrants in Bogota, think similarly: \u201cMaduro can only win the election if he steals it. But if there\u2019s a new government, I\u2019d go back the same day. Not just me, hundreds, thousands\u2026 there won\u2019t be enough planes for everyone to return home,\u201d said Endel Gonzalez, a 54-year-old from Maracaibo who has worked as a food courier in Bogota for the past five years. What it means for America It\u2019s the fate of migrants like Alvarez and millions of others like her that are making this such a closely watched election. Before the pandemic, it was common for Venezuelan migrants to seek opportunities in neighboring countries, but in the past three years more than half a million have headed to the United States\u2019 southern border, moving directly via land from Colombia to Panama and Central America, all the way to Northern Mexico. Venezuelans were the second largest group of migrants apprehended by US Customs and Border Patrol in 2023, totaling over 260,000 encounters, a fivefold increase\u00a0from 2020\u00a0when there were less than 50,000,\u00a0putting pressure on the White House to stem the flow. With the Democratic administration facing an uncertain election in November and migration policies squarely on the ballot, this month\u2019s contest in Caracas could hold profound consequences for US President Joe Biden. Most experts who spoke to CNN believe that if Gonzalez wins, many migrants will decide to return to Venezuela \u2013 but if Maduro clings to power, even more will be tempted to head to the US border, both for political reasons and practical ones. In the early years of Venezuela\u2019s migration boom, many Latin American countries offered emergency permits and ad hoc policies for migrants from the country, but now many are erecting barriers to deter the free movement of people. Colombia for example has stopped issuing documents for recently arrived migrants, while the newly elected president of Panama, Jose Raul Mulino, has proposed fencing off the jungles that connect his country to Colombia. Dib estimates that up to two million more migrants could be on the move by next year. What next? The Biden administration has been instrumental in reaching this moment. Maduro\u2019s agreement to a free and fair election came only after the US partially lifted oil sanctions, and only after repatriation flights for undocumented migrants back to Caracas resumed in October. Direct negotiations between Maduro and the State Department seem to have halted, although Maduro announced last week that his chief negotiator, Jorge Rodriguez, held a meeting with US officials to resume talks. Washington is openly supporting Gonzalez, apparently reasoning that a transition to democracy in Venezuela would not only help negotiations around energy policy and migration, but also help turn Caracas from its ideological alliances with the likes of China, Russia and Iran. But with both countries going to the polls this year, it may be what voters decide in November, rather than July, that really makes the difference. \u201cIf the Biden administration remains in power, I believe (bilateral) negotiations will continue,\u201d Dib said. \u201cNow, if there\u2019s a Trump administration, most likely it\u2019s just conducting business\u2026 without much regard on what happens in terms of democracy and human rights.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/14/americas/venezuela-migrants-maduro-biden-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_middleeast_israel-hostage-andrey-kozlov-gaza-hamas-intl", "text": "When the Gaza sunshine was at its hottest, Andrey Kozlov said the Hamas fighters would cover him with blankets, leaving him to stew in his sweat. When he asked about his family, they would say they had forgotten him. When they pulled the blindfold from his eyes, they said they would kill him and film his murder. The 27-year-old said he suffered intense psychological \u2013 and some physical \u2013 abuse at the hands of Hamas. He cannot bring himself to describe all that happened to him and the two other hostages he was kept with during his eight months of captivity in Gaza. After being snatched from the Nova music festival on October 7, Kozlov, a Russian-Israeli citizen, said he was tied up for \u201cthree days with rope, then until the middle of December with chains.\u201d During these months he was subjected to \u201ccreative\u201d forms of punishment: One guard \u201ctold us a lot that Israel wants to kill us\u201d and that they were a problem from which Israel was trying to rid itself. Kozlov strove not to believe the lies, he said, but the result was that, when Israeli soldiers last month burst into the building in which he was being held, he thought they had been sent to kill him. Instead, it was a stunning rescue operation that brought him and the two others home \u2013 as well as Noa Argamani, who was held in a nearby building. But it left in its wake a trail of destruction: Gaza authorities say at least 274 Palestinians were killed in the raid and the ensuing firefight with Hamas militants. In an interview with CNN, Kozlov detailed his months of captivity in Gaza, the psychological torture he weathered, the threats he faced, and his desire for Israel and Hamas to strike a deal to release the remaining hostages. Kozlov was nearing the end of his shift as a security guard at the Nova festival when Hamas fighters began to pour over the border. He had moved from Russia to Israel two years earlier, and taken the job because it was \u201ceasy money.\u201d When he clocked off, Kozlov thought \u201cI will come back home, I will sleep and everything will be good. But no, it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Minutes later, he was sprinting through a forest with \u201cmaybe 200, 300 people,\u201d panicked by the sound of gunshots and a stream of gruesome nearby videos that had already emerged online. But as they stumbled out into a field, Kozlov saw \u2013 he recalled in broken English \u2013 \u201ca car full of guys in green uniform. And they shoot in the air, they shoot already on us.\u201d Hiding in the bushes was no help. He was swiftly found and taken to Gaza, where he was held in several different places with Almog Meir Jan and Shlomi Ziv, before their eventual rescue in Nuseirat, in the center of the enclave. On his first day, his captor \u201ctook the fabric from my eyes and showed me with signs\u201d what he was planning to do. The man pointed to himself \u2013 \u201cI\u201d \u2013 then tapped his watch \u2013 \u201ctomorrow\u201d \u2013 then pointed to Kozlov \u2013 \u201cyou\u201d \u2013 then made a camera sign, clicking its shutter \u2013 \u201cfilm\u201d \u2013 then made a gun with his fingers, pulling the trigger \u2013 \u201ckill.\u201d Kozlov said he thought that day would be his last, but \u2013 as the hours passed \u2013 that fear slowly subsided. Days later, he said he understood \u201cthat probably they\u2019re not gonna kill us.\u201d Using signs again, they explained to Kozlov that they wanted to swap him: \u201cYou\u2019re going to Israel, our people go to Gaza and the West Bank.\u201d For the first three months, the sound of Israeli bombing was constant, Kozlov said: \u201cWe were afraid of every bomb that we heard. Every time you started to hide in the corners of our room.\u201d His captors laughed, he said, asking what they were afraid of. They were moved between houses several times, Kozlov said, with some places giving them enough food. After being unchained in December, some places where he was held gave him the chance to exercise \u2013 \u201csquats, pushups\u201d and the like. But he was exposed to prolonged psychological abuse, he said, by guards watching over them wearing masks, holding Kalashnikovs and a \u201cbig knife.\u201d The main guard, he said, had a \u201csplit\u201d personality and often \u201cgot crazy.\u201d \u201cHe has two personalities,\u201d Kozlov said. \u201cHe told us: \u2018I have two faces: A good one, but I don\u2019t want you to see the second face \u2013 like, I can kill you.\u2019\u201d Some mornings, the guard would be friendly, offering to play cards with them. But in other mornings Kozlov would \u201cwake up and you understand \u2013 ah, the second face. You don\u2019t talk with him at all.\u201d Kozlov would be punished for arbitrary things, he said. Once, after washing his hands with drinking water before eating, the guard \u201cnoticed and he said, \u2018I told you not to do this, yes?\u2019\u201d The guard had someone cover Kozlov with \u201creally thick blankets, in the middle of May,\u201d and leave him in the heat for an hour and a half. Kozlov\u2019s testimony chimes with that of other rescued hostages. The doctor in charge of medical treatment for Kozlov and the three others rescued in the Israeli operation said they were beaten and described their captivity as a \u201charsh, harsh experience, with a lot of abuse, almost every day.\u201d \u201cThere have been periods where they got almost no food whatsoever, there were other periods where it was a little better, but all in all, the combination of the psychological stress, malnutrition or not getting enough food\u2026 have a significant effect on health,\u201d Dr. Itai Pessach told CNN last month. Still, Kozlov considers himself \u201clucky.\u201d He said he saw other hostages during his eight months in Gaza, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to talk about it\u2026 It\u2019s painful and it\u2019s gonna be dangerous for them,\u201d he said. Were they in worse shape than him? \u201cYes they were.\u201d For that reason, Kozlov implored Israeli officials to \u201ctry to understand how we (the hostages) felt all this time. We need to bring them home as soon as possible. I don\u2019t know how. But we need to do this immediately.\u201d Optimism about a ceasefire-for-hostages deal has waned this week, however, as Hamas warned that Israeli actions in Gaza could jeopardize the talks. Last week, a US official told CNN that a framework agreement is \u201cin place\u201d and an Israeli official said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations, signaling a potential breakthrough. Talks resumed in the Qatari capital Doha last Friday. Over the weekend, Hamas agreed to compromise on a major sticking point for Israel \u2013 that Netanyahu\u2019s government commits to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before signing an agreement. But a statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office on Sunday cast doubt on the deal, laying out several \u201cprinciples\u201d Israel is not prepared to abandon, including resumed fighting in Gaza \u201cuntil all objectives of the war have been achieved.\u201d For Kozlov, the days he was captured \u2013 and rescued \u2013 have become landmarks in his life. October 7 became his second \u201cbirthday;\u201d June 8, his third. He wants the 120 remaining hostages to be able to mark their own dates. Correction: This story has been updated to correct the date of Kozlov\u2019s third \u201cbirthday,\u201d when he was rescued on June 8.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/middleeast/israel-hostage-andrey-kozlov-gaza-hamas-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_middleeast_israeli-military-withdrawal-central-northern-gaza-palestinians-killed-intl", "text": "At least 50 Palestinians were found killed on Friday, local authorities said, after the Israeli military pulled back from several areas in central and northern Gaza, leaving entire\u00a0neighborhoods razed and residents reeling from a spate of heavy attacks. Emergency crews recovered 50 to 60 bodies in the Tal al-Hawa neighborhood in the west of Gaza City, according to Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense. Many more were trapped under the debris, spokesperson Mahmoud Basal told CNN. Further east in the city, Israeli bombardment destroyed vital infrastructure in the Shujaya neighborhood, said Asem Al-Nabih, a media officer at the Gaza Municipality. Footage obtained by CNN showed rescue staff in Tal al-Hawa wading through blown out buildings, and clambering over slabs of fallen concrete piled on top of old mattresses. The limbs of dead Palestinians could be seen peeking out from under the rubble, as workers attempted to retrieve those buried by the devastation. \u201cThere is unprecedented destruction of infrastructure and vital facilities in the Shujaya\u2026 and Tal al-Hawa areas,\u201d Al-Nabih told CNN. \u201cThe municipality is trying to deliver water to displaced citizens with great difficulty.\u201d More than nine months of fighting in Gaza has turned swathes of the territory into rubble-filled wasteland. The Israeli military offensive following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks has triggered a sprawling humanitarian crisis, crushed the health system and depleted food and water supplies. The UN warned Tuesday of widespread famine across the strip, and relief workers say Israeli aid restrictions mean they are unable to support Palestinians trying to survive the war. Human rights agencies reiterated calls for a ceasefire, as negotiations between Israel and Hamas this week hit yet another roadblock. Israel launched its military offensive on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel. At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others abducted, according to Israeli authorities. Israeli strikes in Gaza have since killed\u00a038,345\u00a0Palestinians and injured another 88,295 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. \u2018We want a total ceasefire\u2019 Palestinian residents surveyed the desolate landscape in Tal al-Hawa neighborhood on Friday, as the sound of Israeli drones buzzed overhead. CNN footage from the aftermath showed multiple-story blocks sliced in half. Children sat under the sun with despondent expressions on their faces. In one scene, the words \u201cGaza, I promise we will rebuild it,\u201d could be seen scrawled onto the wall of a damaged building. \u201cI don\u2019t know what crime civilians did to deserve this,\u201d one resident, Tareq Ghanem, told CNN on Friday. \u201cPeople are dying in the streets. The bodies are strewn in the streets for 4 to 5 (days), maybe a week, and no civil defense can evacuate them. Where is the international law?\u201d Another Palestinian, Umm Ihab Arafat, said she and her family had been displaced at least four times since the war erupted. The mother told CNN she was desperate to return home for the wellbeing of her children. \u201cWe want a total ceasefire,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be displaced from one place to another. The fear is in the eyes of the young ones.\u201d A CNN stringer in the area reported Friday there had been a partial withdrawal from several locations \u2013 including Tal Al-Hawa, Al-Rimal and the vicinity of the UNRWA headquarters on Al-Sina\u2019a Street. Further south, in the coastal tent city of Al-Mawasi, two people were killed and five other Palestinians wounded by an airstrike on an aid warehouse, according to the Civil Defense. CNN has provided the Israeli military with the coordinates of the strike and sought comment. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed troops in central Gaza \u201clocated a weapons production workshop\u201d and \u201cfunds used for terrorist activity,\u201d adding that \u201cterrorists who posed a threat to the troops in the area were eliminated.\u201d The IDF also said that it had attacked the site of rocket launches in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza, and had continued assaults in Rafah, southern Gaza. CNN cannot verify the IDF statements. Also in central Gaza, a CNN stringer reported that four Palestinians, including two children, had been killed by an Israeli airstrike in the New Nuseirat camp early Friday. CNN has asked the IDF about its operations in central Gaza. Almost the whole population \u2013 1.9 million people \u2013 have been displaced, according to the UN. Earlier this week, several Palestinians told CNN they were terrified to leave areas in the north under Israeli evacuation orders amid heavy shelling, citing no promise of safety or accommodation. The UN warned that Israeli evacuation orders for people to leave Gaza City on Wednesday \u201cwill only fuel mass suffering for Palestinian families,\u201d adding that many have already been displaced multiple times.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/middleeast/israeli-military-withdrawal-central-northern-gaza-palestinians-killed-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/15/2024", "section": "world"}}
