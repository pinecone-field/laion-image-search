From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_brazil-pantanal-wetland-fires-intl-latam", "text": "Brazil\u2019s Pantanal, the largest tropical wetland on earth, is ablaze, with fires in June breaking historical records for that month. While aerial views of the wetland show smoke rising and the bright orange of burning fires, a closer look at burnt vegetation found charred skeletons of wildlife, including an alligator, monkey and snake, photos from Reuters showed earlier this week. Brazil\u2019s National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has detected 733 fires in the Pantanal biome so far this month, with the previous record for fires in Pantanal for June being 435 registered in 2005. The state of Mato Grosso do Sul, which encompasses 60% of the Brazilian Pantanal, is under a \u201cdanger\u201d warning for a heat wave expected to hit with temperatures 5\u00baC higher than average for the next three to five days, according to Brazil\u2019s National Meteorological Institute (INMET). The World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) Brazil has warned that the entire year of 2024 could become the worst year on record for the Pantanal as the dry season is just beginning, and the number of fires this year already represents an increase of 898% compared to the same period in 2023, according to INPE\u2019s data. \u201cIt is necessary to act quickly reinforcing [fire] brigades and counting with the support of the local communities to avoid a catastrophe\u201d, said Cynthia Santos, conservation analyst for WWF Brazil, in a statement. What to know about the wetlands The Pantanal\u2019s distinctive habitats rely on what scientists call the \u201cflood pulse.\u201d During the wet season between November and March, three quarters of the plain gets flooded, only for much of the water to drain away during the dry months, from April to September. This seasonal flooding makes the Pantanal a unique biome where large swaths of land regularly turn from terrestrial into aquatic habitats and back again. Wetlands like the Pantanal are Earth\u2019s most effective carbon sinks \u2013 ecosystems that absorb and store more carbon than they release, keeping it away from the atmosphere. At roughly 200,000 square kilometers, the Pantanal comprises about 3% of the globe\u2019s wetlands and plays a key role in the carbon cycle. When these carbon-rich ecosystems burn, vast amounts of heat-trapping gases are released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (known as the World Wildlife Fund in the US and Canada), the Pantanal boasts the greatest concentration of wildlife in South America \u2013 higher than that of its more famous northern neighbor, the Amazon. \u201cThe Pantanal is very important for the planet, it has unique wild areas that are fundamental to life on Earth,\u201d said Andre Luiz Siqueira, the CEO of ECOA, an environmental NGO based in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, speaking to CNN in 2020. The area is home to thousands of endangered or unusual species, including jaguars, capybaras, black caimans, giant otters and hyacinth macaws. It\u2019s also an important stop on the routes of around 180 species of migratory birds. The wetland is facing a \u201chydrological crisis scenario\u201d due to an intense drought. The lack of rain began in 2023 and has been aggravated by the ongoing El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, according to ECOA. Occasional wildfires are normal in the Pantanal, so much so that some plants in the region developed resistance to fires \u2013 for example by growing thick bark or covering their seeds with hard shells. In 2020, the fires destroyed unique habitats and wrecked the livelihoods of many of the Pantanal\u2019s diverse indigenous communities.

{"id": "2024_06_12_tech_spacex-elon-musk-former-employees-lawsuit", "text": "SpaceX and CEO Elon Musk were sued on Wednesday by former employees who claim they were illegally fired for raising concerns about gender discrimination and sexual harassment at the rocket company. The lawsuit, brought by eight employees who were fired in 2022, alleges that Musk wants to be \u201cthe leader to a brave new world of space travel, but runs his company in the dark ages \u2014 treating women as sexual objects to be evaluated on their bra size, bombarding the workplace with lewd sexual banter, and offering the reprise to those who challenge the \u2018Animal House\u2019 environment that if they don\u2019t like it they can seek employment elsewhere,\u201d according to the complaint, filed in state court in California. The eight former employees were involved in writing a 2022 open letter criticizing Musk and urging SpaceX executives to make the firm\u2019s culture more inclusive. The letter, which was signed by at least 400 other employees, asked SpaceX management to make it clear that Musk\u2019s statements \u2014 particularly on Twitter \u2014 did not reflect the views or values of the company and asserted that SpaceX\u2019s so-called \u201cNo A**hole\u201d policy was unevenly enforced. Following the letter\u2019s release, the eight employees were fired. Wednesday\u2019s complaint alleges that \u201cMusk personally ordered the Plaintiff\u2019s terminations.\u201d SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. SpaceX does not typically respond to queries from news organizations. In response to the 2022 letter, SpaceX COO Gwynne Shotwell previously said she would enforce SpaceX\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d standards against employee harassment, but the The New York Times reported that she said the employees had been fired for making other staff feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d SpaceX previously faced similar complaints filed to the National Labor Relations Board over the termination of employees involved in the letter. Those complaints claimed that the terminations amounted to employees being fired for engaging in \u201cconcerted protected activities.\u201d One former employee who filed an NLRB complaint and is a plaintiff in the Wednesday lawsuit, Tom Moline, previously told CNN that SpaceX management used an \u201c\u2018ends justifies the means\u2019 philosophy to turn a blind eye to the ongoing mistreatment, harassment, and abuse reported by my colleagues, much of which was directly encouraged and inspired by the words and actions of the CEO.\u201d Earlier this year, SpaceX responded to a consolidated complaint from the NLRB with its own lawsuit, alleging that the structure of the NLRB itself is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s complaint details the statements by Musk and the actions of other workers that the fired employees claim contributed to a hostile work environment and \u201cpervasively sexist culture\u201d at SpaceX. It points to multiple crude posts by Musk on Twitter, now called X, such as one containing a plan \u201cto create a Texas university similar to MIT which he would call \u2018TITS\u2019 and where \u2018Ds [women\u2019s bra size] would get degrees,\u2019 accompanied by an altered photo rendering a rocket to appear to be a giant penis,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cThings like that were widely shared on all internal chat channels and talked about in meetings and used as fodder in professional environments,\u201d Paige\u00a0Holland-Thielen, one of the plaintiffs, told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates, adding that employees were \u201cencouraged\u201d to follow Musk on the social media platform. As a result, it became \u201cimpossible to separate his personal nonsense from the actual day-to-day life of an actual working environment,\u201d she said. The complaint also references a post from Musk, shared the day after Business Insider published a report claiming Musk had sexually harassed a flight attendant, in which the billionaire said: \u201cFinally, we get to use Elongate as scandal name. It\u2019s kinda perfect,\u201d along with a laughing emoji. (Musk has\u00a0denied\u00a0the harassment claims.) \u201cMusk\u2019s conduct of interjecting this juvenile, grotesque sexual banter into the workplace had the wholly foreseeable and intentional result of encouraging other employees to engage in similar conduct,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s complaint states. The former employees allege that engineers commonly applied \u201ccrude and demeaning names to products in an attempt at humor, often at the expense of women and LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, the name \u2018Upskirt Camera\u2019 was used for a camera on first stage of the Falcon rocket that views the bottom of the second stage,\u201d according to the complaint. In one instance, a SpaceX HR director responded to allegations of inappropriate workplace behavior at an internal event by saying: \u201cI\u2019ve never been sexually harassed; I must not be hot enough,\u201d the complaint alleges. The lawsuit adds that the former employees believe \u201cSpaceX has not taken action to redress the harassment, hostile work-environment, and retaliation.\u201d The former employees are seeking unspecified monetary damages to account for \u201clost wages, earnings, and other employee benefits, emotional distress.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details and context.

{"id": "2024_06_10_asia_north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea sent a new wave of trash-laden balloons toward its southern neighbor late Sunday, after Kim Jong Un\u2019s powerful sister warned of further responses if the South keeps up its \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d The new balloons, which Seoul has previously slammed as \u201cbase and dangerous,\u201d come in apparent retaliation for the decision by South Korea to resume broadcasting anti-North Korean\u00a0propaganda over loudspeakers in border areas. Kim\u2019s sister and government spokeswoman Kim Yo Jong warned the resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts was \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation.\u201d In a statement carried by North Korean state media, Kim said South Korea would be subject to an unspecified \u201cnew counteraction\u201d\u00a0from the North if it continued with the loudspeaker broadcasts and failed to prevent activists from\u00a0sending anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the border. \u201cI sternly warn Seoul to stop at once this dangerous act,\u201d Kim said, adding that Seoul is creating a \u201cnew environment of crisis.\u201d South\u00a0Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)\u00a0has maintained North\u00a0Korea\u00a0is \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the current situation and urged the North to \u201cimmediately stop such mean acts like sending waste balloons.\u201d In a statement Monday, a JCS spokesman would not say whether the South would continue to broadcast over the loudspeakers, noting only that\u00a0the military would conduct missions \u201cwith flexibility according to the strategic and operational situation.\u201d The escalating tit-for-tat has sparked concerns of potential retaliatory military action. Last week, the South Korean government suspended a 2018 deal\u00a0to reduce military tensions with the North, allowing it to resume propaganda broadcasts and potentially restart military exercises along the border. South Korea\u2019s military once routinely deployed propaganda broadcasts as a means of psychological warfare against the North, until it withdrew the equipment following the 2018 deal. The broadcasts inform North\u00a0Korean soldiers and residents of the \u201creality of North\u00a0Korea,\u201d and the development of\u00a0South\u00a0Korea, and modern Korean culture, according to the JCS. Tit-for-tat balloons In recent weeks, the North has floated more than a thousand trash-filled balloons across the heavily fortified border, in what it claims is a response to the years-long practice among South Korean activist groups of sending\u00a0balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets in the other direction. As of Monday morning, the South Korean military had found \u201caround 50 balloons\u201d that fell into its territory overnight Sunday. Many other balloons are believed to have flown back into\u00a0North\u00a0Korea due to the wind, according to the JCS spokesman. On Thursday, South Korean activists sent balloons across the border toward the North, carrying hundreds of thousands of leaflets condemning leader Kim Jong Un and 5,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and K-dramas. For decades, North Korea has been almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers\u00a0sentenced to hard labor\u00a0for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including\u00a0parts of its pop culture,\u00a0to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years and diplomatic talks fell apart \u2013 prompting\u00a0strict rules to snap back\u00a0into place in the North.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

In the early 2000s, the area experienced a brutal conflict that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Today, there are alarming signs that Darfur may be heading towards another genocide. For more than a year, swathes of Sudan have erupted in fierce clashes between the Sudanese Army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that have left more 14,000 people dead and displaced more than 8 million others, according to the United Nations. But their battle for territorial control has now drifted toward El Fasher, the last major town in Darfur that\u2019s yet to be conquered by the RSF. Analysts say it\u2019s only a matter of days before El Fasher falls to the rebels. What\u2019s happening in Darfur? Ethnic-related killings have intensified in Darfur since fighting broke out in mid-April last year between the rival military factions. The RSF, which evolved from the Arab Janjaweed militia that spearheaded the genocide of the early 2000s, killing an estimated 300,000 people, has however, targeted the Masalit ethnic group and other non-Arab communities. Reports indicate widespread atrocities, including mass killings, sexual violence, and the systematic destruction of villages. Human Rights Watch and other organizations have documented these abuses, which have been likened to ethnic cleansing campaigns. The violence has forced tens of thousands of people to flee, many seeking refuge in neighboring Chad, the UN Refugee Agency said. At least 134 people were killed in El Fasher last month after gunfire rang out in the city and bombs fell on civilian homes as RSF fighters encircled the town. Last week, North Darfur\u2019s main hospital in El Fasher was also forced to close after the RSF raided the facility and looted vital supplies. The hospital had previously been hit by bullets and mortar shells. Indicators of genocide The RSF is headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, also known as Hemedti, a former leader of the Janjaweed militia. Analysts told CNN that the targeted nature of the violence in Darfur, the systematic approach of the RSF, and the historical context of ethnic conflicts in the region all suggest that the situation could evolve into another genocide. The intent to destroy the Masalit people and other non-Arab groups mirrors the patterns of violence that characterized the genocide of the early 2000s, said Sudanese lawyer Mutasim Ali. \u201cThe RSF uses systematic dehumanization method against non-Arabs in Darfur, saying,\u00a0\u2018these are dirt, dogs and monkeys\u2019 and \u2018let\u2019s kill the babies and males because if they grow up, they will fight us back.\u2019 There is a systematic policy of dehumanization .. the same explicit incitement from since the early 2000s,\u201d said Ali, a legal adviser at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights. In April, the United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, warned that \u201cprevailing signs of genocide\u201d and \u201cgrave human rights violations and abuses continue to be reported against innocent civilian populations\u201d in Sudan. \u201cMost of the atrocities that are committed today\u00a0are by the same actors in the early 2000s.\u00a0The RSF is rebranded Janjaweed militia: same commanders, same ethnic tribes, and the same victim groups (non-Arab communities) in Darfur\u00a0that are being systematically targeted by the RSF,\u201d Ali told CNN. He added: \u201cWe see that the perpetrators are documenting their abuses by themselves. Back in the day, there were no cell\u00a0phones,\u00a0and (abuses) were primarily documented by human rights organizations that were in Sudan.\u00a0But this time, they document killing people, burning villages, and their incitement.\u201d Weapons support from regional powers Ali says that technology and sophisticated weaponry are the only peculiarities that differentiate the RSF\u2019s current atrocities from the genocide committed by the Janjaweed more than two decades ago. Where previously, they used camels, horses, and basic weapons. The militia now has armored vehicles, drones, and advanced weaponry, along with significant support from regional powers and nations such as the United Arab Emirates, Ali said. A June 12 report by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab said that a cargo plane believed to be owned by the UAE was identified through satellite imagery flying within RSF-controlled areas in El-Fasher on June 11. \u201cThe same model of aircraft (IL-76) is reported to be used for lethal aid transfers by the UAE to the RSF for flights to locations in Chad,\u201d the report added. The UAE has denied providing military, financial, or logistical support to any armed group in Sudan. What happens if El Fasher falls? US Special Envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, said this week that El Fasher\u2019s fall to the RSF could be imminent. Home to nearly 2 million people, the city is predominantly occupied by non-Arab\u00a0ethnic groups, including the Masalit. El Fasher also shelters hundreds of thousands of displaced people who fled other parts of Darfur that were captured by the RSF, including El Geneina where hundreds of non-Arab people were massacred last year. Ali told CNN similar atrocities were likely to happen in El Fasher if the city came under RSF control. \u201cEl Fasher is going to be a lot more catastrophic because it is basically in the middle of a desert. Even if people decide to leave, probably they will die\u00a0in the desert. We will see another genocide on our watch.\u201d What has been the international response? The UN Security Council adopted a UK-led\u00a0resolution Thursday demanding that the RSF ends its \u201csiege\u201d of El Fasher. \u201cThe fighting must stop now,\u201d said UK Foreign Secretary\u00a0David Cameron in a post on X, adding that warring \u201cparties must let in urgent humanitarian aid to prevent a famine.\u201d Earlier this week, the International Criminal Court said it was investigating allegations of war crimes in El Fasher while making a public call for evidence. International response to the conflict has however been criticized as insufficient. Despite calls for action, including the deployment of protective missions and the imposition of sanctions by the United States on key RSF commanders, concrete measures have been limited. \u201cThe international response does not come close to meeting the scale of the world\u2019s largest man-made humanitarian disaster,\u201d said\u00a0international human rights lawyer, Yonah Diamond. \u201cThe major powers have largely invested in a sham peace process for 14 months that is going nowhere and serves as a cover for daily mass atrocities on the ground. Only concrete acts of protection and accountability will stem the violence,\u201d he told CNN. International efforts to broker ceasefires between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF have been unsuccessful. Diamond said there has also been insufficient coverage of the Sudan war when compared to other global conflicts. \u201cEvery major news outlet has dedicated an ongoing slot to Gaza and Ukraine, with ad hoc coverage for Sudan. There is no reason why a conflict impacting a greater number of civilians, threatening millions with death by starvation and an ongoing genocide do not receive the same attention,\u201d he said. He noted that this lack of attention hinders humanitarian efforts, pointing out that while Gaza and Ukraine have each received about 30% of their humanitarian response plans, Sudan, where 25 million people urgently need help, has received only about half of that amount. What will happen next? As Sudan steers dangerously towards another genocide, the world\u2019s response in the coming months will be crucial in determining the outcome. \u201cThe international community, led by the African Union, must deploy a civilian protection mechanism to protect the millions at risk in El Fasher and elsewhere in Sudan and explicitly threaten the UAE with consequences should it fail to restrain the RSF and continue to supply the militias with heavy weaponry,\u201d Diamond advised. \u201cThe US, the UK, and others have leverage to exert pressure on their ally, the UAE, to end the RSF\u2019s genocidal campaign today. President (Joe) Biden can simply call on the UAE to halt its support for the RSF, which would fall apart without it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/africa/sudan-darfur-genocide-fears-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_14_middleeast_hezbollah-lebanon-israel-tensions-explainer-update-intl", "text": "Israel and the Lebanese Iran-backed Islamist group Hezbollah have been ramping up cross-border attacks after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border. With both sides trading fire for more than eight months, experts say Israel feels it can no longer ignore its northern front or delay taking action there. A full-blown war appears to have become more likely \u2013 even if both sides have no desire for one, analysts believe. Here\u2019s what we know: Why are Israel and Hezbollah fighting? Lebanon and Israel have officially been in a state of war for decades. Israel launched a devastating invasion of Lebanon in 1982, sending tanks all the way to the capital Beirut,\u00a0after coming under attack from Palestinian militants in the country. It then occupied southern Lebanon for 22 years until it was driven out by Hezbollah, which emerged from the rubble of the Israeli invasion. Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Lebanese movement with one of the region\u2019s most powerful paramilitary forces. The \u201cresistance\u201d group is tasked with confronting Israel, which Beirut classifies as an enemy state. Much of the Western world has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization. Since then, the two sides have traded fire sporadically, but tensions boiled over in 2006 when Israel went to war in southern Lebanon again after Hezbollah kidnapped two Israeli soldiers. More than 1,000 Lebanese were killed in that conflict, mostly civilians, as well as 49 Israeli civilians and 121 soldiers. Two years later, Hezbollah returned the remains of the kidnapped soldiers in exchange for the release of Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, as well as the bodies of militants Israel was holding. The latest hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah started after Hamas led an attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 250, according to Israeli authorities. That prompted Israel to go to war with Hamas in Gaza, during which it has levelled much of the territory and killed more than 37,000 Palestinians. Hezbollah has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support the Palestinians in Gaza. The military capability of the Lebanese group has grown since 2006, when it relied largely on inaccurate Soviet-era Katyusha rockets. Today, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says his group boasts more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess 150,000 rockets that could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses if an all-out war breaks out. Why are tensions flaring up now? The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has been gradually intensifying since October 7, said Heiko Wimmen, project director for Iraq, Syria and Lebanon at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. It\u2019s a \u201cslow-motion escalation\u201d that \u201cinches upwards,\u201d he said. But both sides have come closer to war of late as clashes across the border have grown in number and scale. \u201cThere is clearly an escalation,\u201d said Wimmen, particularly in terms of deaths on each side of the border and the type of weaponry Hezbollah has been deploying. An Israeli reservist was killed in a Hezbollah strike on a village in northern Israel last week, bringing the total number of soldiers killed on the Israeli side to 19. Israel killed one of Hezbollah\u2019s most senior commanders, Talib Sami Abdulla, in a strike on southern Lebanon this week. The IDF said the commander was responsible for multiple attacks against Israeli civilians over several years. In retaliation, Hezbollah launched more than\u00a0200 rockets toward Israel on Wednesday and a significant but smaller barrage on Thursday. Israel and Hezbollah have also been striking much deeper into each other\u2019s territory than they were at the beginning of the war, when fighting was confined to a roughly 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) radius of the border on either side. Hezbollah has fired 35 kilometers into Israel, while Israel has targeted areas of Lebanon more than 120 kilometers north. Cross-border attacks from Lebanon in early June led to large fires blazing through Israel\u2019s northern region,\u00a0which Israel attributed to rocket fire from southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah said it had launched a \u201cswarm of drones\u201d at Israeli military sites. Amal Saad, a lecturer at Cardiff University and an expert on Hezbollah, said the group\u2019s escalation \u201cis a marked departure from prior flare-ups that have occurred since October 8.\u201d \u201cThis stage transcends merely responding to Israeli attacks and restoring deterrence; it involves conveying new messages and strategies,\u201d Saad wrote on X on June 5. The conflict has become \u201cvery visible\u201d and \u201cdifficult to ignore,\u201d said Wimmen, of the International Crisis Group, adding that Israeli officials feel compelled to respond, or at least be seen as responding, amid pressure to react from far-right ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. There is a push within government and the Israeli army to take action in the north, Ronni Shaked, a scholar at the Truman Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told CNN. \u201cNobody can live in this situation.\u201d New weapons at play The cross-border conflict has seen new weapons come into the mix. In an escalatory development on June 8, Hezbollah said it fired a salvo of Falaq 2 rockets at a military site in northern Israel. This was the first time the group had deployed the weapon, which is an improved version of the Falaq 1 rocket that Hezbollah has used throughout the conflict. An Iranian-made rocket, the Falaq 2 has a longer range and carries a larger warhead than its predecessor. An Iranian-made rocket, the Falaq 2 has a longer range and carries a larger warhead than its predecessor. Israeli soldiers on the border with Lebanon have also used a catapult rarely used by military forces since the 16th century. The trebuchet, a rotating arm with a sling attached to launch a projectile, was used to launch fireballs from Israel toward Lebanese territory, likely to burn shrubbery to make it easier for Israeli forces to identify militants. Israeli public broadcaster and CNN affiliate Kan on Thursday reported that the IDF had said the catapult was \u201ca local initiative\u201d and had not \u201ccome into widespread use.\u201d What are both sides saying? Rhetoric has been fiery from both sides, but experts say neither side wants a full-blown conflict. Netanyahu in December warned that Beirut would turn into Gaza if Hezbollah chose to start an all-out war. But Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich last week poured cold water on the prospect of a wider war, saying the IDF isn\u2019t interested in broadening the war to eliminate Hezbollah. The military is \u201ctelling us right now that it doesn\u2019t want to\u2026 launch an attack in the north, fight and defeat Hezbollah, and overwhelm it and create a security zone.\u201d During his visit to the northern city of Kiryat Shmona near the Lebanese border last week, Netanyahu said Israel was prepared for \u201cvery intense action\u201d in the north. \u201cWhoever thinks that they can hurt us and that we will sit idly by is making a big mistake,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cOne way or another, we will restore security to the north.\u201d Naim Qassem, Hezbollah\u2019s second-in-command, told Al Jazeera that the group had assessed that recent threats from Israel were not serious. \u201cEither way, we have decided not to widen the battle and we do not want an all-out war. But if it is imposed on us, we are ready and we won\u2019t retreat,\u201d Qassem said, adding that Hezbollah will end its attacks on Israel once the war in Gaza stops. Is a full-blown war likely? Experts say that while both sides may not choose to start an all-out war, their escalatory actions may still trigger one inadvertently. Wimmen of the International Crisis Group said that Israel and Hezbollah are unlikely to take a conscious decision to start a war. However, the more intense the conflict becomes, the deeper each side strikes into the other\u2019s territory and the heavier the weapons used, the more likely it is that \u201csomething goes wrong,\u201d he said. Netanyahu is under intense pressure from the opposition and members of his coalition to take action in the north, especially given that so many Israelis have been displaced from the area. More than 53,000 Israelis have been forced to leave their homes in the north, the IDF said. More houses were evacuated this week in the Galilee region in northern Israel after a fire broke following rocket attacks from Lebanon, Israeli police said. In Lebanon, more than 94,000 people have been displaced from areas and towns near the border with Israel since the conflict started, according to figures released last week by the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health. \u201cAll Hezbollah strongholds must be burned and destroyed. War!\u201d said Israeli far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir in a statement. Opposition leader Yair Lapid also slammed the government, saying: \u201cThe north goes up in flames and Israeli deterrence burns with it. \u201cThe government has no plan for the day after in Gaza, no plan to return the residents to the north, no management, no strategy. A government of total abandonment,\u201d Lapid said on X. The US has cautioned against escalation, worried it might spin out of control. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday the United States is \u201cincredibly concerned\u201d about the risk of escalation, adding that the Biden administration is engaged in diplomatic conversations \u201cto try to avoid that conflict from escalating beyond control.\u201d Shaked, the Truman Institute scholar, said that despite Hezbollah\u2019s assertions that its attacks on Israel are in support of Gaza, the group\u2019s strategy is likely to be closely coordinated with its closest ally Iran \u2013 especially with so much at stake. Hezbollah is Iran\u2019s most effective non-state partner. A wider conflict could also draw the Islamic Republic and the United States into the war. Israel and Iran came close to war in April after launching unprecedented direct attacks on each other\u2019s soil.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/middleeast/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-tensions-explainer-update-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

Two chairs on a sunny sidewalk in Los Angeles, California, indicate where 37-year-old Norma Guzman, 37, was shot and killed by police officers in 2015. Beside each image in the book are three brief lines of biographical information: the name of the deceased, their birth and death years, and the site\u2019s location. \u201cI was really adamant about how the photographs would be presented. I just wanted it to be a name,\u201d said Matar, who consulted family and victims\u2019 support groups. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the last thing to be thought of about these people was the way they died. These were people, with lives.\u201d \u201cThere are so many images, and so many images of violence that we kind of turn off,\u201d Matar added continued of today\u2019s era of social media and smartphones. \u201cI think we need space to digest, and I wanted to approach this in a way that was quite quiet. I wanted images that did not reinforce the violence. I wanted images that you can look at, and imagine this very banal place as the last place someone has been.\u201d An internationally acclaimed photographer and distinguished artist at Columbia University\u2019s Barnard College in New York City, Matar\u2019s relationship with documenting landscapes and violence is rooted in her own personal experiences. In 1990, her father-in-law was forcibly disappeared by the Gadhafi regime in Libya, and was never seen by his family again. \u201cI was familiar with this idea of the legacy of state-sponsored violence and what it does intimately to a family\u2026 but also really looking at it through photography and what these landscapes hold,\u201d Matar said. Matar was born in California but has lived abroad for nearly two decades. Her photographic practice has taken her to locations across Libya, North Africa, Italy and Ukraine looking at the intersections of landscape and memory, in particular examining spaces where people had been killed or forcibly interned. But before beginning her work on \u201cMy America,\u201d she had never turned her lens on the US. In 2014 and 2015, the police killings of Black men and boys including Eric Garner in New York City, 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio and Walter Scott in Charleston, South Carolina, captured on camera and shared on social media, sparked national protests and a racial reckoning. Matar felt compelled to return to America. \u201cI had worked on issues around landscapes of violence and state violence for many years outside of my home country, and I wanted to start researching what was happening from that point of view (in the US).\u201d Using a range of sources \u2014 including victim databases, media coverage, district attorney documents and police reports \u2014 Matar made her work during six lengthy road trips. She would watch videos or local news coverage of what happened at the location right before photographing the site in question. \u201cThat really was very emotionally affecting,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time I got out of the car, I was very aware I was not just taking a photograph of a landscape or of a building. I was photographing something that held the last moments of someone\u2019s life \u2014 unless they had been taken to hospital, it was the place where these deaths happened. It made me think about my country, and made me question so many things. \u201d Of all the sites Matar visited, she said only seven had a memorial of some kind, whether that was a mural, flowers, memorabilia or photos. In a way, though, the photographs and the information placed alongside them in \u201cMy America\u201d have a memorial-like quality of their own; Matar emphasizes this was a conscious decision in the book\u2019s design. \u201cI wanted a lot of white space in there, because I wanted the viewer to sit and think, and not just move on quickly,\u201d she said. While the biographical information next to each photograph is sparse, Matar researched and wrote a longer passage of text dedicated to each person\u2019s life, and death, which is included in the book\u2019s final pages. She describes her research of the wider issues relating to law-enforcement related deaths as \u201ceven more affecting\u201d than the process of making the photographs. This is exemplified in a series of pages in the middle of the book which outline key statistics related to such deaths, those impacted and factors involved \u2014 like that the number of people who die in encounters with police each year (around 1,000) has not changed in the nine years since Matar started researching the project in 2015. \u201cWhen you see all the things that go into why this is occurring \u2014 the lack of mental health beds, the lack of arms training, the racial injustice \u2014 there\u2019s so many things that come together in this particular challenge,\u201d Matar reflected. \u201cThis book is placing this type of violence in a continuum of a lot of violence in the history of the country.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have an illusion that this work is going to change anything, she continued. \u201cWhat I do think, though, is that point a camera at something, researching something, writing about something \u2014 all these things require great attention. And that attention is saying that this matters, this really matters.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/style/my-america-diana-matar-police-shootings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_style_flamingo-photograph-ai-1839-awards", "text": "As AI-generated images have begun creeping into art and photography contests over the past two years, sometimes fooling jurors and provoking anxiety and anger among artists, the photographer Miles Astray decided it was time to turn the tides. In an AI category at the 1839 Awards\u2019 Color Photography Contest, judged by industry leaders at Christie\u2019s, Phaidon and the Centre Pompidou, Astray pulled off an act of feathery subterfuge, sneaking in an entry of a real photo of a flamingo he took while in Aruba. Like AI images, which can bear hallmark signs of wonky anatomy, like too many teeth or fingers, the flamingo appeared headless as it bent its neck to scratch itself with its beak. To Astray\u2019s surprise, it won both third place in the category \u2014 and the People\u2019s Vote award. \u201cTo see it get shortlisted by the jury was a surprise in that it\u2019s always a bit of a lottery in such big contest. There are just so many excellent pictures competing,\u201d Astray told CNN over email. \u201cAfter it got shortlisted\u2026 I thought I might really have a shot and started campaigning for people\u2019s votes, but I had absolutely no idea how far or close I was to winning until the announcement.\u201d After the winners were revealed, the photographer notified the organization that runs the 1839 Awards, Creative Resource Collective, and took to social media to reveal his trickery. \u201cI entered this actual photo into the AI category of 1839 Awards to prove that human-made content has not lost its relevance, that Mother Nature and her human interpreters can still beat the machine, and that creativity and emotion are more than just a string of digits,\u201d Astray wrote. \u201cThere were ethical concerns, of course, so I was hoping that the jury and the audience would find that this jab at AI and its ethical implications outweighs the ethical implications of deceiving the viewer, which, of course, is ironic because that is what AI does.\u201d Astray was subsequently disqualified from the competition, with the director of Creative Resource Collective, Lily Fierman, explaining in a statement to CNN that \u201ceach category has distinct criteria that entrants\u2019 images must meet\u2026 we don\u2019t want to prevent other artists from their shot at winning in the AI category.\u201d Fierman said there\u2019s \u201cno hard feelings,\u201d and that their team plans to work with Astray to publish a conversation around the state of AI-generated images, using his entry as a \u201cjumping-off point.\u201d \u201cWe hope this will raise awareness (and send a message of hope) to other photographers who are worried about AI,\u201d she added. Creative Resource Collective did not comment on how their AI and non-AI photography categories are judged and vetted. As for the flamingo, Astray emphasized it was a serendipitous moment, not one that he sought out. \u201cI was not actively looking for a picture that would work for this stunt,\u201d he explained to CNN. \u201cRather, the idea had been roaming in some remote corner of my mind, more subconsciously than consciously I think, and when I saw this picture, it surfaced. It is simply the perfect shot for this because the scene is so unreal and for such a simple, natural reason: a flamingo scratching its belly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/style/flamingo-photograph-ai-1839-awards/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_weather_us-fathers-day-heat-wave-climate-sunday", "text": "The year\u2019s most significant heat wave so far is expected to roast a large portion of the central and southern United States on Father\u2019s Day Sunday with potentially record-breaking high temperatures, four days away from summer\u2019s official start. The National Weather Service warned people in the South and Midwest planning to celebrate dads outdoors on Sunday to stay cool amid a major heat risk, with high temperatures into the 90s in some areas. The intense heat wave won\u2019t stop there. An expansive and exceptionally strong heat dome will build Sunday over the East and stretch into the Midwest and Great Lakes over the next few days, with the heat expected to persist through the week. Heat domes trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. The final Sunday of spring will be a scorcher in the Plains and Midwest, where temperatures will reach the mid- to upper 90s, according to the Weather Prediction Center. People living across the Great Lakes region can expect temperatures in the upper 80s and low 90s. The Mississippi River Valley will be slammed with the worst of Sunday\u2019s sweltering conditions, with large portions of both states facing a Level 3 \u2013 or major \u2013 risk of heat-related impacts. The National Weather Service office in St. Louis encouraged residents to take extra precautions Sunday for its hottest day of the year. \u201cIt will feel like 100-105 during the afternoon hours. We aren\u2019t used to this kind of heat yet,\u201d forecasters wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Sunday\u2019s unrelenting heat will be felt across states including Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to the weather service. Some smaller pockets of Level 4 \u2013 or extreme \u2013 heat will be felt in a few locations such as Atlanta, where Sunday afternoon temperatures could reach 94 degrees by the afternoon. Millions will face heat-related health risks as conditions reach extreme levels into this week, according to a scale from the National Weather Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heat is the\u00a0deadliest form of weather\u00a0in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. Persistent heat could break records this week The extreme temperatures and uncomfortable heat will seep into the larger cities of the Midwest and Northeast by the start of the workweek. On Monday, Chicago temperatures could hit 94 degrees with the heat index at 97 degrees, according to forecasters at Chicago\u2019s weather service office. The high temperatures for the Upper Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions will soar into the mid- and upper 90s on Monday, with the possibility of tying or breaking numerous records, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The potential for record-shattering heat will last across the Ohio Valley and the Northeast through Friday, with some areas hitting heat indices of 105 degrees, the Weather Prediction Center said. A Level 3 heat risk is expected to affect large portions of states including Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio on Monday, according to the weather service. Meanwhile, much of the southern half of Iowa faces an extreme heat risk on Monday. Weather service forecasters in Des Moines, Iowa, warned of high heat and humidity through Tuesday as temperatures push into the 90s and heat index values hit near-triple digits. \u201cMorning lows will be just as impressive, as temperatures remain in the mid- to even upper 70s,\u201d the Weather Prediction Center said. \u201cThe combination of heat, humidity and little overnight relief will bring potentially widespread, significant heat-related impacts to anyone without adequate hydration or reliable cooling,\u201d according to the center. In Detroit, where daytime temperatures are expected to hit the high 90s, the city\u2019s urban core won\u2019t see much relief after dark, where weather service forecasters say overnight lows will only dip to the 70s this week. The sweltering conditions will continue to shift into the eastern and northeastern US by Tuesday.

{"id": "2024_06_16_sport_caitlin-clark-angel-reese-indiana-fever-chicago-sky-spt-intl", "text": "Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese faced each other for the second time in the WNBA as the Indiana Fever defeated Reese\u2019s Chicago Sky on Sunday. It was another closely-fought, physical affair, epitomized by the moment when Reese\u2019s swinging arm caught Clark\u2019s head as she tried to block the Fever star from shooting \u2013 which officials determined was \u201cunnecessary contact\u201d and a flagrant foul 1. Clark sunk the resulting two free throws, as she contributed a game-high 23 points as well as eight rebounds and nine assists to steer the Fever to a 91-83 victory. There was little to separate the two teams for much of the game and it wasn\u2019t until Clark hit a 30-foot three pointer with just over three minutes remaining that either side was able to stretch its lead beyond seven points. The 22-year-old Clark formed a potent partnership with fellow star Aliyah Boston who finished with 19 points, 14 rebounds and four assists \u2013 her third consecutive double-double. Meanwhile, Marina Mabrey led the way for the Sky with 22 points, Kamilla Cardoso had her first WNBA double-double and Chennedy Carter had 18 points and four assists. Reese finished with 11 points, 13 rebounds and five assists. After the game, Clark was asked what she was thinking after the hard foul. \u201cWhat\u2019s going through my mind is: \u2018I need to make these two free throws, that\u2019s all I\u2019m thinking about,\u2019\u201d the rookie said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a part of basketball. It is what it is, you know. She\u2019s trying to make a play on the ball and get the block. But yeah, it happens.\u201d When asked after the game about the flagrant foul, Reese seemed to disagree with the referee\u2019s decision. \u201cIt was a basketball play,\u201d Reese said. \u201cI can\u2019t control the refs, they affected the game obviously a lot tonight.\u201d Later in the press conference, Reese took another verbal jab at the way the game was called. \u201cGoing back and looking at the film, I see a lot of calls that weren\u2019t made,\u201d said Reese. \u201cI guess some people got a special whistle \u2026 we\u2019re not gonna be denied, no matter what you guys can try to do.\u201d Clark and Reese\u2019s rivalry \u2013 both in the WNBA and college basketball \u2013 has triggered discourse about race in the US, while the Fever star has found herself being used by controversial figures on social media to push their agendas in American culture wars. Earlier this month, Reese said of the rivalry with Clark: \u201cPeople are pulling up to games, we got celebrities coming to games, sold out arenas, just because of [the 2023 NCAA championship game]. \u201cAnd just looking at that, I\u2019ll take that role. I\u2019ll take the bad guy role, and I\u2019ll continue to take that on and be that for my teammates.\u201d Reese continued: \u201cI\u2019ll look back in 20 years and be like, \u2018Yeah, the reason why we\u2019re watching women\u2019s basketball is not just because of one person. It\u2019s because of me too,\u2019 and I want y\u2019all to realize that. \u201c Clark was asked on Sunday why she thinks there is so much attention on the matchup between herself and Reese. \u201cI think it\u2019s just the emotion and the passion that we play with,\u201d Clark answered. \u201cPeople love to see that, and I think that\u2019s maybe not something that was always appreciated in women\u2019s sports. And it should be. I think that\u2019s what makes it fun. \u201cWe\u2019re competitors, that\u2019s the way the game should be. It\u2019s going to get a little feisty, it\u2019s gonna get physical, but at the end of the day both teams are just trying to win. \u201cI think what [Reese] has done with her platform has been absolutely incredible, and she has an entire fan base that has supported her and what she did at Maryland and then LSU,\u201d Clark continued. \u201cObviously I\u2019ve played her for a very long time, and she\u2019s been a tremendous player. It\u2019s been really fun getting to compete against. I think it\u2019s been good for the game \u2026 people just love seeing great matchups.\u201d WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert recently told USA Today that the league was \u201cthrilled with the rivalries that are being built.\u2019\u2019 \u201cLook, apathy is the death of a brand,\u201d said Engelbert. \u201cNobody\u2019s apathetic about the WNBA because we\u2019ve brought in so many new fans into what we call the fan funnel this year.\u201d After losing five straight games to start the season, the Fever have been 5-5 since and have won four of their last six games. The Sky, meanwhile, are on a four-game losing streak and have now lost six out of their last seven games. The Indiana Fever next play on Wednesday when they face the Washington Mystics, while the Chicago Sky will look to bounce back against the Dallas Wings on Thursday.

{"id": "2024_06_16_uk_farage-uk-election-clacton-intl", "text": "At the end of Clacton Pier, where the salty North Sea breeze tangles with the sickly stench of the nearby amusement hall, a row of amateur fishermen gaze way off past the horizon, towards Europe. The lights and the noise here start early every day. Seagulls dart down from the sky; arcade games blare over each other; Radiohead, the Nineties alternative band, wails gloomily from a tinny speaker, until an employee notices, and puts on a dance anthem instead. The funfair is always in town, but the people have stopped coming. \u201cWe seem to be a bit forgotten down here in Clacton,\u201d Danny Botterell, a small business owner, tells CNN of his aging seaside home, which can no longer rely on visitors from London. He looks towards an empty seafront. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like God\u2019s waiting room.\u201d But Clacton is the front line of Britain\u2019s migration debate. And there is still one man who can draw a crowd: Nigel Farage, the rabble-rousing architect of Brexit and figurehead of the country\u2019s populist right, who told hundreds on the pier last week that he was running to be their member of parliament in next month\u2019s general election. Farage has pushed the boundaries of Britain\u2019s conversation on migration for a decade, and more recently sought to do the same in the United States, campaigning regularly alongside former President Donald Trump. He has returned to hammer the ruling Conservatives from the right once more, as though little has changed since the tempestuous EU referendum campaign eight years ago that resulted in the UK\u2019s departure from the bloc. \u201cWe know Nigel likes to get his point across, and shout,\u201d Botterell says. \u201cThat\u2019s a massive positive.\u201d Like many here, he expects Farage to \u201cspeak the truth.\u201d Farage is the favorite to win Clacton and become an MP at the eighth attempt. His Reform party is meanwhile swallowing up the support of dissatisfied ex-Conservatives across Britain, dragging the ruling party into what opinion polls suggest will be an ignominious battle for second place behind runaway leader Labour. One pollster this week had Reform \u2013 an upstart group formed by Farage in 2018, then known as the Brexit Party \u2013 overtaking the Conservatives. Others have them close behind. Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system makes it difficult for fringe groups like Reform to win more than a handful of seats in Westminster. But if the predicted surge holds, it could push Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s party to a once-in-a-lifetime defeat, and hand Farage an outsized role in British politics nonetheless. That is not an outcome asylum experts or rights groups welcome. They say Farage\u2019s presence in British life has already warped the country\u2019s understanding of migration, and hardened attitudes towards the tens of thousands caught in a backlog of unresolved asylum claims. \u201cHe can talk about migration in a way that makes it sound like he\u2019s really telling the truth \u2013 telling it like it is, and playing into people\u2019s deepest fears and prejudices,\u201d Zoe Gardner, a migration policy specialist, tells CNN. \u201cFarage knows he needs to stay one step ahead of where even the right wing of the Tories are,\u201d she adds, likening his rhetoric to Trump\u2019s on illegal migration across the southern US border. \u201cThey\u2019ll always want more,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir career is based on pushing things ever, ever, ever further.\u201d A \u2018closed\u2019 asylum system Clacton\u2019s pub landlords are well-acquainted with Farage, a natural political campaigner typically pictured with a pint in his hand. \u201cHe came in today,\u201d says Louise Brockwell, who runs the Three Jays pub, nodding to a stash of campaign posters left behind the bar. \u201cWhen he turns up, loads of people turn up.\u201d People recoil, too; few Britons are as divisive as Farage, whose career has relied in large part on his willingness to reach for alarmist and confrontational language when discussing immigration. Since announcing his candidacy he has warned supporters of an \u201cinvasion\u201d of asylum seekers, and was condemned by rival parties for claiming to Sky News that growing numbers of young Muslims \u201cdo not subscribe to British values.\u201d On Saturday, Foreign Secretary and former Prime Minister David Cameron \u2013 whose own premiership was thrown off course due to tussles with Farage over Europe \u2013 condemned his former foe\u2019s claim that Sunak, whose parents migrated to Britain from India, \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand our culture,\u201d made after Sunak returned early from events marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day. Cameron told The Times: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to watch sheep dog trials to hear a dog whistle.\u201d But Farage\u2019s relevance doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum. Despite years of tough rhetoric and policies aimed at deterring the arrival of asylum seekers \u2013 devised largely to placate Farage\u2019s supporters \u2013 Britain\u2019s asylum system is creaking. Legal migration is higher than it was before the 2016 referendum, which has benefited Britain\u2019s understaffed public services and sectors like hospitality \u2013 one in five healthcare workers is a non-UK national \u2013 but placed pressure on other parts of the socio-economic fabric, like housing. And illegal migration \u2013 often mentioned in the same breath by Farage, and symbolized for millions of Brits by the small boat crossings across the Channel from France \u2013 has soared too, despite Sunak\u2019s pledge to \u201cStop the Boats.\u201d Put simply, Britain\u2019s approach to migrants and refugees is harsher, but less effective, than before. \u201cThe Tories have effectively closed the asylum system. You arrive, (and) your claim will not be processed,\u201d Gardner says. The Home Office declined to comment. Around 100,000\u00a0people are waiting to hear if they will be granted asylum \u2013 a limbo that can be punishing, particularly for those housed in hotels or detention centers, like the Bibby Stockholm barge that floats off Britain\u2019s southern coast. In the county of Kent, south of Clacton, one of those asylum seekers, Masood, tells CNN: \u201cIt\u2019s not a nice feeling to constantly have in your mind that any day, you can receive a letter (sending) you to the barge,\u201d or to the nearby Napier military barracks, another controversial detention site called \u201cfundamentally unsuitable\u201d by\u00a0a group of MPs\u00a0in 2022. Masood was born and raised in Afghanistan and initially came to the UK on a student visa, after studying in the UAE. He applied for asylum last year, and was immediately put in a taxi and sent to live in the hotel where he remains today. He fears for his safety in Afghanistan, having been critical online of the Taliban prior to their 2021 takeover of the country.\u00a0CNN is not publishing his last name, due to fears it would affect his claim. \u201cMy entire family is back there, and they\u2019re not recommending (I return),\u201d he says. \u201cI think if I decided to go back home, they might arrest me in the airport.\u201d He says his hotel is cramped, with most residents sharing rooms. Many have mental health difficulties, he adds. Laws prevent most asylum seekers from working, so while taxpayers fund their accommodation, they cannot contribute formally to the economy. But \u201cthey\u2019re working anyway \u2026 they\u2019re all getting paid in cash,\u201d Masood says of his fellow hotel residents. Regret in Brexit\u2019s spiritual home If Brexit began anywhere, it is Clacton. The decision by its then-Conservative MP, Douglas Carswell, to defect to Farage\u2019s UKIP party in 2014 accelerated Britain\u2019s Eurosceptic movement. Two years later, amid a heated debate over migration that Farage and others promised would be reduced, seven in 10 people in Clacton voted to leave the EU. The town is one of the Whitest, oldest and poorest in the UK \u2013 all factors that correlated with support for Brexit. \u201cClacton is a straw in the wind,\u201d Carswell tells CNN now, recalling a sense in the town that \u201cpeople who run the state \u2026 treat them with absolute contempt.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s been more of a conversation about these profound questions of governance, and national identity, in that part of Essex,\u201d adds Carswell, who co-founded the Vote Leave campaign during the referendum and is now President of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy. Back then, Brexit sliced Britain in two. Now it unites the country: virtually no-one thinks it is going well. \u201cI know why a lot of people (voted) out \u2013 the foreigners, immigrants. But it hasn\u2019t changed, has it?\u201d says 73-year-old John Terrier, outside his home in Jaywick, a village west of Clacton. He voted to leave too, but he has \u201cRegrexit.\u201d \u201cWhat was the point of doing it all?\u201d Terrier says, hammering a nail into a garden door. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind going back in.\u201d As he speaks, his next-door neighbor snipes back, aghast. Bob Brace, 69, was at Farage\u2019s rally last week. He sports a top emblazoned with a Union Jack. \u201cIs this not the most patriotic town in the country? I believe it is,\u201d he says. Opinion polls indicate that Britain would vote today to remain in the EU, though the public doesn\u2019t support holding another bitter referendum. The painful memories of that entire project have, in many ways, been buried; neither Sunak nor Labour leader Keir Starmer see any value in unearthing the rows of the past decade. There are other things to worry about, in any case. Jaywick,\u00a0statistically\u00a0England\u2019s most deprived neighborhood, is comprised of ramshackle rows of beachside chalets, each third or fourth home boarded up like a blackened tooth. Residents here have many grievances \u2013 the roads, the health service, the schools \u2013 but concerns about immigration underpin almost every one. And after last week\u2019s European Parliament elections, in which the UK no longer plays a part, some see a movement brewing. \u201cIt\u2019s not just here. It\u2019s France, Netherlands, Germany, they\u2019ve all got the same crisis,\u201d says Karen French, a Reform supporter, sipping coffee and eating a sausage bap by the shore. \u201cI\u2019ve seen their votes and they\u2019re all starting to head towards (the) far right as well.\u201d A political storm gathers Farage initially announced he wouldn\u2019t stand in the July 4 election, citing his desire to campaign on behalf of Trump in the fall. Farage declined to give an interview for this story, as did the Labour and Conservative candidates in Clacton. But his U-turn animated both supporters and critics. Farage has had a milkshake tipped over his head and objects thrown at his open-top campaign bus in the past two weeks. Several of Reform\u2019s election candidates have meanwhile been dropped after racist comments they had made online emerged. Farage\u2019s entry also stoked Conservative fears of an electoral catastrophe. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely a polarizing figure. But from an electoral point of view, that doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d says James Johnson, who ran polling at Downing Street during Theresa May\u2019s premiership and then co-founded pollster JL Partners. \u201cBy the voters who are considering voting Reform, he is very, very, well liked\u201d he says of Farage \u2013 more so than Queen Elizabeth II was among Britons, according to Johnson\u2019s data. Not everyone in Clacton buys what Farage is selling. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of smoke,\u201d says restauranter Dean Coles. \u201cHe\u2019s a little bit shouty shouty, more than a do-er.\u201d Jehosh Adekiyesi, a social care worker, is blunter. \u201cA lot of people say a lot of sh*t. When you give them recognition, they say more. When you ignore them, they become irrelevant,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t take him seriously.\u201d But it is becoming harder not to; even pulling in a sixth of voters could demolish the Conservatives and elevate his voice in the postmortem that takes place on the opposition benches. That could widen even further the chasm in understanding between his voters and Britain\u2019s asylum seekers, experts fear. \u201cThey really, desperately need a solution,\u201d says Gardner.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/uk/farage-uk-election-clacton-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_middleeast_hamas-interview-israel-gaza-hostages-intl", "text": "The fate of the 120 remaining hostages in Gaza is crucial to any deal to end the protracted and bloody conflict between Israel and Hamas. But a senior Hamas official has told CNN that \u201cno one has an idea\u201d how many of them are alive, and that any deal to release them must include guarantees of\u00a0a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. In an interview with CNN, Hamas spokesperson and political bureau member Osama Hamdan offered an insight into the militant group\u2019s position on the stalled ceasefire talks, a view on whether Hamas regrets its decision to attack Israel given the mounting Palestinian death toll, and a commentary on the leak earlier this week of messages from its chief in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, the man believed to be the ultimate decision-maker on any peace deal. The US believes that Hamas holds the key to the talks. \u201cThe haggling has to stop,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told NBC on Thursday, urging Sinwar to end the war. \u201cHe\u2019s relatively safe underground; the people that he purports to represent, they\u2019re suffering every day.\u201d Speaking to CNN in the Lebanese capital Beirut, Hamdan said the latest proposal on the table \u2013 an Israeli plan that was first publicly announced by US President Joe Biden late last month \u2013 did not meet the group\u2019s demands for an end to the war. Hamdan, who has been part of the Hamas negotiations team on the ground, told CNN that the group needed \u201ca clear position from Israel to accept the ceasefire, a complete withdrawal from Gaza, and let the Palestinians to determine their future by themselves, the reconstruction, the (lifting) of the siege \u2026 and we are ready to talk about a fair deal about the prisoners exchange.\u201d Negotiations over the US-backed proposal have intensified in recent days but appeared to grind to a halt on Wednesday after Hamas presented its response to the document, 12 days after first receiving it. Blinken expressed frustration over what he said was Hamas\u2019s decision to submit \u201cnumerous changes,\u201d describing some of them as going \u201cbeyond positions (Hamas) had previously taken.\u201d \u201cSome of the changes are workable. Some are not,\u201d Blinken said at a news conference in Doha on Wednesday. The US-backed ceasefire plan that was approved by the United Nations Security Council on Monday lays out a phased approach. In the first phase, there would be a six-week ceasefire in which some hostages would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and the Israeli military would pull out of populated areas in Gaza. The second phase \u2013 a permanent end to the war and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza \u2013 would only be implemented after further negotiations between the two sides. But Hamdan told CNN the duration of the ceasefire was a key issue for Hamas, which is concerned that Israel has no intention of following through with the second phase of the deal. The end of hostilities must be permanent, he said, and Israel must withdraw from Gaza completely. \u201cThe Israelis want the ceasefire only for six weeks and then they want to go back to the fight, which I think the Americans, till now, they did not convince the Israelis to accept (a\u00a0permanent ceasefire),\u201d he said, adding that he believes the US needs to convince Israel to accept a permanent ceasefire as part of the deal. Israel has not yet publicly committed to the deal, even though the White House has repeatedly stressed that it was an Israeli plan that the government had accepted. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been under pressure to announce his support for the current plan, has repeatedly said that the war will not end until Israel eliminates Hamas. Blinken told NBC that Netanyahu \u201creconfirmed\u201d to him \u201cthat Israel supported this proposal and was ready to say yes\u201d when he saw him couple of days ago, and placed the blame for stalled negotiations squarely on Hamas. \u201cHamas has to demonstrate that it too wants this to end. If it does, we can bring it to an end. If it doesn\u2019t, then it means that it wants the war to continue,\u201d Blinken said. Question of responsibility Speaking to CNN inside a modest office decorated with a large map of Gaza and panoramic photo of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, Hamdan repeatedly deflected any questions about Hamas\u2019 role in the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. He called the October 7 terror attacks, which sparked the current war in Gaza, \u201ca reaction against the occupation.\u201d The October 7 attack was the deadliest assault in Israel\u2019s history. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and also took some 250 people hostage into Gaza. Israel was quick to retaliate, immediately declaring war on Hamas and launching an intense campaign of bombardment followed by a ground invasion several weeks later. That operation has had a devastating impact on the Palestinians of Gaza. More than 37,000 people have been killed, most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in the strip. Some 90% of people living in the territory are estimated to have been displaced by the fighting. While the Gazan authorities do not distinguish between casualties among civilians and Hamas fighters, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has previously admitted the majority of those killed in the operation were civilians. Asked repeatedly by CNN whether Hamas regretted its decision to attack Israel, Hamdan responded by blaming the situation on Israel and saying the attack was \u201ca reaction against the occupation.\u201d \u201cThe one who is in charge or responsible for that is (the Israeli) occupation. If you resist the occupation, (they) will kill you, if you did not resist the occupation, (they) also will kill you and deport you out of your country. So what we are supposed to do, just to wait?,\u201d he said. Hamdan also dismissed as fake reports that Sinwar suggested the deaths of thousands of Palestinians were \u201cnecessary sacrifices.\u201d Sinwar has not been seen in public since the October 7 attacks. He is believed to be hiding in Gaza, somewhere inside the tunnel network that runs underneath the strip. He has been designated as a terrorist by the US, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using civilians in Gaza as human shields and earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal published what it said were leaked messages from Sinwar to other Hamas leaders in which he allegedly expressed an uncompromising determination to continue fighting, regardless of the human cost. Hamdan told CNN the messages \u201cwere fake.\u201d \u201cIt was fake messages done by someone who is not Palestinian and (it) was sent (to the) Wall Street Journal as part of the pressure against Hamas and provoking the people against the leader,\u201d he said without providing evidence. \u201cNo one can accept the killing of the Palestinians, of his own people.\u201d Destroying Hamas? When Israel launched its war on Hamas, Netanyahu said the objectives were to \u201cdestroy Hamas and bring back hostages held in Gaza.\u201d But more than eight months on, the goal of eliminating the group completely appears unachievable. While the IDF has killed some Hamas commanders, the top leadership in Gaza, including Sinwar, continues to evade them. And despite the damage caused to its infrastructure, Hamas also continues to fire rockets towards Israel, albeit much more sporadically than at the outset of the conflict. American intelligence officials believe that Sinwar likely believes Hamas can survive Israel\u2019s attempt to destroy it. At the same time, Netanyahu is under increasing pressure to reach a deal that would secure the return of the remaining hostages still in Gaza. Israel believes that more than 70 hostages of the more than 100 who are still held in Gaza to be alive. Speaking to CNN, Hamdan said he didn\u2019t know how many were still alive. \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea about that. No one has an idea about this,\u201d he said, alleging \u2013 without providing any evidence \u2013 that the Israeli operation to free four of the hostages on Saturday resulted in the deaths of three others, including an American citizen. There are fears that more hostages may be dead than are publicly known. In April, Hamas told international mediators that it was not able to fulfill Israel\u2019s demand to free 40 of the remaining hostages in the first phase of a deal, including all the women as well as sick and elderly men, because it did not hold 40 living hostages who match those criteria for release. Opposition leader Benny Gantz, who quit the Israeli war cabinet last weekend, was asked by an Israeli TV channel on Thursday whether Israel knew how many hostages are alive. He responded by saying: \u201cWe know (a) very close number,\u201d he responded. Asked about the testimony of a doctor who treated the released hostages and said they suffered mental and physical abuse and were beaten every hour, Hamdan again blamed Israel for their suffering. \u201cI believe if they have mental problem, this is because of what Israel have done in Gaza. Because (no one can) handle what Israel is doing, bombing each day, killing civilians, killing women and children \u2026 they saw that (with) their own eyes,\u201d he said, adding that comparing images of the hostages taken before and after the eight-months long captivity shows \u201cthey were better than before\u201d \u2013 a claim that is demonstrably false.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/middleeast/hamas-interview-israel-gaza-hostages-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_style_hot-rodent-men-celebrities", "text": "In the Chinese zodiac, 2024 is the year of the dragon. To the internet, it is the year of the rat. It began, seemingly, with a few innocuous social media posts comparing Mike Faist, co-star of the titillating tennis throuple film \u201cChallengers,\u201d to a dormouse. Soon, the complexity of the analogy snowballed to odd levels of specificity: He\u2019s a field mouse. No, he\u2019s a cartoon mouse. No, he\u2019s Despereaux (the dumbo-eared mouse from the 2008 animated film \u201cThe Tale of Despereaux\u201d). No, he\u2019s Stuart Little, if Stuart Little was hot. He was \u201clike if a sleepy cartoon mouse came to life and then got really into cross fit,\u201d wrote journalist Lucy Ford on X. And it wasn\u2019t long until fans on social media began examining the facial features of other male celebrities for similar signs of rodent likeness \u2014 Faist\u2019s \u201cChallengers\u201d co-star Josh O\u2019Connor, for example. Barry Keoghan. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Jeremy Allen White. Glen Powell. This list goes on. From chinchillas to capybaras,\u00a0the rodent comparisons sped across social media like a runaway wheel of cheese, warping the image (and perhaps the confidence) of many popular, young white male celebrities in its path. On June 2, a Daily Mail article introduced this internet in-joke to the masses. \u201cHow \u2018hot rodent\u2019 men became Hollywood\u2019s sexiest heartthrobs: Gen Z fans are going wild for actors with unusual features including Barry Keoghan, Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Allen White,\u201d read the headline. The trend has since been covered by the New York Times, the Guardian, the London Times, NBC and the Today Show, among others. How do these men \u2014 heartthrobs of the moment, even \u2014 feel about being categorized as \u201chot rodents\u201d? Powell, who was first likened to a rodent back in 2023, has gamely praised the ingenuity of the chronically online. \u201cThis is why the internet\u2019s a great place,\u201d he told Jimmy Fallon last December. \u201cI really kind of own the capybara thing now. I am the capybara.\u201d Despite outreach, CNN did not receive a response from O\u2019Connor, Chalamet, Keoghan or White. (Faist\u2019s agent, meanwhile, confirmed that the actor does not use social media. A small mercy). But more broadly, the informal sampling of average Joes \u2014 or should that be average Jerrys? \u2014 CNN reached for comment largely didn\u2019t mind being dubbed ratty. Surveyed in a Whatsapp friend group, one 20-something admitted hearing the term would \u201churt,\u201d while another said he would be happy to embrace \u201chot rat summer.\u201d A third man polled shared\u00a0that despite an initial knee jerk reaction, he understood that \u201crodent men are very hot right now\u201d and so would probably be \u201cflattered.\u201d For some, the question goes beyond the hypothetical. One had already been called a \u201crat boy\u201d by his current girlfriend. \u201cShe\u2019s still with me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo I\u2019ve taken it well.\u201d Similarly, Gustav, a 22-year-old X user, has also been compared to a mouse. (Stuart Little, to be precise \u2014 just like Faist.) \u201cI\u2019d say I mostly found the comment amusing,\u201d he told CNN via X. \u201cIt was clearly not meant as an insult and even though some people would take it as an insult, I mostly felt it was a way of saying that I was cute.\u201d While by no means exhaustive, these responses suggest men feel mostly fine with the \u201chot rodent\u201d trend. But if any male celebrity is struggling with the break-neck transition from traditional dreamboat to furry pin-up, perhaps the Chinese zodiac \u2014 which believes rats to be among the most intelligent, popular and charming animals of the 12-year cycle \u2014 can be some comfort, after all.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/style/hot-rodent-men-celebrities/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_06_16_sport_bryson-dechambeau-us-open-win-2024-spt-intl", "text": "American Bryson DeChambeau won his second US Open title on Sunday, edging Rory McIlroy in a nerve-shredding finale at Pinehurst No. 2 in Pinehurst, North Carolina. LIV Golf star DeChambeau carded a final round one-over 71 to finish one stroke ahead of his Northern Irish counterpart at six-under overall and add to his first major victory in 2020. It resigned world No. 3 McIlroy to yet another heartbreaking near-miss as his 10-year wait for a fifth major title continues. The 35-year-old played brilliantly to surge from three shots behind to two ahead of DeChambeau, only to miss two putts from inside four feet across the last two holes. Left needing to close with par to win, DeChambeau held his nerve to triumph and exorcise the demons of falling one stroke short of the PGA Championship to compatriot Xander Schauffele last month. With his victory falling on Father\u2019s Day, an emotional DeChambeau began his winner\u2019s speech by dedicating the trophy to his father Jon, who died in 2022. \u201cFirst off I want to say a Happy Father\u2019s Day to every father out there,\u201d DeChambeau said.\u201cThis one is for him.\u201d It makes the 30-year-old the second golfer after last year\u2019s PGA Championship winner Brooks Koepka to win a major after departing the PGA Tour for LIV Golf. Cameron Smith and Jon Rahm joined the Saudi-backed circuit after their victories at the 2022 Open Championship and 2023 Masters respectively. Once maligned by some fans, DeChambeau \u2013 whose personal YouTube channel continues to amass subscribers \u2013 has become a crowd-favorite at the majors this year and further consolidated that reputation at Pinehurst. The California-born golfer mixed thrilling play with regular fan interaction throughout, wooing fans one final time by delivering on his victor\u2019s speech promise to let them touch the trophy and ferrying it around the throngs gathered at the 18th green. \u201cI just can\u2019t thank you guys enough for all the support this week,\u201d he added to the crowd. \u201cYou guys have meant the world to me. You are the best fans in the world and I can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d The joyous scenes served as a stark contrast to the agony undoubtedly felt by McIlroy, who declined to speak to media after his final round one-under 69. McIlroy has plugged away at ending his major drought with remarkable consistency since his last triumph at the 2014 Open Championship, finishing inside the top-10 on 20 of his 36 subsequent appearances at the four flagship events, including his last five in a row at the US Open. He has been a major runner-up three times before, his most recent to Wyndham Clark at last year\u2019s tournament, but the fourth has the potential to haunt him the most given the context. Three bogeys and a par across his last four holes, compounded by two horror close-range misses, resigned him to a closing 69. Even one stroke better would ultimately have been enough to force DeChambeau into a playoff. McIlroy had made his previous 496 putts from inside three feet before his miss for par at the 16th, according to the PGA Tour. The curtain falls on the 2024 men\u2019s major calendar with the 152nd Open Championship at Royal Troon in Scotland on July 18, where American Brian Harman will seek to defend the Claret Jug. Scheffler endures rare torrid week Scottie Scheffler\u2019s miserable week ended in another birdie-less round as the world No.1 toiled to a tied-41st finish at eight-over par overall, his worst major performance in two years. Five wins in his previous eight starts \u2013 including last week\u2019s Memorial Tournament \u2013 had seen Scheffler arrive at Pinehurst as the overwhelming favorite yet he struggled to cope with the course\u2019s firm and fast greens, the typically unflappable Texan\u2019s frustrations bubbling over as he narrowly scraped under the cut line Friday. A third round one-over 71 meant Scheffler had shot four consecutive rounds over par for the first time in a professional career spanning 120 PGA Tour events, and the unwanted streak extended to five as he signed off with a 72. April\u2019s Masters champion had gone 168 rounds with at least one birdie before his second round 74, and had not finished outside the top-25 at a major since missing the cut at the 2022 PGA Championship. Both streaks had extended through a tied-eighth finish at last month\u2019s PGA Championship, a result achieved despite his arrest and release from jail during the major. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hole anything. I could not see the break on these greens,\u201d Scheffler, who has since seen all charges against him dismissed, told reporters Sunday. \u201cThe greens this week kind of had my number. I felt like I hit a lot of really good putts that did weird things at the cup that I was not expecting them to do.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been on a good stretch of golf,\u201d he added. \u201cHad one tough event following a great event. I\u2019m not really going to look too much into it but focus more on my prep.\u201d Scheffler finished 12 shots behind his compatriots Tony Finau and Patrick Cantlay, who shared third place at four-under overall, one shot behind McIlroy. France\u2019s Matthieu Pavon finished a further stroke back. Unfamiliar territory A virtuoso third round 67 that was as entertaining as it was excellent had rocketed DeChambeau into the final 18 holes with a plush \u2013 yet unfamiliar \u2013 three shot cushion. The Californian had never before held the 54-hole lead at a major championship. Though he had ultimately cantered to victory at Winged Foot six years ago, he had trailed Matthew Wolff by two strokes ahead of the final round before tearing away from his compatriot down the stretch. DeChambeau said Saturday he was aiming to play \u201cboring golf\u201d to get over the line, and looked to be delivering on his plan as he made a steady \u2013 albeit unspectacular \u2013 start with six pars and a bogey through the opening seven holes. Yet that strategy, and his nerve, soon came under enormous scrutiny. Unlike Wolff four years ago, McIlroy was showing no signs of fading. Far from it \u2013 he was catching fire. The steely-eyed Northern Irishman was making a mockery of the firm and fast greens that had humbled so much of the field across the week. After two birdies from beyond 20 feet, McIlroy lasered in his fourth in a five-hole stretch at the 13th. With DeChambeau bogeying the 12th, McIlroy headed to the next tee box with a two stroke cushion. The picture had changed entirely in less than 20 minutes, yet it took the same amount of time for it to reset as DeChambeau capitalized on a bogey from his rival to draw level just two holes later. It set up a climax that would serve as the ultimate test of nerve and DeChambeau blinked first, a birdie opportunity turning into a bogey as his four-foot par putt lipped out of the 15th cup. Incredibly though, McIlroy would mirror the error from even closer range mere moments later to surrender his lead and set in motion a meltdown to rival his infamous collapse at the Masters in 2011. Yet the minor consolation of that spiral at Augusta National was that victory had all but vanished shortly after he made the turn. This time, the nightmare ran on till to the last two-and-a-half feet, as a simple conversion for par at the 18th green would have forced DeChambeau to birdie to avoid a playoff. There was a glimmer of hope as DeChambeau went from a hook into the native area to a bunker, but the American recovered superbly with a stunning 55-yard approach to within four feet of the cup. Watching anxiously on a clubhouse TV, McIlroy could only watch as DeChambeau safely avoided making the same mistake he did.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/sport/bryson-dechambeau-us-open-win-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

Lines to buy food, lines to pay bills, lines just because people were lining up for something maybe worth lining up for. But now I was in a line for something unexpected:\u00a0to\u00a0board\u00a0a Russian warship docked in Havana\u2019s harbor. When a Russian diplomat told me that starting on Thursday, the Admiral Gorshkov frigate would offer tours to the public for three days, I was somewhat skeptical. The Gorshkov is one of the most modern vessels in the Russian fleet, capable of firing hypersonic missiles that travel at more than 6,000 miles per hour. I had trouble imagining that\u00a0President Vladimir\u00a0Putin\u2019s prized\u00a0ship would be opened for anyone to see. When the Gorshkov arrived in Cuba\u00a0on Wednesday, it fired a deafening\u00a021-shot\u00a0salute.\u00a0The\u00a0Cubans answered with cannon fire from an 18th\u00a0century fortress overlooking the harbor that the Spanish had built to protect the city from pirates. With the frigate came a rescue tug, a fuel ship and the Kazan, an imposing nuclear-powered submarine. Cuba\u2019s Ministry of Defense said that none of the ships were carrying nuclear weapons and that they did not represent \u201ca threat to the region,\u201d clearly meaning the US, Cuba\u2019s neighbor 90 miles to the\u00a0north. But for many Cubans, the visit of the largest convoy of ships in years from their old Cold War ally seemed like a return to the past, particularly as Moscow and Washington increasingly spar over the war in Ukraine. \u201cI never thought I would see a Russian submarine so up close,\u201d said a Cuban man next to me as we waited in line in view of the four\u00a0vessels. We were standing outside the port terminal in Havana which,\u00a0just years earlier,\u00a0had been full\u00a0of\u00a0US cruise ships, until then-President Donald Trump banned their visits to the island\u00a0in 2019. Even though a line had formed, it was not clear if any of us waiting there were going to get aboard. An hour passed in the broiling Cuban sun. \u201cWe are roasting out here,\u201d a woman carrying a small baby next to me said. Cubans are champion line-waiters and I worried that I would have nothing to show for my interlude outside the port other than a worsening sunburn. Finally, a Cuban Navy official in a sparkling white uniform came out to speak to us, resting his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou can go aboard but need to leave any sharp objects like knives, scissors or hair clippers behind,\u201d he said. Two plainclothes\u00a0state\u00a0security officers began to run everyone\u2019s\u00a0identity card numbers through a database on their phones. I handed my\u00a0carn\u00e9,\u00a0or\u00a0ID card,\u00a0that lists my birthplace in the US to one of the officers who appeared too young to shave. He looked at my\u00a0carn\u00e9\u00a0and turned to his older colleague for advice. \u201cAre we letting foreign residents on board?\u201d\u00a0he asked. The older officer,\u00a0who was wearing a New York Yankee\u2019s baseball cap,\u00a0nodded and then ran my card information through the database. \u201cYou can go ahead,\u201d he said. Inside the port, past officials manning a metal detector, Russian sailors in dark blue unforms waited to take a group of about\u00a020\u00a0of us aboard the Gorshkov. In front of the ship, the sailors had posted a sign in English that declared the Gorshkov\u2019s \u201cmain purpose\u201d was \u201ccombat operations against enemy surface ships and submarines.\u201d The Russian sailors spoke more English than Spanish and I occasionally translated to help the other members of our group, who were\u00a0all\u00a0Cuban. We were told we could film and everyone immediately took out their smartphones to snap videos and selfies. We started out on the ship\u2019s massive helicopter pad and then walked through the ship to the bow. Every few feet a Russian sailor stood keeping watch. At the front of the ship, one of the sailors\u00a0showed me an anti-rocket system\u00a0to be used\u00a0in the unlikely event we came under attack. I asked about the massive cannon and the sailor replied that it could fire shells a distance of 23 kilometers,\u00a0or about 15 miles. A level up, where there appeared to be sensitive communications equipment, a Russian soldier in tactical gear with an assault rifle at his side looked down at us. Just off the bow we could see an unobstructed view of the Kazan, the 430-foot long submarine that stretched out into the harbor. I noticed one of the Russian sailors taking in the blue skies and calm waters around us. \u201cCuba good?\u201d I ask him. \u201cCuba good,\u201d he laughs in reply and gives me a thumbs up. The war in Ukraine has\u00a0severely\u00a0degraded the Russian fleet and once again pitted the US and Russia on opposite sides of a bloody conflict. For a Russian sailor, Cuba could be as good as it gets these days. I disembarked the Russian warship in Havana feeling that the Cold War did not seem like such a distant memory, when I saw an alert flash across my phone. It was an announcement that the Pentagon had just dispatched its own nuclear powered attack submarine\u00a0to the other side of the island:\u00a0the US Navy Base in Guantanamo\u00a0Bay,\u00a0Cuba, slightly more than 500 miles away from the where the Russian ships are docked.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/americas/onboard-the-russian-warship-visiting-cuba/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

The respective parties involved include the ANC, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the DA, Steenhuisen outlined in his statement. \u201cToday, the 14th of June 2024 will go down in the annals of history as the start of a new chapter for our beloved country,\u201d Steenhuisen said. The DA, a broadly centrist and pro-business party, is seen as the official opposition to the ANC, and has been heavily critical of the ANC for years. \u201cIt is difficult to overstate just how significant this moment is for the Democratic Alliance,\u201d Steenhuisen said, adding that the party will \u201cgovern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration.\u201d \u201cThanks to the 3.5 million people who voted for us, the DA will no longer only be an opposition party at a national level. Instead, the DA now becomes the second biggest party inside a multi-party national government,\u201d the DA leader added. No party managed to win an outright majority in South Africa\u2019s election last month. Support for the ANC dropped to 40.18%,\u00a0a huge slump from the 57.5% it received in the last election in 2019. The DA party received 21.8% of the vote. Former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s newly-formed uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) had nearly 14.59% of the vote. Another ANC splinter party \u2013 the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) \u2013 had nearly 10%, with results at 9.52% The ANC\u2019s Secretary General Fikile Mbalula said on Thursday the party had reached a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d with political parties in coalition negotiations during a press conference on Thursday in Cape Town. The announcement comes as the newly elected parliament was convening for the first time and lawmakers were in the process of being sworn in. \u201cToday marks the beginning of a new era where we put our differences aside and unite for the betterment of all South Africans,\u201d wrote Sihle Zikalala, of the ANC\u2019s governing body, in a post on X. Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC leader, will remain the country\u2019s president under the deal, according to a report on the TimesLive news website.

The painting depicts Jesus, Mary and Joseph resting on their way to Egypt after learning that Herod, King of Judea, wanted to kill the young Christ. Titian, whose real name was Tiziano Vecellio, made the work in the first decade of the 16th century, at the beginning of his career. Measuring just 18.25 inches by 24.75 inches (46.2 centimeters x 62.9 centimeters), the painting is tiny compared with some of the massive works for which Titian became known later in his life. The oil-on-canvas work has a remarkable history. After changing hands among various European aristocrats, the painting was looted by Napoleonic troops during the French occupation of Vienna in 1809 and taken to Paris. It was returned to Vienna in 1815 and again moved through private collections before ending up with John Alexander Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath, in Wiltshire, England. In 1995, it was stolen from Longleat, the home of Thynne\u2019s descendants, and disappeared for seven years, before it was found at a bus stop in London by art detective Charles Hill. \u201cThis is a painting, then, that has been coveted by aristocrats, archdukes and emperors alike: prized for its vividly coloured scene of familial affection within the natural world,\u201d Christie\u2019s said in the statement. \u201cLike its subjects,\u00a0The Rest on the Flight into Egypt\u00a0has been on a long and eventful journey \u2014 a journey that\u2019s far from over.\u201d The painting will be offered as part of the Old Masters Part I auction at Christie\u2019s in London on July 2.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/style/titian-painting-auction-scli-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_europe_putin-conditions-peace-talks-ukraine-intl", "text": "President Vladimir Putin said Russia will only end its war in Ukraine if Kyiv surrenders the entirety of four regions claimed by Moscow and abandons its bid to join NATO \u2013 terms Kyiv immediately dismissed as a \u201ccomplete sham\u201d and \u201coffensive to common sense.\u201d Speaking Friday ahead of a peace conference in Switzerland to which Russia has not been invited, Putin set out his conditions for a \u201cfinal end\u201d to the war in more granular detail than at any previous time since he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. As well as withdrawing from the four occupied regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, Putin said Ukraine must demilitarize and that Western countries must lift their sanctions on Russia, which have damaged but not crippled its economy. While these conditions are more maximalist than those Putin has hinted at before, they represent Russia\u2019s failure to achieve its original war aims, when Moscow believed it could capture Kyiv in days and the rest of Ukraine in weeks. Nearly 28 months later, Russia occupies around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula it annexed a decade ago. Ukrainian and certain Western officials have repeatedly warned that Putin intends to settle for nothing less than Kyiv\u2019s total defeat, and that any truce or peace talks are merely a guise to allow Russia\u2019s troops to regroup and launch a fresh and fiercer offensive in the future. But, in comments to the foreign ministry, Putin said Russia\u2019s conditions for peace talks are \u201csimple,\u201d beginning with the total withdrawal of Ukraine\u2019s troops from the entire territory of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Moscow only controls these regions partially, but claimed the whole of each region was part of Russia\u2019s territory in 2022. Putin stressed that Ukraine should surrender not just the territory on the Russian side of the frontline, which splices through each of these regions, but \u201cthe entire territory of these regions.\u201d \u201cAs soon as they declare in Kyiv that they are ready for such a decision and begin the real withdrawal of troops from these regions \u2013 and also officially notify about the abandonment of plans to join NATO \u2013 our side will immediately, at the same minute, make the order to cease fire and begin negotiations,\u201d he said. Putin promised to \u201cguarantee the unhindered and safe withdrawal of Ukrainian units and formations,\u201d and said Moscow acknowledges its role in global stability. He asked that his terms for ending the war would need to be cemented in international agreements. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country \u201cdoes not trust\u201d Putin\u2019s \u201cultimatum,\u201d which he said did not significantly differ from previous offers he has made before. Speaking Friday from the Group of Seven summit in Italy, Zelensky drew parallels between Putin\u2019s tactics and those used by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler to conquer swaths of Europe in the 1930s and 40s. \u201cHe talks about regions of our country, and he says he will not stop,\u201d Zelensky told CNN affiliate Sky Tg24. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing Hitler did, when he said \u2018give me a part of Czechoslovakia and that\u2019s the end of it.\u2019 You can\u2019t trust it,\u201d Zelensky said, referring to Hitler\u2019s annexation of the Sudetenland and Western countries\u2019 failed policy of appeasement. \u201cThat is why we must not trust these messages, because Putin follows the same course,\u201d Zelensky warned. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called on Kyiv\u2019s allies to \u201cget rid of illusions\u201d and to stop taking Russia\u2019s proposals seriously, describing Putin\u2019s terms as \u201coffensive to common sense.\u201d \u201cThere is no novelty in this, no real peace proposals and no desire to end the war. But there is a desire not to pay for this war and to continue it in new formats. It\u2019s all a complete sham,\u201d Podolyak said. Putin\u2019s speech comes on the eve of the Swiss peace conference, in which nearly 100 countries and organizations will take part. He dismissed the conference as \u201canother ploy to divert everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/europe/putin-conditions-peace-talks-ukraine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_europe_us-weapons-azov-brigade-ukraine-intl", "text": "The United States has lifted a ban on sending weapons and training to the Ukrainian Azov brigade, which played a vital role in the defense of the port city of Mariupol, but had a controversial past. The ban, called the \u201cLeahy Law,\u201d prohibits any military assistance or training to be provided to foreign units held responsible for human rights violations, according to the US State Department. The battalion, named the 12th Special Forces Azov Brigade, was integrated into the Ukrainian National Guard in 2023, after the initial formation dissolved. The unit has been praised for its role in the fight against Russian occupation in the Mariupol area. The unit welcomed the lifting of the ban on receiving security assistance from the US, saying in a statement Tuesday, \u201cThis is a new page in the history of our unit.\u201d \u201cEligibility for US assistance will not only increase Azov\u2019s combat effectiveness, but, most importantly, will help save the lives and health of the brigade\u2019s personnel,\u201d the unit said. \u201cAzov is becoming more professional and more effective in defending Ukraine against the invaders.\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned the US decision on Tuesday, saying the US is \u201cready even to flirt with neo-Nazis,\u201d according to Russian state news agency TASS. Major battles Founded as a militia to defend Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion in 2014, the unit was initially called the \u201cAzov Battalion,\u201d active around the Mariupol area. Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defense encouraged at the time volunteer battalions to help the army and resistance efforts. Later that year, the Azov battalion was \u201creorganized and expanded into the Azov Special Police Regiment of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,\u201d before becoming part of the National Guard, according to its website. In 2015, Azov fighters liberated Mariupol and its surroundings from occupation, pushing Russian forces far away from the city. They took part in several major battles in Donetsk region. The battalion has said it repeatedly denies \u201callegations of fascism, nazism and racism,\u201d in response to claims it had associations with White supremacists and neo-Nazi ideology. The US State Department said Tuesday that Russian disinformation \u201chas actively worked to discredit\u201d the unit. \u201cThey have long tried to conflate Ukraine\u2019s National Guard Unit of 12th Special Forces Brigade Azov with a militia formed to defend Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion in 2014, called the \u201cAzov Battalion,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said. \u201cThat militia disbanded in 2015 and the Special Forces Brigade Azov is unrelated to that militia.\u201d After applying the Leahy vetting process, the State Department \u201cfound no evidence of Gross Violations of Human Rights\u201d committed by the 12th Azov Special Forces Brigade. Russian Ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, said Tuesday the steps taken by Washington \u201ccan cause nothing but extreme indignation.\u201d He called the brigade \u201can openly nationalist formation\u201d and said Moscow is concerned over \u201cUS approaches in the fight against terrorism.\u201d After the bombing of a Mariupol theater in 2022 that was sheltering civilians and had the word \u201cchildren\u201d written in Russian on the ground on either side of the building, the Russian Defense Ministry accused \u201cmilitants of the nationalist \u2018Azov\u2019 battalion\u201d of carrying out the attack. At the time, local\u00a0Ukrainian officials blamed Russia for the attack, which is believed to have killed hundreds who were sheltering in the theater amid heavy bombardment in the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion. The city of Mariupol has become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance, after Ukrainian soldiers, including members of the Azov unit, and residents sheltered for weeks underground at the city\u2019s massive Azovstal steelworks plant refusing to surrender to Russian forces.

The days of deadly, torrential storms have turned roads into canals and forced some residents to stand on the roofs of their cars or trudge through waist-deep waters. Two people were killed in a weather-related vehicle crash late Wednesday afternoon southeast of Fort Myers, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. Identified only as a 35-year-old woman and a 25-year-old-man, the two died after their vehicle \u201clost control due to weather\u201d conditions and crashed into opposing traffic, the FHP said. Two others were injured in the crash. Since heavy rain started swamping the region Tuesday, the flooding has become waist-deep in some places. Hazardous conditions on streets and roadways have stranded drivers and made roads impassable. And they\u2019ve forced some schools in hard-hit counties to shutter and hundreds of flights to be canceled or delayed. With tropical moisture still streaming over South Florida, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a level 3 of 4 flood threat Friday \u2013 just one level lower than the rare high risk of excessive rainfall seen Thursday. Robust tropical moisture fueling the soaking storms slowly starts to shift out of the area over the weekend, but Friday marks yet another drenching day for South Florida. By week\u2019s end, multiple cities could see more than 2 feet of rain. \u201cEven moderate rain rates are likely to cause additional flash flooding, as any rainfall will be unable to drain\u201d due to ongoing flooding, the WPC warned Friday. Flood watches remain in effect for over 7 million people across South Florida, including in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, through Friday evening. An additional 2 to 4 inches or more of rainfall is expected through Friday night. Thunderstorm activity is expected to diminish over the weekend, but any rain Saturday or early Sunday could worsen ongoing flooding issues. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties, and officials have urged locals to stay at home instead of walking or driving through the floodwater, which has covered streets and seeped into homes. Many cities have been distributing sandbags to residents to help combat the rising floodwaters. Flooding brought back familiar dangers for Florida residents With flooding from the rainfall deluging South Florida since Tuesday morning, footage on social media has shown water levels in the area reaching to vehicles\u2019 windows and filling up parking decks and neighborhood streets. Notably, many South Florida residents had just finished repairing their homes after\u00a0catastrophic flooding in April 2023, only to find water lapping at their doorsteps this week. In Miami, video showed stranded cars that were nearly entirely submerged under water. One area family\u2019s yard looked like a lake as belongings floated outside and were pulled from the standing water, according to CNN affiliate WSVN. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d 11-year-old Somaya Ferdinand told WSVN as she waded through thigh-high water outside her home in Northeast Miami-Dade. \u201cIt looked like a swimming pool.\u201d And in Hallandale Beach, just north of Miami, footage showed one man kayaking among cars as high waters flooded parts of the city. Some mobile home parks were underwater, said Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Michael Kane. Severe flooding there on Wednesday covered cars up to their windshields, forcing some drivers to abandon their stalled-out vehicles and wade to safety. Others had to be rescued. \u201cWe had to use our boats to rescue people standing on top of the roofs of cars,\u201d Kane told CNN. Kane\u2019s office received 175 calls for help in Hallandale Beach alone. Anna Rysedorph, a resident of the Broward County neighborhood of Edgewood, prepared for the worst as water circled her ankles in her home. \u201cI put the dogs in, I\u2019m all packed up.

{"id": "2024_06_14_tech_apple-openai-partnership", "text": "When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attended Apple\u2019s annual developer conference this week, he walked the campus, mingling with current and former executives, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Nearly an hour later, the iPhone maker announced a much-rumored partnership with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT technology to devices later this year. But Altman, who has emerged as the poster child for generative AI in the 18 months since the launch of ChatGPT, was not featured in Apple\u2019s formal presentation, neither in person or via livestream. Nor did he join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives in a private press event about privacy and security and the partnership between the two companies. \u201cI was not surprised Sam Altman did not appear on stage,\u201d said Ben Wood, an analyst at market research firm CCS Insight in an interview with CNN. \u201cApple had to manage the message carefully. OpenAI is merely the vehicle to address broader AI-powered inquiries that are not core to the Apple experience. Having him in the livestream would have only created an unnecessary level of confusion.\u201d Earlier this week, Apple showed off a handful of AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall \u2013 the majority of which are fueled by the company\u2019s own proprietary technology, called Apple Intelligence. The company will offer OpenAI\u2019s viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity, usually only when Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry. The move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continues to face concerns from researchers, industry experts and government officials around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more. The deal also comes at a time when the industry is moving quickly, and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to engage with the technology responsibly. Apple hopes that a big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales as the device has languished without a major upgrade for years and users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices as a result. An uncertain economic environment is also weighing on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was recently passed by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. In the 60 hours after Apple\u2019s Monday event, however, the company\u2019s stock price (AAPL) rose by as much as 10%, boosting Apple\u2019s market capitalization by more than $300 billion, rocketing past Nvidia and putting Apple back in contention with Microsoft for largest market value. The timing is further noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the latest buzzy technology. \u201cApple needed to deliver an AI story and Apple Intelligence should help placate nervous investors and reassure them that Apple is keeping pace with its rivals,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe partnership with ChatGPT is a major development which beefs up Apple\u2019s AI offerings, and new features like a significantly improved Siri will be welcome to users.\u201d But the partnership could also open Apple up to some vulnerability, as it has no control over OpenAI\u2019s models or what it does with user inputs. Apple alignment with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could also cause some challenges down the road. A limited partnership Although Apple has been working on its own AI program for years, a partnership with OpenAI marks a way for it to fill in the competitive gaps. When a user has a question beyond Siri\u2019s scope, ChatGPT can step in. In the demo following the keynote, Apple showed CNN how someone could upload a picture of vegetables at a farmer\u2019s market and ask what they could make for dinner. Siri may suggest that the question is better suited for ChatGPT, and provide the user with a prompt to give consent to use the service. Apple using ChatGPT as a complimentary service could potentially cut down on risks associated with the company. It\u2019s also very possible Apple could partner with other AI companies in the future too, such as Google\u2019s Gemini or more niche providers with certain expertise, such as in healthcare. \u201cI think Apple will take a pragmatic approach to the OpenAI partnership,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf Apple finds that the relationship with OpenAI starts to affect the overall user experience or worse, create challenges around security and data integrity, it might look to add further guardrails, or find other ways to deliver AI-powered content.\u201d A focus on privacy and security Apple has been vocal about how it intends to keep user data private and secure when using its own proprietary technology, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone and inputs will be kept away from a far-off server cloud. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up,\u201d he added. Apple said it will not share any personal user information with OpenAI, so inquiries made through ChatGPT won\u2019t be linked to an Apple user\u2019s account. And the repeated consent prompt to require users to opt into using ChatGPT with Siri is noteworthy too; each time Siri wants to kick over a question to ChatGPT, it\u2019ll ask for permission first. Wood believes the consent prompts and other guardrails that Apple is implementing \u201creflect its nervousness.\u201d Meanwhile, Reece Hayden, a principal analyst at ABI Research, told CNN that Apple\u2019s approach is smart because it provides customers with a choice of how to deal with their data. \u201cBy providing a phased approach that blends ChatGPT and native capabilities, users will worry less about the partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cApple can also continue to highlight their own AI capabilities and mitigate some of the risks of being associated with OpenAI, which remains in a state of flux.\u201d Industry concerns Companies like OpenAI have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but many experts, researchers and AI employees believe they should be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures. Just last week, a group of OpenAI insiders demanded that artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about the concerns over the technology they\u2019re building. So it came as no surprise when some industry watchers, including Elon Musk, were quick to react to Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI. In a post to X Monday, Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies \u2014 which include Tesla, SpaceX and X, among others \u2014 if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans. If Apple \u201cintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,\u201d Musk said that would constitute \u201can unacceptable security violation.\u201d Although concerns over how employees are using AI models is a topic of worldwide discussion at the moment across many industries, Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said Musk\u2019s reaction is a bit misdirected and the topic is not specific to iPhones. \u201cAny employee with a smartphone should follow company policies and not enter any private information into the open domain of ChatGPT,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not specific to the iPhone \u2026 or Tesla.\u201d Andrew Cornwall, senior analyst at Forrester, told CNN he thinks it\u2019s unlikely that Apple users will become loyal to ChatGPT, as many people won\u2019t use the service unless the iPhone maker can\u2019t provide an appropriate response. \u201cWhen users do query ChatGPT, Apple will track the prompts and gather metrics to improve its own models,\u201d he said. \u201cApple may switch providers or even use more than one third party \u2014 until it has mastered its own model. At that point, Apple will shut the garden gate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/tech/apple-openai-partnership/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_michael-mosley-died-unwell-greek-police-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "British TV personality and health guru Michael Mosley may have died shortly after becoming unwell while walking alone on the Greek island of Symi, local police told CNN on Monday. Mosley, a television doctor who popularized a type of intermittent fasting known as the 5:2 diet, was on vacation when he went missing on Wednesday, sparking an enormous days-long search involving the police, fire service, coast guard and volunteers. His body was found on Sunday about a two-hour walk from Agios Nikolaos beach, from where he set off on his walk. Police believe he died around 4 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) on Wednesday, the day he went missing, Greek police spokeswoman Konstantia Dimoglidou told CNN. An initial autopsy concluded that Mosley died from natural causes and that there were no injuries on his body that could have caused his death, the BBC reported. Dimoglidou told CNN that police do not believe Mosley had been sitting down for long before dying, as his time of death was similar to the length of time it would have taken for him to reach the spot. Mosley\u2019s body was found when a boat carrying the island\u2019s mayor, Lefteris Papakalodoukas, and some journalists spotted him lying face-up next to a fence about 20 meters (66 feet) above Agia Marina beach, Papakalodoukas told the Associated Press. The position in which his body was found suggests he was sitting at the time of his death, Dimoglidou said. Mosley\u2019s wife, Dr. Clare Bailey, paid tribute to her \u201cwonderful, funny, kind and brilliant\u201d husband after his body was found, saying that he \u201cdid an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn\u2019t be easily seen by the extensive search team.\u201d   His family have identified the body to police but a formal identification using DNA samples has yet to take place, Dimoglidou added. The television doctor was known for British documentary shows such as Channel 4\u2019s \u201cMichael Mosley: Who Made Britain Fat?\u201d and the BBC\u2019s \u201cTrust Me, I\u2019m A Doctor.\u201d The 67-year-old broadcaster was also a regular on talk shows such as the BBC\u2019s \u201cThe One Show\u201d and ITV\u2019s \u201cThis Morning,\u201d and was a columnist for the Daily Mail. He authored a book on the Fast 800 diet, which focuses on time-restricted eating for rapid weight loss. His wife wrote a recipe book as part of \u201cThe Fast 800\u201d book series. In 2002, Mosley was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for outstanding non-fiction special (informational) after executive producing the 2001 BBC mini-series \u201cThe Human Face,\u201d which examined the science behind facial beauty, expression and fame. The fathe- of-four deliberately infested himself with parasites to learn more about them for BBC\u2019s 2014 show \u201cInfested! Living with Parasites.\u201d Mosley\u2019s impact on public health, particularly in Britain, was evident in the tributes paid to him. Former lawmaker Tom Watson wrote on social media that Mosley \u201cwas a hero to me,\u201d and that he \u201chelped thousands of people get well and healthy. I\u2019m one of them.\u201d Meanwhile, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mosley \u201cwill be known as an extraordinary broadcaster who used his platform to influence and change the way we think about many public health issues,\u201d according to PA Media.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/michael-mosley-died-unwell-greek-police-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_middleeast_israel-catapult-trebuchet-lebanon-intl", "text": "Israeli troops have used a medieval-style catapult to toss fireballs across the border into Lebanon, as fighting ramps up between Israel and the Iran-backed Islamist group Hezbollah. The trebuchet, a rotating arm with a sling attached to launch a projectile, has rarely been used since the 16th century. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the catapult was \u201ca local initiative\u201d and had not \u201ccome into widespread use,\u201d Israeli public broadcaster and CNN affiliate Kan reported Thursday. Kan said the trebuchet was probably used to burn shrubbery, making it easier for Israeli forces to identify militants attempting to reach the border. CNN has asked the IDF for comment. A video of the catapult in action was posted on social media on Wednesday. CNN could not verify when the footage was filmed but geolocated it to the Israeli-Lebanese border. While there have been reports of catapults being used by Ukrainian demonstrators during the Euromaidan protests in 2014, and by Syrian rebels in 2013, the weapon is a relic of bygone military ages. One of the last recorded uses of a large-scale trebuchet in warfare was by the Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s against the Aztecs during the assault on Tenochtitl\u00e1n, Mexico in 1521, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. The use of trebuchets and other catapults began to dwindle after the invention of modern gunpowder artillery in the 15th century. The video comes after cross-border attacks from Lebanon led to large fires blazing through the north of Israel last week, consuming swaths of land and leading to the evacuation of residents. Cross-border attacks have spiked this month, but there has been low-intensity fighting since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, when militants killed around 1,200 people and abducted 200 others, according to Israeli officials. That prompted Israel to go to war with Hamas in Gaza, during which it has leveled much of the Strip and killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan officials. Hezbollah has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support the Palestinians in Gaza. Its military capability is believed to be far greater than that of Hamas and has grown since 2006, when it relied largely on inaccurate Soviet-era Katyusha rockets. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says his group boasts more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess 150,000 rockets, which could overwhelm Israel\u2019s defenses if an all-out war broke out. More than 53,000 Israelis have been evacuated from the north since hostilities began in October, the IDF told CNN. In Lebanon, more than 94,000 people have been displaced from the border area, according to the country\u2019s health ministry.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/middleeast/israel-catapult-trebuchet-lebanon-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_europe_france-far-right-macron-analysis-intl", "text": "Alliances brokered and canceled, leaders defenestrated and besieged, and cries of \u201cbetrayal\u201d and \u201cshame\u201d echoing across the airwaves:\u00a0It was almost Shakespearean. This week saw the wildest week France\u2019s right-wing has had in decades. The saga began Sunday night, with a stunning victory\u00a0for the far right\u00a0in European\u00a0parliamentary\u00a0elections, bagging some 40% of the vote\u00a0in France. French President Emmanuel\u00a0Macron\u00a0promptly turned the country on its head by announcing a snap\u00a0legislative\u00a0election. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to give the keys to the far right in 2027 (in France\u2019s next presidential election),\u201d he said this week in justifying his huge gamble on the surprise vote. After topping the European poll, there\u2019s been widespread speculation that\u00a0the\u00a0National Rally,\u00a0the party of far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen\u00a0and her youthful acolyte Jordan Bardella, could at least become the kingmaker of the country\u2019s next government, if not lead it, unseating Macron\u2019s own centrist bloc. Macron is safe as president until 2027, but he\u2019s facing the possibility of a government led and staffed by far-right ministers: hardly calm-inducing thoughts for him. But the far right\u2019s success has thrown the French political right off balance, with almost comic results. Within days, one leader on the right would be barricaded inside his HQ, another abandoned by all but one of his newly elected lawmakers. In the struggle for favor with the far right, the knives were out. Locked inside Fast forward to Tuesday, and\u00a0Eric\u00a0Ciotti, president of The Republicans \u2013 long the main party on France\u2019s political right \u2013 announced a surprise coalition with Le Pen\u2019s far-right party. His thinking, as outlined,\u00a0was measured: \u201cThe country has never been so right-wing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe country expects right-wing actions.\u201d The reaction from his colleagues was anything but. \u201cSelling your soul for a plate of lentils and making it look like the country\u2019s best interest,\u201d was how his\u00a0fellow\u00a0Republican Valerie Pecresse\u00a0put it. Cries of \u201cshame\u201d were slung towards him from other past and present\u00a0Republican\u00a0colleagues online. After decades in the traditional mainstream, which prided itself on the\u00a0so-called\u00a0\u201ccordon sanitaire\u201d protecting the seats of French power from the far right via tactical alliances, The Republicans, led by Ciotti, found themselves on the periphery,\u00a0winning just over\u00a07% of the vote.\u00a0\u00a0 With the far right on the rise, Ciotti saw a path to relevance. His party disagreed. In the maelstrom of outrage at his \u201cdeal with the devil\u201d (as the French President termed it), party figures called to excommunicate him from the party. His defiance will go down in French political history:\u00a0locking himself inside\u00a0the party\u2019s headquarters to try\u00a0to\u00a0stymie them. Cue a procession of party leaders marching to unseat him. Most memorable was\u00a0president of the Paris area\u2019s regional council,\u00a0theatrically rolling up her sleeves\u00a0amid\u00a0a swarm of journalists as she advanced on Ciotti\u2019s holdout. Meanwhile, francophone social media was ablaze with memes depicting police SWAT teams or hostage negotiators ousting Ciotti. The reality was a little less climactic: His colleagues found spare keys to unlock the door. By Wednesday evening, Ciotti had been\u00a0kicked out\u00a0of the party, with\u00a0its\u00a0secretary general blasting the \u201cunholy alliance\u201d with the far right,\u00a0echoing\u00a0Macron\u2019s own attack. But the now supposedly ex-leader of the party went down swinging, issuing a\u00a0press statement\u00a0in the name of\u00a0The Republicans\u00a0condemning the leadership meeting as illegitimate and \u201cwith no legal standing.\u201d \u201cI am and remain the president of our political formation, elected by our members,\u201d he posted on X, formerly Twitter. On\u00a0Thursday\u00a0morning, he tweeted\u00a0a video\u00a0of himself sitting at his desk,\u00a0overlaid with a dramatic Hollywood-esque soundtrack: an overt rejection\u00a0of\u00a0his ousting from the party. This would-be coup did the 21st\u00a0century proud: The putschists apparently had the party\u2019s X account in their grip, Ciotti loyalists the party\u2019s Facebook, the accounts posting conflicting statements as to the party\u2019s leadership. Vindication for Ciotti came Friday, as a French court ruled his ouster illegal. \u201cJustice has spoken,\u201d he said following the verdict, \u201cshe said you can\u2019t do whatever you want, you can\u2019t do DIY.\u201d Meanwhile, at stage right\u00a0\u2026 Further right on the French political spectrum, chaos was also the order of the day, often playing out on national TV screens. Spearheaded by Le Pen\u2019s niece, Executive Vice President\u00a0Marion Marechal, and former TV pundit Eric\u00a0Zemmour, the Reconquest party clung to the coattails of National Rally, taking some 5% of the European\u00a0parliamentary\u00a0election vote in France.\u00a0The party was only founded in 2021. Like Ciotti, keen to ride the far-right wave of popularity to government,\u00a0Marechal had\u00a0since Sunday\u00a0been working towards\u00a0forming\u00a0a formal partnership with her aunt\u2019s party. Zemmour seemed to disagree, his shock at Marechal\u2019s efforts clear on his face when she announced them on national TV\u00a0on Sunday night. Apparently\u00a0frustrated with his opposition, she went rogue, telling Reconquest supporters to vote for their far-right competitors. \u201cLet\u2019s put the interests of France before those of the party,\u201d she said on live TV. Zemmour was furious. Later that day, in a television interview\u00a0with BFMTV, he slammed her as a liar. \u201cShe\u2019s beaten the world record for betrayal,\u201d he said. Next, he took an axe to her ties to his party, declaring Marechal, and the newly elected three European lawmakers that supported her, exiled from the party. Zemmour now cuts a lonely figure, left with one single member of the European Parliament, a pariah even\u00a0within\u00a0the far-right. \u201cI am distressed to have to comment on these internal quarrels at a time when our country is dying, at a time when hope can finally be reborn,\u201d he lamented on X. In his statement on X, formerly Twitter, he refuted\u00a0Marechal\u2019s\u00a0accusations that he had sunk a deal with National Rally. France leaning right? In the wake of this chaos,\u00a0Wednesday ended with one party divorced from its leader after declaring an alliance and another leader left with only a single\u00a0European\u00a0lawmaker for failing to do the same. Less than two weeks out from the\u00a0legislative\u00a0election,\u00a0called for June 30,\u00a0it\u2019s unclear how much this right-wing wrangling will affect national results. Certainly, it plays well for Le Pen and\u00a0Bardella\u2019s National Rally. They are the unchallenged electoral muscle on the right and have so far managed to stay above the fray. The fact of Ciotti\u2019s endorsement, even if rejected by others in his traditionalist party, indicates how far National Rally has moved into mainstream politics. Outwardly, National Rally\u2019s transformation from extremists to ballot card favorites, for at least a substantial portion of French voters,\u00a0is complete. As the French right crumbles around them, for Le Pen\u2019s party, that may be the sweetest victory yet.

The tourist had last been seen Tuesday at a cafe in the company of two female tourists who have since left the island. No further details about the victim, including a name or hometown, were immediately available. Mathraki, which has a population of 100, is a 3.9-square-kilometer (1.2-square-mile) heavily wooded island, west of the better-known island of Corfu. This was the latest in a string of recent cases in which tourists on the Greek islands have died or gone missing. Some, if not all, had set out on hikes in very hot temperatures.

Fighters from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)\u00a0plundered the facility on Saturday stealing an ambulance among other supplies, the aid agency said. \u201cOn Saturday, MSF and the Ministry of Health suspended all activities in South Hospital, El Fasher, North Darfur, after RSF soldiers stormed the facility, opened fire, and looted it, including stealing an MSF ambulance,\u201d MSF Sudan said on social media Saturday. The hospital was the only one in the region \u201cequipped to deal with mass casualties\u201d and \u201cwas the main referral hospital for treating war-wounded.\u201d It was also one of the two hospitals in El Fasher with surgical capacity, according to MSF. As a result, patients are being moved to Paediatric and Saudi hospitals \u201cwhich were unprepared for such an influx,\u201d it added. Video posted on an apparent RSF \u201cX\u201d account shows armed men at the front gate of South Hospital. The footage was geolocated by CNN and shows at least one man firing an AK-style weapon on hospital grounds. According to MSF\u2019s statement posted on Twitter,\u00a0only ten patients and a small medical team were at the hospital\u00a0when it was attacked. Medical teams had already begun transferring patients and services to other facilities earlier in the week after intensified fighting in the region, the MSF said. Images posted to social media and verified by CNN show damaged medical equipment strewn in and around the facility. In one video, an armed man poses inside what appears to be an ambulance parked outside South Hospital. It is unclear whether the vehicle belonged to MSF. CNN has reached out to the RSF for comment. MSF said most patients and the remaining medical team, which included all MSF staff, were able to flee the violence but they are unable to say for certain if there were any casualties due to the chaos that ensued. South Hospital is the latest medical facility to fall into warring factions\u2019 crosshairs in Darfur. The medical facility had already been hit by mortar shells and bullets multiple times in the preceding weeks between May 25th\u00a0and June 3rd\u00a0resulting in two deaths and 14 injuries among patients and caretakers, according to MSF. On May 11, nearby Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital was impacted by an SAF airstrike 50 meters from the facility, per an MSF press release. Two children and a care giver in the intensive care unit were killed in the strike after a roof collapsed. \u201cIt is outrageous that the RSF opened fire inside the hospital. This is not an isolated incident, as staff and patients have endured attacks on the facility for weeks from all sides, but opening fire inside a hospital crosses a line,\u201d said MSF\u2019s Head of Emergencies Michel Lacharite, as quoted by MSF Sudan on X Saturday. \u201cWarring parties must halt attacks on medical care. Hospitals are closing. Remaining facilities can\u2019t handle mass casualties. We are trying to find solutions. The responsibility is on warring parties to spare medical facilities,\u201d Lacharite added. Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy of the EU Nabila Massrali\u00a0said on X Sunday,\u00a0\u201cThe EU is appalled by RSF-Janjaweed assault of staff at the El Fasher South Hospital in Darfur also looting it, as it did with many other hospitals in Sudan.\u201d \u201cWe remind again the [RSF] to show restraint and respect International Humanitarian Law,\u201d she added.

Heat dome to bring intense heat wave for millions Heat arrived in the eastern half of the country Friday, but it\u2019s just an appetizer of what\u2019s to come. An expansive and exceptionally strong heat dome builds Sunday over the East and expands to reach the Midwest and Great Lakes over the following days, ushering in the regions\u2019 first significant heat wave of the year. Heat domes trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. This one will make temperatures skyrocket to levels hotter than even the hottest typical summer day.

Temperatures will top out 15 to 20 degrees above normal over a huge portion of the eastern half of the country Monday afternoon, but surge even higher to reach 25 degrees above normal at times from Tuesday through Friday.

Overnight low temperatures aren\u2019t expected to drop below the low 70s or upper 60s in many locations. To make matters worse, humidity will work in tandem with extreme heat to send the heat index \u2013 how heat feels to the human body \u2013 to dangerous triple digits in parts of the East. Heat index values in the low 100s are possible as far north as Maine next week. The health risks from heat will reach extreme levels for millions next week, according to a scale from the National Weather Service and CDC. Heat is the deadliest form of weather in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. First signs of tropical trouble are brewing The Atlantic hurricane season looks ready to awaken at the same time intense summer heat bakes a significant portion of the country. There are two short-term risk areas that could produce the first tropical system of the year, and both are a little too close to the US coast for comfort. An area in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico has the highest chance to become the first tropical system. There is also a small window and a low chance the same stormy pattern driving Florida\u2019s rain could develop into a tropical depression off the Southeast coast before it gets swept out to sea this weekend. Robust tropical moisture is swirling in the southwestern Gulf because of the Central American gyre: A large, disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms that rotates over Central America and its surrounding waters. The gyre\u2019s broad spin and abundant moisture can help tropical systems form in parts of the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and even the extreme eastern Pacific Ocean when other necessary factors \u2013 including favorable upper-level winds and warm ocean water \u2013 align. That could be the case by midweek; the National Hurricane Center says there\u2019s a medium chance a tropical depression could form in the Bay of Campeche in the southwestern Gulf. Most of the Gulf of Mexico is bathtub-warm, so if a tropical system manages to form it would have plenty of fuel to strengthen. If something does form, it\u2019s likely to track north or northwest. Regardless of tropical development, a surge of moisture like the one behind the deluges in South Florida will provide much-needed wet weather to parts of Mexico that have been baking under extreme heat and brutal drought for weeks. But it will also raise the flood risk along the Gulf Coast, especially in areas soaked this spring. Multiple days of rain are heading for the Gulf Coast from Texas to Alabama starting Sunday and continuing throughout the week. Wildfire risk growing Heat isn\u2019t just making us sweat and giving hurricane season a boost \u2013 it\u2019s also had a hand in several recent notable wildfires. Fire activity is increasing gradually nationwide, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Almost a dozen large fires are burning in parts of the West and half of these started in recent days. Hot, dry conditions in place since early in the month in the West will continue to increase wildfire risk and could worsen ongoing fires. Wildfire fuels like grass and plant life will continue to dry out during this time, making them more prone to fire ignition or spread. Winds will also kick up in the region later this weekend and early next week. Gusty winds cause wildfires to spread quickly, as the Corral Fire demonstrated in California at the start of June. Breezy conditions could also spell trouble next week for a small, but destructive fire in Arizona, about 70 miles northwest of Phoenix, dubbed the Rose Fire. The fire destroyed at least 15 structures \u2013 seven of which were homes \u2013 along with at least a dozen vehicles, the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said Thursday. The fire had burned through at least 166 acres since igniting Wednesday, but was only 20% contained as of Thursday evening.

{"id": "2024_06_10_europe_france-macron-gamble-far-right-vote-intl-cmd", "text": "It was a stinging blow and a shocking parry. French President Emmanuel Macron saw his party fall into second place in European Parliament elections in France on Sunday, with the two main far-right parties together taking close to 40% of the vote. When Jordan Bardella, the leader of the far-right National Rally party, called on Macron\ufeff to dissolve the French national parliament on Sunday night, it seemed like political posturing, riding high on his victory in European polls. \u201cThe President of the Republic cannot remain deaf to the message sent by the French this evening,\u201d he told supporters. Macron called his bluff. Announcing a snap national election for the end of June, Macron has set up a showdown between his pro-European, centrist and pro-Ukrainian ideals and the anti-immigration, populist and hard-line law-and-order rhetoric of the far right. \u201cThe extreme right is both the impoverishment of the French and the downgrading of our country. So, at the end of this day, I cannot act as if nothing had happened,\u201d he told the country in a televised address Sunday. Calling the far right\u2019s bluff Macron will try to rally the right and left, urging their supporters to come together and vote against the far right, but there\u2019s no knowing if it\u2019ll pay off. The first round of voting will take place in 20 days, a tiny window in which to form a coalition from the mosaic of France\u2019s centrist and left-wing parties. There appears to be little appetite to join forces with Macron on the left, bruised after years of largely fruitless protests against his pro-business agenda, and torn apart from the inside by divisions over the war in Gaza. The last time a French president dissolved the country\u2019s lower house, the National Assembly, was in 1997. Jacques Chirac lost his majority, and the left came to power. In an interview Monday morning, French Foreign Minister Stephane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 said that Macron\u2019s Renaissance party was open to withholding candidates from contesting the seats of potential allies in other parties. S\u00e9journ\u00e9 told Radio France that the party would discuss such a move with \u201creasonable people with whom we can work.\u201d On Sunday night, the popular French far-left party France Unbowed (LFI) appeared to have already ruled itself out of such a move. \u201cIt is now clear that the country wants to turn the page on the Macron era. And this page must not be turned with the National Rally and the far right,\u201d Manon Aubry, leader of the LFI European list, which came fourth in the European vote in France, told supporters. LFI figurehead Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon said that he saw no reason to unite with other parties on the left, especially with the narrow window to form a coalition. Such a proposition by Macron\u2019s party is no doubt a sign of weakness, a far cry from Macron\u2019s 2017 landslide second-round victory over far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen \u2013 and a sign of the times, his party wounded by memories of the \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests, an unyielding Covid-19 regime, and unpopular pension reforms. Since parliamentary elections held at the beginning of his second term in 2022, Macron has been ruling without an absolute majority in parliament, ordinarily unable to pass bills with his lawmakers alone. Instead, he invoked article 49.3 of the constitution several times to push legislation through parliament without a vote. This has stoked yet more anger against Macron and further division in France, especially given the contentious nature of his hike in the pension age to 64. Dueling visions The far-right National Rally, spearheaded by Le Pen, the long-time doyenne of France\u2019s anti-immigration camp, currently holds 88 to Macron\u2019s bloc\u2019s 250 seats in the 577-seat French parliament and, in theory, the upcoming election is far from a two-horse race. The appeal of the far-right\u2019s anti-immigration stance is no doubt magnified on the European stage \u2013 where EU lawmakers have long struggled to stem illegal immigration flows. At a national level, Bardella and Le Pen will have to rely on a broader spectrum of policies, doing battle with Macron\u2019s economic record, which has mostly shielded France from the inflation woes suffered by Europe. However, it\u2019s clear that this election will be a duel between Macron and Le Pen. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire admitted Monday morning that his party held some responsibility for Sunday\u2019s results. He made his objective for the campaign clear. \u201cThis will be project against project; National Rally against ours,\u201d he told French radio network RTL. The French foreign minister described the call for elections as a \u201cbet of confidence\u201d in the French people by Macron, with the president trusting they will hold the line against political extremes. France\u2019s voting system plays in Macron\u2019s favor. In the first round of ballots, a variety of parties will compete to meet a minimum threshold of votes. The second round on July 7 will see the highest-polling candidates in each seat run off if no one wins an absolute majority. This could see voters of different stripes banding together to oppose a candidate from the far right. This mechanism also applies to the presidential election, which has ensured no far-right victory at the Elysee Palace thus far. On a more local scale, it may not be such a security. Ultimately, the June 30 and July 7 votes will determine how Macron spends his last three years in power. What comes next? What\u2019s certain is that Macron \u2013 with a presidential mandate until 2027 - will remain president no matter what. If his gamble pays off and he wins back a majority in parliament, he\u2019ll be able to move ahead with reforms and govern as he likes: changes to end-of-life care and the education system are in his crosshairs. It\u2019ll give him precious breathing space and a clear mandate for his agenda at home and abroad. In his words, \u201cIt\u2019s a time of indispensable clarification.\u201d \u201cThe rise of nationalists and demagogues is a danger not only for our nation, but also for our Europe and for France\u2019s place in Europe and the world,\u201d Macron said Sunday in his address to the nation. But the prospect of a lame-duck presidency looms large. If his bloc, currently with 250 of the 577 MPs in the National Assembly, fails to meet the 289-seat threshold for an absolute majority but remains the largest, his government will again have to wage legislative battle with one hand tied behind its back. If his nightmare comes true and the far-right movement replicates its European results on the national stage, he will be forced to appoint a prime minister from its ranks \u2013 most likely the 28-year-old Bardella, current president of National Rally. In a \u201ccohabitation,\u201d Macron would deal with international and defense issues, while Bardella would hold sway over the domestic agenda. Party figurehead Le Pen would likely wait in the wings to contest the 2027 president election against Macron\u2019s successor. The constitution prevents him running for a third term. \u201cWe are ready to be in power,\u201d she said in her Sunday night victory speech. In a country increasingly polarized by populist rhetoric, Ya\u00ebl Braun-Pivet, speaker of France\u2019s National Assembly struck a lonely note Monday morning as she called for greater cross-party cooperation. \u201cIn France we don\u2019t manage to get past partisan quarrels,\u201d she said in an interview with broadcaster France 2. Macron\u2019s reputation has been founded on bold, political moves. But if he fails to hold back the far-right this month in the coming weeks, his legacy will be the gamble that let the far right into power.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/europe/france-macron-gamble-far-right-vote-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_christ-redeemer-rio-de-janeiro-brazil-history", "text": "Think of Rio de Janeiro and the first image that comes to mind \u2013 no matter your own belief system \u2013 is probably a religious one. Perched on the Corcovado \u2013 a 2,300-foot-high granite outcrop looming above the city \u2013 the Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer) statue sweeps its arms out in a warm embrace, welcoming visitors to the city of samba. \u201cThe first thing we see when we arrive at the city\u2019s two airports is this brother of ours welcoming us with open arms,\u201d says Rio designer Gilson Martins, whose handbags have been seen on the arms of everyone from Madonna to Michelle Obama. Does he look for the statue when he arrives home after a trip abroad? No, he says \u2013 because there\u2019s no need. \u201cIt is he who finds me when I arrive in Rio.\u201d For over a century, the statue has been a symbol of Rio de Janeiro. In February 1922, architect Heitor da Silva Costa won the competition to design what sounded like a foolhardy project: an enormous statue of Jesus teetering on a high mountain peak as slim as a toothpick. It was inaugurated nine years later. Yet nearly 100 years on, the statue \u2013 98 feet high with an arm span of 92 feet \u2013 is still standing, and is today a symbol of the city, known all over the world. Is it a miracle from on high? Or a testament to the engineering prowess of the Brazilians who built it? For Paulo Vidal, architect and Rio superintendent of the Instituto do Patrim\u00f4nio Hist\u00f3rico e Art\u00edstico Nacional (Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage, or IPHAN), which approves any restoration projects, it\u2019s the latter. \u201cCivil engineering in Brazil has always been at the forefront of the world, especially in reinforced concrete construction,\u201d he says. And therein lies its secret. Although the Christ the Redeemer looks like a stone sculpture, it\u2019s actually what Vidal calls a \u201cconcrete building covered in soapstone tablets.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean the construction of it wasn\u2019t heroic, however. Turning back a \u2018sea of godlessness\u2019 The statue\u2019s genesis came from what was essentially an act of religious propaganda: a bid to turn back a post-World War I \u201csea of godlessness\u201d by installing a figure of Jesus Christ to watch over Rio, visible from anywhere in the city \u2013 an omnipresent god made stony flesh. A competition to design the statue was held and Da Silva Costa \u2013 who imagined it almost as a sun salutation, having Jesus illuminated by the dawn and ringed by a rosy \u201chalo\u201d at sunset \u2013 won the commission. It wasn\u2019t always going to be the simple figure that we see today. Initially he designed the sculpture as Christ on the road to Calvary, carrying his cross and a globe in his other hand. Luckily, with the help of artist Carlos Oswald, he switched to the more streamlined, modernist design, in which Christ\u2019s outstretched arms not only form the shape of the cross themselves, but seem to embrace the city below it. French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski collaborated on the final design, streamlining the shape even further, bringing it in line with Art Deco style that was all the rage at the time. Building such a colossal structure was always going to be difficult; building it on top of a high, perilous peak even more so. Not just because of the difficulty of construction; but also of maintenance. \u201cThe big challenge was to design a project that would withstand the weather,\u201d says Vidal, who says that the peak of Corcovado is \u201cexposed to very aggressive atmospheric conditions.\u201d What\u2019s more, this was to be a sculpture for the ages, \u201ccarefully designed to withstand the elements and to stand the test of time as a symbol of human ingenuity and devotion,\u201d says Vidal. Rio architects were already adept in concrete \u2013 the A Noite building, a city newspaper headquarters, was the highest building in Latin America when it was inaugurated in 1929. Da Silva Costa and his team used that experience, cladding the Christ\u2019s concrete core in steatite, or soapstone, which is known as an insulator, and was traditionally used as cooking pots in the state of Minas Gerais, Vidal explains. It\u2019s tough, too \u2013 a century on, the cladding is still \u201cwell preserved,\u201d he says. The team decided on a mosaic effect \u2013 invisible from far away, but adding detail for those who made the pilgrimage to see it up close. Soapstone was sourced from a quarry in Minas Gerais, chosen for its calm, gray-green hue. It was carved into small pieces \u2013 just over 1.5 inches in length and 0.2 inches thick, according to M\u00e1rcia Braga, the architect and restoration expert who led a major conservation project of the monument in 2010 \u2013 and attached to the cement \u201cbody.\u201d There are around 6 million tiles on the Christ Redeemer in total. Work began in 1926, funded mainly by the church in Rio, and on October 12, 1931, the statue was inaugurated. Today, it\u2019s part of the \u201cCarioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea\u201d UNESCO World Heritage site, established in 2012. Four years earlier, the statue had been listed by IPHAN for its historical importance. It had been declared a municipal heritage site in 1990. It\u2019s also the largest Art Deco statue in the world. Constant conservation Of course, the same ingenuity that Vidal refers to regarding its engineering has also been on full display during the past century as extreme weather batters Corcovado. The fact that a visit to the Christ the Redeemer \u2013 either taking a tiny train to the peak, or hiking up \u2013 is a must-do activity in Rio, with around 2 million visitors per year, means it\u2019s even more important to keep the statue safe. It\u2019s no easy task. \u201cConservation is a major challenge because it\u2019s exposed to very aggressive atmospheric conditions \u2013 whether that\u2019s the sun\u2019s rays, which cause the mantle and structure to expand and shrink every day, or the southwest winds that hit the statue laden with salt and sand, causing constant abrasion to the coating,\u201d explains Vidal. Then there\u2019s lightning. Rio de Janeiro is a city of storms, and this high peak attracts strikes like bees to a honeypot. Lightning rods were originally built into the statue\u2019s head to help with strikes. Vidal says that these have been expanded over the years, as storms increase in intensity. In 2021, the \u2018crown\u2019 of rods was quadrupled in size, and the earthing system was expanded. The statue has undergone a major conservation effort every decade since 1980, but Vidal says the site is \u201cconstantly\u201d monitored for any emergency maintenance that might be needed. \u201cWe know the materials, the degradation processes, the aggressive agents and the behavior of the structure,\u201d he says. The Christ has five large, covered holes for conservators to enter inside \u2013 one on top of its head, and four more on the shoulders and elbows. There are 14 smaller holes which, when open, help with air circulation, says Braga. \u201cInside the statue, you feel as if you were totally protected from the weather and environment,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is silence \u2013 it is a very strong structure, and as you are climbing to the head, the spaces to cross through get very narrow. When you finally get out on the top of the head, it is a wonderful sensation of freedom.\u201d Replacing 300,000 tiles Braga \u2013 who calls the restoration project an \u201cenormous responsibility\u201d \u2013 was 50 when she worked on the statue. \u201cI felt as if it was a great event in my professional career,\u201d she says. In a 2011 paper about the project, shared with CNN, she wrote that her team found spores from the Atlantic rainforest on the statue \u2013 making the monument even more redolent of Rio and Brazil as a whole. The bacteria were cleaned off with steam and water jets at 158 degrees Fahrenheit. The statue was also regrouted. No detail is ignored during the conservation projects, the most recent of which took place from 2020-2022. The soapstone from the original quarry has run out over the past century \u2013 \u201cthis color is increasingly difficult to find in the natural world,\u201d wrote Braga of her conservation project \u2013 so when pieces of mosaic need replacing, conservators carefully look at stone from other quarries in Minas Gerais, to try and match the original color as best as possible. During her renovation, Braga rejected 80% of the replacement tesserae, picking only those that best matched the original color. She also replaced stones that had been added in previous restorations but weren\u2019t a good color match, replacing 5% of those 6 million tesserae in total. Such herculanean efforts are worth it, says Vidal. \u201cChrist the Redeemer is an iconic image that publicizes the city and the country to the world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt attracts tourism and consequently foreign currency to the city.\u201d Gilson Martins agrees. Christ Redeemer bags are his top sellers, tied with those sporting the Sugarloaf Mountain. \u2018Like a childhood friend\u2019 For cariocas \u2013 the inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro \u2013 the Christ has become like a family member. Tom Jobin, the bossa nova grandee who composed The Girl from Ipanema, wrote of its \u201copen arms over Guanabara\u201d in his song, Samba do Avi\u00e3o. Another song was called, simply, Corcovado. \u201cDa janela, ve-se o Corcovado, O Redentor, que lindo,\u201d he wrote \u2013 \u201cFrom the window you can see Corcovado, the Redeemer, how beautiful.\u201d Martins himself has produced two art exhibitions centered around the sculpture, and has recently made an EP, singing about the statue in three of the five songs. In fact, he says, it was his childhood memories of observing the statue that inspired his songwriting. \u201cTo me, he is my brother, my friend of many years, always present in my life,\u201d he says of the Christ. \u201cThe feeling is like having a childhood friend with whom I have a lot of intimacy, and he is always there for us to talk to.\u201d Martin\u2019s deep devotion to the concrete statue is a sentiment shared by cariocas across the city. \u201cFor me, as a carioca, architect and urban planner, Christ the Redeemer is a landmark of territorial identification. If I see Christ the Redeemer I know where I am, and that I am at \u2018home,\u2019\u201d says Vidal. \u201cIn order to be sung about in music, the statue needs to be loved by the population \u2013 and it is. It welcomes and embraces residents and visitors.\u201d For Francesco Perrotta-Bosch, architecture critic and the biographer of modernist architect Lina Bo Bardi, Corcovado is \u201cthe most democratic landmark in the city.\u201d Rio de Janeiro is famously a place where great wealth and poverty live side by side, but in a sense, the sculpture unites them. \u201cYou can see it from rich neighborhoods and poor neighborhoods,\u201d he says. \u201cCariocas can observe it from the south or north zone and will have a reference to find themselves in the city. Largely due to Corcovado, Rio becomes a city with many visual elements that help a visitor not to get lost in it.\u201d \u2018Some people cry\u2019 Tourists seem as fond of the statue as locals. Deemed one of the seven modern wonders of the world, the Christ the Redeemer is Rio\u2019s most visited attraction, says tour guide Cristina Arroio. Her guests \u201cthink it\u2019s amazing. Some people are very sensitive and they cry. Some say it\u2019s a dream come true to go all the way up and be close to the statue,\u201d she says. Gilson Martins, who can see the statue from his home, calls it \u201cthe carioca host that welcomes Rio, Brazil and the world with open arms.\u201d \u201cThe atmosphere of Rio is formed by an intense energy of human warmth, relaxation, joy, lightness, sensuality, and receptivity,\u201d he says. \u201cChrist on top of Corcovado is the accomplice to all this carioca spirit. It complements all the beauty of the beaches, the Sugarloaf Mountain, the carnival, the samba dancers, and the entire carioca way of being.\u201d How fitting for laid-back, multicultural Brazil, that a sculpture built as a symbol of one religion has ended up representing the welcoming atmosphere of the entire country. Maybe that\u2019s the ultimate miracle of Christ the Redeemer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/christ-redeemer-rio-de-janeiro-brazil-history/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

Before proceedings got under way Fallon was seen larking around at the front of the audience hall, before quickly being told to get to his seat as the pope was about to walk through the door. \u201cIn the midst of so much gloomy news, immersed as we are in many social and even personal emergencies, you have the power to spread peace and smiles,\u201d the pontiff told the gathering. \u201cYou unite people, because laughter is contagious,\u201d he said, adding that he has prayed for 40 years for a good sense of humor, adding his own joke and the end, where he asked the audience to \u201cI ask you to please pray for me: for, with a smile, not against!\u201d \u2013 and was obliged with laughter from the crowd. \u201cYou manage to make people smile even while dealing with problems and events, large and small. You denounce abuses of power; you give voice to forgotten situations; you highlight abuses; you point out inappropriate behavior,\u201d Pope Francis added. The 87-year-old pontiff said that humor can overcome \u201csocial barriers\u201d and help create \u201cconnections among people.\u201d \u201cWhile communication today often generates conflict, you know how to bring together diverse and sometimes contrary realities. How much we need to learn from you!\u201d the Pope said. Pope Francis also said it was okay to \u201claugh at God\u201d in the same way \u201cwe play and joke with the people we love.\u201d After delivering his speech, Francis greeted all the comedians individually, sharing a laugh and joke with several of them, including Rock, Fallon and Colbert, as he left the audience hall. \u201cIt was great,\u201d\u00a0Whoopi Goldberg told reporters. When asked if she had again asked the pope if he would appear in \u201cSister Act 3,\u201d she said: \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was the right place to bring it up, but I\u2019ll probably send an email.\u201d Conan O\u2019Brien said afterwards: \u201cWe are all looking at each other thinking \u2018something\u2019s wrong\u2019. We are in this beautiful, beautiful space in the Vatican and for some reason they\u2019ve let comedians in which is always a mistake.\u201d A papal outreach The Pope hosted the comedians as leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) democratic advanced economies gather for a three-day summit in southern Italy, where they face thorny global issues including how to continue to support Ukraine nearly two and half years into Russia\u2019s invasion. The Pope is expected to become the first leader of the Catholic church to participate in the G7 summit later Friday, when he is slated to take part in a session dedicated to AI. US President Joe Biden, a Catholic who has a warm relationship with Francis, is among the leaders expected to be present at the gathering. Francis\u2019 meeting on Friday with\u00a0\u201cartists from the world of humor\u201d\u00a0is part of his latest attempt to engage with contemporary culture, with the Vatican explaining in a statement that the meeting underlines how the \u201cart of comedy can contribute to a more empathetic and supportive world.\u201d It follows on from his\u00a0landmark visit to the Venice Biennale\u00a0and his meeting last year with\u00a0artists and directors in the Vatican.\u00a0The meeting also comes with the pope facing\u00a0question marks\u00a0over his outreach to\u00a0LGBTQ+ Catholics\u00a0after reportedly using a homophobic slur at private meetings. Others from the US contingent included Tig Notaro, Jim Gaffigan with several Catholics among them: both Gaffigan and Colbert identify as Catholics while Fallon and O\u2019Brien were both raised in the Catholic Church.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/europe/pope-comedians-vatican-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_middleeast_israel-tactical-pause-gaza-aid-intl-hnk", "text": "The Israeli military has announced a \u201ctactical pause\u201d of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed but stressed that there would be no let up in fighting in and around Rafah in southern Gaza. The pause began on Saturday and will take place every day from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. local time until further notice to allow trucks to move from the Kerem Shalom Crossing, the main entry point for incoming aid to southern Gaza, up the Salah al-Din Road and northwards, the IDF said. Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza has triggered a humanitarian crisis. A bottleneck of aid has built up at Kerem Shalom amid airstrikes and fighting in much of southern Gaza. The IDF has designated a route from Kerem Shalom to Al Bayuk and onto the European Hospital in Khan Younis to be open during the day for the transportation of humanitarian aid only. It will be run in coordination with international organizations, it said, as part of efforts to increase volumes of aid reaching Gaza. But soon after announcing the move, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said \u201cthe fighting in Rafah continues,\u201d adding \u201cthere is no change in the entry of goods into the Strip.\u201d The fierce fighting that been underway in Rafah as Israel seeks to destroy Hamas in Gaza continued on Sunday, with a civil defense official in Gaza telling CNN that heavy clashes are ongoing in neighborhoods of western Rafah. On Saturday, eight IDF soldiers were killed near the city, one of the single deadliest incidents of the war for Israeli troops.  The\u00a0director\u00a0of\u00a0UNRWA\u00a0affairs\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza, Scott Anderson, welcomed the \u201ctactical pause,\u201d telling CNN \u201cwe very much hope that this long pause every day will allow us to move freely back and forth.\u201d But a spokesperson for the UN Children\u2019s Fund warned the pause could not replace a ceasefire. \u201cI just don\u2019t know unfortunately [how long the pause will last], this is a question for the the occupying power, for Israel and its military,\u201d said James Elder. Meanwhile, criticisms of the \u201ctactical pause\u201d by senior Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have raised the question of who ordered it. According to an Israeli official, Netanyahu was unhappy when he first heard about it. Netanyahu then contacted his military secretary and said the idea was unacceptable until he was assured the fighting in Rafah would continue, said the official who spoke to CNN on Sunday and requested anonymity. Israel\u2019s security minister Ben Gvir \u2013 a leading right-wing member of the cabinet \u2013 has also condemned the pause. \u201cWhoever decided on a \u2018tactical pause\u2019 for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,\u201d he said. Humanitarian crisis The distribution of aid announced by Israel comes as Muslims in Gaza are marking Eid al-Adha with little food. Eid ul-Adha begins on Sunday evening and ends on Thursday, June 20. Human rights groups have described \u201cunspeakable\u201d living conditions for Palestinians in Gaza following eight months of Israeli bombardment, with over 75% of the population displaced,\u00a0according\u00a0to the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). Israel\u2019s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. More than 37,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, according to figures from the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The conflict in the enclave began following the October 7 attacks led by the Palestinian militant group Hamas that killed around 1,200 people and captured 250 hostages in southern Israel. More than 50,000 children in Gaza now require treatment for acute malnutrition, UNRWA said in a post on X on Saturday. \u201cWith continued restrictions to humanitarian access, people in #Gaza continue to face desperate levels of hunger. Over 50,000 children require treatment for acute malnutrition.\u201d Last month, Israel pressed ahead with its ground operation in central Rafah,\u00a0which led hundreds of thousands of already displaced people to leave the area. Internally displaced Palestinians are estimated to be crammed into an area of 69 square kilometers\u00a0(27 square miles) \u2013 less than a fifth of the territory\u2019s area. Aid has been delivered to Gaza by land, sea and air since soon after the war began, but few entry points remain operational. Those are Kerem Shalom on Gaza\u2019s southern border and Western Erez in the north. Humanitarian agencies say that land routes are the quickest and most effective way of getting aid into Gaza at scale. But even when aid crosses into Gaza there are multiple issues with distributing it throughout Gaza, because convoys require Israeli approval, many roads are severely damaged and security is frequently challenging. Efforts to bring aid via sea have stuttered after the US military said Friday it would temporarily dismantle the\u00a0humanitarian pier it constructed off the coast of Gaza\u00a0due to heavy seas. It will be the second time in a matter of weeks that the\u00a0fragile\u00a0pier and causeway system, known as Joint Logistics over the Shore or JLOTS, has had to be moved back to the Israeli port of\u00a0Ashdod.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/middleeast/israel-tactical-pause-gaza-aid-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Princess of Wales, her husband William, their children George, Charlotte and Louis gathered together with King Charles and Queen Camilla to watch a Royal Air Force flypast. They waved and smiled at the crowd, who responded with cheers. The Princess, also known as Kate, was earlier driven in a state carriage with her children from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade to watch the celebration, known as Trooping the Colour. She could be seen wearing an Irish Guards regimental broach, a nod towards her role as their honorary colonel. The family were later seen watching events from a viewing point, while Kate\u2019s husband William, the Prince of Wales, rode on horseback. For Kate, it was her first public appearance since Christmas Day \u2013 weeks before her cancer diagnosis. Kate stepped away from public duties in January, following what Kensington Palace said at the time was surgery for a non-cancerous abdominal condition. In March, amid speculation about her wellbeing, she revealed she had been diagnosed with cancer after the operation, and was undergoing treatment. King Charles III and Queen Camilla were also taken in a carriage from Buckingham Palace, bringing cheers from the packed crowds as they made their way slowly up The Mall. The King took part riding a carriage rather than on horseback this year due to his own cancer diagnosis. People of all ages gathered along the length of the Mall for the event. Some onlookers are wearing Union Jack bucket hats and fascinators, while others are waving flags. Some sang the national anthem. Kate gave an update on her health on Friday, saying she had made \u201cgood progress\u201d in her recovery. But she said she expected her treatment to last for a few more months and was \u201cnot out of the woods yet.\u201d Trooping the Colour is the magnificent military spectacle which sees 1,400 officers and soldiers, together with 400 musicians and 200 horses, process through the streets of London from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guard\u2019s Parade, while crowds line the route. The event - one of the highlights of the royal calendar - is a tradition marking the official birthday of the British sovereign for more than 260 years. However, Charles\u2019s actual birthday is in November. Britain\u2019s Kings and Queens have doubled up on their festivities since the 18th century, holding both a public celebration \u2013 the official birthday \u2013 and a more private event on the real date. The tradition is believed to have started with the party-mad King George II in 1748. Like Charles III, George was born in November, when British weather is often far from ideal. Proving that point, the weather took a downward turn as events neared their end. Crowds waiting for the King to arrive back at the palace were lashed with heavy rain and gusts of wind. Some onlookers struggled to hold their umbrellas in place. Speaking about Kate\u2019s appearance on the balcony, David Betteridge, 66, told CNN that \u201cshe looked well so hopefully that is a good sign.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see her back actually,\u201d he added. \u201cFor the most part we stayed dry. But we got pretty wet just after the ceremony when the parade had finished. It rained very hard.\u201d Anna Yang, 30, who was visiting the UK from China on holiday, said she saw the flypast from her hotel nearby. \u201cIt was great. It\u2019s our first time, even in our own country, seeing all the national aircraft going through the sky,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIt was incredible.\u201d But anti-royalists turned out too, some of whom chanted \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cnot my king!\u201d This year\u2019s proceedings were adapted as the 75-year-old Charles continues his treatment for an unspecified form of cancer. Doctors have been encouraged by his progress, allowing him to resume public-facing duties in April, but each engagement he carries out is reviewed and adapted where appropriate. For the events on Saturday, he carried out his review of troops seated in an Ascot landau carriage alongside Queen Camilla. Three of the British Army\u2019s horses which bolted across in London in April returned to duty and took part in this weekend\u2019s birthday parade.

{"id": "travel_ethiopian-unique-calendar-year", "text": "On September 11, Ethiopians will celebrate the end of one year and the beginning of another. However, when the East African country rings in its New Year in a few months, it will technically be 2017, according to the Ethiopian calendar. So why is Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second most populous country, seven years and eight months \u201cbehind\u201d much of the rest of the world? And how does that work for Ethiopians living on an increasingly interconnected planet that mostly operates in an entirely different era? The answers lie in traditions that date back centuries \u2013 and a firm sense of national identity. Unique calendar In Ethiopia, the birth year of Jesus Christ is recognized as seven or eight years later than the Gregorian, or \u201cWestern\u201d calendar, which was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. According to experts, the Roman Church adjusted its calculation in 500 CE, while the Ethiopian Orthodox Church opted to stick to the ancient dates. Although much of the rest of the world went on to adopt the Gregorian calendar, Ethiopia has kept its own. \u201cWe are unique,\u201d says Eshetu Getachew, CEO of Rotate Ethiopia Tours And Travel. \u201cWe [were] never colonized. We have our own calendar. We have our own alphabet. We have our own cultural traditions.\u201d Thought to date back at least 1,500 years, the Ethiopian Calendar has many similarities to the Coptic calendar of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, an Oriental Orthodox Christian church based in Egypt. Following a solar-lunar system, it\u2019s 13 months long, with 12 of those months lasting for 30 days. The final month consists of just five days, or six days during a leap year. Travelers visiting Ethiopia are often stunned to learn that they\u2019ve gone \u201cback in time,\u201d with some taking to social media to express their bewilderment. As international businesses and schools based in the country tend to follow the Gregorian\u00a0calendar, many Ethiopians have little choice but to use both the traditional Ethiopian calendar and the Western calendar simultaneously. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult,\u201d Ethiopian archaeologist Goitom W. Tekle, currently based in Germany, tells CNN Travel. \u201cI still can\u2019t switch into one\u2026 It\u2019s quite a challenge. \u201cI need to think of the hours, the days. Sometimes the months, and sometimes even the year.\u201d Tekle explains that some institutions have to keep switching between the two calendars, incorporating the different dates and times, when corresponding with Ethiopians, especially those based in rural areas, and those outside the country. Even something as simple as applying for a birth certificate can pose problems when attempting to merge the Ethiopian system and the Western system. Date confusion \u201cLet\u2019s say, a baby is three years old, and you file for their birth certificate with the city or with the local government,\u201d says German historian Verena Krebs, who specializes in medieval European and African history. \u201cAnd then you state according to the Ethiopian system of time, and then you have to trust that the clerk does the conversion well. \u201cSo there are certain variables, which can then result in doubled or tripled birthdays.\u201d While she notes that this may seem unusual to those who aren\u2019t accustomed to it, it\u2019s not something that she gives much thought to anymore. \u201cYou just adapt to the system,\u201d she says. \u201cYou switch from one to the other. So you\u2019re not even actively aware anymore that this is a thing that people might find striking, because it\u2019s become so normal.\u201d Krebs also acknowledges that the traditional Ethiopian calendar isn\u2019t the only separate calendar, pointing to the ancient Egyptian calendar, where the year 2024 corresponds to the year 6266, as an example. \u201cThat is clearly a very, very different way of counting time,\u201d she says. Saudi Arabia has traditionally prioritized the Hijri calendar, made up of 12 months and 354 days, but recently approved the use of the Gregorian calendar for official dealings. Meanwhile, the Hebrew calendar is the official calendar of Israel. Krebs feels that interest in the Ethiopian calendar has increased in recent years, suggesting that this may be linked to the fact that it\u2019s \u201cvery close\u201d to the Gregorian calendar, and yet different. \u2018Logical\u2019 approach Photographer Abel Gashaw is among the many Ethiopians who have adapted to moving between both calendars relatively comfortably. However, he admits that he prefers the Ethiopian calendar, describing it as \u201cmore logical,\u201d particularly in reference to the start of the year. New Year, or Enkutatash, which translates to \u201cgift of jewels\u201d in the Ethiopian Semitic language Amharic, arrives towards the end of the rainy season. Adey Abeba, a flower indigenous to Ethiopia, blooms during this period and has become a symbol of the Ethiopian New Year. \u201cThat\u2019s like a fresh start,\u201d says Gashaw. \u201cIt\u2019s a new beginning for us\u2026 After that, the amount of rain becomes low, and everywhere you go, it\u2019s so green.\u201d He goes on to point out that having the New Year on January 1 wouldn\u2019t make any sense in Ethiopia, as the date falls during the dry season, whereas September 11 (or September 12 during a leap year,) which also marks the beginning of the Egyptian year, works well. \u201cI know it\u2019s a bad day for the world,\u201d says Gashaw, referencing the 9/11 attacks in 2001. \u201cBut the Ethiopian calendar happens annually on that day.\u201d Meanwhile, Krebs stresses that \u201cthere\u2019s no reason beyond basically the Christian appropriation of pagan holidays from the Roman Empire\u201d to suggest that the New Year should begin \u201cat the threshold between December and January.\u201d \u201cSo I think it makes much more sense, in that it often coincides with the tail end of the rainy season. It\u2019s not over yet, but it\u2019s going out,\u201d she adds. It\u2019s not just months, days and years that differ in Ethiopia. The country also runs on its own time system. 12-hour clock While most countries begin their day at midnight, Ethiopians use a 12-hour clock system that runs from dawn to dusk, beginning at 1 a.m. This means that what most people outside of the country would consider as 7 a.m., Ethiopians would class as 1 a.m. Gashaw explains that this is reflective of life in Ethiopia \u2013 the hours of daylight in the country are pretty consistent due to its proximity to the Equator \u2013 and feels like a more sensible approach. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know why the European time changes at midnight,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause everybody sleeps.\u201d Understandably, this can cause confusion, particularly for travelers visiting the country. When making appointments with international visitors, Gashaw always makes sure to clarify whether they\u2019re referring to Ethiopian timings or Western time. \u201cIf somebody says let\u2019s meet at 2 p.m. I will double-check [whether they mean morning or afternoon.]\u201d he says. \u201cAlso, when I buy a flight ticket, the airlines use the European calendar, so I double check three or four times, to understand in my time.\u201d However, even he\u2019s gotten it wrong on occasion. Gashaw once missed an exam because his university schedule was set to Western times, and he misunderstood. \u201cWhen they said 2 p.m., I thought it was in Ethiopian time, and that means in the morning,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo when I go there\u2019s nobody there. I think. \u2018Okay, the exam got canceled.\u2019\u201d Tekle suggests that there may be something of a disconnect between residents who live in more rural areas of the country and don\u2019t necessarily have to consider different timings and calendars, and those based in the cities who are regularly exposed to the Western system. Time of change? \u201cEthiopia is a very conservative Christian country where the majority of the people don\u2019t care about the rest of the world,\u201d he says, explaining that the way things are done in the Western world would be of little interest or concern to many Ethiopians, particularly those who live in the countryside. \u201cThey tell you a time\u2026 Sometimes they don\u2019t even know that there is another way of counting time.\u201d Of course, Ethiopia has made it all the way to 2024 \u2013 or 2016 depending on which system you\u2019re using \u2013 without shifting its approach to timing, changing its calendar or amending its method of counting the years. But is that likely to change in the future as more people based in rural areas of the country become connected to the rest of the world? \u201cI know that a lot of farmers nowadays already, of course, have smartphones,\u201d says Krebs, noting that this could potentially affect the way they view the Ethiopian approach to things. \u201cIt will be interesting [to see] how that plays out in the coming decades with even more connectivity and whether that will have an impact.\u201d Gashaw doesn\u2019t feel that this is a particularly pressing issue, or something that will make much of a difference to Ethiopians either way. \u201cIn my opinion, as long as there\u2019s complete months and days difference, the year coordination will not matter that much,\u201d he says. Tekle stresses that the traditional Ethiopian calendar, based on the teachings of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, isn\u2019t even the only functioning calendar in the country. It\u2019s also worth noting that Ethiopia has the third-largest Muslim population in sub-Saharan Africa. \u201cThere are at least two other calendars, to my knowledge, that work for people who use them in southern Ethiopia,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo you know, you can use a lot of other calendars.\u201d For Krebs, the notion that a country with a population of around 130 million should alter one of its long-standing traditions in the name of \u201cpracticality\u201d is difficult to champion. \u201cThere is no real reason, other than practicality, that anybody should adapt to it [the Western method of tracking time] in a globalized world,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom an outsider\u2019s perspective, I don\u2019t think that any other nation should lose their own local system, which has much more cultural significance and meaning [to them].\u201d Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified Ethiopia\u2019s location in Africa.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/ethiopian-unique-calendar-year/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_12_europe_jordan-bardella-france-far-right-profile-intl", "text": "At just 28 years old, Jordan Bardella has led the French far right to a landslide victory and humiliated\u00a0President Emmanuel\u00a0Macron\u2019s camp in the European Parliament elections. He\u2019s poised to become the next prime minister if the French president loses his gamble in the upcoming\u00a0snap election. But who is\u00a0far-right doyenne\u00a0Marine Le Pen\u2019s slick prot\u00e9g\u00e9? Bardella, the National Rally party leader, grew up\u00a0an only child\u00a0in social housing in Seine-Saint-Denis, a working-class suburb in the northeast of Paris. He joined the far-right party at 16 and then briefly attended the prestigious Sorbonne university\u00a0in the French capital\u00a0before dropping out. \u201cLike many families, many people who live in these neighborhoods, I was confronted with violence, and my mother struggled to make ends meet. The truth is that the sense of urgency that led me into politics has never left me,\u201d Bardella told\u00a0public television channel\u00a0France 2 in April. In\u00a0clinching 31% of the vote in the European parliamentary election\u00a0\u2013 a record score for the National Rally \u2013 he trounced Macron\u2019s centrist party by a wide margin. \u201cA wind of hope is sweeping across France and it\u2019s only just the beginning,\u201d he said Sunday, as he urged Macron to call a national election \u2013 a bluff the president called, with the first round of voting to take place June 30. Le Pen handpicked the young\u00a0politician to head the party in 2022 \u2013 ending a 50-year-rule by the Le Pen dynasty \u2013 and bring a fresh boost to the French populist right. Hailed as the answer to the National Rally\u2019s attempts to detoxify the party and attract a younger crowd, he helped distance the party from its founder\u00a0and Marine\u2019s father,\u00a095-year-old Holocaust-denier Jean-Marie Le Pen. While Bardella\u00a0continues to try to rid\u00a0the party of its\u00a0antisemitic\u00a0and racist overtones, the populist rhetoric remains\u00a0much\u00a0the same. \u201cWe will act by expelling delinquents, criminals and foreign Islamists who pose a threat to national security,\u201d Bardella said, as he campaigned on promises of limiting free movement of migrants and threats of mass expulsions. Entrenched in the mainstream Bardella\u2019s popularity is proof that what was once unpalatable and reserved to the fringes of French politics is now normalized and entrenched in the mainstream. Voting for the far right is no longer something to be ashamed of in\u00a0much of France. He appeals to the working class, the unemployed and young people in rural areas. On Sunday, 32% of people aged between 18-34 voted for him compared to 5% for the candidate representing Macron\u2019s party, according to an Elabe poll for BFMTV. According to\u00a0political analyst Dominique Moisi, Bardella has\u00a0galvanized a new generation of voters who worry about the future,\u00a0particularly as regards\u00a0jobs and the cost of living, and who believe France has an \u201cidentity crisis.\u201d \u201cThey (the youth) think the\u00a0world is too dangerous and they say we don\u2019t want to be inundated by migrants coming from the Middle East or Africa. We want to be at home,\u201d\u00a0said Moisi. TikTok charm offensive The selfie-taking, clean-shaven Bardella has led a successful charm offensive on TikTok with videos of him\u00a0wine tasting and\u00a0doing shots.\u00a0Even\u00a0something\u00a0as banal as\u00a0him\u00a0eating a\u00a0cereal bar\u00a0racks up thousands of views. His carefully curated social media presence makes him seem familiar and relatable to his 1.5 million followers. He\u2019s known for his videos with brutal put-downs,\u00a0such as\u00a0drinking\u00a0a beer\u00a0with a caption reading \u201cdrinking the tears of Macron fans.\u201d Far-left figurehead Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon has accused Bardella of being all bluster and no substance. \u201cWhat does Mr. Bardella want? We don\u2019t know. He says nothing. He\u2019s a good-looking guy, but what\u2019s his program? Throwing immigrants into the sea.\u201d Critics\u00a0also\u00a0point to Bardella\u2019s\u00a0short career and lack of concrete experience as well as his many absences from the European parliament, to which he was first elected in 2019. Despite his inexperience, Bardella\u2019s ability to rally people behind him was evident this week\u00a0when Eric Ciotti, the\u00a0head of The Republicans, France\u2019s traditional right-wing party, announced a surprise coalition with\u00a0the National Rally for the upcoming legislative elections. The move was immediately attacked by senior members of Ciotti\u2019s own party while Marine Le Pen welcomed the announcement calling it \u201ca brave choice.\u201d Effective political match Bardella \u2013 who dated Le Pen\u2019s niece\u00a0\u2013 has said the two politicians\u00a0have a very trusting relationship. \u201cI\u2019m a loyal, well-behaved boy and I\u2019ll always be her first supporter,\u201d he said. Le Pen, a self-described Bardella groupie, has said she\u2019s always been a great admirer of his and that\u00a0he shows great maturity. The 55-year-old has run for president three times since 2012, made it into the final runoff for the past two, and is largely expected to be a candidate in the next presidential election in 2027. The young Bardella\u2019s electoral success in the European elections look set to help boost that\u00a0ambition. These two deeply political animals, one a fixture of French political life, the other an\u00a0up-and-coming disruptor of it, appear to have found in each other a remarkably efficient political match. It\u2019s\u00a0one that threatens to bring a party long considered too far to the right to be electable to power.

The stark warning, issued at the end of the annual Group of Seven (G7) summit in Italy, comes as the United States is stepping up diplomatic efforts to convince Europe to adopt a tougher stance on China over its role in aiding Russia\u2019s military-industrial complex. \u201cChina\u2019s ongoing support for Russia\u2019s defense industrial base is enabling Russia to maintain its illegal war in Ukraine and has significant and broad-based security implications,\u201d the G7 leaders said in the communique Friday. \u201cWe call on China to cease the transfer of dual-use materials, including weapons components and equipment, that are inputs for Russia\u2019s defense sector.\u201d The leaders also threatened further actions, including sanctions, to punish Chinese entities that they say are helping Russia circumvent Western embargoes. \u201cWe will continue taking measures against actors in China and third countries that materially support Russia\u2019s war machine, including financial institutions, consistent with our legal systems, and other entities in China that facilitate Russia\u2019s acquisition of items for its defense industrial base,\u201d the joint statement said, vowing to impose \u201crestrictive measures to prevent abuse and restrict access to our financial systems.\u201d American officials have accused China of helping Russia expand military manufacturing, including through exports like semiconductors, materials and machine tools they say are enabling Moscow to ramp up production of\u00a0tanks, munitions and armored vehicles. Beijing has refuted the allegation, saying it has not provided weapons to either side and maintains tight export controls on dual use goods. The US and European Union have already slapped sanctions on Chinese companies, and this week, the US imposed fresh sanctions on China-based firms supplying semiconductors to Russia. \u201cChina does not supply weapons, but the ability to produce those weapons and the technology available to do it,\u201d US President Joe Biden said at the summit on Thursday. \u201cSo it is, in fact, helping Russia.\u201d The G7 is also taking a tougher stance on China\u2019s economic policies, especially on the issue of industrial overcapacity, vowing to take actions against \u201cunfair practices\u201d to \u201clevel the playing field and remedy ongoing harm.\u201d \u201cWe\u00a0express our concerns about China\u2019s persistent industrial targeting and comprehensive non-market policies and practices that are leading to global spillovers, market distortions and harmful overcapacity in a growing range of sectors, undermining our workers, industries, and economic resilience and security,\u201d the joint communique said. The day before the summit, the EU announced\u00a0additional tariffs on electric vehicles (EV) imported from China following a months-long investigation, over what it sees as Beijing\u2019s unfair support for companies that undercut European carmakers. Last month, the US also imposed new tariffs on $18 billion in Chinese imports across a handful of sectors deemed strategic to national security \u2013 including EVs and clean-energy products. The G7 also voiced strong opposition to what it says are China\u2019s unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion in the East and South China seas. \u201cWe continue opposing China\u2019s dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia in the South China Sea and its repeated obstruction of countries\u2019 high seas freedom of navigation,\u201d the joint statement said. \u201cWe express serious concern about the increasing use of dangerous maneuvers and water cannons against Philippine vessels.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/china/g7-accuses-china-enabling-russia-war-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "washington-earthquake-tsunami-violent-earth", "text": "A catastrophic earthquake and tsunami are inevitable for the coast of the Pacific Northwest, scientists say. Planning for that means imagining a disaster unlike anything that\u2019s ever hit the modern United States. \u201c30 or 40 years ago, we didn\u2019t even know that big earthquakes were possible in the Pacific Northwest,\u201d said Diego Melgar, a seismologist at the University of Oregon. Scientists now know the 700-mile fault called the Cascadia Subduction Zone, 100 miles off the coast of Northern California stretching north to Vancouver Island, could trigger a 9.0 magnitude earthquake followed by a tsunami, which is exactly what happened in Japan 2011. New in-depth imagery of the fault was recently reported in \u201cScience Advances.\u201d Scientists say it confirmed the subduction zone is cut into 3 to 5 segments, each with its own unique geology. When the segment of the fault off Washington\u2019s coast ruptures, it has the greatest potential of triggering a devastating earthquake. No one is ready for this. Nothing built prior to 2005 was designed to withstand the long, strong earthquake Cascadia will produce, according to Corina Allen\ufeff, the chief hazards geologist at the  Washington Geological Survey. And tsunami building codes only went into effect in 2016. \u201cWe have bridges, buildings, hospitals, schools, all of this infrastructure that is located in places where a tsunami could go,\u201d Allen said. Can these facilities survive an earthquake and tsunami that will follow? \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d \u201cWhat keeps me up at night is that I know that we\u2019re not taking the steps that we need to, as fast as we should be, to protect our people,\u201d said Yumei Wang, a senior adviser of infrastructure and risk at Portland State University.  Brick and masonry buildings are the most vulnerable in earthquakes. And Wang says wood frame buildings are particularly vulnerable to tsunami forces. \u201cYou can just imagine water pushing over a typical house,\u201d she adds. The geological record of the region indicates on average, these mega earthquake and tsunami events happen every 500 years. There is no way to predict when one will happen next, but it\u2019s expected to happen again within the next 200 years \u2013 or less It will be a long process and cost billions of dollars to retrofit existing communities, Allen said. Melgar believes the effort is well worth it. \u201cMy children might not see dividends, my grandchildren might not see dividends. We\u2019re playing a really long game if we\u2019re doing it right.\u201d. For those who live and vacation along the coastal Pacific Northwest, surviving a tsunami that comes 15 to 30 minutes after an earthquake depends on how quickly they can reach high ground. But there may be no safe place to go. \u201cIn Washington, most people who actually live in the tsunami inundation zone don\u2019t have any high ground nearby,\u201d Allen said. In that case, vertical evacuation structures built within the tsunami zone are vital. These structures helped save thousands of lives in the 2011 tsunami in Japan. Only three have been built in the Pacific Northwest, and four more are planned. But Allen estimates that 50 are needed in Washington alone. Each of the three existing structures could hold 400 to 1,000 people, reach up to 76 feet tall and vary in cost.\u00a0The most expensive, at $62 million, is the Marine Sciences Center in Oregon, Wang said.  \u201cThe foundation is deeper than the building is tall, like an iceberg. And the structure itself is a little bit like a car bumper, so that very heavy, big debris can hit it.\u201d \u201cWe know enough about building codes. We know enough about early warning. We know enough about tsunami evacuation zones that it need not be that bad,\u201d says Melgar. What is less clear is whether people are willing to invest billions of dollars to prepare for something that may not happen for 200 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a costly problem to solve,\u201d says Allen. \u201cMaybe we do have more time and we\u2019re able to put the systems in place that we need to survive this event.\u201d The problem is, nobody knows how much time remains.", "source": "http://cnn.com/washington-earthquake-tsunami-violent-earth/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_world_catan-new-engeries-game-universe-cec", "text": "For many people, games are an escape into a world of fun and fantasy. It may come as a surprise, then, that the newest edition of a popular board game deals directly with a timely issue that\u2019s not quite so fun: the climate crisis. Catan, a game about collecting and using resources such as bricks and lumber to build and expand settlements in a fictional world, turns 30 next year. While the company has since released numerous versions and expansions \u2014 and sold more than 45 million copies worldwide \u2014 its latest edition, Catan: New Energies, is one of the biggest departures for the game so far. Instead of gameplay set in pre-industrial times, New Energies is set in the 21st century, with real elements such as power plants and pollution playing a major role. In many ways, it makes sense for a game about the rapid expansion of humanity to explore the effects of the climate crisis. After all, industrialization caused it. You may not expect a game about the climate crisis to be fun \u2014 or to be backed by deep research on the intricacies of the topic. But the developers of New Energies worked hard to balance joyful play with environmental science. And they\u2019re not the first. More games are tackling the climate crisis In fact, climate change \u2014 or elements often related to it \u2014 is popping up in more games as the topic becomes increasingly prevalent in news reports and cultural conversations. The popular empire-building video game \u201cCivilization 6\u201d released an expansion titled Gathering Storm in 2019, which was almost wholly centered around climate. In Gathering Storm, players\u2019 actions such as burning coal have major repercussions \u2014 rising sea levels and more frequent natural disasters such as tornadoes \u2014 which affect gameplay. \u201cTerra Nil,\u201d a popular world-building strategy game released in 2023, sees players transform a barren wasteland into an inviting paradise through the use of technology such as wind turbines and \u201ctoxin scrubbers.\u201d This was the same year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report saying we had a very small window in which to \u201csecure a livable and sustainable future for all.\u201d \u201cClimate change is an ever-growing problem \u2026 it makes sense that the most popular media in the world would also reflect these growing challenges,\u201d Rachel Kowert, a research psychologist who specializes in games, tells CNN. This is, says Kowert, because \u201cgames reflect culture.\u201d Adding climate crisis elements to games can also make the topic more accessible, Kowert says. \u201cIt adds that element of playfulness and fun. It makes it a social activity,\u201d she says. \u201cNot many people are going to sit down and read documents on climate change, but people love Catan.\u201d Catan: New Energies rewards players for using renewable energy In New Energies, the basic gameplay of gathering resources to build settlements is the same as in the traditional version of Catan. But in this version, there are additional cards, pieces and mechanics that introduce climate crisis elements. Instead of just building roads, towns and cities, players must build fossil fuel or renewable power plants to gather energy. But their choices carry consequences. If a player builds a fossil fuel power plant, for example, the level of greenhouse gasses in the game increases \u2014 indicated on the board itself with a little marker. When this happens, the potential for climate-related events in the game, such as flooding or air pollution, also increases. These climate events can block resource production for players and therefore their ability to expand their settlements and win the game. It can also trigger the early end of the game, in which case the player with the most renewable power plants wins. Players can add green discs to the bag \u2014\u00a0which can give players using renewable energy bonuses \u2014 by building renewable power plants. This also brings down the global carbon footprint on the tracker, so fewer discs need to be removed from the bag each turn. Adding climate elements into Catan certainly makes it more complicated to play. But this also reflects the reality of our world. Even experts struggle to reach a consensus on the best solutions to mitigate climate change. The game is based on real environmental science While Catan: New Energies was released on June 14 of this year, the game has actually been in development since 2011. It started with a scenario called Oil Springs based on managing oil resources, which was pitched to the Catan team by Erik Assadourian, a researcher at the Worldwatch Institute, a sustainability think tank. In the Oil Springs scenario, players could use oil to expand more rapidly \u2014 with the added potential to cause flooding of the Catan world. \u201cAt its heart, Catan is a growth story,\u201d says Assadourian. \u201cWithout recognizing the limits to growth, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d The Oil Springs scenario, paired with WWF\u2019s 2050 climate solutions report, inspired the idea of a Catan that deals with electricity as a resource, says Benjamin Teuber, game designer and Managing Director at Catan GmbH, who created New Energies with his late father, Catan creator Klaus Teuber, who died in April 2023. When development on New Energies started in 2011\u00a0there were three renewable energy sources:\u00a0wind, water and solar. This, among other things, made it \u201cvery complicated,\u201d says Teuber. Development of the game was shelved until the Covid-19 pandemic hit, when Benjamin Teuber and his father had more free time to revisit the idea. Immediately, solutions to the original gameplay problems started presenting themselves, Teuber says. To ensure the game\u2019s climate science was still within the bounds of reality, Assadourian came on board as a consultant for New Energies toward the end of its development in 2022. He also wrote an almanac about climate at the back of the rulebook to build out the game\u2019s thematic background. \u201cYou can only do so much when you\u2019re constrained by the simplicity of game mechanics,\u201d Assadourian tells CNN. In real life, \u201cNo renewable energy power plant is going to be a minus one pollution point.\u201d Instead, Assadourian hopes the game will show people how we can transition from the current energy and economic system we\u2019re in to a sustainable and regenerative one. The first step to that is reducing energy use. Even the physical materials for New Energies were chosen with the climate in mind. \u201cWhen you\u2019re creating a physical consumer product, it\u2019s impossible to have no impact, but we focused on how we can lessen the environmental impact,\u201d says Kelli Schmitz, the Director of Brand Development at Catan Studio. \u201cThe English printing of New Energies is printed and assembled in the United States using cardboard and wood from sustainable sources.\u201d Its makers hope the game will inspire people to act Before the design of New Energies wrapped in December 2022, outside playtesters were asked to provide feedback on the game. After all, it wouldn\u2019t work if the game was too complex or not fun to play. \u201cPeople liked it because nobody felt that we pushed our opinion on them,\u201d says Teuber. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Oh, I can actually grow quite well with fossil (fuels). Do I like this? I don\u2019t know.\u2019 \u201cWe wanted to really make this feel like a simulation, if you will, of reality. And for that reason, it\u2019s important that you can win with fossil (fuel) energy. It would be bad, I think, if we just balanced it in a way that it\u2019s impossible because then you give the wrong message \u2014 you don\u2019t give the message of reality. The more real it feels, the more serious people will talk about it.\u201d Many of the playtesters had to question their morality and make decisions based on it, says Teuber. \u201cThey said, \u2018It\u2019s fascinating, because I really wasn\u2019t sure what to do. I had this moral thing, but I wanted to win the game.\u2019\u201d In real life, almost everyone has an opinion on what we could do as a society to reduce the effects of the climate crisis. But few of us are in a position to make changes on a global scale. Having the power to improve the health of the planet, even in a board game, can be empowering. \u201cThe fun thing about games is there\u2019s enough detachment that you can engage with this big, scary concept in this big, varied space,\u201d says Kowert, the research psychologist. \u201cAnd then maybe at the end of it, come out with a greater understanding of what you can actually do, what power you have.\u201d If players come away from New Energies having philosophical discussions about our climate and trying to make little changes in their lives, the game will have done its job, says Teuber. \u201cThe game itself won\u2019t change the world, but it maybe enables you a little bit in thinking, \u2018Oh, I maybe have more power to make things change.\u2019\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/world/catan-new-engeries-game-universe-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a sign of the \u201cZeitenwende,\u201d or \u201cchanging of the times,\u201d that Germany is\u00a0undergoing in the wake of the Ukraine war, the country is actively seeking to increase the prestige of its military. Germany has for decades felt uncomfortable over such pageantry given the role of its soldiers in World War II and the Holocaust. But a\u00a0bill to introduce an annual national Veterans\u2019 Day was voted in on April 25 after being approved by nearly all parties in the German parliament. Only the far-left Die Linke party raised objections.\u00a0Party co-chairman Ates G\u00fcrpinar implied this was due to the party\u2019s pacifist stance. \u201cWe on the left reject this Veterans\u2019 Day,\u201d\u00a0he told CNN in a statement.\u00a0\u201cIt is based on cheap symbolic politics and at the same time ensures the minister of defense\u2019s promise of war-readiness.\u201d\u00a0 The new legislation states that the day should be celebrated \u201cpublicly and visibly\u201d every year on June 15.\u00a0It\u00a0also\u00a0mandates improvements to services providing mental and physical care for veterans, including rehabilitation and therapy. The commemorations, modeled on Armed Forces Day in the UK and Veterans Day in the US, will honor all Germans who have worn military uniform \u2013 not only those wounded or killed in combat.\u00a0Germany has around 10 million veterans, according to its ministry of defense.\u00a0 Defense Minister Boris Pistorius described the move as a \u201cstrong, important and, yes, an overdue signal of recognition and appreciation.\u201d During the Cold War, Soviet-occupied East Germany celebrated its National People\u2019s Army with military parades. An equivalent was never established in the West. Following the end of World War II,\u00a0the first combat mission in which\u00a0German soldiers took part was the Kosovo War in the late 1990s.\u00a0Since then\u00a0the most significant deployments of\u00a0the\u00a0German armed forces, or Bundeswehr,\u00a0have been in Afghanistan and Mali. But the biggest spur to creating a Veterans\u2019\u00a0Day has been Ukraine. Germany was initially reluctant to send heavy weaponry to Kyiv for fear of becoming directly involved in the war, but eventually bowed to international pressure. Now, Berlin is the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine. \u201cThe war against Ukraine has created the need for a significant build-up of the Bundeswehr (armed forces), increased spending and also recruitment,\u201d Johannes Kiess, a sociologist at the University of Leipzig, told CNN.\u00a0It was\u00a0an opportunity, he\u00a0added,\u00a0that made it appear appropriate to upgrade the military \u201csymbolically\u201d as well. A relationship of respect This Saturday, the day will be marked with an event in Berlin. From next year, commemorations will take place nationwide. Johannes Arlt, a former soldier who was deployed four times to Afghanistan and three times to Mali from 2014 to 2019, is now a lawmaker for the ruling center-left Social Democrats (SPD). He played a prominent role in forming the new Veterans\u2019\u00a0Day bill. Speaking to CNN, Arlt said he\u00a0experienced first-hand the lack of recognition of the Bundeswehr in German society, particularly for deployments abroad, but acknowledged that this appears to have changed in recent times. \u201cFor a long time, there appeared to be a sparse interest in people who served abroad, and there used to be little empathy, but we find that the population now has a great deal of respect for the Bundeswehr.\u201d Arlt explains he believes a Veterans\u2019\u00a0Day in Germany is important to \u201ccommemorate military service \u2013 in all its facets \u2013 and thank the men and women who are committed to security in our country.\u201d Arlt said he experienced horrors during his military service abroad that he would not wish anyone to witness. \u201cI had my worst experiences in Mali in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cI flew a drone and saw all the things that others didn\u2019t see on the front line. I was also present at massacres and had to watch these things and couldn\u2019t do anything. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.\u201d Mental health support leaves \u2018room for improvement\u2019 Part of the reason for the move is to improve the health services offered to soldiers returning from assignments overseas, as well as\u00a0to\u00a0raise awareness of what they have to endure. Army veteran Andreas Eggert served in the Bundeswehr from 1999-2013, first in Kosovo and then in Afghanistan. He was diagnosed with PTSD in 2013 and went into rehabilitation in 2014. He is welcoming the efforts to improve aftercare for soldiers, many of whom are left with physical or psychological damage. \u201cMental illness was still frowned upon in my time, especially if you were in a specialized assignment like I was, it was difficult to deal with it openly,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut I did it back then, in 2013, I spoke out it openly and was criticized a lot for it.\u201d Eggert says that he has seen the Bundeswehr\u2019s rehabilitation programs improve over the years, but there is still work to be done. \u201c[The programs] are not optimal, and the care is not optimal either. There are not enough therapists, especially not in the Bundeswehr. The Bundeswehr hospitals that do a good job are often overstretched\u2026 There is a lot of room for improvement.\u201d Regardless of the debate around marking Veterans\u2019 Day,\u00a0it is clear the country has had to adapt its anti-militaristic stance in recent years. Pistorius has previously warned that Germany needs to prepare for a worst-case scenario regarding the specter\u00a0of war in Europe. He has also not ruled out introducing some form of military conscription. For now, though, the soldiers CNN spoke to were simply grateful for the acknowledgment. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as a hero, quite the opposite, but what I have missed is a time or even a day when we can also remember those who have fallen during their assignments,\u201d\u00a0said 42-year-old Stefan Huss, an active soldier who twice served in Afghanistan. He added: \u201cWe have been fighting for this for a long time.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/europe/germany-first-veterans-day-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, all of whom have important trading relationships with Russia as members of the BRICS economic group, attended the weekend meeting but did not agree to sign the joint statement. The document reaffirmed the signatories commitment to \u201crefraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all states, including Ukraine, within their internationally recognized borders.\u201d Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists at a news conference alongside the leaders of the European Union, Ghana, Canada, Chile and Switzerland that it was \u201cimportant that all participants of this summit support this Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity because there is will be no lasting peace without territorial integrity.\u201d More than 100 countries and organizations gathered at an idyllic lakeside resort near Lucerne to drum up support for the 10-point peace plan Zelensky first outlined late in 2022. That formula includes demands for a cessation of hostilities, the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian soil and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s pre-war borders with Russia \u2013 terms Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to ever agree to. Among the high-level dignitaries in attendance were the leaders of Argentina, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. US Vice President Kamala Harris was also in attendance and used the occasion to announce a $1.5 billion aid package that would go toward humanitarian expenditures and help Kyiv rebuilt its battered infrastructure. \u201cThis high level attendance shows one thing. The world cares deeply about the war provoked by Russia\u2019s aggression,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. Despite the strong showing among Western democracies, there had been questions ahead of the event as to just how much could be accomplished given that neither Russia nor China, whose increasingly close trading relationship with Moscow has helped the Kremlin survive Western sanctions, were attending. The communique published on Sunday said that signatories had struck several other agreements. Among them were the principle that Ukraine to should be allowed its own nuclear power plants \u2013 including the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant \u2013 and that the Kremlin refrain from both the use of and the threat of using nuclear weapons. The sides also said that all children and civilians that were unlawfully displaced must be returned to Ukraine. On Friday, the day before the summit was set to kick off,\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin restated the Kremlin\u2019s own peace plan, which calls for Ukrainian troops withdraw from four southern and eastern regions of Ukrainian territory that Moscow said it would annex in violation of international law and demands Kyiv abandon its bid to join\u00a0NATO. While Russian forces have made modest gains in two of the regions \u2013 Donetsk and Luhansk \u2013 in recent months, they are far from occupying all four, which include Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who traveled with Harris to Switzerland, told reporters at the summit that Putin\u2019s framework \u201cdefies basic morality.\u201d \u201cHe (Putin) said, not only does Ukraine have to give up the territory Russia currently occupies, but Ukraine has to leave additional sovereign Ukrainian territory before Russia will negotiate. And Ukraine must disarm so that is vulnerable to future Russian aggression down the road. No responsible nation could say that is a reasonable basis for peace,\u201d Sullivan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/europe/ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

As the heat of summer gathers, hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are contending with a crisis in sanitation. Ismail Zayda, who lives in Gaza City in the north, told CNN that water supplies had been cut off for nine months. \u201cThe municipalities are not working, and waste in large piles is on our doorsteps and on the roads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeing large quantities of flying insects for the first time\u2026 Frankly, we have insects that we see for the first time and we do not know their names, and they sting our bodies and the bodies of our children.\u201d Israel\u2019s relentless bombardment of Gaza \u2013 launched in the wake of the October 7 attacks \u2013 is now into its eighth month and has triggered a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Human rights groups have repeatedly sounded the alarm over \u201cunspeakable\u201d living conditions for Palestinians, as Israel\u2019s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. There is little sign of a resolution to the protracted and bloody conflict. A US-backed ceasefire plan was overwhelmingly approved by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) this week. But neither side has accepted it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly stated that he will continue until Hamas is destroyed and the remaining hostages are freed. In an assessment this week, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stated that in Deir al Balah in central Gaza, where thousands of displaced are sheltering, families say that shelters are overcrowded. They have reported a range of health issues, such as hepatitis A, skin diseases, and respiratory illnesses and say that access to water is also critically low. At one displacement site, the average amount of water available per day was less than one liter per person, well below the internationally recognized minimum requirement for survival of three litres per day, according to OCHA. A safe water supply is essential not just for drinking and cooking, but to prevent the spread of disease. OCHA reported this week that more than two-thirds of water and sanitation facilities and infrastructure in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged due to the conflict. It added many other facilities are out of service due to challenges including \u201cinsecurity, access impediments, and lack of power and fuel to operate generators.\u201d OCHA said that people\u2019s coping mechanisms are \u201cheavily stretched,\u201d with the most vulnerable collecting water from unreliable sources in inadequate containers, while lacking basic hygiene items like soap. The average high temperature in Gaza in the coming week is expected to be in the low 30 degrees celsius, with warmer weather likely to worsen what is already a crisis in sanitation. Roads \u2018full of sewage\u2019 Zayda, the Gaza City resident, told how an out-of-service swimming pool in his had become a magnet for insects. \u201cDuring the day, flies come, and at night, mosquitoes spread\u2026 We light fires at night and burn garbage until the flying insects disappear.\u201d Zayda spends much of the day wearing a mask, partly because some vehicles run on burned frying oil as an alternative to diesel, making breathing difficult. \u201cThe roads are full of sewage running through the streets, waste and rubble from the bombing,\u201d he said. The treatment of sewage amid damage to infrastructure and a lack of fuel has become an enduring problem in Gaza. Carl Skau, Deputy Executive Director of the World Food Programme, said after a tour of Gaza this week\u00a0that a million people have been pushed out of Rafah and are now \u201ctrapped\u201d in a \u201chighly congested area along the beach in the burning summer heat.\u201d \u201cWe drove through rivers of sewage,\u201d he said. According to the OCHA, the delivery of some fuel supplies has helped reduce the level of accumulated wastewater in the Sheikh Radwan area in Gaza City, but \u201cthe lack of a steady flow of fuel creates a continued risk of sewage overflow into neighbouring areas.\u201d Assem Al-Nabih, media officer for the Gaza City Municipality, told CNN there is now \u201ca leakage of large quantities of sewage in various parts of the city and also into the sea.\u201d \u201cThere is significant damage to the sewer lines and sewage pumps, this has led to the leakage of sewage and wastewater throughout the city.\u201d He estimated that more than 4 kilometers of water pipelines had been destroyed or damaged, an immense stretch to repair in the middle of a war. According to assessments by UN agencies and partner organizations published in the last week, 67% of water and sanitation facilities and infrastructure in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged due to conflict. There are sporadic efforts to repair infrastructure. The Coastal Municipalities Water Utility, in partnership with the International Committee of the Red Cross, has restored several wells in Khan Younis, Deir Al Balah and Nuseirat. But the scale of the task, without a ceasefire and with limited fuel supplies and equipment, is far beyond the capability of local authorities in Gaza.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/middleeast/gaza-health-crisis-mosquitoes-sewage-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_europe_meloni-macron-italy-france-abortion-g7-intl", "text": "The crowning document from a meeting of G7 leaders in Italy has been released with a veiled reference to abortion after French President Emmanuel Macron clashed with Italy\u2019s prime minister over the specific language to include on abortion rights. The Group of Seven\u2019s summit declaration on Friday referred to \u201ccomprehensive sexual and reproductive health and rights for all\u201d but did not include the word\u00a0\u201cabortion\u201d itself \u2013 a contrast to the group\u2019s previous communique, released after the 2023 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, which called explicitly for \u201caccess to safe and legal abortion and post abortion care.\u201d American officials said US President Joe Biden pushed to keep in language about reproductive rights after the summit host, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia\u00a0Meloni, sought to strip some language from the document. Friday\u2019s communique appeared to be a diplomatic solution, with the statement endorsing the Hiroshima text without reproducing it. The document emphasizes the seven nations\u2019 \u201ccommitments in the Hiroshima Leaders\u2019 Communiqu\u00e9 to universal access to adequate,\u00a0affordable, and quality health services for women, including comprehensive sexual and reproductive\u00a0health and rights for all,\u201d the communique reads. The annual gathering\u2019s communique sets out the bloc\u2019s values and agenda for the year ahead. Several previous summits\u2019 communiques have also stopped short of using the word \u201cabortion,\u201d calling instead for access to sexual and reproductive health services. \u2018I regret it, but I respect it\u2019 Negotiations over this year\u2019s language caused a public clash on the sidelines of the summit between Meloni and Macron. Asked by an Italian journalist on Thursday how he felt about a G7 statement \u201cwithout the word abortion,\u201d Macron said he regretted Rome\u2019s position. \u201cFrance shares this vision of equality between men and women. It is not a vision that is shared by all the political spectrum. I regret it but I respect it because it was the sovereign choice of your people,\u201d he said. France intends to \u201cdefend with force\u201d the right to abortion, he added. Meloni defended her conservative government\u2019s position on Thursday, and accused Macron of playing politics, days after he called\u00a0snap parliamentary elections\u00a0in France for later this month. \u201cThere is no reason to argue about issues on which we have already agreed for some time. I believe it is profoundly wrong, in difficult times like these, to campaign using a precious forum like the G7,\u201d Meloni told reporters Thursday. The bloc has used the past two summits primarily to stress its support for Ukraine as the country tries to repel Russia\u2019s invasion and show it remains undivided in the face of resurgent global threats. But, coming swiftly after European parliamentary elections which saw far-right parties make gains in several countries \u2013 and ahead of the United States presidential election in November \u2013 national political issues have intruded on this summit more than in previous years. Biden, who has made protecting abortion rights a centerpiece of his reelection bid, had pushed to ensure that an endorsement of the Hiroshima statement would be in the communique, according to US officials on Thursday. \u201cThe president felt very strongly that we need to have at the very least the language that references what we did in Hiroshima on women\u2019s health and reproductive rights,\u201d a senior US administration official said. The issue of abortion has become particularly febrile in the US since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a decision made possible by a solid six-member conservative majority, including three judges nominated by former President Donald Trump. In Italy, however, where Meloni\u2019s conservative platform helped propel her party to power in 2022, she has largely toed the G7\u2019s line on geopolitical issues \u2013 while pushing hard-right policies domestically. She has previously called abortion a \u201ctragedy,\u201d surrogacy \u201cinhuman\u201d and has removed lesbian mothers\u2019 names from their children\u2019s birth certificates. Francesco Lollobrigida, Meloni\u2019s brother-in-law, informal spokesman and Italy\u2019s agriculture minister, suggested the reason Meloni feels so strongly about this issue was because the Pope has been present at the summit. The clash between Meloni and Macron comes after France in March became the world\u2019s first country to enshrine abortion rights in its constitution, the culmination of an effort which began in direct response to the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision to roll back abortion rights in America. \u201cFrance integrated this right of women to an abortion, the freedom to have control over one\u2019s body within this institution. The same sensibility is not shared in your country today,\u201d Macron said at the summit.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/europe/meloni-macron-italy-france-abortion-g7-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

The prisoner swap was mediated by Oman, the country\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. \u201cOmani efforts resulted in the two sides agreeing on a mutual release, as those released were transferred from Tehran and Stockholm,\u201d it said. Sweden had freed convicted former Iranian official Hamid Noury, Iran\u2019s top human rights official said on X. Noury, who had been convicted for his part in a mass execution of political prisoners in Iran in 1988, would be back in Iran in a few hours, the official added.

Strange men began to approach her in the street and warn she didn\u2019t have long to live, she said. She tried moving to a relative\u2019s house, but noticed that she was being followed on the way. When that rival party won the municipal elections two weeks ago, Norma decided to leave town, she said, fearing that she would be further targeted. \u201cAfter the vote, it got ugly in my city,\u201d she said. CNN is using only\u00a0her first name due to concerns for her safety. CNN met Norma on a dusty road in southern Arizona, just moments after she and her three children\u00a0\u2013 13, 8 and 2 years old \u2013 climbed across the low fence that separates Mexico from the United States. They are among several migrant families on the border who told CNN\u00a0they were fleeing the fallout of Mexico\u2019s bloody national elections, which saw dozens of political candidates assassinated and hundreds threatened on the campaign trail. All said they hoped for asylum from the US government. And all said they had not heard of a new executive order by US President Joe Biden blocking asylum requests from most people illegally crossing the southern border during periods of high volume. A few miles east along the border, CNN met several more Mexican families who had been sheltering for days in a tent erected by a local humanitarian group. Bottles of water had been left out for them, along with signs warning to wait for Border Patrol agents to show up, rather than attempt to walk any further\u00a0under the hot sun. Some were fleeing general violence, a lack of jobs, kidnapping threats made to their families.\u00a0Two men with a family sitting on the ground in the stifling heat said they too had fled Mexico following the elections. They had received threats for supporting the wrong candidate in their town, one said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t vote for the candidate \u2013 they were forcing us to.\u201d A wave of political killings and threats US officials have been keeping watch for new migration surges this summer. The violence surrounding Mexico\u2019s election this month is just one of many factors pushing some families to try to cross the border. \u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about elections in Mexico or here in the US, it always provokes a level of uncertainty with everyone, generally, but especially in the migrant population,\u201d a Homeland Security official previously told CNN. The June 2 vote was the biggest and most violent\u00a0in Mexico\u2019s history. With 20,000 electoral positions up for grabs, the scale of bloodshed committed by those attempting to influence the vote was massive; at least\u00a034 political candidates assassinated by criminal organizations during the campaign season. A May 28 report by research group Integralia identified 749 victims of political violence in Mexico, including 231 killings. Hundreds of candidates reported being threatened,\u00a0and many dropped out of their races, fearing for their lives. Intimidation was particularly pervasive in local-level elections, experts told CNN, where races could hand the winners broad control over small communities\u2019 police and fiscal resources. \u201cThe violence and threats were being done specifically to have the impact of saying that this party or these people or this group \u2013 whatever it may be \u2013 is in control here. To create that environment of fear,\u201d said Carin Zissis, a Mexico expert and editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council\u2019s website. Zissis told CNN she was not surprised political violence might be displacing some Mexicans from their homes today, given a broader security crisis in the country, where the\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is one of the highest in the world. Hundreds of people faced threats during the election campaign, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking the candidates themselves, politicians in the parties, officials in the parties, violence against family members of candidates. So you can imagine that the issue of violence in general in Mexico \u2013 which is potentially getting people to leave their communities and flee \u2013 this could overlap with political violence as well,\u201d she said. Even while ballots were being counted, the attacks continued. One mayor, Yolanda S\u00e1nchez Figueroa of Cotija in Michoac\u00e1n state,\u00a0was assassinated the day after the election, while she was walking from a gym back to her house with her bodyguard. Both were\u00a0shot\u00a0dead\u00a0by people in a white van, the state attorney general said in a statement. US-Mexico cooperation on border control Mexico has worked closely with the US to ease\u00a0migratory pressure at the border, with multiple state agencies working to block or redirect asylum-seekers from around the world away from the US-Mexico border. But conditions at home appear to be pushing some Mexican citizens to join the northward flow. Salvador Guerrero, director of the Alaide Foppa Refugee Legal Clinic in Mexico City, said he worries the government\u2019s commitment to serving as a migration buffer for its northern neighbor has siphoned away resources and attention from interior security work. \u201cFor example, the National Guard was created to protect Mexico,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut for each criminal that the National Guard present to a judge, there are 80 migrants that they also present to relocate people\u00a0from the north to the south,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, impunity reigns in Mexico, where in addition to the high homicide rate, more than 100,000 people have gone missing\u00a0with no explanation of their fate. According to think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua,\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved in\u00a02022. And while outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s social welfare programs have lifted many Mexicans out of poverty, the erosion of democratic guardrails and institutions under his watch are piling pressure on those who find themselves on the wrong side politically. High on Lopez Obrador\u2019s agenda before he leaves office is a list of reforms, many of which are expected to have a weakening effect on the day-in, day-out work of democratic institutions in the country, pointed out Zissis, the AS/COA editor. These include eliminating proportional representation of legislators, gutting of autonomous regulatory agencies, and direct election of Supreme Court justices. The ruling Morena party says such\u00a0measures are designed to create a more direct democracy, but critics say they will erode\u00a0checks and balances in the government. \u201cThese may seem like tedious questions but they have a real impact on the country\u2019s democracy and the ability of opposition parties to still have a voice,\u201d Zissis said. President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum will begin her presidency on October 1. Widely seen as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Lopez Obrador, whether she will continue in his footprints on security, border control and government reform are key questions amid historic levels of migration through North America. Sent back with little fanfare To reach Arizona, Norma\u2019s family took a flight to Hermosillo, and then a truck to a frontier town in the scorching Sonoran desert before eventually crossing the border on foot. She said they walked through dry scrub and mesquite trees for about 20 minutes before reaching a ditch filled with the\u00a0abandoned water bottles, diapers, ID cards and clothing \u2013 left\u00a0by the hundreds of migrants who had already reached the land of the free. Her children were protective as Norma stopped to chat with CNN, her 13-year-old worried that\u00a0people in Mexico would see her mother\u2019s picture on television. Even the two-year-old hugged her leg and pulled at her shirt, trying to hurry her along. \u201cMama,\u201d the toddler squeaked. \u201cVamos.\u201d But the tent at the end of the road would be a long walk for little legs. The temperature was 111 degrees Fahrenheit (43.8 Celsius). They would find no food, water, or air conditioning there \u2013 just dozens of other dazed looking families sprawled on the floor, waiting to be apprehended so that they could tell someone why they were there. For most people crossing that border\u00a0illegally\u00a0today, requesting asylum is no longer an option, no matter what their circumstances. US President Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0proclamation\u00a0bars migrants who cross the border illegally from seeking asylum once a daily threshold of illegal crossings is met. Though asylum seekers can still use a Customs and Border Protection app to request an appointment to present their asylum claim at a port of entry. It\u2019s a controversial measure. Critics argue the change\u00a0doesn\u2019t go far enough\u00a0in stemming the vast numbers of people entering the country that far exceeds the capacity of US immigration systems. Immigrant\u00a0rights advocates warn closing the\u00a0border\u00a0to\u00a0asylum\u00a0seekers\u00a0endangers\u00a0vulnerable people\u00a0and ultimately makes the\u00a0border\u00a0less safe. Norma and her kids were detained by Border Patrol on Friday after entering the US.\u00a0By Monday, they had been deported to Mexico, where she says they are afraid to leave the house, and her kids are not going to school. They were treated with respect by the US agents, she told CNN, who swabbed them for DNA \u2013 likely to ensure that the children were really hers. But she never got a chance to explain what she was running from, she said. \u201cThey just said that wasn\u2019t an option,\u201d she told CNN on Monday, speaking on the phone from her home in Mexico.

Authorities identified the suspect only by his last name, Cui, who was describes as a 55-year-old man from the city\u2019s Longtan District. Police said he \u201ccollided with a foreigner while walking\u201d in Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in the city center. The suspect then stabbed the instructors, as well as a Chinese tourist who stepped forward and tried to stop him during the incident, police said in a statement. Police said they received the call around 11:49 a.m. local time Monday, after which they dispatched officers to the scene and transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. The injured \u201chave all received proper medical treatment and are not in danger \u2026\u201d police said earlier. The educators from Cornell College, a private liberal arts college\u00a0in Mount Vernon, Iowa, were wounded \u201cin a serious incident\u201d\u00a0on Monday, while participating in a partnership program with Beihua University in Jilin, according to the college. \u201cWe have been in contact with all four instructors and are assisting them during this time,\u201d Cornell College President Jonathan Brand said in a statement, adding no students took part in the program. Footage purportedly showing the aftermath of the daylight attack emerged on Chinese social media on Monday but was swiftly censored. It showed two men and a woman lying on the ground covered in large blood stains, surrounded by onlookers. They appeared conscious and were talking on their cell phones, the video showed. CNN geolocated the video to Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in Jilin city center, less than half an hour\u2019s drive from Beihua University. Monday was a public holiday in China. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry confirmed Tuesday that \u201cfour foreign teachers at Beihua University were attacked\u201d while visiting the park Monday morning \u2013 adding they were immediately taken to the hospital and did not suffer life-threatening injuries. Iowa state Rep. Adam Zabner told CNN his brother, David Zabner, was one of the victims of the stabbing. Zabner said his brother, who was on his second visit to China with Cornell, is \u201cdoing well\u201d and has \u201cbeen stitched up and seems to be recovering,\u201d after speaking to him on Tuesday morning Beijing time. The other three victims survived the attack, Adam Zabner said, adding he could not comment on their health status. \u201cI\u2019m just extremely grateful that my brother is OK and that he survived this attack,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe hope of my family is to get my brother back home as soon as possible and get them healthy. And we really just want to thank the US State Department for all their help, and also our federal delegation from Iowa who have been particularly helpful.\u201d The US State Department said it was aware of reports of a stabbing incident in China and is monitoring the situation. \u2018Horrifying attack\u2019 Knife attacks are not uncommon in China, where guns are tightly controlled. The country has faced a spate of stabbing rampages in public places including schools and hospitals. But public attacks against foreigners are rare. The attack in Jilin comes as China has been seeking to draw back international visitors following three years of stringent Covid-19 border controls. It also comes amid efforts to boost educational exchanges with the United States as the two countries look to stabilize their fraught relationship. The incident has drawn attention and concern in Iowa from officials and lawmakers. Gov. Kim Reynolds called it a \u201chorrifying attack.\u201d US Rep. Ashley Hinson, who represents the district where Cornell College is located, said the college employees \u201cwere brutally stabbed\u201d and vowed to \u201cdo everything in our power to bring these Iowans home safely.\u201d On China\u2019s heavily censored social media, visuals and discussions about the attack had been swiftly erased since Monday. Censorship appeared to have relaxed somewhat by noon Tuesday to allow some comments to surface. Some Chinese internet users called it a \u201cterrible\u201d incident, while others questioned why Chinese media was not reporting on the attack. Some also expressed concerns about its potential impact on China\u2019s global image and the willingness of foreigners to visit the country, amid a rise in nationalism and anti-American sentiment. At its news conference Tuesday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry sought to dismiss concerns that the attack would affect educational exchanges between China and the US. \u201cCarrying out people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and the United States is in the common interests of both sides and has received active support and response from various sectors in both countries,\u201d said Lin, the spokesperson. \u201cChina is widely recognized as one of the safest countries in the world. China has always taken effective measures and will continue to take relevant measures to effectively protect the safety of all foreigners in China.\u201d Study ties Cornell College began a partnership with Beihua University in 2018, which would see the Chinese institution provide funding for educators from the Iowa school to travel and live in China and teach a portion of a course in areas of computer science, math and physics over two-week periods, according to information posted on the college website at the time. China has been trying to boost its educational cooperation with the US, which has suffered considerable setbacks due to the Covid pandemic and bilateral tensions. During a visit to the US in November, Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced the country would invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years to foster personal ties between the two countries. The Chinese leader noted his own enduring ties to the state of Iowa in his announcement. Xi stayed with a host family in Iowa during his first visit to the US nearly four decades ago, an experience he has described as \u201cunforgettable.\u201d Last week, Xi encouraged universities in China and the US to \u201cstrengthen exchanges and cooperation,\u201d in a letter to the president of Kean University in New Jersey, which has a China-based joint venture with Wenzhou University, according to state media. China has one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the world, partly due to its strict gun controls and powerful mass surveillance. But it has continued to face mass stabbings in public places. In May, two people were killed and another 21 injured in a knife attack in a hospital in the southwestern province of Yunnan. Last year, six people were killed and one injured in an early morning\u00a0stabbing incident\u00a0outside a kindergarten in southern Guangdong province. And a\u00a02022 stabbing, also at a kindergarten, killed three and injured six in eastern Jiangxi province. Correction: An earlier version of this story reported the wrong day for the stabbings.

Norway, Ireland, Spain and Slovenia have each recognized an independent Palestinian state in recent weeks, a move motivated at least in part by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s open refusal to commit to a two-state solution. Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the move was a reward for terrorism and would strengthen Hamas. The statement also said Israel would look at what actions to take against the Palestinian Authority as it took actions against Israel in international bodies. Earlier this month, the Palestinian Authority applied to join South Africa\u2019s case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. Israel\u2019s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said in May that Israel should approve 10,000 settlements in the West Bank, establish a new settlement for every country that recognizes a state of Palestine, and cancel travel permits for Palestinian Authority officials.

{"id": "2024_06_15_middleeast_eight-soldiers-killed-rafah-intl", "text": "Eight Israeli soldiers were killed in southern Gaza on Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces says, in one of the deadliest single incidents involving its troops since October 7. The IDF said the incident was still under review but preliminary findings suggested an armored vehicle carrying soldiers as part of a convoy had been hit by an explosion at around 5:15 a.m. local time during an operation targeting \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d in the northwestern part of Tal al-Sultan. \u201cAccording to the information we have at this point one of the engineering vehicles in the convoy was involved in an explosion that was apparently caused by explosive devices planted in the area or as a result of anti-tank missile fire,\u201d IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari told a press conference Saturday. The IDF is also investigating whether the initial explosion was compounded when explosive materiel aboard the vehicle detonated. \u201cThe current assessment is that the \u2018Nemera\u2019 armored vehicle got hit as a result of an explosion of a side bomb. In addition, on the vehicle there were engineering tools that include explosive materiel. The explosion was significant and may have been caused by the ignition of the explosive materiel on the vehicle. All this is not supposed to happen and therefore the incident is being examined,\u201d the IDF said. So great was the damage that it was difficult to identify and locate the bodies of those killed, the Israeli military added. \u201cToday we received another painful reminder of the price of war and that brave warriors and heroes were willing to sacrifice their lives for the state of Israel, which is the common home of all of us: Druze, Jews, Bedouin, Muslims and Christians. All citizens of Israel, our hearts and thoughts are with the families at this difficult time,\u201d Hagari said at the press conference. The IDF has not announced who they think was responsible for the incident. However, Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said it had \u201ccarried out a complex ambush against enemy vehicles\u201d operating in Tal al-Sultan, which lies west of the southern city of Rafah. The militant group claimed it had targeted a military bulldozer,\u00a0which then caught on fire, and that when rescue troops arrived,\u00a0it hit an armored personnel carrier with a missile strike. \u201cOur painful strikes against the enemy will continue everywhere they are present, and the occupying army will find nothing but death traps,\u201d the militant group said. The Israeli military has so far released the names of six of the eight soldiers killed in the incident. The troops, ages 19-23, were all members of the Combat Engineering Corps\u2019 601st Battalion. Meanwhile in the Sabra neighborhood in Gaza City, located in the enclave\u2019s north, two reservists were killed in an incident involving an explosive device on the tank they were traveling in, Israeli media, including CNN affiliate Channel 11 (Kan News), reported. The IDF did not say who they thought was responsible for the incident. We must stick to war goals: Netanyahu Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a speech on Saturday, spoke of his \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d over the deaths, describing the enemy as \u201cloathsome and murderous,\u201d but pledged to stick to his war goals. \u201cDespite the heavy and staggering cost, we must stick to the goals of the war: destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas, returning all our abductees, making sure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel and returning our residents safely to their homes \u2013 both in the north and in the south,\u201d Netanyahu said. He came under fire from opposition leader Yair Lapid, who accused Netanyahu of prioritizing political gains over national unity. Speaking at an anti-government rally in Tel Aviv, Lapid offered his condolences to the families of the eight soldiers killed in Tal al-Sultan before criticizing what he claimed was Netanyahu\u2019s response to a previous incident involving the deaths of four soldiers earlier this week. \u201cWhen the (four soldiers earlier this week) were killed, we were in the Knesset, voting on the conscription law. The whole Knesset already knew. We were all in a difficult, depressed mood, then we looked up and saw that there was one person who didn\u2019t feel that way (Netanyahu); we saw him smile,\u201d Lapid said. \u201cThat smile will bury his political career. This smile will remove him from our lives,\u201d Lapid added. The rally in Tel Aviv was attended by thousands of Israelis calling for an immediate ceasefire to secure the release of the remaining hostages. Similar protests have been taking place almost weekly. Various other ministers expressed their sorrow at the deaths, including defense minister Yoav Gallant, foreign minister Israel Katz and national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir. \u201cEight of our best sons were killed in Rafah,\u201d Katz said in a post on X. \u201cWhile knowing the price, they bravely entered Gaza to complete the mission of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages.\u201d Meanwhile Benny Gantz, who resigned from Israel\u2019s war cabinet just days ago, described the eight soldiers as \u201cthe beautiful faces of the people of Israel, the best among us.\u201d \u201cThe heart is torn by hearing the hard news, we will never stop protecting our country, and our society\u201d Gantz added. Push into Rafah Reports of airstrikes and artillery shelling emerged since dawn local time as Israel continues its push into Rafah. Ahmed Radwan, the media officer of\u00a0Rafah\u00a0Civil Defense, said they had received appeals to collect bodies and the injured but it was difficult for civil defense crews to access the area. Some of the fiercest fighting of recent days has been seen in Tal al-Sultan. Hamas\u00a0on\u00a0Friday said its fighters targeted\u00a0Israeli tanks\u00a0in\u00a0the neighborhood with Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs) and mortars, while the IDF said it found tunnels between neighboring houses used by militants as passageways. Elsewhere, at least 14 people were killed, including seven children, in Israeli strikes on central Gaza, the Civil Defense Directorate in Gaza said. In total, 30 people have been killed and 95 injured in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The conflict in Gaza began after the Hamas attacks of October 7, which killed around 1,200 people. Since then at least 37,296 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, according to the latest figures from the Ministry of Health in Gaza.

All six of the dead are Jordanian citizens, the Jordanian foreign ministry said Saturday, adding that it was coordinating with Saudi authorities in Jeddah regarding burial procedures and possible transfer of their bodies back to Jordan. News of the deaths comes as pilgrims gathered atop Mount Arafat on Saturday, marking the main event of the pilgrimage, with the niece of one of the deceased telling CNN Arabic that her aunt had died on Mount Arafat and was buried in Saudi Arabia. More than\u00a01.8 million people\u00a0are taking part in Hajj this year, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. The Hajj is one of the biggest religious gatherings in the world and the largest annual event in Saudi Arabia. It occurs two months and 10 days after Ramadan ends, during the Islamic month of Dhul-Hijjah. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and shorter than the Gregorian calendar, the timing of Hajj on the Gregorian calendar shifts slightly each year. This year, Saudi Arabia is expected to experience extreme heat over the five-day pilgrimage, with temperatures reaching 48 degrees Celsius (118 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca. Hajj officials are asking pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated amid the harsh conditions, the spokesman for the ministry of health Muhammad Al-Abdulaali said, according to the state news agency SPA. The Saudi army has also deployed more than 1,600 personnel with medical units specifically for heatstroke and 30 rapid response teams. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers are taking part. Jordan has previously said there were more than 4,000 pilgrims in its official delegation this year. However, the foreign ministry clarified that the six who died were not part of the \u201cofficial delegation,\u201d meaning they did not have valid Hajj licenses to perform the pilgrimage. Performing Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam. Islam requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life. The pilgrimage includes numerous detailed rituals including wearing a special garment that symbolizes human equality and unity before God, a circular, counter-clockwise procession around the Kaaba, and the symbolic stoning of evil. People who have completed the pilgrimage may add the phrase al-Hajj or hajji (pilgrim) to their names. Over the past decade, Saudi Arabia has invested billions of dollars to upgrade transport, technology and accommodation for pilgrims performing Hajj \u2013 a key source of income for the world\u2019s largest oil producer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/middleeast/hajj-pilgrims-die-heatstroke-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_europe_ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-intl", "text": "More than 100 countries and organizations have gathered for a major conference in Switzerland dedicated to setting out a path toward peace between Ukraine and Russia, but there will be no delegation from Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is aiming to use the meeting, which is being held at a resort near Lucerne, to drum up support for the 10-point peace plan he first outlined late in 2022. Addressing the conference on Saturday, Zelensky said the proposal for ending the war would be submitted to Russia once it had been agreed by the other nations in attendance and there would then be a second peace summit, where \u201cwe can fix the real end of the war.\u201d \u201cThe peace formula is inclusive, and we are happy to hear and work on all proposals, all ideas of what is really needed for peace and what is important to you dear friends,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cI urge you to be as active as possible and I am proud all parts of the world, all continents are now represented at the peace summit,\u201d he added. Most Western governments have sent representatives at a senior level. US Vice President Kamala Harris is attending and announced that Washington will supply Kyiv with an aid package of more than $1.5 billion to help the country rebuild its battered infrastructure and address humanitarian needs stemming from the conflict,\u00a0according to a statement from the White House on Saturday. \u201cThis war remains an utter failure for Putin. I am here in Switzerland to stand with Ukraine and the leaders from around the world in support of a just and lasting peace,\u201d Harris said. Heads of state and government from several European states, including France, Germany and the UK are also joining, as is Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. However, China will not attend. It has said that any such meeting needs to be attended by both Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky\u2019s plan includes demands for a cessation of hostilites, the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian soil and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s \ufeffpre-war borders with Russia. It also calls for the establishment of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian war crimes. \u201cUkraine never wanted this war, it\u2019s a criminal and absolutely unprovoked aggression of Russia. And the only one who wanted it was Putin,\u201d Zelensky said. Russia has expressed little interest in agreeing to those terms and has shown no sign of compromise when it comes to the territorial issues. On Friday, the day before the summit was set to kick off, Russian President Vladimir Putin restated the Kremlin\u2019s own peace plan, which Ukraine is unlikely to ever agree to. The proposal calls for Ukrainian troops withdraw from four southern and eastern regions of Ukrainian territory that Moscow said it would annex in violation of international law and demands Kyiv abandon its bid to join\u00a0NATO. While Russian forces have made modest gains in two of the regions \u2013 Donetsk and Luhansk \u2013 in recent months, they are far from occupying all four, which include Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Putin said later in the day that nearly 700,000 Russian soldiers are fighting in Ukraine, a hike from the 617,000 he reported during a end-of-year press conference in 2023.

{"id": "2024_06_14_uk_king-charles-foundation-awards-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "King Charles III was in his element this week as he celebrated a very special moment for his foundation at St. James\u2019s Palace in London. On Tuesday, the 75-year-old monarch attended the inaugural awards of his King\u2019s Foundation, so we thought, why not take our Royal News readers along with us? Now, to rewind for just a moment \u2013 King Charles set up the charity back in 1990 when he was still the Prince of Wales. His vision was to help revitalize communities while creating a balance between people and the planet. More than 30 years on, the King\u2019s ethos continues to drive the organization\u2019s projects, whether it\u2019s through its education courses focusing on arts, architecture, traditional crafts or rural skills, its health and wellbeing programs, or its regeneration work. King\u2019s Foundation chief executive Kristina Murrin told CNN that the charity is underpinned by the monarch\u2019s philosophy of working in concert with nature to \u201cbuild sustainable thriving communities.\u201d \u201cThe way we do that is we take our inspiration from nature and from tradition to try and work out what are the best ways we can work with nature, not against her.\u201d Murrin said the foundation has six historic sites in the United Kingdom \u2013 including Dumfries House and Highgrove Gardens \u2013 which together attracted nearly 300,000 visitors in the past 12 months, as well as more than a dozen sites internationally. Meanwhile, its education, skills and training programs benefited more than 15,000 students last year. This week\u2019s glittering event \u2013 set to become an annual fixture in the charity\u2019s calendar \u2013 saw rock royalty Rod Stewart and his wife, Penny Lancaster, footballing legend David Beckham, actress Sienna Miller, fashion editor Edward Enninful, supermodel Naomi Campbell and chef Raymond Blanc hand out awards. Organizers are eager to offer a platform to recognize students, teachers, alumni and partners for their contributions to the organization\u2019s efforts across a range of sectors. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited about the awards. The charity has been going (for) nearly 35 years and it just felt the right moment to finally celebrate the work we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Murrin said. \u201cWe have amazing students and teachers \u2013 many of whom have gone (on) to start incredible businesses \u2013 and so it just felt it was about time we got around to celebrating some of those people.\u201d Nine awards were given out, with Charles presenting the final accolade, the King Charles III Harmony Award, to South Korean diplomat and former secretary-general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon. In a short speech, the King said the award was \u201ccreated to recognize the individuals who champion the values which underpin the King\u2019s Foundation\u2019s mission, and my own hope, for a world in which we live in harmony with nature.\u201d He then paid tribute to the former UN chief for his \u201ctireless dedication to promoting these ideals on the global stage.\u201d Some 250 guests attended the event at St. James\u2019s Palace. Pipers from the National Piping Centre and the Rock Choir played as nominees and their families made their way up the Grand Staircase to the lavish State Apartment for the reception. The awards also featured live demonstrations of some of the foundation\u2019s educational programs, including furniture-making, woodworking and embroidery. Charles was beaming as he made his way around the reception, keen to hear about how students have been supported in learning and entrepreneurship across traditional arts, textiles, rural skills, and health and wellbeing. British gardener and broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh spoke of his joy at being involved in the foundation for several decades, saying \u201cthe fact that it works\u201d continues to draw him in. He said he wants to be involved in the King\u2019s Foundation because of \u201cthe fact that it encourages practical skills \u2013 crafts, arts \u2013 that it catches people that might otherwise fall through the net and that it really makes a difference.\u201d \u201cIt makes a difference to our landscape, to the crafts and skills that are available, making sure they don\u2019t disappear, but also to individuals. It turns people around, people who are not necessarily academic but people who have really valuable skills,\u201d he added. Among the winners was Isabelle Pennington-Edmead, 27, who received the Young Entrepreneur Award from actress Sienna Miller. After graduating from the King\u2019s Foundation\u2019s The Modern Artisan program, she has gone on to set up her own eponymous label centered on a sustainable and ethical approach. Her collection \u2013 which is inspired by her mixed Caribbean Kittitian and English heritage \u2013 is made to order, cutting out unwanted stock. She will be expanding onto an online retailer this summer while scaling up her business sustainably. She told CNN that setting up her business \u201cwas something I\u2019d always wanted to do and when I left the King\u2019s Foundation, I felt that I had the tools to be able to do it.\u201d In the Throne Room, Charles had the chance to catch up with Beckham, who was recently announced as a new ambassador for the foundation and who mentioned at the event that he had cuts on his hands from planting roses over the weekend. The pair appeared delighted to see each other again, discussing the England men\u2019s soccer team\u2019s prospects ahead of the Euro 2024 tournament, which kicks off today in Germany. Beckham assured the King \u201cwe\u2019ll be ready\u201d after a recent loss to Iceland in a friendly. Charles may have only recently returned to public duties and is continuing his cancer treatment, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s slowed down. Murrin told CNN that King\u2019s Foundation staff had wondered how much time Charles would have to devote himself to the charity after his accession to the throne \u201cbut he stays very involved, very committed.\u201d \u201cHis Majesty is very involved and we\u2019re incredibly lucky to have him as our Royal Founding President. He was bringing attention to some of these themes around the climate, the planet, and our sustainability decades ago. It\u2019s a real honor to do his work.\u201d She added: \u201cHe loves seeing the projects that we\u2019re making out in the world \u2013 both here and across the globe.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/uk/king-charles-foundation-awards-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

Catherine, who revealed in March she has been diagnosed with cancer, said in a new statement on Friday that she has experienced \u201cgood days and bad days\u201d while undergoing chemotherapy, and expects her treatment to continue \u201cfor a few more months.\u201d But she is expected to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony with the royal family on Saturday at Trooping the Colour, King Charles III\u2019s birthday parade, and Kensington Palace have released a new photo of the Princess taken earlier this week in Windsor. \u201cI am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,\u201d the Princess, who is often known as Kate, said in a personal message released on Friday. \u201cOn those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.\u201d \u201cMy treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months,\u201d Kate wrote. \u201cOn the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home.\u201d She said she is hoping to join some more engagements over the summer, but acknowledged she is \u201cnot out of the woods yet.\u201d King Charles III is \u201cdelighted\u201d to hear that Kate will be attending royal events on Saturday, according to a Buckingham Palace spokesperson Friday. \u201cHis Majesty is delighted that The Princess is able to attend tomorrow\u2019s events, and is much looking forward to all elements of the day,\u201d the spokesperson said. Kate will travel down the Mall in a carriage during Saturday\u2019s Trooping the Colour, accompanied by her children. She will watch the rest of the parade with her family nearby, and is expected to join fellow royals on the balcony. It represents a significant moment in the Princess\u2019s recovery, marking her first public appearance since Christmas Day \u2013 weeks before her cancer diagnosis. But it does not represent a return to public duties, and throughout her recovery, any appearances will be taken alongside medical guidance and will be subject to change if required. \u201cI have been blown away by all the kind messages of support and encouragement over the last couple of months,\u201d Kate wrote. \u201cIt really has made the world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times.\u201d \u201cI am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal.\u201d Kate first stepped away from public duties in January, following what Kensington Palace said at the time was surgery for a non-cancerous abdominal condition. In March, amid speculation about her wellbeing, she revealed in a video message that she had been diagnosed with cancer after the operation. \u201cMy medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy,\u201d she said in that update, adding she was in the early stages of that treatment. The Princess\u2019s cancer diagnosis stunned the country, especially as it came so soon after Charles announced that he had also been diagnosed with cancer. Neither royal has specified the type of cancer they are receiving treatment for, or revealed details about their progress. Charles said in March he was \u201cso proud\u201d of Catherine, his daughter-in-law, for \u201cher courage in speaking as she did\u201d in sharing her diagnosis. Kate has not appeared in public or taken on any formal duties since her announcement, but her husband Prince William has returned to his roles. He recently traveled to France for the events marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day, alongside his father King Charles III.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/uk/catherine-princess-of-wales-cancer-update-appearance-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_travel_high-speed-sleeper-train-hong-kong-beijing-shanghai-intl-hnk", "text": "Interested in capping off your trip to Hong Kong with a long weekend in Beijing or Shanghai? A new high-speed sleeper train service is making that possibility easier than ever. Two new overnight routes connecting the city with Beijing and Shanghai entered into service on June 15. Both trains depart Hong Kong West Kowloon Station in the evening and arrive in Beijing at 6.53 a.m. and Shanghai at 6.45 a.m., making the journeys around 12.5 hours and 11 hours respectively. Return trips depart from Beijing and Shanghai at around 8 p.m. and arrive in Hong Kong at 8.47 a.m. and 7.29 a.m. These routes run four days a week, departing all three stations every evening from Friday to Monday. \u201cIt will be more comfortable and faster, reducing the travel time by about half, and will cover a wider range of destinations, including popular tourist attraction cities,\u201d John Lee, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, said in a press statement, referring to the previous overnight train routes that connected Hong Kong with China\u2019s two biggest cities. Those intercity railway services, Beijing-Kowloon and Shanghai-Kowloon, launched in 1997. The train ride to China\u2019s capital took around 24 hours while the journey to Shanghai was about 19 hours. The services were suspended during the pandemic in 2020 and have been replaced by the new high-speed options that launched on June 15. But while the new trips do indeed slash the overnight travel time by almost half, the high-speed sleeper services take slightly longer than the daytime bullet trains already in service connecting Hong Kong and the two cities in mainland China. Currently, the train company operates one daily high-speed connection to Beijing, which takes around 8.5 hours, and one to Shanghai, which is around 7.5 hours. Why bother with the longer journey then? The new sleeper trains might not be the fastest way to get between Hong Kong and Beijing or Shanghai, but they are a great option for business travelers who need to arrive well-rested before standard office hours, as well as leisure tourists who don\u2019t want to waste a full day on the train or wish to save money on accommodations. Inside the sleeper trains Each of the electric multiple unit (EMU) trains used to service the routes has 16 carriages, including 13 sleeper cars, two second-class seating cars and one dining car. There are three types of seats to choose from: Second class (without a bed), sleeper and deluxe sleeper. A standard sleeper class cabin consists of two bunk beds, sleeping four passengers, in a cabin. The deluxe version, only available on the Hong Kong-Shanghai route for now, features a bunk bed, wardrobe and sofa. Prices range from HKD937 to HKD1,506 ($120-$193) for the Hong Kong-Beijing route and HKD682 to HKD2,128 ($88-273) for the Hong Kong-Shanghai route. Passengers who want to book a seat can reserve their tickets on China Railway\u2019s official ticketing site 12306.cn. Note that for trains departing from Hong Kong, you have to search \u201chkwestkowloon.\u201d International travelers can also book through ticketing platforms such as Trip.com or buy their tickets at the West Kowloon Station directly. A joint immigration checkpoint inside West Kowloon Station allows passengers to avoid additional checks when crossing the border in and out of Hong Kong. However, travelers still need to have a valid China visa or travel document to ride the train. (Although part of China, Hong Kong is governed under a separate legal framework.) Hong Kong\u2019s controversial high-speed railway Opened in 2018, the 26-kilometer Hong Kong high-speed railway is a part of the larger Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL). Costing more than $10.7 billion to build, the Hong Kong section connects the city with China\u2019s 25,000-kilometer national high-speed rail network. But the project, which marked the first time mainland Chinese laws were given jurisdiction inside Hong Kong territory, stirred much controversy, even well before its opening. The massive price tag, the limited traveling speed (the Hong Kong section has a maximum speed of 200 kilometers/hour \u2013 much lower than the usual 300 kilometers/hour due to its short distance) and the political implications all cast a shadow over the new railway. Controversy aside, the introduction of the Express Rail Link provided an alternative way to travel to major Chinese cities through Hong Kong \u2013 and avoid China\u2019s notorious flight delays. The Hong Kong station now offers direct trips to 78 destinations around China and some 70,600 passengers use the network daily according to official figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/travel/high-speed-sleeper-train-hong-kong-beijing-shanghai-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_colombia-chiquita-banana-intl-latam", "text": "The execution of banana plantation worker \u201cDavid\u201d\u00a0by right-wing Colombian paramilitary\u00a0members\u00a0in 1997 was as swift as it was brutal. Minutes after his bus was\u00a0stopped at a checkpoint in the coastal region of Urab\u00e1, he was dragged off, beaten to death in front of his fellow passengers, and dumped on the side of the road \u2013 where his killers covered his corpse with a\u00a0banana plant.\u00a0Cows would later feed on his body, according to court documents. The brutality did not end there. His\u00a0daughter and\u00a0sister-in-law\u00a0disappeared weeks later, never to be found again. Death threats were made to another member of the family. What was left of the family soon left Urab\u00e1 for good. He\u00a0was just one of thousands of people targeted by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC, an infamous right-wing terrorist group that, at the height of Colombia\u2019s civil conflict around the turn of the century, was able to mobilize tens of thousands of fighters. More than a quarter century\u00a0later, a landmark civil case in a US federal court this week found banana company Chiquita Brands International liable for financing the\u00a0paramilitary\u00a0group, and ordered Chiquita\u00a0to pay $38.3 million in compensation to \u201cDavid\u2019s\u201d family and those of\u00a0seven other victims \u2013 whose real identities were concealed in court documents. The details of those deaths, which took place between 1997 and 2004, and accounts of\u00a0the impact they had on the families, were read to jurors before\u00a0they deliberated whether Chiquita \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest banana producers \u2013 had acted \u201cas a reasonable businessperson\u201d by paying the AUC what the company characterized as extortion payments. The families\u00a0argued\u00a0that\u00a0payments from Chiquita to the AUC had helped to prop up the paramilitary group\u2019s violence in Colombia and that the company should therefore be held liable for the group\u2019s murders. The verdict\u00a0has been celebrated as a legal breakthrough.\u00a0According to the lawyers who won the case in Florida, it marks \u201cthe first time an American jury has held a major US corporation accountable for complicity in serious human rights abuses in another country.\u201d \u201cI feel great joy, we waited for so long and suddenly, we won. I had almost lost hope, but God helped us,\u201d one of the plaintiffs told CNN after the ruling. The mother of four daughters\u00a0recalled telling\u00a0the court how her partner\u00a0was\u00a0killed by AUC paramilitaries on November 14, 2003, to pressure the family to sell a banana plantation at below market rate. \u201cI don\u2019t want the money myself, I\u2019ll be gone soon\u2026 but at least, for the girls: may they get some justice now!\u201d she said of the compensation. A bellwether case? The verdict follows a nearly two-decade judicial fight by the families, who sued Chiquita International after a separate court case in 2007.\u00a0In\u00a0that case,\u00a0the company admitted paying $1.7 million in \u201cprotection money\u201d to the AUC \u2013 at that time considered a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the State Department \u2013 and agreed to pay the US government a $25 million fine. However, it\u2019s unlikely to be the last of the matter, and not only because Chiquita has already said it will appeal the verdict. Marco Simons, general counsel for Earth Rights International, a human rights NGO that provided legal assistance to the victims, described his legal strategy as a \u201cbellwether process,\u201d with his team selecting the nine strongest cases they had from over 4,500 complaints. He now hopes many more cases will follow. \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to represent these victims for the past 17 years. It\u2019s not over yet, but this is a significant step forward, and we hope that this will pave the way for compensation for all the victims,\u201d Simons told a press conference in Washington on Tuesday. Because of Chiquita\u2019s appeal, Simons says it is unlikely any of the victims will receive compensation soon, however, he says the case has sent a strong message to corporations about the need to respect human rights. \u201cUltimately, this money is not going to replace what\u2019s been lost. We\u2019re still talking about horrific abuses that these families have suffered, but the money is important because, unfortunately, the language that corporations understand best is money. Sometimes it takes a significant monetary penalty to change corporate behavior,\u201d Simons said. \u2018Tragic for so many\u2019 Chiquita has maintained in its defense \u2013 both throughout the latest case and in previous litigation \u2013 that it was itself a victim, as it had been forced to pay the AUC protection money. While that argument was not enough to\u00a0convince\u00a0the jury that it had acted \u201cas a reasonable businessperson would have acted under the circumstances,\u201d the company told CNN following the latest verdict that it remained \u201cconfident that our legal position will ultimately prevail.\u201d \u201cThe situation in Colombia was tragic for so many, including those directly affected by the violence there, and our thoughts remain with them and their families. However, that does not change our belief that there is no legal basis for these claims,\u201d the statement read. In its 2007 case against the US Justice Department, the company\u00a0admitted making more than \u201c100 payments to the AUC totaling over $1.7 million.\u201d\u00a0Chiquita recorded the AUC payments as \u201csecurity services,\u201d though the company never received any actual services from these payments,\u00a0according\u00a0to a US Justice Department press release from the time. Eric Holder, who represented Chiquita in the 2007 trial before serving as US Attorney General under President\u00a0Barack Obama, told the court then\u00a0that: \u201cThe company had to pay a variety of terrorist groups for over 15 years because those were the groups that controlled the areas in which the company operated. Not the Colombian government.\u201d However, in that trial, the company ended up admitting in a plea deal that it had willingly continued to pay the AUC even after the group was declared a terrorist organization by the US government in 2001, and even after a senior director lodged an objection to Chiquita\u2019s board reiterating \u201chis strong opinion to sell our operations in Colombia,\u201d due to the protection money issue. Federal attorneys found that Chiquita made $49.4 million in profit from their Colombian operations between 1997 and 2004. A time of \u2018real terror\u2019 The AUC was founded in 1997, during one of the most tragic phases of the Colombian civil conflict, which saw the government wrestle for control against left-wing guerrilla forces, right-wing paramilitaries, and criminal organizations. Around that time, left-wing guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) were moving against the state and terrorizing the civilian population.\u00a0Chiquita said in the 2007 case that it had paid ransoms to the FARC and ELN\u00a0before it turned to the AUC in 1997. Faced with the possibility of an armed communist revolution in the country, Colombian landowners and right-wing sympathizers created groups of\u00a0vigilantes\u00a0to respond to the guerrillas blow for blow. The AUC were once such a\u00a0group and spent the years before their final demobilization\u00a0in 2006 terrorizing the population of northern Colombia to stem the rebellion. At its zenith, the AUC could mobilize tens of thousands of fighters, and was heavily financed by drug trafficking: following demobilization, more than a dozen AUC leaders were extradited on drug charges to the US. \u201cI remember that period, it was real terror,\u201d one of the plaintiffs awarded compensation on Monday told CNN. \u201cMy husband was killed, but my daughter was also raped, you had victims all across town.\u201d In other testimony heard by the jurors in the most recent court case, a minor\u00a0girl\u00a0was forced to watch from a taxi as her mother and stepfather were executed on the side of the street, before being given the equivalent of less than a dollar to return home and survive as an orphan. Colombia today Colombia today is a vastly different country to the one in which the AUC was born. A few years after the demobilization of the AUC, a peace deal in 2016 also brought to an end the 52-year conflict between the government and the FARC, though some dissidents continue to fight. Both right wing paramilitaries and left-wing guerrillas have since been included in transitional justice processes aimed at bringing closure to some of the darkest pages of the conflict. Yet the fear in Urab\u00e1 remains. Some of the AUC\u2019s former members remain at large and have joined a new organized criminal group, the Gulf Clan, that challenges government control in northwestern Colombia. Rights groups say powerful corporate interests continue to collude with local politicians and criminal groups to repress activism, particularly in defense of the environment, which can be a dangerous business in South America. Even so, for at least some of the many victims of the AUC, this week\u2019s court verdict is a reason for optimism.\u00a0One of the plaintiffs who spoke with CNN asked to share her message as an act of defiance. \u201cMy daughter, my son, they\u2019re all \u2018Mom don\u2019t pick up the phone, mom don\u2019t talk.\u2019 But hey, fear can only last until someone decides to speak,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/americas/colombia-chiquita-banana-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

The boys, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, murdered 19-year-old Shawn Seesahai in a park in Wolverhampton, central England, West Midlands Police said in a statement. Seesahai, who was from Anguilla, had only lived in the UK for about six months, the statement said. According to the police, Seesahai and his friend were in the park when they were approached by \u201cyoungsters.\u201d Nottingham Crown Court heard that the victim was then shoulder-barged by one of the boys, and was punched, kicked, stamped on and \u201cchopped\u201d at with a 42.5cm-long machete, PA reported. A witness told the court that one defendant used the machete on Seesahai\u2019s legs while the other punched and stamped on his head, PA said. The court was also told that Seesahai had an injury \u201cthat went through his body all the way from his back, through his ribs and into his heart,\u201d PA reported. The perpetrators were arrested two days after the attack, West Midlands Police said. A machete was found under one of the boys\u2019 beds, blood-stained clothing was found in one of the boys\u2019 laundry baskets, and forensic analysis of a mobile phone seized by officers found multiple images of large knives and other weapons.

{"id": "2024_06_14_middleeast_israel-detention-palestinians-release-intl-latam", "text": "The Palestinian Legislative Council in Gaza has demanded international inspections of Israeli detention centers, after the release of a number of prisoners this week who appeared frail and thin after several months in detention. Among those released was the Council\u2019s former Speaker, Aziz Dweik, who had been held for nine months, accused of affiliation with Hamas. He appeared much thinner and greyer than before being detained. The Council said it \u201clooks with anger at the crimes committed by the enemy against the prisoners, and the greatest example is the photo of Dr. Aziz Dweik when he left the occupation prisons.\u201d The Council alleged that the prisoners had been subjected to starvation, isolation and torture. Dweik himself said Friday that prisoners were\u00a0\u201cstarved for 24 hours a day. The prisoners are in poor health conditions, suffering from skin diseases, and the food is insufficient even for children, let alone meeting the needs of men.\u201d He added that sugar, salt, and fruit were virtually absent in the prisons. CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces and prison authorities for a response to the allegations made by the Council. Most of the approximately 30 prisoners released from the Negev and Ofer prisoners this week were administrative detainees, who had not been charged with any offenses. One of them, according to the Palestinian Prisoners\u2019 Society, was Saed Abu Shanab from Tulkarm, who had spent 21 years in Israeli prisons. The Prisoners\u2019 Society said that the condition of the prisoners \u201creflect some of the harsh and humiliating conditions of detention, including acts of torture, abuse and starvation, in addition to medical crimes.\u201d In May, CNN published an investigation based on testimonies from whistleblowers at the Negev facility which reported that \u201cdoctors sometimes amputated prisoners\u2019 limbs due to injuries sustained from constant handcuffing; [and] of medical procedures sometimes performed by underqualified medics.\u201d In response to that reporting, the IDF responded that it \u201censures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly.\u201d The Israeli military has acknowledged partially converting\u00a0three different military facilities into detention camps for Palestinian detainees from Gaza\u00a0since the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel. The Prisoners\u2019 Society said in April that the vast majority of detainees released suffered from health problems \u201cwhich required the transfer of some of them to the hospital immediately upon their release.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/middleeast/israel-detention-palestinians-release-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/17/2024", "section": "world"}}

Italian media had attributed to the pope the use of a vulgar Italian term roughly translating as \u201cf*****ry,\u201d on\u00a0May 20\u00a0during a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops. According to ANSA, Francis repeated the term on Tuesday as he met Roman priests, saying \u201cthere is an air of f*****ry in the Vatican,\u201d and it was better that young men with a homosexual tendency not be allowed to enter the seminary. Asked about the latest report, the Vatican\u2019s press office made reference to a statement it had issued regarding Tuesday\u2019s meeting with the priests, in which the pope reiterated the need to welcome gay people into the Church and the need for caution regarding them becoming seminarians. After the initial report of his use of the word, Corriere della Sera newspaper quoted unnamed bishops who were in the room as suggesting that the pope, as an Argentine, might not have realized the Italian term he used was offensive. Last month, a source close to the pope told CNN the phrase could also be understood as there is a \u201cgay climate\u201d in the seminaries. The Vatican ruled in 2005 that the church cannot allow the ordination of men who are actively gay or have \u201cdeep-seated\u201d homosexual tendencies. In 2016, Francis upheld this ruling. Two years later he told Italian bishops not to accept gay candidates for the priesthood. Francis, 87, had been credited with making substantial overtures toward the LGBTQ community during his 11-year papacy. Some observers of the Vatican say his recent missteps undermine his authority and raise questions about his convictions and the reform path he has in mind for the Church.
