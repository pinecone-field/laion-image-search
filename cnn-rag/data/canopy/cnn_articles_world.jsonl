But as he confronts that choice, Netanyahu is also looking for a way to avoid it altogether. For months, Netanyahu has gingerly balanced these competing imperatives by refusing to even contemplate a permanent ceasefire as he blamed Hamas\u2019s \u201cdelusional demands\u201d for the collapse of previous rounds of negotiations. But after US President Joe Biden publicly outlined Israel\u2019s latest ceasefire proposal on Friday \u2013 one that could lead to a permanent truce and which Hamas may be prepared to accept \u2013 Netanyahu is now out of time. \u201cI think that Bibi is cornered now,\u201d said Aviv Bushinsky, a former adviser to Netanyahu, using the prime minister\u2019s nickname. Biden is \u201cforcing Bibi to take off his mask and say: \u2018OK, now is the money time. Are you in favor of a deal?\u2019,\u201d he said. As Israel awaits Hamas\u2019 response to the latest proposal, National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and other far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition are already threatening to bolt from the government and cause its collapse if the prime minister follows through. Amid the chorus of threats from his right flank, Netanyahu is trying to reframe the latest ceasefire proposal, insisting to Ben Gvir and others that the terms of the deal are not as Biden defined them. While Biden squarely framed the proposal as a way to end the war, Netanyahu is insisting Israel will not end the war until and unless Hamas is eliminated. Netanyahu told the Knesset\u2019s Foreign Affairs and Security Committee on Monday that \u201cthe claim that we agreed to a ceasefire without our conditions being met is not true.\u201d He appeared to be referring to the permanent ceasefire outlined in the second phase of the proposal, the conditions of which Israel and Hamas would need to negotiate during the first phase \u2013 a point Netanyahu has sought to emphasize in recent days. According to Biden, the three-phase proposal would pair a release of hostages with a \u201cfull and complete ceasefire.\u201d But Netanyahu\u2019s spokesperson told journalists at a briefing Monday that Biden had presented only a \u201cpartial\u201d outline of the deal Israel had offered Hamas. \u201cThe war will be stopped for the purpose of returning hostages and then we will proceed with further discussions. There are other details that the US President did not present to the public,\u201d the spokesperson added. The spokesperson reiterated Israel\u2019s refusal to agree to any ceasefire until all hostages had been released, until Gaza no longer posed \u201ca threat\u201d to Israel, and until Hamas\u2019s \u201cgoverning and military capabilities\u201d in Gaza had been eradicated. \u201cThe notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter. It\u2019s not an option,\u201d said the spokesperson. Netanyahu\u2019s efforts to convince the far-right ministers in order to avoid choosing between a ceasefire deal and the survival of his government have so far fallen flat. Ben Gvir said Monday that Netanyahu\u2019s office refused to follow through on a commitment to show him the draft proposal, leaving him convinced the prime minister has something to hide. If Ben Gvir or Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich don\u2019t back off their threats to leave the government, Netanyahu will be back to the binary choice that is beginning to materialize before his eyes. Opposition leader Yair Lapid has offered to provide a \u201csafety net\u201d to keep the government in power in order to achieve a ceasefire deal, but doing so would also be handing Lapid the keys to forcing early elections once the deal is implemented. Just as it has been over the past eight months, Netanyahu\u2019s political survival may be wrapped up in the continuation of the war and his elusive pursuit of total victory over Hamas. Netanyahu is confronting the choice between his government\u2019s survival and a hostage deal at a time when his political fortunes have begun to improve. For the first time this year, Netanyahu edged out his chief political rival Benny Gantz as the preferred choice for prime minister for Israelis, 36% to 30%, according to a Channel 12 survey last week. And a smattering of recent polls have shown Gantz\u2019s National Unity party faltering, while Netanyahu\u2019s Likud is making modest gains. National Unity would still win a plurality of seats in the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, but the party\u2019s 19-seat advantage over Likud in December has dropped to a four-seat advantage in last week\u2019s Channel 12 poll. The improvement in Netanyahu\u2019s political standing coincided with a surge of international condemnation of Israel\u2019s war effort in Gaza and the International Criminal Court\u2019s decision to seek an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, all of which have positioned Netanyahu domestically as Israel\u2019s defender, a familiar and comfortable role for Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister. Meanwhile, Gantz\u2019s threat to leave the war cabinet over Netanyahu\u2019s lack of long-term strategy in Gaza appears to be the cause of his drop in support. A poll by Israel\u2019s Channel 11 on Monday put the Israeli public\u2019s support for the ceasefire deal currently on the table at 40%, with 27% opposed and 33% unsure. But if Netanyahu is now contemplating whether there is more upside to continuing the war than reaching a ceasefire deal, Biden\u2019s speech last week didn\u2019t just force Netanyahu to confront that choice \u2013 it was also aimed at countering the pressure Netanyahu is now facing to abandon his own government\u2019s proposal. \u201cI know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some are even in the government coalition,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve urged the leadership in Israel to stand behind this deal, despite whatever pressure comes.\u201d Despite Netanyahu\u2019s remarks that the conditions for ending the war \u201chave not changed,\u201d the US State Department said Monday it was \u201ccompletely confident\u201d Israel would go along with the proposal laid out by Biden. \u201cThe only thing standing in the way of an immediate ceasefire today is Hamas,\u201d Matthew Miller told a press briefing. But one key question remains: Will Hamas force Netanyahu to make the choice he now confronts? Or will Yahya Sinwar, Hamas\u2019s leader in Gaza, offer Netanyahu an escape hatch of his own making? Hamas said it viewed Biden\u2019s speech about the latest Israeli proposal \u201cpositively,\u201d but has yet to submit its official response. While the latest proposal makes major concessions to close the gap with Hamas\u2019s demands \u2013 including by offering a clear pathway to a permanent ceasefire \u2013 it still falls short of meeting all of the demands. It allows an initial 6-week ceasefire period to be extended for as long as the parties need to negotiate a permanent truce that includes the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza in a second phase of the deal. But it does not require Israel to commit to a permanent ceasefire upfront. Hamas\u2019s refusal to compromise on that point and sign off on this deal could let Netanyahu off the hook, and plunge Gaza into many more months of war.

{"id": "2024_05_30_weather_hawaii-power-cuts-wildfires", "text": "The main power utility in Hawaii will cut off electricity to some areas in future extreme weather conditions to avoid another wildfire disaster, the state announced Wednesday. The Public Safety Power Shutoff program is in response to last year\u2019s fire that\u00a0killed more than 100 people in Lahaina\u00a0on the island of Maui and left $6 billion in damages. \u201cThis means they may turn off power in high-risk wildfire areas during extreme weather conditions,\u201d the Hawaii Division of Consumer advocacy said in a\u00a0public notice\u00a0Wednesday. \u201cWhile this may create hardships for affected customers, PSPS aims to prevent wildfires caused by downed power lines.\u201d The new program goes into effect July 1. Hawaiian Electric says\u00a0on its website\u00a0that \u201ca best-case scenario\u201d would allow them to give people 24-48 hours\u2019 notice before a shutdown.\u00a0According to the public notice,\u00a0residents would be notified of a potential shutoff through news releases, social media, outage maps or the Hawaiian Electric website. If weather changes suddenly, then a shutoff may occur with little or no notice. High wind and red flag warnings were issued by the National Weather Service on August 8, the day of the devastating Maui wildfires. But during the disaster,\u00a0the community\u2019s siren warning system did not sound. Investigations\u00a0by the state and the Western Fire Chiefs Association said the disaster was exacerbated by lack of preparation and coordination. Maui County\u2019s top emergency management official\u00a0resigned\u00a0days after defending the siren\u2019s silence, citing health reasons. Maui\u2019s government filed a lawsuit in August accusing Hawaiian Electric of causing the wildfires. The lawsuit alleged the electric company\u00a0\u201cinexcusably kept their power lines energized,\u201d despite the National Weather Service\u2019s warning that winds could knock down power lines and cause fires. The utility announced Wednesday it designated\u00a0high-risk areas\u00a0in three of the state\u2019s counties \u2013 including parts of the west coast of Oahu, its most populous island \u2013 where emergency power shutoffs are authorized in a weather emergency. Hawaiian Electric says\u00a0over 48,000 customers\u00a0are in the affected areas. \u201cThis is an action that is a last line of defense,\u201d said Hawaiian Electric vice president Jim Kelly at a news conference. Hawaii\u2019s new power shutoff program is based on a\u00a0similar program\u00a0that has been in place in California since 2012.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/weather/hawaii-power-cuts-wildfires/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_style_franz-kafka-letter-writers-block-auction-intl-scli", "text": "A letter giving a rare insight into Franz Kafka\u2019s struggle with writer\u2019s block is going up for auction. Best-known for the 1915 novella \u201cThe Metamorphosis,\u201d the Prague-born Jewish writer struggled throughout his short life with anxiety, hopelessness and isolation \u2013 themes that came to define his work \u2013 but little has been known about his creative process. The one-page letter, which is expected to sell for \u00a370,000 to \u00a390,000 ($89,000 to $115,000) at Sotheby\u2019s in London, is dated to spring 1920, according to the auction house. This means it would have been written while Kafka was undergoing treatment for tuberculosis, with which he was diagnosed three years earlier. He took intermittent sick leave from his job with an insurance company and would often spend periods at sanatoriums. He retired in 1922 and died in a clinic near Vienna two years later. \u201cI haven\u2019t written anything for three years, what\u2019s published now are old things, I don\u2019t have any other work, not even started,\u201d Kafka lamented in the letter, written in German and addressed to his friend, the Austrian poet Albert Ehrenstein. Giving a reason for this literary dry spell, Kafka wrote: \u201cWhen worries have penetrated to a certain layer of inner existence, writing and complaining obviously cease, indeed my resistance was not too strong.\u201d The letter was written in response to Ehrenstein asking him to contribute to his magazine, Sotheby\u2019s said in a media statement issued Monday. Ehrenstein made the request after seeing a newly published work by Kafka \u2013 probably the 1919 short story collection \u201cEin Landarzt\u201d (\u201cA Country Doctor\u201d). \u201cThe life and works of Franz Kafka have long been a source of fascination throughout the world,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s Books & Manuscripts specialist Gabriel Heaton said in the release. \u201cThe letter reveals how writing made intense demands on him, and required deep reserves of inner strength, as he grappled with deep insecurity and worry about the futility of his work. We can also all be thankful that Kafka would continue to pick up his pen despite his crippling writer\u2019s block,\u201d he added. At the time the letter was written, Kafka had also begun an intense love affair with Czech journalist and writer Milena Jesensk\u00e1. So, despite his physical health continuing to decline, Kafka was given renewed confidence with Jesensk\u00e1\u2019s support and was able to begin his final literary endeavors, including \u201cA Hunger Artist\u201d and \u201cThe Castle,\u201d according to the release. Both these books were published posthumously, in 1924 and 1926, respectively \u2013 despite Kafka requesting that his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed upon his death. Though he was sought out by avant-garde publishers during his life, Kafka\u2019s greatest literary acclaim came posthumously. His works, all written in German, were rediscovered in Germany and Austria after 1945, and he began to have a huge influence on German literature that extended globally by the 1960s. They have been widely adapted for the cinema, TV and theater.

{"id": "2024_06_02_china_china-accuses-mi6-government-spies-intl-hnk", "text": "China on Monday accused Britain\u00a0of recruiting a married couple employed by\u00a0the Chinese central government to spy for its MI6 intelligence service, as the two countries trade allegations of espionage. In a statement, China\u2019s civilian spy agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), said it had recently cracked a \u201cmajor espionage case\u201d involving MI6, in which it uncovered two important moles \u201cplanted by the British side within our ranks.\u201d The allegation comes just weeks after British police charged three people with spying for Hong Kong\u2019s intelligence service, following charges laid in April against two other people accused of spying for China, including a former researcher for a prominent lawmaker in the ruling Conservative Party. Those charges in the United Kingdom came after China\u2019s MSS said in January it had detained the head of a foreign consultancy who had allegedly spied for MI6. Under Xi Jinping, China\u2019s most authoritarian leader in decades, the country\u2019s notoriously secretive spy agency has drastically raised its public profile and broadened its remit. From a shadowy organization without any discernable public face, the MSS has been transformed into a highly visible presence in public life. Over the last six months the MSS has made regular public declarations of dismantling foreign spying operations, claims which are impossible to verify given their nature but paint the agency in a positive light and provide regular reminders to Chinese citizens to be wary. In its latest statement Monday, the MSS detailed its allegations against the married couple. It said an alleged spy, identified by his surname Wang, was working at a position \u201cwith access to core confidential information\u201d in an unnamed central state organ. In 2015, Wang\u2019s application to study in the UK under an exchange program was \u201cswiftly approved\u201d because MI6 valued his access, according to the MSS. While studying in Britain, Wang was allegedly invited to meals and tours arranged by MI6 to understand his \u201ccharacter weaknesses and personal interests,\u201d MSS said. After finding out Wang had \u201ca strong desire for money,\u201d the British spy agency used an alumnus to lure him into a part-time consulting opportunity with high remuneration, MSS said. \u201cThe British side started with open research projects and gradually moved into core internal matters of our central state agencies, paying him a fee significantly higher than normal consulting rates. Although Wang was somewhat wary of this, he continued to provide so-called \u2018consulting\u2019 services to the British side under the lure of large sums of money,\u201d the MSS statement said. After a while, MI6 personnel approached Wang to work for the British government with promises of higher monetary rewards and security guarantees, the MSS alleged. Wang allegedly agreed to the terms and received espionage training before he was told to return to China to gather intelligence, the statement said. The MSS claimed MI6 also repeatedly urged Wang to persuade his wife \u2013 who worked at a \u201ccore\u201d government agency \u2013 to join the espionage, offering to double the money. Despite his initial hesitation, Wang and his wife, surnamed Zhou, eventually agreed, MSS alleged. The case is under further investigation, according to MSS. CNN has asked for comment from Britain\u2019s Foreign Office, which handles media enquiries for the Secret Intelligence Service, the official name for MI6. In August last year, the MSS made its social media debut: it launched an official account on WeChat, China\u2019s most popular social app, with a rallying call for \u201call members of society\u201d to join its fight against foreign infiltration. Its posts regularly rack up hundreds of thousands of views and are widely shared by state media outlets. According to the MSS, foreign spies are omnipresent and infiltrating everything \u2013 from mapping apps to weather stations. The ministry has previously posted details of what it claims are espionage activities carried out by Western spy agencies, and detailed how Chinese nationals studying or working abroad have allegedly been recruited by the CIA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/china/china-accuses-mi6-government-spies-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_europe_ukraine-french-weapons-russia-macron-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "France and Germany said Tuesday that Ukraine should be allowed to use their weapons against targets inside Russia from which Moscow attacks Ukraine. Speaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf\u00a0Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia. \u201cUkrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\u201d Macron said during his visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany. \u201cSo how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we\u2019re going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we\u2019re seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\u201d \u201cWe think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,\u201d Macron continued. Macron added, however, that \u201cwe must not allow them to hit other targets in Russia,\u201d including civilian or other military targets. Germany\u2019s Scholz echoed Macron\u2019s comments and said that Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons - including the United States - and international law. \u201cUkraine has every possibility under international law for what it is doing. That has to be said explicitly,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cI find it strange when some people argue that it should not be allowed to defend itself and take measures that are suitable for this.\u201d Western allies of Ukraine have long held the policy that donated weapons should be strictly limited to usage inside Ukrainian territory. The issue is a controversial one, with fears from Western leaders that if their weaponry is used to strike inside Russia, it would escalate the violence and trigger a wider war involving NATO. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly asked permission from his allies to expand the usage of the provided weapons to strike inside Russia. The United States, the largest arms supplier to Ukraine, has previously forbidden Kyiv from firing its weapons inside Russian territory over escalation concerns. However, in comments that appeared to hint at the possibility of a change in policy, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that the US would continue to \u201cadapt and adjust\u201d its support for Ukraine. \u201cAnother hallmark of our support for Ukraine over the last two years has been to adapt as the conditions have changed. Battlefields change. As what Russia does has changed in terms of how it is pursuing its aggression escalation, we\u2019ve adapted and adjusted too. And I am confident we will continue to do that,\u201d he said when asked about the possibility of allowing Ukraine to strike Russian soil. But Blinken also reiterated that at present the US has not enabled Ukraine to strike beyond its borders into Russia with US weaponry. \u201cWe haven\u2019t encouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine. Ukraine, as I\u2019ve said before, has to make its own decisions about the best way to effectively defend itself. We\u2019re going to make sure that it has the equipment that it needs to do that,\u201d Blinken said. When pressed on his remarks about adjusting and adapting, he added, \u201cWe\u2019re always listening. We\u2019re always learning, and we\u2019re always making determinations about what\u2019s necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself.\u201d Shift in red lines? Previous red lines drawn by Western leaders in their support for Ukraine have been crossed, including the provision of tanks, which was agreed in early 2023 to help Ukraine breach enemy defensive lines, and F-16 fighter jets, which European governments agreed to in the summer of 2023 after months of diplomatic pressure. France has supplied Ukraine with an unknown number of SCALP cruise missiles, according to the French Defense Ministry\u2019s website. The SCALP missiles have a range of up to 155 kilometers (96 miles) and carry a 400-kilogram (881-pound) high-explosive penetration warhead, according to the Missile Threat project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The SCALP is the equivalent of Britain\u2019s Storm Shadow, which has also been given to Ukraine, and which British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said earlier this month could be used at Kyiv\u2019s discretion. \u201cIn terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view it is their decision about how to use these weapons, they are defending their country, they were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps,\u201d Cameron said during a visit to Kyiv. \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss any caveats that we put on those things. But let\u2019s be absolutely clear: Russia has launched an attack\u00a0into Ukraine, and Ukraine absolutely has the right to strike back at Russia.\u201d France has also supplied Ukraine with a range of military weaponry, including Caesar self-propelled howitzers with a range of up to 42 kilometers. Macron stressed that the French arms are to be used only against targets from which attacks are launched into Ukraine. \u201cWe must not allow them to hit other targets in Russia,\u201d including civilian or other military targets, the French leader said. But Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed Ukraine could not use the long-range weapons without significant NATO support, and such involvement by the alliance could trigger \u201ca global conflict.\u201d For instance, \u201clong-range precision weapons cannot be used without space-based reconnaissance,\u201d Putin said Tuesday during a state visit to Uzbekistan. \u201cFinal target selection\u201d or \u201claunch mission\u201d for Western systems need to be made by \u201chighly skilled specialists who rely on this reconnaissance data,\u201d Putin said. \u201cSo, these officials from NATO countries, especially the ones based in Europe, particularly in small European countries, should be fully aware of what is at stake,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cThey should keep in mind that theirs are small and densely populated countries, which is a factor to reckon with before they start talking about striking deep into the Russian territory.\u201d Meanwhile, Ukraine got a key pledge of support on Tuesday from Belgium, which said it will supply Kyiv with 30 F-16 fighter jets in the next four years, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The deal was part of a bilateral security agreement signed between the two countries Tuesday in Brussels, according to the Ukrainian leader. The agreement includes at least $1.06 billion in Belgian military aid to Ukraine this year, with Belgium offering its long-term commitment to support Ukraine over the next 10 years, Zelensky detailed in a post on X. The first F-16 jets from Belgium will be delivered this year. \u201cThe agreement guarantees Belgium\u2019s timely security assistance, modern armored vehicles, equipment to meet Ukraine\u2019s air force and air defense needs, naval security, mine clearance, participation in the artillery ammunition coalition, and military training,\u201d Zelensky said. The meeting follows a similar agreement between Ukraine and Spain on Monday, with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announcing a $1.08 billion weapons deal for Ukraine. Alongside Belgium and Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Denmark, Finland and Canada have also signed security agreements.

{"id": "2024_05_31_middleeast_wfp-rafah-gaza-food-aid-intl-hnk", "text": "The United Nations food agency is unable to feed most civilians in Rafah, its local director warned Friday, with most border crossings closed amid what he described as \u201capocalyptic conditions\u201d and the Israeli military pushing further into Gaza\u2019s southernmost city. The World Food Programme (WFP) is currently serving only 27,000 people in\u00a0Rafah, according to Matthew Hollingworth, the organization\u2019s country director in Gaza. That\u2019s a tiny fraction of the roughly one million Gazans\u00a0who have been displaced from the area. \u201cThe sounds, the smells, the everyday life are horrific and apocalyptic,\u201d Hollingworth told journalists Friday after returning from a trip to Gaza. \u201cPeople sleep to the sounds of bombing, they sleep to the sounds of drones, they sleep to the sounds of war, as now tanks roll into parts of central\u00a0Rafah, which is only kilometers away. And they wake to the same sounds,\u201d said Hollingsworth. \u201cFrom the seventh of May to the 20th, not a single WFP truck crossed from the southern corridors of Egypt into\u00a0Rafah,\u201d he said. Rafah had previously been the central artery for aid to flow into Gaza, as the only border crossing not controlled by Israel. But since Israel seized control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing on May 7, aid has been blocked, with supplies piling up in Egypt and the enclave teetering close to\u00a0famine. Israel\u2019s military has continued to push further into Rafah, defying international concern and anger over its operations in the city. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on Friday that its troops were in central Rafah \u2013\u00a0confirming\u00a0what eyewitnesses told CNN earlier this week, when tanks were spotted there for the first time since it entered the city in May. \u201cIDF\u00a0troops in central Rafah located Hamas rocket launchers, terror tunnel shafts, and weapons. The troops also dismantled a Hamas weapons storage facility in the area,\u201d the\u00a0IDF\u00a0said in the statement. On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had established \u201coperational control\u201d over the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) buffer zone on the Palestinian side of the Egypt-Gaza border. The IDF\u2019s operations in Rafah have prompted a 67% drop in the amount of humanitarian aid getting through, according to the UN. Gaza is now receiving a daily average of 58 aid trucks \u2013 down from the daily average of 176 trucks between April and May, which itself is far from the 500 trucks that used to enter Gaza each day before the war broke out in October. With Rafah now the epicenter of hostilities, aid has continued to trickle in from two other crossings: Kerem Shalom in the south and Erez in the north. CNN has contacted WFP to clarify whether it managed to send trucks via alternative land crossings. The IDF said 36 trucks were transferred on Thursday through Kerem Shalom and Erez West on behalf of the WFP. Hollingworth added that the WFP\u2019s warehouse in\u00a0Rafah, which was once capable of storing 2,700 tons of food, is no longer operational. \u201cWe do not have the supplies available to provide significant numbers of ready-to-eat ration boxes. We don\u2019t have significant supplies of wheat flour to hand out to those families that have a stove to cook on,\u201d Hollingworth said \u2013 but added they are providing around 400,000 hot meals to families in central\u00a0Rafah.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/middleeast/wfp-rafah-gaza-food-aid-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

However he could be barred from the race: the country\u2019s cleric-led Guardian Council will vet candidates, and publish the list of qualified ones on June 11.

He was barred from standing in the 2017 election by the Guardian Council, a year after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned him that entering was \u201cnot in his interest and that of the country.\u201d A rift developed between the two after Ahmadinejad explicitly advocated checks on Khamenei\u2019s ultimate authority. In 2018, in rare criticism directed at Khamenei, Ahmadinejad wrote to him calling for \u201cfree\u201d elections. Khamenei had backed Ahmadinejad after his 2009 re-election triggered protests in which dozens of people were killed and hundreds arrested, rattling the ruling theocracy, before security forces led by the elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) stamped out the unrest.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/middleeast/iran-ahmadinejad-to-run-in-presidential-election-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

But their advanced age isn\u2019t going to stop them from making the transatlantic journey to honor their fallen comrades on the 80th anniversary of D-Day. On June 6, Foy \u2013 a survivor of the Battle of the Bulge \u2013 and his fellow American veterans will join dignitaries and heads of state from around the world to commemorate the approximately 160,000 Allied troops who, eight decades ago, carried out the largest seaborne invasion in human history. Foy told CNN that he has been to several memorials in France since 2014. The emotional resonance of each trip grows stronger year after year, he said, because these veterans know each trip could be their last. \u201cWe realize we\u2019re getting to the end of our time,\u201d Foy said. They are not alone. With major commemorations held every five years, organizers and government officials concede that this year\u2019s event could be the last to involve living veterans, whose stories of the horrors of war have become particularly poignant given that Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has brought a large-scale ground war back to Europe for the first time since 1945. \u201cWe are perfectly aware that for these centenarians, this is maybe the last chance to return to the beaches where they landed, where they fought and where their brothers-in-arms fell,\u201d said Gen. Michel Delion, the CEO of the French government agency in charge of the French commemoration efforts, Mission Liberation. The various countries putting together the event are now planning what is expected to be the most extensive D-Day commemoration in history \u2013 both in terms of size and, crucially for elderly veterans, logistics. Approximately 150 American veterans are expected to travel to Normandy \u2013 about two dozen of whom actually fought on D-Day \u2013 said Charles Djou, the secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC), the independent agency responsible for managing US military cemeteries and monuments overseas. The youngest is 96. Fifteen Canadian veterans, including three or four that fought on D-Day, are traveling with the Canadian delegation, according to John Desrosiers, the director of international operations for Veterans Affairs Canada. Desrosiers said the youngest traveling with the group is 98 and the eldest are 104. The British defense ministry said it expects more than 40 WWII veterans at the various events in Normandy. Those vets will be joined by about 25 heads of state and government, including US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not extended an invitation due to the war in Ukraine, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is planning on attending, according to a French presidential source. With so many heads of state in town, the security measures in place are intense. A massive contingent of 12,000 security personnel will be deployed on June 6, the French Interior Ministry said. Heavy travel restrictions put in place by French authorities will also effectively cut off the Norman coastline and the normally sleepy towns that dot it from the rest of the country. Yet June 6 typically sees these elderly men criss-cross the region to hit a full day\u2019s itinerary, including national ceremonies held at the American, British and Canadian cemeteries; the big international commemoration put on by France; and then, if they have the energy, more local events. Most veterans also travel with an entire phalanx of medical personnel. The charity that organized Foy\u2019s trip, the US-based Best Defense Foundation, is bringing three doctors and 10 nurses to accompany the 50 veterans they are flying over from the United States. Each veteran will travel with a personal caregiver \u2013 typically a family member or a friend. Officials say they are going to incredible lengths to treat veterans like royalty \u2013 as they are feted by actual royals. King Charles III will be there on June 6 \u2013 his first overseas trip since being diagnosed with cancer \u2013 alongside Queen Camilla and Prince William, Buckingham Palace said. Representatives from the royal families of Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands and Norway are also expected to attend. Delion\u2019s team has been holding rehearsals and timing wheelchair runs for the French-led international ceremony. They are also considering having veterans enter at the same time as heads of states and other dignitaries to reduce their waiting time. American and Canadian organizers told CNN that they will seat veterans last at their respective national ceremonies to keep them comfortable. The general public at the American event, for example, may need to be seated about an hour in advance due to security precautions. \u201cWe take care of the veterans who served and made the enormous sacrifices that they did in the Second World War,\u201d said Djou. Keeping the stories alive After being postponed 24 hours due to bad weather, D-Day began shortly after midnight on June 6, 1944, when paratroopers dropped into German-occupied France to lay the groundwork for the incoming invasion. Allied planes and warships began their bombardment at about 6:30 a.m., with troops hitting the beaches shortly after. They landed on a stretch of coastline 50 miles long organized into five beaches codenamed Gold, Juno, Omaha, Sword and Utah. The Americans were responsible for Omaha and Utah. The British led the assault on Gold and Sword, while the Canadians handled Juno. Though 4,414 Allied troops died that day and it would take more than a month to achieve one of D-Day\u2019s main objectives \u2013 liberating the strategically important city of Caen \u2013 the landings were considered a success. Allied troops had successfully made it onshore in France; it was the beginning of the end for Hitler and Nazi Germany. The sheer drama of the event has, for decades, captured the American public imagination, because of both the magnitude of the invasion and the fact that it was a \u201cdigestible\u201d turning point in the war, according to Ben Brands, a military historian at the ABMC. \u201cWorld War II, especially in Europe, becomes this ongoing battle from basically the moment troops land on the beaches of D-Day until Germany ultimately surrenders. The human mind needs to cut that up into digestible stories, and D-Day is a really powerful, discrete event that is so critical for everything that comes after,\u201d Brands said. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many powerful stories that come out of D-Day.\u201d As time has passed, veterans have played a crucial role in passing down the stories of D-Day. Their gripping, visceral first-hand accounts are better teachers of history than any textbook. But just a fraction of the soldiers who lived through D-Day are still alive. Of the 16.4 million Americans who served in the military during WWII, fewer than 100,000 are expected to still be alive by the end of the year, according to statistics from the US Department of Veterans Affairs. In Canada, there were just 9,297 living Canadian veterans who had served in either WWII or the Korean War as of March 31, 2023, according to the most recent statistics available from Veterans Affairs Canada. The British defense ministry said it does not keep veteran numbers on hand. It\u2019s unclear what the average age of a WWII veteran is. Given that the median age for an American WWII veteran in June 2020 was 93, according to US Census figures at the time, most surviving vets from Allied forces are likely to now be at least in their late-nineties. By the 85th anniversary in 2029, those who are still living will almost certainly be in triple digits. \u201cPeople are realizing this generation is passing and they\u2019re passing rapidly now, and it\u2019s important to keep their stories alive, to keep the memories of those who died and are buried at Normandy, but also those who fought and survived because they can no longer be with us for that much longer to tell these stories,\u201d Brands said. \u201cThe 80th will be a very powerful event.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/europe/d-day-80th-anniversary-commemoration-preview-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_europe_netenyahu-ceasefire-hamas-contradiction-biden-intl", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that the conditions for ending the country\u2019s war in Gaza \u201chave not changed,\u201d raising questions over a peace proposal\u00a0laid out by US President Joe Biden which he said Israel submitted. During a speech Friday, Biden said Hamas had been degraded to a point where it can no longer carry out the type of attack seen on October 7 that launched the current war. Part of the agreement, he said, would see a truce and hostage exchange while Israel and Hamas negotiate a permanent end to the fighting. It was perhaps the furthest Biden has gone in telling Israel its stated goals for its operation in Gaza\u00a0have\u00a0been met, and that the time has\u00a0arrived to stop the fighting. The proposal has been welcomed across the international community. The UN, the UK, France, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have all expressed support for Biden\u2019s proposal, while Qatar and Egypt joined the US in calling on Israel and Hamas to \u201cfinalize\u201d the proposed ceasefire agreement. For its part, Hamas said it viewed the plan \u201cpositively\u201d and is ready \u201cto deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire.\u201d But a statement from the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office on Saturday said Israel\u2019s goals \u2014 \u201cthe destruction of Hamas military and governing capabilities, the freeing of all hostages and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel\u201d \u2014 would need to be met before a permanent ceasefire can begin. \u201cUnder the proposal, Israel will continue to insist these conditions are met before a permanent ceasefire is put in place. The notion that Israel will agree to a permanent ceasefire before these conditions are fulfilled is a non-starter,\u201d the statement said. Saturday\u2019s statement largely reiterated earlier comments from the Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) made less than an hour after Biden detailed the peace proposal on Friday, with Netanyahu insisting the country would not end the war until Hamas is defeated and all hostages had been returned. For all the messaging, however, it is unclear exactly to what degree Israel supports the plan. The earlier PMO statement insisted the \u201cexact outline\u201d of the proposal allows Israel to \u201cmaintain\u201d its goals in the conflict. The Israeli online newspaper The Times of Israel said that Netanyahu\u2019s statement on Saturday was geared towards outlining what kind of ceasefire agreement Israel is prepared to agree to, rather than ruling one out. Domestic pressure mounts for Netanyahu Netanyahu is facing domestic pressure, both from opposition leaders to get a ceasefire agreement on the table, and from ministers within his own party not to back down on Israel\u2019s original war goals. Families of Israelis being held hostage are meanwhile urging him to accept the proposal. Protesters took to the streets of several cities across Israel on Saturday, demanding Netanyahu\u2019s resignation and for early elections to be held. They also demanded the release of all hostages held in Gaza and for the Israeli government to accept the latest proposal laid out by Biden. Families of hostages held in Gaza took part in protests in Tel Aviv, Caesaria, Haifa, Herzeliya, Kfar Saba. At Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, protesters called the names of the 125 hostages still in Hamas captivity. \u201cStart streaming this deal, so that it will start moving\u2026 Start working, start acting,\u201d a woman in Tel Aviv shouted over a loudspeaker. In Caesarea, protesters called for Netanyahu to accept the hostage release deal that Biden presented. \u201cThere is no victory until every last hostage is returned,\u201d people chanted. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid wrote on X Saturday that Israel\u2019s government \u201ccannot ignore President Biden\u2019s significant speech.\u201d Lapid said he was offering\u00a0Netanyahu a \u201csafety net,\u201d saying he would support\u00a0him\u00a0in securing a hostage deal if far-right ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich left the government. Gvir, Israel\u2019s National Security Minister, had previously threatened to leave\u00a0Netanyahu\u2019s coalition if a ceasefire is reached before Israel achieves its declared war aims. Also in his speech on Saturday, Biden alluded to the tensions in the Israeli government, making a direct appeal to ordinary\u00a0Israelis\u00a0to voice their support for a hostage agreement that would result in a ceasefire. \u201cI know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some, some are even in the government coalition,\u201d he said. The international pressure Netanyahu\u2019s government is facing to end the war in Gaza has also been mounting, as the conflict approaches its ninth month. The war was triggered by Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7, which left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 200 people taken hostage. The Israeli campaign in Gaza since then has killed more than 36,000 people. Fighting continues. This week, the Israeli military confirmed that it was operating in the centre of Rafah, southern Gaza, while a top Israeli security official warned the conflict could last into next year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/europe/netenyahu-ceasefire-hamas-contradiction-biden-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_weather_california-heat-dome-wildfires-west-climate", "text": "Searing heat and fire danger will quickly ramp up in California and the West this week as a summerlike heat dome parks over the region. Thermometers will top triple digits for the first time this year in some locations as the early season heat wave sends daily records tumbling. The official start of summer is just a few weeks away, but it will feel like July in much of the West as temperatures climb 20 degrees or more above average, the highest temperatures of the year so far for many locations. Excessive heat warnings are in effect for more than 10 million people in California, Nevada and Arizona this week. The warnings are the most extreme form of heat alert issued by the National Weather Service and are used when widespread, dangerous heat is expected. The soaring temperatures are being caused by a heat dome, a large area of high pressure that parks over an area, traps air and heats it with abundant sunshine for days or weeks. The resulting heat becomes more intense the longer a heat dome lasts. Dangerous heat will get underway Tuesday in parts of California and expand its reach into more of the Southwest by Wednesday and as a heat dome parks over the West. It will then reach the Pacific Northwest by late-week. The most extreme heat will avoid major population centers along the coast, but Los Angeles will still be 5 to 10 degrees warmer than normal this week. Temperatures will soar into the upper 90s and low 100s Tuesday in California\u2019s Central Valley \u2013 including where the Corral Fire is burning near Tracy. Sacramento is forecast to hit triple digits Tuesday for the first time this year. California\u2019s capital typically hits this threshold in early June, but last year it didn\u2019t happen until the end of the month. Triple-digit temperatures will become widespread in the Central Valley Wednesday and stick around into the weekend. Conditions will also sizzle in Southern California\u2019s desert regions. Death Valley, the hottest place in the world, is likely to reach a high temperature of at least 120 degrees by Thursday. Even the brutal desert landscape doesn\u2019t typically get this hot until mid-to-late June. The Southwest will start to bake by Wednesday as temperatures in parts of southern Arizona and far southern Nevada approach 110 degrees. Phoenix will likely have hit 110 degrees for the first time this year by Thursday even though the city doesn\u2019t typically encounter these temperatures until mid-June. High temperatures are forecast to climb into the low 110s in Las Vegas, more than three weeks earlier than the city typically exceeds this threshold. The early summerlike heat will threaten daily high temperature records across a significant portion of the West this week. Phoenix; Las Vegas; Flagstaff, Arizona; Reno, Nevada; and Fresno, California, are just a handful of cities where the day\u2019s high temperature record could fall. By Friday, records could be broken in parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Colorado as heat expands north and east. Fire danger will also rise while the heat is at its peak. Sizzling temperatures and low levels of humidity will dry out short-fuse fuels such as grasses and brush, making them more prone to burn. Breezy winds will develop at times, especially in California into midweek. The combination of these factors will make it easier for fires to ignite and spread. Corral Fire blazing in California\u2019s Central Valley The Corral Fire has consumed more than 14,000 acres of land in California\u2019s San Joaquin county since it ignited south of Tracy Saturday afternoon. Residents were ordered to evacuate over the weekend as the fire \u2013 initially fueled by gusty winds and dry, hot conditions \u2013 threatened communities. Firefighters gained an upper hand as winds eased Sunday and the blaze was\u00a075% contained by Monday morning, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Evacuation orders dropped to warnings Sunday evening as containment increased. Officials urged residents to remain vigilant and be ready to evacuate at a moment\u2019s notice, according to the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services. Two Alameda County firefighters were injured while responding to the\u00a0fire,\u00a0Cal Fire Battalion Chief Josh Silveira told CNN early Sunday morning. They had minor to moderate injuries and were transported to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment, Silveira said. A section of I-580 was closed in both directions over the weekend as the fire\u2019s thick smoke enveloped the roadway. All lanes were reopened Sunday night, according to the California Department of Transportation. The cause of the fire is under investigation, according to CAL Fire. Gusty winds up to 30 mph are possible through Tuesday, which could complicate ongoing containment efforts. Temperatures will also surge well into the 90s from Tuesday through the weekend. An excessive heat warning is in effect for the region from Tuesday through Thursday.

{"id": "2024_06_03_africa_burkina-faso-most-neglected-crisis-intl", "text": "Burkina Faso has been named the world\u2019s most neglected displacement crisis by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) for the second year. In its\u00a0annual report, released Monday, the NRC said the West African country saw a record-high 707,000 new displacements in 2023, driven by escalating violence and a worsening humanitarian crisis. Nine out of the 10 most neglected crises outlined in the report were in Africa, with Cameroon, Central African Republic, Mali, and Niger holding the second to fifth positions respectively. The NRC said in a\u00a0press release Monday\u00a0its criteria for neglected displacement crises are: \u201clack of humanitarian funding, lack of media attention, and a lack of international political and diplomatic initiatives compared to the number of people in need.\u201d The NCR report said 2023 saw a record-breaking shortfall in aid budgets of around $32 billion, leaving more than half of humanitarian needs worldwide unmet. Neglect now \u2018the new normal\u2019 The report said media coverage of the displacement crisis in Burkina Faso and international political engagement with the crisis were \u201cnegligible\u201d in 2023, adding that only 37% of requested humanitarian funding had been received by the country, leaving a significant gap in aid. \u201cThe utter neglect of displaced people has become the new normal,\u201d said Jan Egeland, Secretary General of NRC. \u201cThe local political and military elites disregard the suffering they cause, and the world is neither shocked nor compelled to act by stories of desperation and record-breaking statistics. We need a global reboot of solidarity and a refocus on where needs are greatest.\u201d The report added that media coverage in Burkina Faso also declined as \u201caccess became more difficult for both journalists and humanitarian organisations.\u201d Burkina Faso is currently under military rule after a junta staged a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in July 2022. Its junta, headed by acting president Captain Ibrahim Traore, has prioritized security due to the multiple lives claimed by attacks. But in April this year, a Human Rights Watch\u00a0(HRW) report found\u00a0that more than 200 people were killed by the country\u2019s military in a campaign against civilians accused of collaborating with armed groups, alleging these could amount to war crimes. Burkina Faso said it \u201cfirmly rejects and condemns such unfounded accusations,\u201d in a\u00a0government press release. The country\u2019s\u00a0media regulatory body, the Superior Council for Communication, announced in the following days it was temporarily suspending broadcasting and access to websites of some western news organizations including the French\u00a0TV5 Monde and Le Monde, the Guardian,\u00a0as well as BBC Africa and VOA. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remained one of the most neglected crises for the eighth consecutive year, with around 6.9 million people displaced by the end of 2023, mainly in the eastern provinces, the report said. A lack of aid forced people to resort to negative coping mechanisms, including exchanging sexual favors for food, money, and other survival needs, the report stated. Sudan came in at number ten. Although the war which broke out in April last year has resulted in a death toll in the tens of thousands, more than eight million people internally displaced and nearly 25 million people in need of aid, the NRC remarked the crisis has been \u201cgrossly neglected.\u201d Reccurent attacks Violence-related deaths in Burkina Faso doubled in 2023, according to the NRC. The country faces recurrent attacks often blamed on \u201cterrorists.\u201d In February last year, the murder of two Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) aid workers led the organization to suspend activities in the region. By the end of the year, up to two million people were trapped in 36 blockaded towns, with over 40,000 facing catastrophic food insecurity, according to the report. A displaced mother in northern Burkina Faso, Asseta, shared her struggle with NRC researchers: \u201cWhen we have nothing to cook, I pick leaves and boil them in water,\u201d she said, as quoted in the organization\u2019s release. Egeland emphasized the growing difficulty in reaching those in need due to dangerous roads and the prohibitively expensive minimal air services. \u201cDonors and humanitarians must prioritize areas that are out-of-sight to ensure they do not become out-of-mind,\u201d he urged. The NRC says around 6.3 million people will need humanitarian assistance in 2024, with over two million remaining internally displaced. Hundreds of civilians have already been killed in attacks this year, including around 170 in three villages in March, and approximately 30 in separate mosque and church attacks in February. The NRC\u2019s report noted that many neglected crises are interconnected, with ripple effects beyond borders affecting neighboring countries and sometimes causing broader regional impacts. Competition over resources between refugees and local communities, driven by a lack of funds, can also cause tension.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/africa/burkina-faso-most-neglected-crisis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_europe_ukraine-soldiers-germany-prosthetic-limbs-intl-cmd", "text": "Pavlo Kushnirov was among the Ukrainian soldiers fighting in the eastern city of Bakhmut with the 114th\u00a0territorial defense brigade on a sunny day last winter when Russian shelling\u00a0changed his life forever. \u201cFor two days our unit was under heavy bombardment from Russian artillery and drones. That morning \u2013 on 5 December \u2013 the shells found me,\u201d the 43-year-old bearded soldier, who now uses a wheelchair, told CNN in Berlin, as he pointed\u00a0to where his legs should be. Instead, there are two stumps: One of his legs is amputated just below the knee joint, the other is amputated above the knee. Fellow Ukrainian soldier Vitaliy Sayko-Kazakov, 42, served in the 19th Separate Rifle Battalion in Chervonopopivka, on the front line where Ukraine\u2019s Luhansk and Donetsk regions meet. His left leg was torn off during a battle with Russian forces on July 1 last year. \u201cI immediately put a tourniquet on myself and luckily remained conscious. On adrenaline, I guess, I saved myself,\u201d he said. His right leg sustained serious injuries with an open fracture and eventually had to be amputated in Lviv, he told CNN earlier this month in Berlin. For three months he was confined to his hospital bed. Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine has killed tens of thousands and left even more with lost limbs and other life-altering injuries since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. German officials estimate there are between 30,000 and 50,000 Ukrainian amputees as a result of the conflict. Obtaining adequate prosthetic limbs and care is tough inside Ukraine. Now a German non-governmental organization is working to bring wounded Ukrainian soldiers to Berlin so they can be fitted with custom-made artificial limbs and given treatment that will allow them to lead as normal a life as possible. Kushnirov and Sayko-Kazakov are among the first of 60 severely wounded Ukrainian soldiers who will receive treatment in Germany, thanks to the Berlin-based NGO \u201cLife Bridge Ukraine.\u201d They hope to start what they see as a new life soon. \u201cMy doctor called and said there was an opportunity to go abroad for me to receive prosthetics. So, I said OK,\u201d Vitaliy said. \u201cOnce there were hundreds of us, now there are thousands of people like me.\u201d Limbs amputated quickly to save lives Marko G\u00e4nsl, from German health care company Seeger,\u00a0is among five orthopedic technicians in Berlin who build custom-made prostheses for the soldiers. When CNN visited the wounded soldiers in their accommodation center for the first time, G\u00e4nsl was assessing the new patients. Bending over Kushnirov\u2019s leg stumps, he softly felt along them. \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d he asked.\u00a0Kushnirov shook his head as a translator relayed the question. \u201cLet me know if anything hurts,\u201d G\u00e4nsl said, taking out a tape to measure the stumps. He and other orthopedic technicians assessed the condition of Kushnirov\u2019s limbs. Battlefield conditions in Ukraine mean limbs must often be amputated quickly to save soldiers\u2019 lives. \u201cThe severity of the amputations often leave the survivors with stumps that won\u2019t allow for the fitting of regular-sized prosthetics,\u201d said G\u00e4nsl. \u201cAnd of course we are dealing here with completely different requirements (than what orthopedic technicians are used to in Germany).\u201d It will be relatively easy to provide a prosthesis for Kushnirov\u2019s right leg, G\u00e4nsl\u00a0said. However, his left leg will be more difficult to treat because it was amputated above the knee. G\u00e4nsl moved on to inspect the next patient: 27-year-old Valerii Omelchenko, who was drafted into the war three months after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \u201cI was on duty defending my country on November 23 last year when a Russian drone flew over me and a grenade exploded right in front of me,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI jumped away and pulled my legs into my chest to protect myself from the explosion which I knew was coming. But look at my legs, they are injured badly.\u201d Sitting in a wheelchair with his left leg amputated and the other one badly bruised and shattered, Omelchenko added: \u201cBut at least I am still alive.\u201d Keen to save his damaged leg, doctors in Germany kept it in a metal frame, or external fixator, at first while it healed. That has just been removed and he will be fitted with a prosthesis on the other leg soon. A bridge between two capitals Janine von Wolfersdorff, a Berlin-based financial expert who became involved in humanitarian aid work in Ukraine after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, is the initiator of Life Bridge Ukraine, a project\u00a0which is being run in partnership between the German and Ukrainian capitals. Under its auspices, experts in workshops in Berlin will make new limbs and teach the 60 patients chosen for treatment how to walk and move again. Von Wolfersdorff traveled\u00a0to Ukraine herself with a medical team to assess some of the most seriously injured soldiers. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to find the right patients in Ukraine. There are so many complex cases. At the same time, there are too few orthopedic technicians in Ukraine to provide all war victims with fast, adequate and good care,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cWe want to give Ukrainian war-wounded soldiers a new life\u00a0\u2013\u00a0and simultaneously want to train six Ukrainians for three months here in Berlin, who will learn to build very good quality prosthetics so that they can do it themselves in Kyiv.\u201d Von Wolfersdorff is collaborating closely with Kyiv\u2019s Mayor Vitali Klitschko and Berlin\u2019s Governing Mayor Kai Wegner on the project, hoping that a prosthetics center will be opened in Kyiv later this year. Ultimately,\u00a0her group wants to open further prosthetics centres in other Ukrainian cities as well. \u201cThe trainees learn here first-hand when a stump may need another amputation, another surgery, when a scar needs to be attended to again, and other issues that arise during this very complex process,\u201d Von Wolfersdorff\u00a0said. CNN met with Ukrainian trainee Volodymyr Havrylov in the Seeger workshop. \u201cIt takes time to train to do it correctly and get every detail right,\u201d he said. In the past few weeks, he has learnt that \u201csurgeons need to make a good stump. The better the stump is, the easier for us to make a stump receiver.\u201d Each patient requires a different treatment, Havrylov said, explaining that \u201csometimes the limb is too short, sometimes it is long\u00a0\u2013\u00a0sometimes there is not enough space for the fitting. Sometimes patients still have pain somewhere.\u201d Oftentimes there are other medical conditions that could influence the fitting of prosthetic limbs. Havrylov said he wants to learn \u201cas much as possible from the Germans and maybe even get better at it so that we can open our center in Kyiv and help there. Unfortunately, there will be more people with injuries. We need good workshops to provide our Ukrainians with a good life. We need to bring them back into society.\u201d Life Bridge Ukraine has collected around $600,000 in donations for the project, including for the care of the soldiers in Berlin. \u201cIt is a long process of recuperation,\u201d Von Wolfersdorff said. \u201cWe seek a holistic treatment approach:\u00a0In addition to a lot of physiotherapy, patients are offered psychological help, as well as nutritional advice, to reintegrate themselves into as\u00a0normal as possible\u00a0a\u00a0life.\u201d \u2018Completely new way of learning to walk\u2019 A few weeks later, CNN joined Kushnirov and Sayko-Kazakov for their first fittings in Seeger\u2019s Berlin workshop. Vitaliy looked at his new artificial limbs and smiled. \u201cThese are my two legs,\u201d he said, pointing at his new prosthetic limbs. \u201cOne and two. We are going to fit them today.\u201d With the help of the medical and orthopedic technician teams Sayko-Kazakov took his first steps\u00a0using them.\u00a0\u201cThese are cool feet. Really fine work.\u201d For Kushnirov, the initial fitting was trickier because of the artificial knee joint on one limb. \u201cUnfortunately walking will be more difficult for him,\u201d G\u00e4nsl explained. \u201cIt is a completely new way of learning how to walk.\u201d Kushnirov knows his rehabilitation process will take time, but he is determined to keep trying. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame I am losing so much time getting rehabilitated and I know it will still take me a lot of time. But of course, my life will improve,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to say what life will be like after my prosthetics fittings. I know it will be different.\u201d Sayko-Kazakov, Kushnirov and the other soldiers with new artificial limbs will receive a lot of training on how to move again in the coming weeks in Berlin. Any final adjustments that are needed will be made before they receive their permanent prosthetic fittings and leave to be cared for back home in Ukraine. \u201cIt is a lot of fun working together with our highly motivated patients and Ukrainian trainees, we see so much progress,\u201d G\u00e4nsl said. However, there will be challenges ahead for these soldiers even with their final artificial limbs. \u201cProsthetic fittings need to be adjusted again and again. It is a lifelong process,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, bodies change. Just as we occasionally put on weight over Christmas or lose weight when exercising, a stump does not grow with you.\u201d Both Sayko-Kazakov and Kushnirov are determined to return to Ukraine soon, walking comfortably with their new artificial limbs. They say they\ufeff are ready to support their units back home as they fight to fend off Russian forces. \u201cThe war is not yet over. Our work is not yet finished,\u201d Sayko-Kazakov said. \u201cI\u00a0often think of the guys who worked with me at the front line. So many lost their lives. So many I carried out on my shoulders. It hurts. When we go back, we can be useful on the home front, for example assembling drones.\u201d Kushnirov acknowledges his limitations\ufeff. \u201cI know I won\u2019t be able to walk again just like others do. I won\u2019t be able to fight at the front line anymore,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are a lot of other things I can do: I could operate a drone or take care of repair and maintenance works. Wherever I can help, I will do so. I will continue to fight for Ukraine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/europe/ukraine-soldiers-germany-prosthetic-limbs-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

Citing sources from inside the meeting, the Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica newspapers reported Monday that the Pope had made the comments while meeting with Italian bishops on May 20. The remarks took place in the context of proposals from the Italian bishops to amend guidelines on candidates to seminaries. The newspaper articles, which were translated from Italian, claimed the Pope had used an offensive noun which translates into English approximately as \u201cf*****ry, to describe some of the seminaries. The Vatican ruled in 2005 that the church cannot allow the ordination of men who are actively gay or have \u201cdeep-seated\u201d homosexual tendencies. In 2016, Francis upheld this ruling. Two years later he told the Italian bishops not to accept gay candidates for the priesthood. During his pontificate, the Pope has sought to offer a more welcoming approach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, saying \u201cwho am I to judge?\u201d when asked about gay priests, and has also offered the possibility that priests could offer informal blessings for same-sex couples. The Corriere della Sera newspaper stated that the Argentine pope, who speaks Italian as a second language, may not have been aware of how offensive his language was, adding that the remark was greeted with incredulous laughter by the bishops. A source close to the Pope told CNN that it could also be understood as there is a \u201cgay climate\u201d in the seminaries. There is no official transcript of the comments due to the nature of the closed-door meeting. CNN has reached out to the Vatican to request comment on whether the Pope used the term.

{"id": "2024_05_31_weather_power-grid-outages-us-texas-climate", "text": "Picture this: It\u2019s a Thursday night in Houston and thunderstorms are rolling in. Suddenly, winds roar past 100 mph. Trees snap, windows shatter and the city darkens as power flickers out. Even after it\u2019s over, it takes days for the lights to come back on in parts of the city. A week and a half later, the Tuesday morning commute is just getting underway in Dallas. Thunderstorms rush through the city, unleashing hurricane-strength wind gusts and torrential rain. Trees and power lines topple to the ground, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people. Many homes and businesses remain without power days later. That\u2019s exactly the scenario that played out in Texas over the past few weeks, and these kinds of outages are happening more frequently as destructive extreme weather thrashes the aging electric grid. From 2000 to 2023, 80% of all major US power outages were due to weather, according to analysis by Climate Central, a non-profit research group. The number of weather-related outages from 2014 to 2023 doubled compared to outages at the start of the century. Being without power is not only expensive \u2013 keeping people out of work and school, and keeping businesses closed \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous. There doesn\u2019t need to be a heat wave in Texas for summertime temperatures to soar to unhealthy levels. Heat is particularly dangerous without A/C at night, which is when the body needs to cool itself after a hot day. Experts say there could be ways to keep the lights on in the face of extreme conditions, even if there\u2019s no single perfect solution. Why can\u2019t the lights stay on? Power generation, transmission and distribution within the US happens on a power grid, an interconnected series of power plants, power lines and electrical substations. But the grid\u2019s infrastructure is aging fast and struggling to keep up with modern power demands, according to the US Department of Energy. It\u2019s also struggling as extreme weather gets more intense as the planet warms. \u201cOur (power) infrastructure was built for the weather of the past,\u201d Michael Webber, a professor of engineering at the University of Texas said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t built for the weather of the future, and the weather of the future is already here.\u201d A majority of the US electric grid was built in the 1960s and 1970s, but some of the first parts of the system were constructed in the early 1900s. And 70% of transmission lines in the US are approaching the end of their 50- to 80-year lifecycles, according to the DOE. Every element within the power grid is vulnerable in some way to extreme weather, Webber told CNN. Power is largely distributed by above-ground power lines from large transmission towers to smaller \u2013 and abundant \u2013 power poles. Most outages happen because of failures with power lines and poles, making them a \u201cbig weakness\u201d in the overall system, according to Webber. Severe weather \u2013 defined as thunderstorms, high winds, heavy rain and tornadoes \u2013 was far and away the main cause of weather-related major outages at 58%, according to Climate Central. And it directly impacts these exposed lines. Power lines and poles can be brought down by falling tree limbs, topple over in fierce winds and be snapped by heavy ice. Extreme events, like the derecho and tornado that tore through the Houston in mid-May, can turn massive transmission towers into mangled metal. Hurricanes, like 2021\u2019s Ida, inflict damage at a colossal scale. When infrastructure can\u2019t withstand extreme weather, it not only disrupts power, it also creates its own disasters: The massive Smokehouse Creek Fire ignited earlier this year after a \u201cdecayed\u201d power pole toppled in strong winds, according to a report from the Texas House of Representatives. But it\u2019s not just power lines and power poles under attack from extreme weather; the things that generate power can also take a beating. Blasts of frigid cold can freeze necessary equipment, leaving it unable to keep up with demand. Historic cold shuttered power plants and froze non-winterized wind turbines in Texas in 2021. The resulting power outages were vast and deadly in the brutal cold. Meanwhile, searing heat sends electricity demands skyrocketing as cooling needs surge. If power needs cannot be met, blackouts and brownouts arise. Equipment also overheats and fails if temperatures soar too high. Modernized equipment can keep the A/C running \u2013 for a price In order to keep power flowing during extreme weather, or restore it quickly in the aftermath, the US grid needs to be upgraded and fortified on a vast scale. It will cost trillions of dollars to do this well, according to Webber. Power poles, power lines and transmission equipment need to be built or rebuilt stronger and operate at a higher capacity to keep larger amounts of power flowing, even when demand spikes. At the most basic level, a wooden power pole is less durable and has a shorter lifespan than a metal pole. Installing sturdy, metal poles means more stay upright in extreme weather, but they could come at an environmental cost, given how energy intensive it is to make steel. Fortified power lines above ground will still sometimes be knocked over by violent storms, so another solution is to put power lines underground. Parts of the US are already doing this, including cities like Anaheim, California, and Fort Collins, Colorado. But burying electricity isn\u2019t perfect solution, either. Running power lines underground is often 10 times more expensive than building overhead wires, and the lines are susceptible to flooding and can be difficult for crews to service, according to Rob Gramlich, founder and president of Grid Strategies, a power grid consulting firm. Modernization of outdated power lines costs around $100,000 per mile, while new power lines can run anywhere from $1 million to $10 million per mile depending on geography and whether they are above or underground, according to Webber. But it\u2019s an investment that will pay for itself when fewer power lines spark devastating wildfires or outages that cost up to billions of dollars are avoided, Webber contends. A stronger grid also has to have smarter controls to rapidly reroute power where it\u2019s needed when outages do occur. \u201cAny number of things can happen to power generation in any one area,\u201d Gramlich told CNN. \u201cBut if you have fortified inter-regional transmission, you have an insurance policy against many risks.\u201d The US is designed so that if power needs in one region spike because of increased demand or power generation fails, another region steps in to help handle the load. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind make the grid more resilient by diversifying the number of ways power is generated if another method fails. But, the energy generated by renewable means is still delivered via the same vulnerable infrastructure as all other power. It may be an insurmountable task to eliminate weather-related power outages completely, but it should be possible to eradicate major, multi-day outages. \u201cUltimately, I think it really should be extremely rare to have a multi-day power outage,\u201d Gramlich said. \u201cWe can plan the whole electricity system so that never happens.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/weather/power-grid-outages-us-texas-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

It\u2019s a Russian S-300. On Russian territory. The first days after permission to use Western weapons on enemy territory,\u201d Ukrainian government minister Iryna Vereshchuk posted on Facebook alongside a picture purporting to show the strike. This comes just days after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes using US weapons in Russian territory around Kharkiv, after several European nations had removed restrictions on how the weapons can be used. It is unclear if the weapons used in the strike described by Vereshchuk were US-supplied. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Biden\u2019s decision to allow some strikes in Russian territory as a \u201cstep forward\u201d that will help his forces defend the embattled Kharkiv region, though some analysts have questioned whether the new freedoms will significantly bolster Ukraine\u2019s ability to repel Russia\u2019s invasion. Military analysts have tempered expectations, partly because the US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles). While the removal of this taboo appears to mark a new chapter in the war, Russia has already experienced Ukrainian strikes with Western weapons on territory to which it lays claim. Ukraine has frequently targeted occupied Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, using \u201cStorm Shadow\u201d missiles provided by the\u00a0UK. Ukraine also launched strikes on Kharkiv and Kherson in late 2022, as it sought to liberate the regions occupied by Russia in the early weeks of the war.

{"id": "2024_06_03_india_india-general-election-vote-counting-day-intl-hnk", "text": "Hundreds of millions of votes cast, more than six weeks of polling, and billions of dollars spent: India on Tuesday will declare a new leader after a mammoth nationwide election that has become a referendum on the last decade of leadership by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. His powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is seeking a supermajority in the lower house of parliament \u2013 or Lok Sabha \u2013 a goal which, if successful, would give it an unstoppable mandate to further enshrine its Hindu-nationalist agenda, deepening India\u2019s  move away from its secular foundations. Given India\u2019s strategic position in Asia and its booming economy, the election result will reverberate far beyond its borders, capturing the attention of the United States, China and Russia in particular. Some 642 million people cast their vote in the world\u2019s largest election, as swathes of the country was blanketed in searing heat, making people sick and killing dozens. Hoping to unseat India\u2019s charismatic but divisive leader is an alliance of more than two dozen parties, including the country\u2019s main opposition, the Indian National Congress, which is running on a platform of reducing inequality and upholding democratic institutions which it argues are at risk. Since assuming power in 2014, Modi has attained levels of popularity not seen in decades, owing to a raft of development and welfare programs, mixed with a strident brand of Hindu nationalism in a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith. Under Modi\u2019s leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power, making strides in technology and space. Yet, despite these successes, poverty and youth unemployment persist \u2013 particularly in rural areas \u2013 and the wealth gap has widened. Critics also say a decade of Modi\u2019s governance has led to growing religious polarization, with Islamophobia marginalizing much of the country\u2019s more than 200 million Muslims, and religious violence flaring up in a nation with a long history of communal tensions. Polling began on April 19 and ended on June 1. Nearly 1 billion Indians were eligible to vote for 543 seats in the lower house of parliament. The leader of the party that wins a majority will become prime minister and form a ruling government. Modi has set an ambitious target of securing a 400-seat supermajority, with 370 directly controlled by his BJP \u2013 up from 303 in 2019 \u2013 and the others from its National Democratic Alliance. His BJP centered its manifesto on job creation and anti-poverty programs, with a focus on women, the poor and farmers. He\u2019s promised to turn India into a developed nation by 2047 and transform the country into a global manufacturing hub. Yet, on the campaign trail, he has been accused of deploying openly divisive rhetoric that has been condemned as Islamophobic, while casting himself as an instrument chosen by God. Modi sparked a row over hate speech when he accused Muslims \u2013 who have been part of India for centuries \u2013 of being \u201cinfiltrators,\u201d and echoing a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists that Muslims are displacing the country\u2019s Hindu population by deliberately having large families. His BJP released several political videos targeting Muslims, one of which is under investigation by police. Congress has governed India for much of its independent history, having been instrumental in ending nearly 200 years of British colonial rule. But over the last decade, it has struggled to find relevance \u2013 partly due to a series of corruption scandals and infighting \u2013 unable to break through Modi\u2019s popularity. Rahul Gandhi, the son of the famed Gandhi dynasty, is the face of the party but lost the past two elections to Modi. He is contending once again from the southern state of Kerala and the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh in the north, also India\u2019s most populous. Opposition leaders and parties have faced a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year\u2019s election, with many accusing the BJP of using state agencies to stifle opponents. The arrest in March of the popular Aam Aadmi Party leader, chief minister of Delhi and staunch Modi critic Arvind Kejriwal sparked protests in the capital and prompted claims of a political \u201cconspiracy\u201d by his party \u2013 claims the BJP has denied. Kejriwal\u2019s release on interim bail last month galvanized the opposition to put up a tough fight against the BJP, uniting a group of political leaders who were once divided over ideological differences. The Congress\u2019 manifesto has also been dubbed one of India\u2019s most progressive, pledging \u201cfreedom from fear\u201d and vowing to protect freedom of speech, expression and religious belief espoused in the constitution. Turnout across all seven phases has slightly dipped from the record highs of 2019, yet India\u2019s general election remains the largest exercise in democracy, with hundreds of millions showing up to determine who will lead the world\u2019s most populous country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/india/india-general-election-vote-counting-day-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_world_russia-spies-us-recruitment-ukraine-war", "text": "Russia\u2019s brutal ongoing invasion of Ukraine has provided US intelligence services with a rare opening to recruit Kremlin insiders furious with the handling of the war. \u201cDisaffection creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity for us,\u201d said CIA Director Bill Burns last year during a speech in the United Kingdom. \u201cWe\u2019re very much open for business.\u201d \u201cThat business is the exchange of information that the asset or agent would provide for something that they want,\u201d said David McCloskey, former CIA officer and author of Moscow X. \u201cWe want people who have some sense of what [Russian] leaders\u2019 priorities are \u2013 what they\u2019re trying to accomplish.\u201d The ongoing recruitment effort is far from a state secret. The CIA has released Russian-language videos on social media appealing to the patriotism of disaffected Russians with access to information that could be helpful to the US. The effort highlights the evolution of an intelligence service that has historically conducted its essential mission of countering national security threats and informing policymakers under a shroud of secrecy. Indeed, until the CIA\u2019s internally unpopular and short-lived director, James Schlesinger, finally posted a sign on a highway marking the site of the ultra-secret organization\u2019s Virginia headquarters in 1973, its very location had been shielded from the public. Fast forward to today, when the spy agency is not only ubiquitous across social media platforms, it is actively using its newfound public-facing presence to accomplish one of CIA\u2019s primary objectives: recruiting foreign spies to steal secrets. Posts have included step-by-step instructions for would-be Russian informants on how to avoid detection by Russia\u2019s security services by using virtual private networks, or VPNs, and the Tor web browser to anonymously and through encryption contact the agency on the so-called Dark Web. The FBI launched a similar effort aimed at recruiting Russian government sources in the US, including geo-targeting social media ads to phones located near Russia\u2019s embassy in Washington. \u201cThis direct appeal is an unusual approach, but one which could prove effective in reaching a Russian populace with few options to express their discontent,\u201d said Douglas London, a former CIA station chief posted abroad. \u201cRussians angry with the Kremlin\u2019s state-sanctioned corruption and abuse, with no way to act openly, are left with few alternatives other than finding external support.\u201d But while the technology is new, espionage has underpinned, and often undermined, US-Russian relations for decades. That secret battle between intelligence services is the focus of a new CNN-BBC documentary \u2013 \u201cSecrets and Spies\u201d \u2013 which premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. ET. With never before heard interviews from Cold War spies and the traitors who sealed their fate, \u201cSecrets and Spies\u201d tracks the operatives who worked behind the scenes to steal and share vital intelligence as the world stood on the brink of nuclear war. Over 30 years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the world has returned to a period of great power conflict. In his latest book, CNN chief national security analyst Jim Sciutto describes it as \u201ca definitive break between the post-Cold War era and an entirely new and uncertain one.\u201d Like the Cold War of the past, espionage remains a vital tool for both sides of the latest conflict, as evidenced by tech-savvy US intelligence officers attempting to recruit new assets in plain sight, and Russian-linked operatives reportedly increasing operations across Europe. While espionage is illegal in every nation in the world, and undercover operatives have certainly been used for nefarious purposes such as sabotage, assassination, and election interference, \u201cSecrets and Spies\u201d pulls back the veil on a lesser-known, historically critical function of spying: to reduce uncertainty and miscalculation among nuclear-armed adversaries. As the documentary underscores, the espionage lessons of the Cold War could very well determine future global stability. \u201cYou have to know your enemy,\u201d said CNN presidential historian Tim Naftali. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, you can scare your enemy into doing something that neither of you wants to see happen.\u201d \u2013CNN\u2019s Sarah Moon, Alex Marquardt, and Donie O\u2019Sullivan contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/world/russia-spies-us-recruitment-ukraine-war/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_africa_south-africa-elections-polls-open-intl", "text": "Millions of South Africans are voting in what is expected to be the most pivotal general election since the end of apartheid. For months, polls have shown the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party could lose its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led it to power in 1994. While polling can be challenging in South Africa, most analysts believe that the ANC faces its stiffest challenge yet with a population deeply frustrated by the country\u2019s direction. If support for the ANC drops below 50% for the first time, the party will be forced to enter into a coalition government. ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Wednesday\u2019s vote \u201cone of the most important elections in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d while addressing a crowd of thousands at Soweto\u2019s FNB soccer stadium on Saturday. \u201cOur people will decide whether our country continues moving forward with the ANC towards a better, brighter future or backwards to a terrible past,\u201d Ramaphosa said. The South African leader, who cast his ballot at a polling station in Soweto, told reporters on Wednesday that he has \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that voters will again trust in the ANC. \u201cThis is the day when South Africa decides, decides on the future of our country, (on) who should lead the government of South Africa, and I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart of hearts that the people will once again invest confidence in the African National Congress to continue to lead this country,\u201d Ramaphosa\u00a0said. South Africa is the most unequal country in the world, according to the World Bank. Citizens are also contending with the highest sustained rate of unemployment in the world, rampant corruption, feeble economic growth, crippling power cuts and\u00a0rising violent crime. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the\u00a0failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Voters in Johannesburg told CNN they headed to vote shortly after polls opened at 7 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) on Wednesday, and many expressed their hopes that the country would move in a different direction. \u201cWe want to see the change,\u201d said Sydney Radebe. \u201cThis is a rich country but people don\u2019t have anything,\u201d the 66-year-old actor and filmmaker added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have land, we don\u2019t have property\u2026 you cannot own nothing and say you are \u2018free.\u2019\u201d Radebe was among the first early morning voters at one of the biggest polling stations in Johannesburg. On a crisp morning as the Southern Hemisphere heads into winter, the line of voters gradually began to grow inside Joubert Park. Events worker Newton Ugboh, 20, was voting for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m looking for change so I came early in the morning,\u201d he said. Ugboh said that some of his friends didn\u2019t want to vote as \u201cthey think things aren\u2019t going to change at all,\u201d but that there are \u201cbig issues\u201d facing young people in the country. The \u201cunemployment rate is crazy,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s a \u201cbig-time struggle to find work, most of my friends are unemployed.\u201d Healthcare worker Roselyne Tswakae, 46, said she\u2019s worried about the future of South Africa\u2019s youth and also believes \u201cit\u2019s time for change.\u201d \u201cYoung South Africans were promised that education would be the key to success, they went to university but they are unemployed and often end up getting involved in drugs, drinking, smoking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are hoping for the light,\u201d Tswakae added. Land surveyor David Ngobeni, 31, also said \u201cthere isn\u2019t much hope\u201d for young people in South Africa. He says unemployment, inflation, crime and corruption are the \u201cbig issues facing everyone right now.\u201d \u201cIf you have a job, you are very lucky,\u201d Ngobeni told CNN. He added that he hopes the outcome of this election will lead to inflation going down and boost the economy. At the very end of a long line in Joubert Park was 40-year-old Ncumisa Xabanisa. She said she has been voting for the same party since 1994 and is very loyal to the ANC. \u201cit\u2019s only one party for me, it\u2019s from home, it\u2019s from my grandmother, I grew up knowing them,\u201d Xabanisa told CNN. She said the major problem the country is facing is a lack of jobs. \u201cSome of us we went to school, we graduated but we have the certificates like it\u2019s a display. It\u2019s hurting.\u201d The mother-of-two added that she is educated but is currently sitting at home most of the time, and sells plastic food containers to make a living. There are 52 parties on this election\u2019s national ballot, including new parties formed by previous ANC members such as former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK). Zuma was forced to\u00a0resign as president in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court. The 82-year-old was barred from running for parliament last week after the country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled that five years must have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. However, his party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Capping off a heated few months of election campaigning, many of the largest parties held their final rallies this weekend, including the Democratic Alliance (DA), the official opposition party. \u201cOn Wednesday, the ANC will lose the outright majority it has abused for decades to subject the people of this country to unemployment, corruption and misrule\u2026 we close the ANC chapter of our history,\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen told supporters in the town of Benoni, east of Johannesburg. The DA has formed a coalition bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. This is the seventh general election South Africa has held since the end of white minority rule 30 years ago. A record 27.79 million people are registered to vote \u2013 the highest number to date, according to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC.) The country\u2019s electoral commission (IEC) said that, by 11 a.m. in South Africa, a \u201csignificant majority\u201d of voters had already cast their ballots, as lines to vote had formed before the polls opened. \u201cThis, we think, is testament to the enthusiasm of South Africans to record their political choice,\u201d the IEC\u2019s deputy CEO Masego Sheburi added during a briefing at the National Results Center. Sheburi said that some voting stations opened late, but by midday \u201cgood progress\u201d was made with \u201cminimal incidences\u201d across the country. One of the issues some polling stations faced was late delivery of ballot papers, mainly in the Johannesburg area, according to the IEC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/africa/south-africa-elections-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

Kim said the balloon were \u201cstrictly a responsive act\u201d to South Korea\u2019s years-long practice of sending balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets the other way. \u201cWe\u2019ve let the South Koreans experience enough of how dirty it feels and how much joint effort it takes to clean up spread-out rubbish,\u201d Kim said. A South\u00a0Korean official pledged his country would take\u00a0\u201cunendurable measures\u201d against North\u00a0Korea for sending more trash balloons this weekend, which will be \u201cspecified in the coming days.\u201d The official from the presidential office added that the government \u201cwill\u00a0not rule out the issue of resuming [playing] loudspeakers\u201d that used to blast propaganda across the demilitarized zone, but had been turned off since a military agreement was signed in 2018. South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff\u00a0said \u201cno substances harmful to safety\u201d were found among the hundreds more balloons that reached the country on Saturday evening \u2013 unlike just a few days ago when used toilet paper was found in some of the about 150 balloons that crossed the border. The latest photos released by the JCS show a large sack containing what appears to be paper left on the roadside, while other images show officers inspecting the garbage strewn on the ground. Others showed burned-out cigarette butts. According to images released by authorities, the packages are conveyed by large, gas-filled balloons. South Korea said its military is working with the police, local government, safety ministry, and the United Nations Command to safely retrieve the balloons and the debris. The balloons were found in the capital Seoul, as well as the provinces of Gyeonggi and Chungcheong. Some were even spotted more than 300 kilometers (over 185 miles) south of the capital, in Gyeongsang province. The two neighboring countries\u00a0have been cut off from each other since the end of the\u00a0Korean War in 1953\u00a0with an armistice. They are still technically at war. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s sister Kim Yo Jong \u2013 a senior official in the reclusive regime \u2013 called the balloons \u201csincere presents,.\u201d North Korea is almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers\u00a0sentenced to hard labor\u00a0for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including\u00a0parts of its pop culture,\u00a0to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries.

{"id": "2024_06_01_china_dong-jun-china-defense-minister-shangrila-intl-hnk", "text": "Taiwan is pursuing independence incrementally and those who support it will \u201cend up in self-destruction,\u201d China\u2019s new defense minister warned Sunday in a wide-ranging speech at a security summit in Singapore where the extent of regional tensions was on stark display. Minister of National Defense Adm. Dong Jun made the comments in a roughly 30-minute speech which comes days after Beijing staged major military exercises encircling the island of Taiwan after it inaugurated its new, democratically elected president last month. \u201cWe will take resolute actions to curb Taiwan independence and make sure such a plot never succeeds,\u201d Dong said speaking through a translator, while slamming \u201cexternal interfering forces\u201d for selling arms and having \u201cillegal official contacts\u201d with Taiwan, in an apparent reference to the United States, which maintains close, unofficial ties with Taiwan. \u201cChina stays committed to peaceful reunification. However, this prospect is increasingly being eroded by separatists for Taiwan independence and foreign forces,\u201d Dong warned. His comments come as there has been heightened concern in the region over Beijing\u2019s military and economic intimidation of Taiwan, which has grown more pronounced under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In a meeting with Dong on Friday, US defense chief Lloyd Austin called on China not to \u201cuse Taiwan\u2019s political transition \u2014 part of a normal, routine democratic process \u2014 as a pretext for coercive measures.\u201d China\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its own, despite never having controlled it and has vowed to \u201creunify\u201d with it, by force if necessary. Taiwan\u2019s new President Lai Ching-te and his party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), are both openly loathed by Beijing for championing Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty. Lai has said he favors the current status quo, proclaiming that \u201cTaiwan is already an independent sovereign country\u201d so there is \u201cno plan or need\u201d to declare independence. The US also by longstanding policy does not support Taiwan independence nor the unilateral change of the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. \u201cThe DPP authorities in Taiwan are pursuing separation in an incremental way. They are bent on erasing their Chinese identity of Taiwan and severing social, historical and cultural links across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Dong said, reiterating Beijing\u2019s rhetoric that they would be\u00a0\u201cnailed to the pillar of shame in history.\u201d Polls show growing numbers of the island\u2019s people \u2013 especially young people \u2013 view themselves as distinctly Taiwanese and have no desire to be part of China, an authoritarian one-party state compared to Taiwan\u2019s democracy. Less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification, and only 3% identify primarily as Chinese \u2013 while 67% see themselves as primarily Taiwanese. Taiwan called Dong\u2019s comments in Singapore \u201cprovocative and irrational.\u201d \u201cAny\u2026 coercive actions that disregard public opinion run contrary to democracy and human rights, or any resort to war will eventually be counterproductive,\u201d Taiwan\u2019s Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement. Dong, a former naval commander, is making his debut at the Shangri-la Dialogue security summit after being appointed to his position late last year following a surprise shake-up at the top of China\u2019s Defense Ministry. The gathering plays out amid a contentious security landscape across the region, where China is widely seen by its neighbors as using its military might to assert disputed territorial claims and bid for military prominence in a part of the world where the US has deep security ties. Chinese vessels and aircraft have been widely documented patrolling and making aggressive maneuvers against others operating in international waters and skies as it asserts disputed claims in the East and South China Seas. But Dong painted a different vision of China in his speech, framing it as a benign power whose military \u201cnever acts from the so-called position of strength,\u201d while taking oblique aim at the US saying, \u201cwe will not allow anyone to bring geopolitical conflicts or any war, whether hot or cold to our region.\u201d A \u2018limit\u2019 to restraint The Chinese defense chief also said there was a \u201climit to\u201d China\u2019s restraint when it comes to \u201cprovocations\u201d in the South China Sea, making an apparent reference to US treaty ally the Philippines, which Dong did not name directly. A \u201ccertain country\u201d was \u201cemboldened\u201d by outside powers and had \u201cmade mediated provocations,\u201d Dong said, while indirectly referencing the deployment of an American missile system during military drills in the Philippines in April. China has militarized islands in the disputed South China Sea, and in recent months its coast guard has fired water cannons and sought to counter Philippine vessels operating in disputed areas, further ratcheting tensions in the key strategic waterway. China claims historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea, despite a 2016 ruling at an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines against that claim. Dong\u2019s comments come after Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr on Friday denounced illegal, coercive and aggressive actions in the South China Sea at the opening of the same defense forum in Singapore. He also warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war. The Chinese defense chief also pushed back against concerns voiced by the US that dual-use exports from China are bolstering Russia\u2019s defense industrial base as it wages war in Ukraine. \u201cWe have never provided weapons to either party of the conflict. We have put stricter control on the export of dual-use\u00a0items and have never done anything to fan the flames,\u201d Dong said. The issue was raised during a meeting between Dong and US counterpart Austin \u2013 the first face-to-face talks between US and Chinese defense since 2022, with Austin indicating to China that there would be consequences if Beijing continues to support Russia militarily. Dong said China \u201cstays open to exchanges and cooperation with the US military.\u201d The annual security forum in Singapore \u2013 which is hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) \u2013 is a rare gathering of senior military officials from across the Asia-Pacific region, including those who are geopolitical rivals or view each other warily. It is also a rare opportunity to hear from, and pose questions to, senior Chinese military leaders. Many of the questions directed at Dong from delegates revolved around China\u2019s increased assertiveness throughout the region, particularly towards Taiwan and in the disputed South China Sea. Robert Ward, IISS Japan chair, told CNN he felt Dong\u2019s tone was \u201cmore shrill\u201d than he\u2019s seen in previous speeches by Chinese defense chiefs at the gathering. \u201cThe strategic environment in Asia has actually got more tense and I think we saw that in the Chinese defense minister\u2019s speech today,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThe tone was far harder this year than it was last year,\u201d he added. Meanwhile a senior US official had the following assessment. \u201cEvery year for three years, a new Chinese defense minister has come to Shangri-La,\u201d the official told CNN. \u201cAnd every year, they\u2019ve given a speech at complete odds with the reality of the PLA\u2019s coercive activity across the region. This year was no different.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/china/dong-jun-china-defense-minister-shangrila-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_americas_haiti-mss-pentagon-contracts-intl-latam", "text": "As preparations accelerate for a multinational security force to deploy to Haiti, federal contract opportunities from the US Department of Defense detail the minutiae of US involvement in planning for the mission. The Multinational Security Support mission, widely referred to as the MSS, aims to bolster local police in combatting the gangs currently overrunning Haiti\u2019s capital Port-au-Prince. After several delays, the Kenya-led mission is expected to arrive in the Caribbean nation in the coming weeks. The US \u00a0has championed the mission, offering to\u00a0provide hundreds of millions of dollars\u00a0in funding and resources, though drawing a line at boots on the ground. Recent contract opportunities posted to a US General Services Administration website by\u00a0the Defense Department (DOD)\u00a0illustrate how closely the US is involved in kitting out the multinational security\u00a0force \u2014 from security for their still-under-construction base to toothbrushes and internet. On Tuesday May 21, the Defense Department published a contract opportunity for commercial internet service providers capable of supporting about 1,400 users in Haiti, according to the website. Contract opportunities published the same day also advertise opportunities for vendors to provide \u201csundry items\u201d\u2014shampoo, toothbrushes, lotions, and other items\u2014and bedding for 1,300 people in Haiti. As conditions for the mission come together, US security contractors are already on the ground in Haiti, about 150 people as of now, a source familiar with the operation told CNN. A posting on the same website also shows that the\u00a0DOD awarded a $30 million contract to GardaWorld Federal Services LLC for private security and protection\u00a0services in Haiti for contractors preparing the\u00a0mission\u00a0base. GardaWorld, a Canadian company which\u00a0provides logistical, medical, and security services to government and commercial clients, told CNN\u00a0that they were contracted to provide these services at the housing site. The firm has previously been involved with protecting US diplomatic facilities in Afghanistan\u2014a role that is the subject of ongoing litigation initially brought by a former employee, Justin Fahn, who alleges in a whistleblower lawsuit\u00a0the company misled the US about its\u00a0employees\u2019 training. GardaWorld denies these claims in court records, and a spokesperson for the company\u00a0told CNN that it is employing \u201chighly trained security professionals\u201d to guard the facility in Haiti. \u201cBeyond the contract information made publicly available in the\u00a0sam.gov\u00a0platform, we would not have additional details to provide at this time,\u201d a Pentagon spokesperson said when reached for comment by CNN. A long-delayed mission Gang violence has wreaked havoc in Haiti, stifling civilians\u2019 access to food, water, and fuel. Armed groups control large swathes\u00a0of Haiti\u2019s capital city and forced the international airport in Port au Prince to shut down; after nearly three months, commercial flights resumed in mid-May. The MSS base is expected to be located close to Toussaint Louverture International Airport in capital city Port-au-Prince.\u00a0Satellite imagery captured on May 20 by\u00a0Maxar Technologies, obtained by CNN, shows a significant construction close to the\u00a0airport\u00a0since\u00a0mid-May.\u00a0The\u00a0expansion appears to include at least\u00a0five new structures and newly cleared land at the eastern end of the tarmac. US President Joe Biden\u00a0has said that he is working with Congress to provide $300 million for the mission and an additional $60 million for equipment to the country. \u201cThere\u2019s\u00a0going to be US\u00a0forces not on the ground, but we\u2019re going to supply logistics, intelligence, and equipment. Matter of fact, some equipment has already arrived,\u201d Biden said last week during a joint press conference with Kenyan\u00a0President William Ruto. In response to a question later in the briefing, Biden also sought to explain why the US isn\u2019t putting boots on the ground. \u201cFor the United States to deploy forces in the hemisphere just raises all kinds of questions that can be easily misrepresented about what we\u2019re trying to do\u2026 we want to do everything we can without once again looking like America is stepping over, deciding this is what must be done,\u201d Biden said. According to documents seen by CNN, the mission will be helmed by a Kenyan police commissioner and a Jamaican police lieutenant, with other top posts filled by Kenyan staff. The Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Chad, and Jamaica have also promised to contribute personnel to the mission. May 23 was the informal deadline for a contingent to be on the ground, but the initial deployment was delayed last week after a Kenyan delegation assessed that equipment on the ground was insufficient, according to sources in Haiti and DC. Sources said a primary concern for the Kenyan assessors \u2013 including several high-ranking police commanders \u2013 was whether there would be helicopters at the ready for medical evacuation. The MSS was authorized last year\u00a0by the United Nations Security Council\u00a0to\u00a0assist Haitian National Police in fighting gang violence and provide stability in the Caribbean country, following a request for military intervention by its government.\u00a0Police unions and law enforcement sources in Haiti have however complained about a lack of clear planning for how they will coordinate with the foreign force. CNN has reached out to the Haitian National Police for comment on the delay of the mission and logistical preparations for Haiti.

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added.

{"id": "2024_06_03_africa_nigerian-workers-declare-nationwide-strike-intl", "text": "A nationwide strike in Nigeria brought air travel to a standstill and plunged the country into darkness on Monday as union workers stormed the national grid and shut down the nation\u2019s power supply, according to the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). Tens of millions are without power and flights have been disrupted, as the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) initiated an indefinite strike. Operators from TCN were beaten and injured while they were forcibly removed from control rooms, the company said. Cane-swinging\u00a0union workers were also seen in photos circulating on social media Monday ordering personnel of the country\u2019s tax agency out of their offices. This strike comes after failed negotiations with the government to raise the federal minimum wage. The unions are also protesting a recent hike in electricity tariffs. The unions\u2019 demands include raising the minimum wage from 30,000 naira ($22.4) to 494,000 naira ($369.6). Presidential aide Bayo Onanuga dismissed these demands as \u201cunreasonable,\u201d in a post on the social media platform X. The government had proposed a 100% increase to 60,000 naira ($44.89), which the unions rejected, seeking a 1,547% increase instead, Onanuga added. Despite being Africa\u2019s fourth-largest economy, Nigeria\u2019s minimum wage is not among the continent\u2019s top ten, lagging far behind countries like Seychelles, where workers receive a minimum wage of $465.4 monthly. Health care system disrupted The strike has severely affected travel, leaving passengers stranded at major airports in Lagos and Abuja. Airport workers confirmed to CNN that all incoming and outgoing flights have been grounded, further compounding the crisis. Healthcare services have also been severely impacted, a Nigerian doctor Olusina Ajidahun told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m worried because the state of the healthcare system is on the verge of collapse,\u201d he said, adding that his medical facility located in southwest Nigeria was unable to power crucial hospital equipment due to the shutdown of the national grid. \u201cComing in the morning, the emergency (unit) and everywhere was dark. Patients and healthcare workers were all in darkness.\u201d Nigerian Justice Minister Lateef Fagbemi has declared the strike illegal in a letter to the labor unions, calling it \u201cpremature and ineffectual,\u201d in a statement posted by Onanuga. The strike has elicited mixed reactions from Nigerians on social media, with some declaring support, others saying it is detrimental to citizens. \u201cI support the strike action by the NLC. 30k or 60k minimum wage in 2024 Nigeria is unsustainable and unacceptable,\u201d wrote lawyer Festus Ogun in a post on X. \u201cThe NLC should refrain from actions that punish the common man \u2013 the average Nigerian. Electricity, roads, airports and other critical infrastructure should be left to function as normal,\u201d argued management consultant Dipo Awojide. Controversial expenditure Nigeria faces numerous economic challenges, including the devaluation of its currency which has dropped to record lows in recent months, as well as a cost-of-living crisis marked by soaring prices for food, transport, and health care. Inflation has reached 33.69%, according to the country\u2019s data office, the highest in nearly three decades. President Bola Tinubu\u2019s administration has faced criticism for controversial spending of public funds which has fueled public anger. Last month, the president approved a 90 billion-naira ($67 million) subsidy for Muslims attending the Hajj pilgrimage, and previously, he authorized multimillion-dollar budgets for luxury SUVs and renovations for presidential residences, as well as vehicles for the First Lady\u2019s office, which is not formally recognized under Nigerian law. Presidential spokesman Ajuri Ngelale admitted that the current wage is \u201cunsustainably low\u201d but warned that the unions\u2019 proposed increase would have severe economic consequences, including significantly higher school fees and potential mass retrenchment if schools and other institutions cannot afford the increased wages. \u201cNigerian parents will now have to grapple with school fees that are 10 times more than what they are paying today \u2026 you are going to mandate schools to pay cooks, janitors, and others 20 times more in wages?\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/africa/nigerian-workers-declare-nationwide-strike-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

And then I got fed up with show business.\u201d Weaving through the vault\u2019s underground network of tunnels, CNN was given a tour of the exhibition by Anwar\u2019s two sons, Samir, 45, and Zak, 43. The pair have followed in their father\u2019s footsteps to become royal photographers in their own right, snapping viral photos of younger generations of the royal family. \u201cDiana did really buck the trend, especially for royals. She changed so much, and things that are now seen as normal, such as what Kate or Meghan wear, it was really Diana that changed all of that,\u201d said Samir, standing in front of a floor-to-ceiling print of the famed \u201crevenge dress\u201d photo, taken at a Vanity Fair party on the same day that Charles publicly admitted to adultery. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t think she was going to come out, and then she just came out looking like a million dollars and made a really big statement that, \u2018I\u2019m not going to hide away, I\u2019m still going to be my own person,\u2019\u201d Zak added. For Anwar, it\u2019s a very different photo that stands out to him. \u201cThis was Diana\u2019s favorite,\u201d he said, looking up at a photo of Diana cradling a young cancer patient during a trip to a hospital in Lahore, Pakistan, in 1996. \u201cThe boy was blind. He smelled of all these chemicals they had been using, but she didn\u2019t care and she cuddled him,\u201d Anwar said. \u201cLater on, he died and she was very sad about that. It shows her humanitarian side.\u201d Over the years, Anwar and his sons have taken hundreds of thousands of photos of the royal family. There is one word, however, which seems to encapsulate the images on display: legacy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want (the exhibition) to be controversial. We wanted it to be a celebration of Diana\u2019s life and her legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had \u2018The Crown,\u2019 we\u2019ve had films about Diana, so it feels like there is a whole new generation experiencing it.\u201d And for Samir and Zak, their father\u2019s influence has also had a profound impact on their lives, something which is illustrated by two almost identical, yet eerily different, photos on display in another part of the exhibition. In the first photo, taken in 1992, Diana sits alone in front of the Taj Mahal in India, her red and purple suit, designed by Catherine Walker, is a pop of color against the softer backdrop of the ivory-white marble mausoleum. Anwar was told on the day of the Taj Mahal visit that Charles had other engagements, so Diana went without him, Zak says, recalling his father\u2019s recollections. \u201cShe ended up posing up in front of it, in front of this monument to love,\u201d he said. \u201cFairly soon afterwards, they announced their separation.\u201d Some 24 years later, Zak returned to the same spot to photograph Prince William and his wife, Catherine. \u201cThere was a lot of speculation. Would they recreate the picture of Diana there?\u201d Zak said. \u201cThey arrived and sat on the bench, but this time it\u2019s two people that are very much in love.\u201d In many ways, the exhibition is a love letter to two families: the Husseins behind the lens, multiple generations of royals in front of it. \u201c(Our father has) never done anything like this before,\u201d Samir said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting on now, he\u2019s a bit older and I think he really wanted to do a celebration of what he had done and a celebration of her as a person.\u201d In a statement, Anwar said: \u201cI am delighted that the images captured, as well as those of my sons, are coming home to London to recognize and memorialize such a remarkable woman and her sons.\u201d Tickets for the exhibition, which start at \u00a317 (about $22), include a 60-minute audio tour detailing the first-hand accounts behind each photograph.

{"id": "2024_05_29_europe_ukraine-war-us-tanks-intl", "text": "Ukrainian crews working on US-supplied Abrams tanks have told CNN of a series of the weaknesses and flaws\u00a0with the armored vehicles, calling into doubt their utility on\u00a0the war\u2019s\u00a0ever-changing frontlines.\u00a0The donation was announced by US President Joe Biden as evidence of the United States\u2019\u00a0\u201cenduring and unflagging commitment to Ukraine.\u201d CNN\u00a0journalists\u00a0were the first reporters to see the M1 Abrams in Ukraine, at a location in the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0east, where around six vehicles were visible, hiding in the foliage. Crews trained in Germany said the vehicles\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the US military\u2019s main $10\u00a0million\u00a0battle tank used in Iraq against Saddam\u00a0Hussein\u2019s\u00a0forces and insurgents \u2013 lacked armor that could stop modern weapons. \u201cIts armor is not sufficient for this moment,\u201d said one crew member, callsign Joker. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t protect the crew. For real, today this is the war of drones. So now, when the tank rolls out, they always try to hit\u00a0them.\u201d His colleague, Dnipro, added they are the \u201cnumber one target.\u201d \u201cWithout defense, the crew doesn\u2019t survive at the battlefield,\u201d\u00a0he said. The crew showed CNN their attempts to affix\u00a0active armor to one damaged tank.\u00a0They used\u00a0plates of plastic explosive that,\u00a0when hit by a round,\u00a0detonate and provide a protective counter-blast. All 31 Abrams deployed to Ukraine are engaged near the frontline in the east, according to officials in the 47th Mechanised Brigade, who took receipt of them all. The Ukrainian request for Abrams, complex and heavy tanks, sparked significant debate in early 2023, as the American vehicle has a complex supply chain.\u00a0Some versions even run\u00a0on jet fuel. Pentagon officials said in April that the Abrams were pulled back from the frontline due to the threat of Russian attack drones, although the 47th said some were still in action, despite the deficiencies that had\u00a0materialized. Much of the Ukrainian frontline is now dominated by the use of self-destructing attack drones, tiny and accurate devices that can swarm infantry and even cause significant damage to tanks. The advent of these so called First-Person Vision (FPV) drones, flown by soldiers wearing gaming goggles, has changed the nature of the war, limiting movement and introducing a new element of vulnerability to\u00a0armored\u00a0vehicles. This Ukrainian crew have learned of the Abrams\u2019 limitations the hard way, in pitched battles around the town of Avdiivka, which Russia finally took control of in February. A driver lost a leg when the\u00a0armor\u00a0was penetrated. Yet it is not just innovation that is hamstringing the tanks\u00a0\u2014\u00a0they appear to have technical issues too. One, parked under a tree, was almost immobile during CNN\u2019s visit, due to an engine problem, the crew say, despite the vehicle having just been shipped in from Poland. They also complain of how, in rain or fog, condensation can fry the electronics inside the vehicle. CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment. Ammunition is also a problem, like elsewhere on the Ukrainian frontline. They say they seem to have the wrong type for the fight they are in. \u201cWhat we have is more for direct tank-to-tank fights, which happens very rarely,\u201d Joker said. \u201cMuch more often we work as artillery. You need to take apart a tree-line or a building. We had a case when we fired 17 rounds into a house and it was still standing.\u201d The tank\u2019s poor performance has been mocked by Russian analysts, dubbing them \u201cempty tin cans.\u201d One model was captured by Russian forces and, damaged, paraded in Red Square. The Ukrainian crew expressed frustration the tanks were made for a NATO style of warfare, in which air power and artillery prepare the battlefield before tanks and infantry advance. Kyiv has long bemoaned its lack of artillery and air power. \u201cThey would never do it,\u201d Joker said, of NATO soldiers undertaking the same advances they make without air support. He switched to English to mimic a NATO soldier: \u201c\u2018Call the aviation, call the artillery,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no aviation and artillery. We have only tank. And it\u2019s the problem.\u201d A spokesperson for the Ukrainian defense ministry told CNN that \u201cUkraine is now testing and improving equipment that was not initially prepared for our war.\u201d \u201cWe are asking all countries to support us with equipment of any technical capacity levels. We use all of it accordingly,\u201d the spokesperson added. Biden\u2019s decision to supply the Abrams came after European allies pledged to send their own battle tanks in early 2023 ahead of Ukraine\u2019s failed summer counteroffensive last year, a step that had been deemed unthinkable months earlier. Kyiv\u2019s allies have slowly swallowed the red lines of what equipment they once refused to supply. F-16s may arrive in Ukraine in the months ahead. Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine\u2019s military commander, on Monday said he had signed initial paperwork to permit France to send military trainers into the country to try and reverse an\u00a0urgent manpower problem on the frontlines. France\u2019s\u00a0defense ministry\u00a0declined to\u00a0confirm the plan, but said it, and other ideas, had long been under discussion. The move would mark a significant escalation in the West\u2019s involvement in the war, now in its third year. The Ukrainian defense ministry later appeared to tamp down those expectations, saying in a statement to CNN that it had \u201cstarted internal paperwork to move forward when the decision is taken.\u201d For the Abrams crew, each delay in equipment or assistance costs the lives of friends. \u201cI only have one question,\u201d Joker said of US assistance. \u201cWhy is this taking so long and (comes) partially? We are losing time. It\u2019s death to us.\u201d Victoria Butenko contributed to this report.

{"id": "travel_shibuya-city-tokyo-public-drinking-ban-intl-hnk", "text": "One of Tokyo\u2019s most popular tourist neighborhoods is making a move to curb bad behavior \u2013 by taking alcohol indoors. The measure, which is expected to take effect in October, will see drinking alcohol forbidden on streets or public places in Shibuya from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. every day. The legal drinking age in Japan is 20. Shibuya City, which is a self-governed district within Tokyo, can make its own local regulations. Mayor Ken Hasebe recently told journalists: \u201cWe have been stepping up patrols and other efforts over the last year, but we have had people say, \u2018Well, the rules say you can drink, don\u2019t they?\u2019 By establishing the rule, we would like to convey the district\u2019s intentions, including during patrols \u2014 we would prefer people to enjoy their drinks inside restaurants.\u201d This news may not come as a surprise to local residents. Last fall, Shibuya banned Halloween-related activities in the district, with alcohol cited as a main reason behind the prohibition. That included a ban on drinking alcohol outside of bars and restaurants. Mayor Hasebe says that local businesses supported the regulations in October 2023 and were behind the push to make them permanent. \u201cThe damage caused by overtourism has become serious, resulting in property damage caused by drinking in the street, altercations with local residents, and littering of large amounts of empty cans and bottles,\u201d the city said in a statement last October. Shibuya is home to some of the capital\u2019s most popular attractions, including the Meiji Shrine, Yoyogi Park and the \u201cShibuya scramble,\u201d believed to be the world\u2019s busiest intersection. Japan has struggled to cope with overtourism since fully reopening post-pandemic. More than three million visitors visited the country in both April and May of this year, with the trend likely to continue through the summer. Educating visitors on the local culture has been a large component of dealing with the influx of international tourists. In the historic city of Kyoto, where it\u2019s possible to spot geisha and their apprentices (maiko) around the ancient alleyways, locals have tried to find ways to deter foreigners from harassing the women as they make their way to and from work. Kyoto\u2019s official tourism office has put up posters and distributed pamphlets about different social customs in Japan, from how to use toilets to whether to tip. The advice also extends to geisha, with visitors asked not to touch the women, pull on their kimonos, or take their photos without permission. Local Gion residents have also taken some measures themselves, such as blocking off private alleys. Despite those measures, though, \u201cgeisha paparazzi\u201d and other nuisance tourists still cause conflict between visitors and locals.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/shibuya-city-tokyo-public-drinking-ban-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

Many\u00a0critics argue\u00a0that Carter appeared to go out of her way to throw her hip and shoulder into Clark, whose back was turned and who tumbled to the ground after the foul. A day later, the WNBA upgraded the foul called against Carter to a Flagrant 1, which the league defines as \u201cunnecessary and/or excessive contact committed by a player against an opponent.\u201d Clark\u2019s Fever team went on to defeat the Sky 71-70 in the hard-fought game. Afterwards Carter refused to address the foul, telling reporters: \u201cI ain\u2019t answering no Caitlin Clark questions.\u201d Fever\u2019s general manager Lin Dunn posted on X, suggesting there\u2019s a \u201cdifference between tough defense and unnecessary \u2014 targeting actions!\u201d \u201cIt needs to stop! The league needs to \u201c cleanup\u201d the crap! That\u2019s NOT who this league is!! continued Dunn on X. CNN has contacted the WNBA for comment. For her part, Clark said of the foul in her postgame media conference: \u201cIt is what it is. I feel like I\u2019m just at the point where you accept it and don\u2019t retaliate. Just let them hit you, be what it is, don\u2019t let it get inside your head and know it\u2019s coming. \u201cI think at this point I know I\u2019m going to take a couple of hard shots a game and that\u2019s what it is. I\u2019m trying not to let it bother me and just stay in the game and stay in what\u2019s important because usually it\u2019s the second person that gets caught if you retaliate. \u201cSo I\u2019m just trying to stay in the game and focus on my team and focus on what\u2019s important.\u201d However, Fever coach Christie Sides later\u00a0took to social media\u00a0to demand the WNBA take action over the \u201cunacceptable\u201d situation.

{"id": "2024_05_31_asia_us-defense-chief-austin-shangrila-intl-hnk", "text": "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Saturday hailed the arrival of a \u201cnew convergence\u201d in the Indo-Pacific, as the United States fortifies\u00a0strategic and security partnerships in the region amid rising threats from China and Russia. \u201cToday, we are witnessing a new convergence around nearly all aspects of security in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d Austin said at the Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore. \u201cThis new convergence is producing a stronger, more resilient, and more capable network of partnerships. And that is defining a new era of security in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d The new convergence is not \u201ca single alliance or coalition,\u201d but instead \u201ca set of overlapping and complementary initiatives and institutions, propelled by both a shared vision and a shared sense of mutual obligation,\u201d Austin said. Looming large in that regional vision is a more assertive China, which Austin alluded to without mentioning it by name. The convergence, he said, is not about \u201cimposing one country\u2019s will\u201d or \u201cbullying or coercion,\u201d but common principles and beliefs including \u201cthe peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue \u2013 not coercion or conflict. And certainly not through so-called punishment.\u201d The remark appeared to be a thinly veiled reference to China\u2019s military drills around Taiwan last week, which Beijing said was a \u201cstrong punishment\u201d for the self-ruled island\u2019s \u201cseparatist acts.\u201d The massive show of force came just days after Taiwan swore in its new democratically elected leader Lai Ching-te, who called on Beijing to\u00a0cease its intimidation tactics. Austin said the new convergence helped the US make \u201chistoric progress\u201d in the past three years. \u201cWe\u2019ve strengthened stability on the Korean Peninsula. We\u2019ve supported the status quo across the Taiwan Strait. And we\u2019ve stood up for the rule of law in the South China Sea,\u201d he said. Under President Joe Biden, the US has bolstered ties with allies and like-minded partners in the Asia-Pacific region to counter a rising China, which under leader Xi Jinping has become increasingly\u00a0assertive\u00a0and belligerent about its many maritime and\u00a0territorial claims in the region \u2013 from Taiwan to the East and South China Seas. That bolstering of US ties has infuriated Beijing, which accuses Washington of leading a campaign of \u201cencirclement and suppression\u201d of China. Austin\u2019s emphasis on a \u201cnew convergence\u201d in Asia-Pacific appeared to have struck a raw nerve with the Chinese delegation in the audience. In the Q&A session, a Chinese colonel asked Austin whether the US is planning to build a NATO-like alliance system in the Asia-Pacific region, and blamed NATO for the Ukraine war. \u201cThe eastern border expansion of NATO has led to the Ukraine crisis. What implications do you think the straightening of the US alliances system in the Asia-Pacific will have on this region\u2019s security and stability?\u201d asked Cao Yanzhong, a\u00a0senior colonel\u00a0and\u00a0researcher\u00a0at the\u00a0Institute\u00a0of\u00a0War Studies\u00a0of the Academy\u00a0of\u00a0Military Sciences of the Chinese military. \u201cI respectfully disagree with your point that the expansion of NATO caused the Ukraine crisis,\u201d Austin replied, drawing a rare round of applause from the audience. \u201cThe Ukraine crisis obviously was caused because (Russian President) Mr (Vladimir) Putin made a decision to unlawfully invade his neighbor.\u201d The exchange came a day after Austin held his first face-to-face talks with China\u2019s Minister of National Defense Adm. Dong Jun on the sidelines of the defense forum. The rare talks between the US and Chinese defense chiefs touched on a host of fractious issues including Taiwan and China\u2019s relationship with Russia, as well as frictions in the South China Sea. On Saturday, Austin mentioned the meeting with Dong in his speech, saying they had a \u201cfrank discussion.\u201d \u201cThere is no substitute for direct military-to-military talks between senior leaders. And there\u2019s no substitute for open lines of communication to avoid misunderstandings and miscalculations,\u201d he said, adding that he looked forward to more talks with China. Austin also reiterated US commitment to its defense treaty with the Philippines, calling it \u201cironclad.\u201d Philippine President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr on Friday denounced illegal, coercive and aggressive actions in the South China Sea at the opening of the defense forum, saying peace, stability and prosperity in the waters was being undermined by other actors, without naming China. Austin also reaffirmed US commitment to the Asia-Pacific region, saying peace and stability across the region are crucial for the whole world. \u201cThe United States can be secure only if Asia is secure. That\u2019s why the United States has long maintained our presence in this region. And that\u2019s why we continue to make the investments necessary to meet our commitments to our allies and partners,\u201d he said. Hours after Austin\u00a0reaffirmed America\u2019s commitment to the Indo-Pacific, a Chinese military spokesman accused the United States of \u201ccreating division and provoking confrontation.\u201d \u201cThe US keeps creating chaos and has become the source of risks, as well as the destroyer to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d Jing Jianfeng, Deputy Chief of the Joint Staff Department at China\u2019s Central Military Commission, told a group of reporters in Singapore.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/asia/us-defense-chief-austin-shangrila-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_china_china-change6-moon-landing-intl-hnk-scn", "text": "China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-6 lunar lander successfully touched down on the far side of the moon Sunday morning Beijing time, in a significant step for the ambitious mission that could advance the country\u2019s aspirations of putting astronauts on the moon. The Chang\u2019e-6 probe landed in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, where it will begin to collect samples from the lunar surface, the China National Space Administration announced. China\u2019s most complex robotic lunar endeavor to date, the uncrewed mission aims to return samples to Earth from the moon\u2019s far side for the first time. The landing marks the second time a mission has successfully reached the far side of the moon. China first completed that historic feat in 2019 with its Chang\u2019e-4 probe. If all goes as planned, the mission \u2014 which began on May 3 and is expected to last 53 days \u2014 could be a\u00a0key milestone in China\u2019s push to become a\u00a0dominant space power. The country\u2019s plans include landing astronauts on the moon by 2030 and building a research base at its south pole \u2013 a region believed to contain water ice. Sunday\u2019s landing comes as a growing number of countries,\u00a0including the United States, eye the strategic and scientific benefits of expanded lunar exploration in an increasingly competitive field. Samples collected by the Chang\u2019e-6 lander could provide key clues into the origin and evolution of the moon, Earth and the solar system, experts say\u00a0\u2013 while the mission itself provides important data and technical practice to advance China\u2019s lunar ambitions. Chang\u2019e-6 touched down within an impact crater known as the Apollo Basin, located within the\u00a0sprawling, roughly 2,500-kilometer-diameter South Pole-Aitken Basin, according to Chinese state media Xinhua. It had orbited the moon for about 20 days as part of a larger probe, which is composed of four parts: an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a re-entry module. It is now expected to use a drill and a mechanical arm\u00a0to gather up to 2 kilograms of moon dust and rocks from the basin, a crater formed some 4 billion years ago. The probe will spend two days on the far side of the moon, and 14 hours to collect moon soil samples, Xinhua reported. To complete its mission, the lander will need to robotically stow those samples in an ascent vehicle that made the landing with it. The ascent vehicle will then return to lunar orbit, where it will\u00a0dock with and transfer the samples to\u00a0a re-entry capsule, according to mission information provided by the China National Space Administration. The re-entry capsule and orbiter will then travel back to Earth\u2019s orbit and separate, allowing the re-entry capsule to make its expected return later this month to the Siziwang Banner Landing Site in China\u2019s rural Inner Mongolia region. The technically complex mission is made more challenging due to where it is being conducted. The far side of the moon is out of range of normal communications, which means Chang\u2019e-6 must also rely on a satellite that was launched into lunar orbit in March, the Queqiao-2. China plans to launch\u00a0two more missions\u00a0in the Chang-e series as it nears its 2030 target of sending astronauts to the moon. Multiple nations are expanding their lunar programs, with a growing focus on securing access to resources and further deep-space exploration. Last year,\u00a0India landed\u00a0a spacecraft on the moon for the first time, while Russia\u2019s first lunar landing mission in decades ended in failure when its\u00a0Luna 25 probe crashed\u00a0into the moon\u2019s surface. In January, Japan became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, though its\u00a0Moon Sniper lander\u00a0faced power issues due to an incorrect landing angle. The following month, IM-1, a\u00a0NASA-funded mission\u00a0designed by Texas-based private firm Intuitive Machines, touched down close to the south pole. That landing \u2013 the first by a US-made spacecraft in over five decades \u2013 is among several planned commercial missions intended to explore the lunar surface before NASA attempts to return US astronauts there\u00a0as soon as 2026\u00a0and build its scientific base camp.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/china/china-change6-moon-landing-intl-hnk-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "style_worlds-largest-3d-printer-homes-maine-hnk-spc-intl", "text": "Dozens of 3D-printed homes have been built across the world \u2013 to house a family in the US state of Virginia or members of an impoverished community in rural Mexico. The world\u2019s largest 3D-printed neighborhood is currently under construction outside of Austin, Texas. The technology could be especially handy in a place like the US state of Maine, where approximately 80,000 new homes will be needed by 2030 to address a shortage, according to a report released last year by three state agencies. \u201cPeople can\u2019t find homes, they\u2019re very expensive. We also have an aging population \u2026 so there\u2019s less and less people who are electricians, plumbers, or builders,\u201d Habib Dagher, the executive director of the University of Maine\u2019s Advanced Structures and Composites Center (ASCC), told CNN via video call. He says he\u2019s got a solution. Last month, the ASCC unveiled what it says is the world\u2019s largest polymer 3D printer. Dagher hopes the-so-called \u201cFactory of the Future 1.0\u201d can help address the state\u2019s housing crisis \u2013 and revolutionize 3D-home-printing in the process. \u201cThe approach we\u2019ve taken is quite different from what you\u2019ve seen, and you\u2019ve been reading about for years,\u201d he says. A home every 48 hours In recent years, 3D-printing has been used to build everything from businesses to bridges to mosques. One non-profit is even working on printing schools in a war zone. Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, holds the Guinness World Record for the world\u2019s biggest 3D-printed structure and aims to have 25% of new buildings constructed with 3D printing technology by 2030. A great majority of current printing relies on concrete, with a robotic arm equipped with a nozzle layering wet concrete into the right shape. ASCC is flipping the script. Its giant printer, and its predecessor, which in 2019 was certified by Guinness World Records as the \u201clargest prototype polymer 3D printer,\u201d are the only printers building homes with wood residuals, says Dagher. The technology has already been tested. In late 2022, the university unveiled the \u201cBioHome3D,\u201d a 600-square-foot single-family unit which it says is the world\u2019s first 100% bio-based 3D-printed home, built from local wood fiber and bio-resin materials. \u201cWhen they\u2019re doing concrete, they\u2019re only printing the walls,\u201d says Dagher. He adds that the floor, roof and walls of the BioHome3D were all printed. Concrete homes also need to be built on site, he says. That can be problematic, especially during the snowy New England winter. \u201cWhen the weather goes bad for two weeks at a time, you can\u2019t print,\u201d he adds. By contrast, ASCC printed prefabricated modules at the university and bolted them together on site to create BioHome3D. The new printer can produce objects as large as 96 feet long by 32 feet wide by 18 feet\u202fhigh and can print up to 500 pounds per hour. Dagher says that the goal is to be able to print 1,000 pounds of material in an hour. At that rate, it could reproduce the BioHome3D in 48 hours, he says. If they can reach that target, their 3D-printed homes will be \u201cvery competitive with current housing construction costs,\u201d he adds. But it can be difficult to process wood materials at such a high speed. Even ASCC\u2019s record-breaking printers sometimes jam. While printing BioHome3D, for example, the printer stopped working due to a dust buildup. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever done this before with these kinds of materials,\u201d says Dagher. \u2018When can I have one?\u2019 The BioHome3D\u2019s warm wooden floors and walls give it the look of a sleek, modern Scandinavian-inspired log cabin. \u201cMany people feel concrete is a cold thing to look at and it\u2019s not necessarily where you want to live,\u201d says Dagher. The BioHome3D, however, is \u201cvery warm and inviting.\u201d It\u2019s also sustainable. When a home is no longer needed or wanted it can be ground up and used to print something else. ASCC is using wood residuals from Maine\u2019s sawmills in its research, and looking into scaling up production using these local byproducts. Thousands of people have toured the prototype on the university\u2019s Orono, Maine campus, and Dagher says it\u2019s a rare occurrence when a visitor doesn\u2019t ask, \u201c\u2019When can I have one?\u2019\u201d \u201cWe hear, \u2018You know, I\u2019m retiring, and I want to downsize. Can I put one of these up?\u2019\u201d Dagher says. There are some obstacles to overcome first. \u201cIt takes years for codes to change,\u201d says Dagher, referring to building codes that construction companies must meet. The printer won\u2019t displace traditional home construction, but in the future 3D printed homes are likely to comprise a larger share of the world\u2019s housing stock, he predicts. The ASCC is now doing work on how to incorporate conduits for wiring and plumbing \u201cexactly where an architect would want them\u201d into the printing process, he adds. The printer\u2019s next big project is a nine-home neighborhood for people experiencing homelessness. ASCC is partnering with a local NGO to design the structures, and printing is set to kick off in 2025.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/worlds-largest-3d-printer-homes-maine-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_style_becoming-karl-lagerfeld-show", "text": "\u201cI like anonymity,\u201d designer Karl Lagerfeld (played by Daniel Br\u00fchl) tells Jacques de Bascher (actor Th\u00e9odore Pellerin) in the first episode of \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld,\u201d a new six-part series based on Rapha\u00eblle Bacqu\u00e9\u2019s novel \u201cKaiser Karl.\u201d De Bascher \u2014 a fledgling writer and Lagerfeld\u2019s eventual love interest \u2014 has accompanied him to the fashion show of his friend and rival Yves Saint Laurent (played by Arnaud Valois). \u201cOf course,\u201d de Bacher deadpans. \u201cYou dress like the Sun King to go unnoticed.\u201d The Sun King was the nickname of King Louis XIV, who ruled over 17th and 18th century France in a procession of exaggerated sleeves, flowing ruffles and intricately patterned fabric. While Lagerfeld leaves off the tumbling dark wig, de Bacher\u2019s comparison is not unfounded. His wardrobe \u2014 which may occasionally inspire vague comparisons to Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci\u2019s character in \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d) \u2014 is a parade of flared trousers and elaborate tie pins; cravats matched to pocket squares, heeled boots, and a selection of ties that would put Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick in \u201cGossip Girl\u201d) to shame. It is a rich palette of jewel and earth tones; petrol blues and pinstripes. And while his signature starched collar and fingerless gloves are yet to make an appearance, his looks are already topped off with another of his soon-to-be trademarks: a pair of dark aviator sunglasses. Opening in 1972, \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d \u2014 which premieres on Hulu June 7 \u2014 follows its namesake\u2019s love life and career throughout the decade and into the spring of 1981, halting just before he began working with Chanel in 1983. Having joined ready-to-wear champion Chlo\u00e9 in 1966, Lagerfeld became the brand\u2019s lone designer in 1974. The show follows his drawn-out power struggle with Chlo\u00e9\u2019s founder Gaby Aghion (played by Agn\u00e8s Jaoui), who first discovered his talents but whose stubbornness prevents him from truly showing off his artistic, haute couture genius. It is a noticeable choice by the series creators to portray Lagerfeld so sympathetically. In 2023, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted its gala and corresponding exhibition in Lagerfeld\u2019s honor, critics were quick to point out the numerous controversial statements the designer had made about weight, women, immigrants, victims of sexual assault and gay marriage. In \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d he is brooding, combative and ambitious, sure \u2014 but we are equally encouraged to root for him. It is instead Saint Laurent who suffers the worst PR: in the love triangle that takes over the plot he is every inch the tortured artist, fawning desperately and pathetically over de Bascher; Lagerfeld, on the other hand, plays the aloof scorned lover. A man\u2019s world? One of the show\u2019s standout lines does point to Lagerfeld\u2019s sexist tendencies. \u201cFashion has nothing to do with women, or there wouldn\u2019t be so many gays in the business,\u201d he tells de Bascher at the same YSL show in the first episode. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of embodying the zeitgeist, of reflecting society\u2019s true nature.\u201d He is then roundly contradicted by Marlene Dietrich (played by Sunnyi Melles) who co-opts his own metaphor in the following episode to tell him, flatly, that \u201ca fashion designer is just a mirror for the woman he\u2019s dressing\u2026 You only exist if the reflection in the mirror pleases me.\u201d These might not be direct quotes from the real life Lagerfeld or Dietrich, but they do show the ego underlying Lagerfeld\u2019s character \u2013 and also pose the interesting question of how gender and power operate within the fashion industry. Despite Dietrich\u2019s protestations, the creators of \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d seem to side with their muse. Nearly all the female characters across the series appear as emotional support or pretty backdrops \u2014 canvases from which Lagerfeld and Saint Laurent may suspend their art. Parisian fashion in the 1970s was, \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d suggests, a scene broadly gatekept by a handful of squabbling men. The history of high fashion isn\u2019t that simple, though. Haute couture \u2014 where Lagerfeld was so eager to make his name \u2014 did not exist until 1858, and its arrival upset the existing trend of having female dressmakers. \u201cThe notion of haute (couture) and the client didn\u2019t exist until (Charles Frederick) Worth,\u201d Claire Wilcox, senior curator of fashion at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum, told CNN over the phone. \u201cIt was an important break in fashion history.\u201d Worth opened the very first house, earning the status of haute couture\u2019s \u201cfather\u201d. In a 2014 essay, historian Abigail Joseph wrote that before Worth, women were largely responsible for dressing other women, having first been given the right to enter the industry by \u2014 coincidentally \u2014 Louis XIV in 1675. By the time Worth opened his doors, women designers were so normalized that the idea of a male dressmaker raised eyebrows: Joseph described the accusations of effeminacy and \u201cinappropriate masculinity\u201d leveled at Worth; in Pierre Larousse\u2019s famed encyclopedia of the 19th century, he protested that fashion needed \u201cfairy-like fingers, not the build of an athlete, to be practiced properly and above all decently.\u201d By 1889, however, the tide had turned again: an edition of the \u201cPeterborough Express\u201d declared the name Worth \u201csynonymous with the center of the fashionable world\u201d. The \u201cLeitrim Advertiser,\u201d six years later, heralded his designs as \u201cdestined to revolutionize the world of feminine dress.\u201d The 20th century then saw a boom in couture houses modeled on Worth\u2019s example. While the likes of Chanel and Schiaparelli also made names for themselves, many of the biggest names were men, including Dior and Balmain in the 1940s and Givenchy in 1952. Neither this context nor women\u2019s relation to fashion is given much attention after Dietrich\u2019s diatribe, as the focus shifts increasingly to Lagerfeld and de Bascher\u2019s tumultuous relationship. \u201cBecoming Karl Lagerfeld\u201d is, stylistically, a luxurious tribute to \u201870s flair: gorgeous to look at and offering an aggressively humanized look at some of fashion\u2019s biggest names. But pulling harder at the thread of fashion\u2019s gendered power dynamics might have added a welcomed complexity.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/style/becoming-karl-lagerfeld-show/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_india_india-narendra-modi-meditation-island-election-intl-hnk", "text": "India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on his way to meditate inside an island shrine for two days to cap weeks of election campaigning \u2013 his latest public display of religiosity days after proclaiming he was sent by god. India\u2019s election is the world\u2019s largest, a mammoth exercise in democracy that has taken place over six weeks. The final day of voting takes place on Saturday and results will be announced three days later. Modi will visit the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari, a pilgrimage site off India\u2019s southernmost tip, from May 30 to June 1, according to Indian state broadcaster DD News. The site is where popular Hindu monk and philosopher Swami Vivekananda attained enlightenment. Modi has twice before ended an election campaign with meditation. But he has recently been making increasingly grand displays of piety, to capitalize on Hindu-nationalist sentiment as he eyes a third consecutive five-year term in power. In an interview last week with local news channel NDTV, Modi said: \u201cI\u2019m convinced that God has sent me for a purpose, and when that purpose is finished, my work will be done.\u201d \u201cGod doesn\u2019t reveal his cards. He just keeps making me do things,\u201d he continued. India is constitutionally bound to secularism, but since assuming power in 2014 Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have promoted a strident brand of Hindu nationalism that has deepened religious divides. When he first contested national elections a decade ago, Modi chose India\u2019s spiritual capital Varanasi as his constituency, making the ancient city the perfect backdrop to meld his religious and political ambitions. At the end of that campaign, Modi visited Pratapgad in the western state of Maharashtra, where the Hindu-led Maratha forces won a historic battle against the Mughal empire army in the 17th century. Toward the end of the 2019 national elections, which he also won, Modi went to meditate in the revered Kedarnath shrine dedicated to Hindu deity Lord Shiva high in the Himalayas. In January, just months before campaigning began, Modi consecrated the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, a controversial Hindu temple that was built on the site of a destroyed mosque, taking on a role typically reserved for priests. In a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith, critics say Modi\u2019s brandishing of Hinduism has led to rising Islamophobia and persecution of the country\u2019s more than 200 million Muslims. Modi and the\u00a0BJP have increasingly resorted to overtly Islamophobic language during his recent election speeches. In a controversial speech last month, Modi said that if the opposition wins, they would distribute the country\u2019s wealth among \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and \u201cthose who have more children,\u201d in apparent reference to the Muslim community.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/india/india-narendra-modi-meditation-island-election-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_01_middleeast_what-seven-months-of-war-mean-for-israel-hamas-mime-intl", "text": "Israel has warned that its war in Gaza could extend until the end of the year. National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi stated on Wednesday that the country anticipates \u201cseven more months of fighting\u201d to achieve its objective of destroying Hamas, a goal that remains unmet after more than seven months of conflict. Prolonging the war could have catastrophic consequences for Palestinians in the already ravaged territory and significant repercussions for Israel and beyond, experts said. It could further harm Israel\u2019s economy, influence its domestic politics, and damage its international standing and foreign relations.\u00a0It could also impact US politics, particularly as President Joe Biden gears up for the November elections. \u201cIt\u2019s a grueling grind forward,\u201d said Assaf Orion, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv and former head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) strategic planning division. \u201cWe see the day-in, day-out toll of that kind of fighting\u2026 On top of that, there is of course the political, diplomatic, informational and reputational issues, in which Israel is paying growing costs for the ongoing fight.\u201d Here\u2019s what seven more months of war could mean. More suffering for Palestinians The situation is deteriorating by the day inside Gaza and a continuation of the war is likely to significantly increase the suffering of the people there. In February, when the death toll in the territory stood at 28,000, researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health projected that if the war escalated the total number of deaths would surpass 72,000 by August. If the impact of epidemics sparked by the conflict is included, the toll could be close to 86,000 by then. Aid agencies have warned that civilians in Gaza are suffering from famine in parts of the enclave and that more airstrikes and more displacement in the south of the strip are only compounding the humanitarian crisis. Delivering much-needed aid into the territory is incredibly difficult. The amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza dropped by 67% after Israel launched its military offensive in Rafah earlier in May, the United Nations warned this week. \u201cWe once again call for a ceasefire and the release of all hostages,\u201d said Juliette Touma, director of communications at the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). \u201cThe longer this war goes on the more there is suffering for Israeli and Palestinian civilians.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s fate Experts suggest that both Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu see benefits in prolonging the war, as their political survival depends on it. A post-war scenario is unlikely to feature either party: Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas, and Netanyahu may face accountability for failing to prevent the October 7 attacks that triggered the conflict. Additionally, new elections in Israel could potentially unseat the longtime prime minister. \u201cMost Israelis support early elections, the largest proportion of which want elections as soon as the war is over,\u201d said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. \u201cSo, in this sense, an extended war might delay elections and therefore postpone Netanyahu\u2019s day of reckoning with the voters.\u201d A majority of Jewish Israelis would be willing to bear the burden of continued fighting for at least six months, Plesner told CNN, citing data from\u00a0a survey conducted between March 31 and April 3. \u201cSo, Israelis are ready for sustained fighting \u2013\u202fthe question is who they want leading them.\u201d A significant majority of Israelis believe that the time has come for those responsible for the failures of October 7 and the war to step down, he added. The Israeli leader has so far refused to take responsibility for the war, stating that such questions will be addressed only after the military achieves its goals: the release of hostages and the elimination of Hamas. Israel has lost 292 soldiers in Gaza since it began its ground offensive there, which came in retaliation to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 others, according to Israeli officials. \u00a0More than 36,000 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the health ministry in the territory. Netanyahu also faces intense pressure from hardline members of his fragile coalition to continue the war. Some have threatened to quit the government if he accepts a ceasefire deal before Hamas is eliminated. Israeli diplomacy Israel\u2019s diplomatic isolation could grow if the war drags on. The government has become the target of increased censure on the world stage, drawing sharp criticism from some of its closest allies in Europe for its conduct. It has withdrawn envoys from three European nations, in response to them formally recognizing a Palestinian state, and had several South American and other countries downgrade diplomatic relations. Legal action could also escalate. Netanyahu is facing a potential arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court over some of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, and Israel is facing a genocide case at the International Court of Justice. That court has ordered Israel to halt its military operation in Rafah, a legally binding order that Israel has so far ignored. An extended war may also further delay prospects of normalization with Saudi Arabia, something Netanyahu singled out as a priority for his government before the October 7 attack. This conflict has derailed those efforts and the Jewish state has come under harsh criticism from Riyadh, as well as other Arab states that already have diplomatic ties with Israel, including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Egypt, the first Arab nation to recognize Israel, has warned its neighbor against stationing troops so close to its border. At least one member of Egyptian security personnel was killed during a shooting incident on the Egypt-Gaza border this week. \u201cIt is a deep conundrum,\u201d Orion of INSS said. For Israel, it is difficult to balance between the need to make sure Hamas will never again be able to launch another attack, with the duty to release the remaining hostages and other costs Israel is paying, he said. \u201cAnd currently Hamas doesn\u2019t seem to be ready to release them.\u201d Impact on Israel\u2019s economy The war hit Israel\u2019s economy hard in the immediate aftermath of October 7. In the fourth quarter of 2023, economic output plunged 21.7% compared to the year earlier, falling for the first time in nearly two years before rebounding in the next quarter. Despite the recovery, credit rating agency S&P Global said it expects the Israeli economy to recover slower than in previous downturns. In April, the agency downgraded Israel\u2019s credit rating, a measurement of the government\u2019s ability to repay its debts, and warned about further downgrades in the future. It expected the government\u2019s budget deficit to widen, \u201cmostly as a result of increased defense spending.\u201d Moody\u2019s Investors Service, another rating agency, also downgraded Israel, warning that the war will become a significant economic and political burden for the country over the long haul. It expects Israel\u2019s defense spending to be nearly double the level of 2022 by the end of 2024, and potentially rise even higher in coming years. Troops, ammunition, funding and the supply of arms are ultimately not endless, especially for a small country, Orion said. While the war in Gaza has been fought at varying intensity since October 7, it is nonetheless \u201cexacting a very high cost on Israel.\u201d Since its founding in 1948, Israel has fought numerous wars, but this one is its costliest. As of January, the Israeli military was spending $272 million per day on the war, according to the Israeli news site Ynet. By that time, the total cost had reached an estimated $60 billion, factoring in military expenses, damage to civilian infrastructure and compensation to Israeli businesses. This figure has likely increased significantly since then. Israel\u2019s decision-makers have taken notice. When the military initiated a partial withdrawal from Gaza in January, IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari cited economic concerns as one of the reasons, stating that it would \u201csignificantly ease the burden.\u201d Plesner said the government hasn\u2019t taken the necessary steps to mitigate economic damage. While Israel\u2019s economy has bounced back from previous conflicts and crises, he said, a prolonged war may make a recovery more challenging. \u201cThere are not sufficient funds available to cover the costs associated with the war on both the military and civilian related costs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer the war goes on, the deeper its economic impact.\u201d Biden\u2019s prospects for re-election The war is having deep consequences for US domestic politics and is weighing heavily on Biden\u2019s re-election bid. The president has been facing a severe backlash at home from progressive, young and Arab American voters that could put his re-election hopes in several key swing states in jeopardy. Biden has consistently supported Israel, offering it almost unconditional diplomatic and legal protection on the global stage. However, his administration has also taken unprecedented punitive measures against the Jewish state, including sanctions on West Bank settlers and withholding American arms that could be used against civilians in Rafah. Despite these efforts, the war persists, civilian casualties rise and famine spreads in Gaza, intensifying pressure from some of his electorate. A CNN poll last month found that Biden\u2019s handling of the war yields 28% approval to 71% disapproval, including an 81% disapproval mark among those younger than 35 and majority disapproval among Democrats (53%). In a speech at the White House on Friday, Biden laid out a three-phase proposal\u00a0Israel has submitted\u00a0to wind down the grinding crisis as he\u00a0declared, \u201cIt\u2019s time\u00a0for this war to end.\u201d It was perhaps the furthest Biden has gone in telling Israel its stated goals for its operation in Gaza\u00a0have\u00a0been met, and that the time has\u00a0arrived to stop the fighting as part of a hostage deal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/01/middleeast/what-seven-months-of-war-mean-for-israel-hamas-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_africa_south-africa-election-results-intl", "text": "South Africa\u2019s ruling African National Congress party has lost its majority for the first time in 30 years after national elections this week, marking the biggest political shift in the country since the end of apartheid. Nelson Mandela\u2019s party suffered a seismic blow at the polls, final election results announced on Sunday confirmed. Support for the ANC dropped to 40.18%, a huge slump from the 57.5% it received in the last election in 2019. The official opposition party, the centrist Democratic Alliance (DA), received 21.8% of the vote. Former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) had nearly 14.59% of the vote. Another ANC splinter party \u2013 the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) \u2013 had nearly 10%, with results at 9.52% The blow to the ANC comes after\u00a0years of corruption scandals and economic mismanagement.\u00a0\u00a0As a result,\u00a0the ANC will be forced to form a coalition to govern\u00a0the world\u2019s most unequal country. Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa and the ANC \u2013 and once Mandela\u2019s favorite to succeed him as leader \u2013 promised a \u201cnew dawn\u201d when he took over in 2018 from disgraced former president Jacob Zuma. But many feel those promises never\u00a0materialized\u00a0and the\u00a0election\u00a0results reflect\u00a0a population deeply frustrated with the country\u2019s direction. South Africans could now face weeks of political uncertainty, as the ANC seeks to strike a coalition deal with former rivals. \u201cOur people have spoken, whether we like it or not they have spoken,\u201d Ramaphosa told an audience after the official results were announced. He added that the voices of the people had been \u201cheard\u201d and \u201cwe must respect their choices and their wishes.\u201d The\u00a0rebuke to the ANC\u00a0was hardly unexpected,\u00a0mirroring widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling party.\u00a0But the scale of the losses surprised some. \u201cWhat we have seen is voters are unhappy with the ANC\u2019s recent history. In particular\u00a0what happened in the Zuma years and what followed on from that,\u201d analyst and former ANC MP Melanie Verwoerd told CNN. There has been \u201ca general arrogance and loss of connection with the general voter from the ANC side,\u201d Verwoerd said, adding that parties like MK and the EFF have capitalized on\u00a0that discontent. Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to\u00a0resign as leader in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court.\u00a0The Constitutional Court barred the\u00a082-year-old\u00a0from running for parliament\u00a0in May, but\u00a0his face remained on the MK party ballot. The results from Wednesday\u2019s poll were officially announced despite protests from Zuma and his MK party. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a recount. We want a total revote,\u201d the party\u2019s spokesperson Nhlamulo Ndhlela said Saturday evening. Zuma told a press briefing the party wanted a chance to present its case before the results were announced. South Africa\u2019s electoral commission had already extended the deadline for submissions of objections and appeals to 6 p.m. local time on Saturday. It received more than 500 objections. ANC in uncharted territory Substantial bargaining for the coalition government will now begin.\u00a0Political parties will have two weeks to form a coalition before a new parliament must convene to elect the nation\u2019s president.\u00a0If they fail, new elections will need to be held. ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula admitted Sunday there was \u201cnothing to celebrate\u201d following the party\u2019s blow at the polls. \u201cWe wish to assure the people of South Africa that we have heard them. We have heard their concerns, their frustrations and their dissatisfaction,\u201d Mbalula told a media briefing. However, he warned potential coalition partners if they demand party leader Ramaphosa must step down \u201cthis is not going to happen.\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen told CNN during an interview at the election\u2019s National Results Center that he had \u201cno sympathy for Mr. Ramaphosa and his party.\u201d \u201cIt is their spinelessness to deal with the prospect of Mr. Zuma and his sins of omission and commission that has led to him being a political force now that has come and wiped them out in places like KwaZulu-Natal and other parts of the country.\u201d The populous coastal eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, where the major city of Durban is located and which is Zuma\u2019s home province, has traditionally been a stronghold of the conservative Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). This time around, the MK party earned almost 46% of the provincial vote, but failed to get a majority and will be forced to find a coalition partner if it wants to govern the province. Zuma has faced\u00a0hundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u00a0over the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \u201cTeflon President\u201d because few politicians could have survived the scandals he has faced and weathered. Analysts CNN spoke to, including Verwoerd,\u00a0believe the most likely coalition is between the ANC and DA. But others are more sceptical of that outcome.\u00a0They all agree that the country is in uncharted territory. Steenhuisen told CNN he wants to be part of a governing coalition and he believes a coalition \u201ccan work.\u201d Before\u00a0the election, the DA had already formed a\u00a0bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. What he labels a \u201cdoomsday coalition\u201d is one of the other options on the table: a deal between the ANC-EFF\u00a0or\u00a0even\u00a0the\u00a0MK. But with such disdain inside those breakaway parties for\u00a0Ramaphosa, it would be quite some negotiation. The EFF is led by\u00a0former ANC youth leader Julius Malema. It espouses the expropriation of land without compensation and sweeping state nationalism.\u00a0The MK party\u2019s manifesto\u00a0holds\u00a0broadly\u00a0similar ideas and demands\u00a0an overhaul of the country\u2019s constitution\u00a0to restore more powers to traditional leaders. Not since the dawn of democracy in 1994 has South Africa\u2019s political landscape been so unclear. But\u00a0some analysts believe \u2013 despite the uncertainty \u2013\u00a0that\u00a0the results of this election could be a win for democracy. \u201cIt\u00a0is probably a maturity in the democracy, we needed change and it is never good to have such a one-party dominance in a country,\u201d Verwoerd said. \u201cIt might be a little bit more unstable as we go into the future. But for\u00a0democracy\u2019s\u00a0sake, it is most probably a good thing.\u201d Ramaphosa appeared to make a similar point in his post results speech, saying the announcement \u201cin many ways represents a victory for our democracy as South Africans. It also represents a victory of our constitutional order\u201d and a \u201cvictory for all the people of South Africa.\u201d Verwoerd said that the ANC\u2019s prospects dropped dramatically under the previous president. \u201cOnce the Jacob Zuma years happened, it became pretty inevitable that there was going to be a slide,\u201d she added. A country going backwards The ANC swept to power in 1994 on a\u00a0pledge\u00a0to \u201cbuild a better life for all,\u201d winning almost 63% of the vote in the country\u2019s first democratic election. Fast forward three decades and rampant corruption, soaring joblessness, crippling\u00a0power cuts,\u00a0and feeble economic growth are severely impacting South Africans. The economy has gone backward over the past decade, evidenced by a sharp fall in living standards. According to the\u00a0World Bank, gross domestic product per capita has fallen from a peak in 2011, leaving the average South African 23% poorer. South Africa has the highest rate of unemployment in the world, according to\u00a0the\u00a0World Bank. \u00a0Inequality is also the world\u2019s worst. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the\u00a0failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Any coalition government will\u00a0be a bitter pill to swallow for the ANC and Ramaphosa,\u00a0who could soon be fighting for his political life. Leading analysts believe that the ANC was depending on its legacy too much. \u201cThe ANC was campaigning on three decades of its existence. But nobody was looking at the current president,\u201d said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance in Johannesburg. He believes Ramaphosa is \u201cunder pressure\u201d. \u201cHistorically, it is an embarrassment for him. He always styles himself as the next Nelson Mandela,\u201d Pooe told CNN. But \u201clast recollection, Nelson Mandela never lost an election.\u201d Pooe said, with this election, voters have told the ANC three things: \u201cjobs, jobs, jobs.\u201d Whether a coalition government can deliver for the people is deeply uncertain, but one thing is clear:\u00a0South Africa and the ANC \u2013 Mandela\u2019s former liberation movement that triumphed over apartheid \u2013 will never be the same.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/africa/south-africa-election-results-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_canada-house-d-day-intl", "text": "Their target was an elegant, two-story villa sitting solitary on a misty beach. No houses stood nearby, just minefields, military pillboxes and enemy machine gun posts. It was D-Day, and on that overcast morning on June 6, 1944, 10 boats filled with Canadian troops crossed the English Channel\u2019s choppy waters to head for the 1,500 yard stretch of Normandy coastline where the house was located. These soldiers\u2019 small part in the world\u2019s largest seaborne invasion was to capture the coastal town of Bernieres-sur-Mer. Seizing the villa would be a key objective. Aerial photographs had led them to falsely believe that it was a railway station. Regardless of what it was, allied war planners wanted to use it as a lookout toward the sea once the beach was captured. To get there, the troops would have to cross the open beach. It would be an assault landing, with almost nowhere to hide. The troops hit the shore at 7:15 a.m. and were met by unrelenting machine gun and mortar fire. Within 20 minutes, the soldiers that had managed to survive the initial onslaught reached the villa and expelled the German troops inside. It was, in all likelihood, the first house to be liberated after the beach landings during Operation Overlord. The cost was extreme. About 100 Canadians died on that beach in the first few minutes of the battle. The villa, though riddled with bullet holes and other battle scars, was intact. Eighty years later, the half-timbered home remains. It is called \u201cLa Maison de Canadiens\u201d in French, or Canada House in English, and it is now a memorial dedicated to the Canadians who gave their lives to liberate France thanks to the work of one French couple. Opening the door to strangers After Nicole and Herve Hoffer married in 1975 and then had children, they began spending more time at the family\u2019s vacation home Bernieres-sur-Mer. Nicole noticed that people walking by on the boardwalk between the house and the beach often stopped to take photographs of the building. She asked her husband why, but he didn\u2019t know. The villa was constructed in 1928 by a Parisian man who wanted his two children to have vacation homes of their own. So he built two adjoining houses, with one side for his daughter and another for his son. Herve Hoffer\u2019s grandparents purchased the daughter\u2019s side in 1936. The Hoffers knew that the house had been occupied by the Germans in 1942 and then returned to their family five years later, luckily relatively intact. Countless other homes had been destroyed by the allied bombardment during the Battle of Normandy. But why people kept photographing their house was a mystery. So the Hoffers began inquiring, and many of the people taking pictures turned out to be Canadian veterans on a pilgrimage back to where they landed on D-Day. The couple would invite them inside for a beer, a glass of Calvados \u2013 an apple brandy native to Normandy \u2013 or a meal, over which former soldiers shared their stories. \u201cEven in my own family, I\u2019ve been criticized \u2026 how could I open the door to strangers?\u201d Nicole Hoffer said. \u201cI\u2019d say, well, if the foreigners hadn\u2019t come, you might not be here today. They brought us freedom, many at the risk of their lives.\u201d The Hoffers typically found the first moments of an encounter particularly moving. As veterans sat down for the first time, they\u2019d look out the window as if they were in a film that had taken a decades-long pause, Nicole Hoffer said. Then they would share stories that even their families and friends had never heard. With each meeting, the story of the Hoffer family vacation home emerged, piece by piece. The family learned that when Canadian troops landed at H-Hour, the beginning of the amphibious assault, the Germans that were inside the home fired at them from a machine gun mounted on a bench and aimed outside the front window. Many of the soldiers who were not gunned down hid behind a beach wall near the home, from which they were able to regroup and expel the German troops from the house. Many soldiers who return, Nicole Hoffer said, are surprised to find the wall gone, buried by sand over the years. The house, however, still looks mostly the same. A summer home filled with war memories The Hoffers found that as veterans kept coming back over the years, more and more began to bring souvenirs for them, so many that their summer home is now effectively doubles as a museum. Their guestbook has collected hundreds \u2013 if not thousands \u2013 of signatures from veterans and their families returning to Juno Beach. One signer, Ernie Kells, even apologized for tossing grenades into their basement to flush out German troops. Donated medals, flags, paintings and other keepsakes adorn the walls, including a cross featuring a Jesus icon whose arm had apparently been blown off while in a soldier\u2019s pocket. The man had found the cross intact in a nearby house, and shrapnel that hit it may have saved his life. Years later, on his death bed, the man had asked his family to return the cross to the Hoffer\u2019s home. \u201cIn the house, you find a lot of memories,\u201d she said. The Hoffers eventually began hosting their own ceremony to honor Canada\u2019s fallen soldiers. About a week before June 6, they light a paraffin lantern and leave it burning on the balcony. Then on the evening of the anniversary, bagpipers play as the lamp is tossed into the sea, while guests place flowers and crosses where the water meets the sand. Herve Hoffer was responsible for throwing the lamp himself until his sudden death in 2017, To honor his memory, Nicole Hoffer has opened the house to even more veterans than when he was alive. \u201cNow there\u2019s trips, entire buses who come and ask if we can open the house,\u201d she said. For the 80th anniversary of D-Day this year, Hoffer is expecting a larger crowd. Not only will there be the usual contingent of visitors to her home, but the west side of the house will open to the public for the first time since being purchased by the local government. It is hosting an exhibit featuring the testimony of French men and women who lived through D-Day as children.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/canada-house-d-day-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "weather_us-leads-tornado-numbers-tornado-alley-xpn", "text": "The US averages over 1,150 tornadoes every year. That\u2019s more than any other country. In fact, it\u2019s more than Canada, Australia and all European countries combined.  Within the US, every state has had at least one tornado, and some have dozens each year.  The US is special in terms of producing so many tornadoes, especially violent ones. In the US, the average number of tornado fatalities per year is 73. But in Europe, where the tornadoes are usually much weaker, the fatalities are estimated to be between 10 and 15 annually. Some states are deadlier than others Texas on average has 140 tornadoes every year \u2013 the most of any state. Kansas, Florida, Oklahoma, and Nebraska round out the top five. But the total number of tornadoes does not always tell the whole story. For example, despite Alabama having on average 42 tornadoes per year \u2013 more than three times fewer than Texas \u2013 it is at the top of the list for tornado fatalities. Alabama averages 14 tornado fatalities per year, almost double the next highest \u2013 Missouri with eight deaths per year. The time of day and the topography where the tornado occurs makes a big difference in the fatality rate. The topography in Alabama and other Southern states often includes rolling hills, plateaus, and many more trees than the Plains states like Kansas, Texas, and Nebraska, where a tornado often can be seen from miles away. The more likely a tornado can be seen often leads to the tornado being reported faster, allowing more time for people to be warned and seek shelter. Southern states such as Tennessee, Kentucky and  Arkansas also see more tornadoes overnight versus any other state. This can lead to higher fatalities, since many people are sleeping and unaware that a tornado is approaching.  \u201cTornadoes in the Southeast tend to be more dangerous than their Great Plains counterparts,\u201d says Brandon Miller, CNN Meteorologist.  \u201cThere are a number of reasons for this, some weather and some geographic. Southeastern tornadoes often travel faster, moved by a faster jet stream.\u201d  All of these factors can lead to higher fatality rate in Southern states compared to the Plains. But all of these states have a few things in common: the ideal atmospheric conditions for tornadoes to form. \u201cThe basic ingredients for severe thunderstorms that can make tornadoes are warm, moist air near the ground, relatively dry, cool air aloft (about 10,000 to 30,000 feet), and horizontal winds in the environment the storm forms in that increase as you go from the ground up and change direction with height, blowing from the equator near the ground and from the west aloft,\u201d says Dr. Harold Brooks, senior scientist with the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory. Low pressure systems in the US pull warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air aloft from the Rocky Mountains or the High Desert in the southwest. The states that fall in between those two regions end up being in the ideal location for severe weather to ignite.  \u201cNo place else in the world has the large warm water on its equatorward side with a wide high range of mountains extending from north to south to the west of it,\u201d Dr. Brooks said. \u201cAll the other tornado prone regions have at least one feature suboptimal.\u201d  The US leads every other country for tornadoes Other countries experience tornadoes, including Germany, Australia, South Africa, eastern China, Japan, Bangladesh, Argentina, and more. Europe as a whole is comparable to the size of the US, but there is a vast difference in number of tornadoes and tornado fatalities.  From 2011 to 2020, the US averaged a preliminary total of 1,173 tornadoes per year, and Europe around 256. However, Dr. Pieter Groenemeijer, Director of the European Severe Storms Laboratory (ESSL), cautions that the European number may be on the low side. \u201cWeaker tornadoes are likely still under-reported in some countries, such as France and the UK,\u201d Groenemeijer says. European Russia (which is the part of the country west of 58 degrees East longitude), tops the list at 86 tornadoes annually. Germany comes in second with an average 28 tornadoes annually. The peak density of tornado reports coincides with the high population density over Belgium, the Netherlands, and northern Germany, according to a study on severe storms in Europe published in December 2020. The study also reports that thunderstorms are twice as frequent over the United States, with as many as four times more storm reports, compared to Europe. One thing most countries have in common is the time of day that tornadoes occur, which is most frequently during the afternoon and early evening. But the peak season is not the same. In the US, spring is the peak for tornado activity. For central and northern Europe the main tornado season is in summer, whereas it is autumn for the western and central Mediterranean region, and winter in the eastern Mediterranean. Outside of the US, Canada actually ranks second on the list for most tornadoes, with an average of 100 per year. Tornadoes are not limited to the Northern Hemisphere. Australia has dozens every year, and South Africa also reports annual occurrences. South America, much like other continents, has its own tornado hotspot, known as \u201cpasillo de los tornados.\u201d This tornado corridor includes Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and a portion of Brazil.  According to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, tornadoes are relatively rare there. On average, around seven to 10 moderate to strong tornado events are reported in New Zealand every year. Southern Hemisphere tornadoes typically rotate clockwise, which is the opposite of how tornadoes primarily spin in the Northern Hemisphere.

{"id": "2024_05_29_tech_ransomware-attacks-hospitals-patients-danger", "text": "A ransomware attack on a major US hospital network that began three weeks ago is endangering patients\u2019 health as nurses are forced to manually enter prescription information and work without electronic health records, nurses at two hospitals affected by the cyberattack told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s putting patients\u2019 lives in danger,\u201d said a nurse who works at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital, a 290-bed facility about 25 miles north of downtown Detroit. \u201cPeople have too many patients for what is safe. Nurses are taking on five or six patients dealing with all of this paper charting.\u201d Another nurse, who works who works at a 409-bed Ascension hospital in Birmingham, Alabama, told CNN: \u201cIt is frightening how many safety guardrails [have been] out of service without any computers.\u201d The nurses spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs. The cyberattack hit Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit that oversees 140 hospitals across 19 states, on May 8, but the healthcare network is still working to bring its systems back online. Ransomware attacks that cut off access to electronic health records are a grimly regular occurrence in American life. The health care sector\u00a0reported\u00a0249 ransomware attacks to the FBI last year, more than any other sector, with some cases affecting patient records. But the Ascension incident is raising concerns about the threat to patient health posed by cybercriminals in a way that numerous other ransomware attacks on US health providers haven\u2019t, according to interviews with nurses and cybersecurity experts. The two Ascension nurses said in separate interviews that they felt overwhelmed by the abrupt shift to paper records following the cyberattack, underwhelmed by their hospitals\u2019 plans for dealing with the situation and worried that they or their colleagues will make mistakes entering a patient\u2019s vital medical information. \u201cI don\u2019t have any orders in the computer,\u201d the Rochester, Michigan-based nurse said. \u201cI can\u2019t see what labs are ordered and their results.\u201d OPEIU Local 40, a union that represents nurses at Ascension Providence Rochester Hospital, distributed an online\u00a0petition\u00a0on Friday saying union members were \u201cdeeply concerned about the current challenges faced by our healthcare professionals\u201d because of the cyberattack, and urged the hospital to take a series of remediating steps, including limiting the nurse-to-patient ratio. Mac Walker, Ascension\u2019s director of media relations, did not answer CNN\u2019s questions about the petition or the nurses\u2019 comments on patient safety. Instead, Walker emailed this statement on Wednesday morning. \u201cRestoring EHR [electronic health records] access has been among the top priorities of our recovery process,\u201d Walker said. \u201cDue to the hard work of our teams over the past several days, we have successfully restored EHR access in our first market and are actively progressing against a plan to restore access across our network on a rolling basis.\u201d Walker did not respond when asked what Ascension\u2019s \u201cfirst market\u201d meant. Ascension, the fourth largest hospital network in the country\u00a0by some measures, said in a public statement Friday that it has been working\u00a0\u201caround the clock with industry-leading cybersecurity experts to safely restore operations across our network.\u201d In the wake of the Ascension hack and another ransomware attack in February that disrupted insurance billing at pharmacies across the US, Biden administration officials say they\u00a0are preparing\u00a0to release a set of minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals.\u00a0But the cybersecurity challenges in the health sector are legion and beyond the scope of any one policy prescription, experts say. Senior officials from the White House and Department of Health and Human Services plan to meet with cybersecurity executives from health care companies on Wednesday to discuss how to better protect hospitals from hackers, three sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. \u2018Exorbitant\u2019 wait times for lab results In statements to the press, Ascension has said that its staff are \u201cappropriately trained to maintain high quality care during downtime.\u201d But the nurses interviewed by CNN say that the shift to paper records and manual operations is taking a toll on hospital operations. With computers down, doctors have been writing paper prescriptions for patients that nurses take to a machine to manually enter without a cross-check from the local pharmacy, according to the two nurses. \u201cThey have to put an override in there to get the medication out,\u201d said Dina Carlisle, president of OPEIU Local 40. \u201cThere\u2019s no second safety check from the pharmacy.\u201d It has also taken an exorbitantly long time to get lab results because of the hack, the nurse in Birmingham, Alabama, told CNN. A \u201cstat lab,\u201d or lab work needed to make quick decisions on patient care, that normally takes 30 minutes to an hour to process has taken hours, the nurse said. A growing problem for hospitals Ransomware attacks in the US\u00a0routinely force hospitals\u00a0to divert ambulances and cancel appointments. That causes a strain on neighboring hospitals that pick up the slack. But a lack of clear public understanding of how cyberattacks on hospitals directly impact patient care is undercutting the urgency needed to deal with the problem, according to health advocates and cybersecurity experts. Researchers are increasingly quantifying how lethal ransomware can be. Roughly 3 in 100 hospitalized Medicare patients will die in the hospital under normal conditions, but during a ransomware attack, that number increases to 4 out of 100 because of the strain on hospital resources,\u00a0according\u00a0to scholars at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, who studied 374 ransomware attacks on health providers. Part of the problem,\u00a0experts say, is that some hospitals have failed basic tests of cybersecurity \u201chygiene,\u201d or sound defensive measures, while many small clinics lack the resources to secure themselves. And, perhaps more than any other sector, health care firms hold an enormous volume of sensitive data that is ripe for targeting and extortion schemes. The number of sensitive data records held by the health care sector grew by more than 63% last year \u201cfar surpassing any other industry and more than five times the global average,\u201d according to a study by security firm Rubrik. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue and snarled service at pharmacies across the US. Andrew Witty, the CEO of\u00a0UnitedHealth Group, which owns Change Healthcare,\u00a0apologized\u00a0in a recent congressional hearing for the security lapse and said he authorized a $22 million ransom payment to hackers to try to protect patient data. Yet a third of Americans could have had their data stolen in the hack, he said. \u201cWe routinely decline healthcare entities unwilling to address things like unpatched critical vulnerabilities, misconfigurations or uneven application of MFA [multi-factor authentication] \u2014 the very things hackers leverage to breach systems. And then we regularly see them breached later,\u201d Sezaneh Seymour, head of regulatory risk and policy at cyber insurance firm Coalition, told CNN. (She said her firm had no specific insights into the Change Healthcare or Ascension ransomware attacks.) Health care providers also make attractive targets for cyber extortionists because hospitals can ill-afford to be offline for long because of the disruptions it causes to operations. \u201cWhen we look at ransomware targeting, it\u2019s: who is the most easily targetable, who can afford little downtime and who has the highest willingness to pay,\u201d Bryan Vorndran, the FBI\u2019s senior most cyber-focused official, said in an interview. \u201cAnd where there\u2019s low-downtime environments, you have obviously a willingness to pay more so than in environments where they can afford downtime,\u201d Vorndran told CNN. \u201cI think all of that is relevant not just to the healthcare sector but to some other sectors as well.\u201d He declined to comment when asked about the Ascension hack.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/tech/ransomware-attacks-hospitals-patients-danger/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

More than 20,000 positions are set to be filled with an estimated 70,000 candidates vying to become senators, mayors and governors. Violence has loomed large in this election, the bloodiest in Mexico\u2019s history. Dozens of political candidates and applicants have been killed by criminal organizations trying to influence those coming into power. While voting was largely peaceful on Sunday, it was suspended in the southeastern Mexican town of Coyomeapan due to violence at the polling centers in the morning, according to state electoral authorities. The poll is seen by some as a referendum on the policies of outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 Sheinbaum\u2019s mentor whose popular social welfare helped poorer Mexicans, but whose \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d policy of not confronting cartels has not led to a substantial drop in homicide numbers. He greeted supporters as he voted on Sunday. Meanwhile, as Sheinbaum made her way to cast her ballot, she called for Mexicans to vote, telling reporters: \u201cThis is a historic day, I am feeling very happy.\u201d G\u00e1lvez told reporters at a polling station that she was expecting it to be a long day and a very close call. Polls opened at 8 a.m. local time and will close at 6 p.m., according to\u00a0Mexico\u2019s National Electoral Institute (INE). However, on Sunday, some voting stations in parts of the country opened with delays. Long lines were seen in Mexico City, Yucat\u00e1n, Tuxtla, Cuauht\u00e9moc, and voting centers abroad. One exasperated woman in Mexico City, who had been waiting for 40 minutes for her polling station to open, said she would not be able to vote before the polls closed at 6 p.m. as she had to go to work. In Madrid, Spain, expatriate Mexicans told CNN they waited more than eight hours to cast their ballots. One Mexican voter said she had been in line for 11 hours. Authorities are telling them INE is to blame. Polls were meant to open at 8 a.m. local time in Madrid, but INE posted on social media on Sunday afternoon saying voters waiting in line at embassies in Madrid and Paris could now cast their ballots. They\u00a0added that the polls will close once 1,500 votes have been cast or everyone who registered votes. CNN has contacted\u00a0the Mexican Embassy in Madrid for comment. Of the more than 200,000 expatriate votes expected to come from abroad, more than 70% will be coming from voters living in the United States. Outside the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles, thousands of people queued up to vote on Sunday as some in the crowd chanted \u201cMorena\u201d \u2013 the name of the ruling party. Security concerns on the ballot Whoever is elected will face several challenges, including security, organized crime, energy, and immigration. They will also set the tone for the US-Mexico\u00a0bilateral relationship. Outside polling stations, voters told CNN that public security was one of their main concerns. A minute of silence was held on Sunday by the advisers of the INE in memory of the people who have been murdered during this electoral period. There have been more than 20 political killings since September according to the Mexican government. By some estimates, that number is even higher, at least 34 candidates murdered, according to Mexican consultancy firm, Integralia. While\u00a0the murder rate fell in Mexico\u00a0between 2019 and 2022, in absolute numbers the country is still reeling from historically high levels of homicides of around 30,000 each year, experts say. Both Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez have largely remained coy about their proposals regarding security. Neither\u00a0has\u00a0repudiated a nearly two-decades-long approach of relying on the armed forces to tackle organized crime \u2013 which\u00a0has coincided with\u00a0the high numbers of homicides. The central challenge for the next president will be\u00a0convincing voters that she can end the culture of impunity in Mexico, where\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved in\u00a02022, according to the think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua. US officials are closely monitoring the presidential election as it comes at a critical time for the Biden administration. A\u202frecord number\u202fof migrants at the US-Mexico border has been seized upon by Republicans who claim it as proof of the Biden administration\u2019s impotence, pushing immigration control to a top election issue. In recent months, the US has relied heavily on Mexico to step up immigration enforcement and help stem the flow of migration to the US\u2019 southern border. The election in Mexico has raised uncertainty in the minds of some Biden officials about what, if anything, will change with a key partner when it comes to border cooperation. \u201cWhether we\u2019re talking about elections in Mexico or here in the US, it always provokes a level of uncertainty with everyone, generally, but especially in the migrant population,\u201d a Homeland Security official previously told CNN.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_02_style_tschabalala-self-artist-painting-black-bodies", "text": "Both a source of inspiration and a place to ground herself, Harlem holds a special meaning for the artist Tschabalala Self. \u201cIt definitely sculpted my personal worldview,\u00a0style and perspective,\u201d said Self of the Manhattan neighborhood, her hometown, famed for fostering generations of Black creatives, artists and intellectuals. \u201cIt\u2019s this world within the world of New York, the largest and most vibrant city in the world. I\u2019ve always been very proud to be from Harlem.\u201d This pride is most recently manifested in her latest exhibition, \u201cAround the Way,\u201d currently on show at the Espoo Museum of Modern Art, Finland. The show\u2019s title is a nod to Black American slang, referring \u201cto someone who\u2019s from our neighborhood,\u201d she told CNN. From referencing the brownstone brick-patterned architecture to real-life friends, family and local residents, the works on display serve as Self\u2019s homage \u2014 and tribute \u2014 to her Harlem.

This relationship can then be replicated through other mixed media, including fabrics. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to think about new and innovative ways to approach painting\u2026 I describe it more as assemblage because the fabric is so dimensional,\u201d she explained of the appliqu\u00e9 techniques in which she works with fabrics on stretched canvas. \u201cSimilar to how other painters have a palette, I have hundreds of bits and scraps of fabrics\u2026 It\u2019s basically an accumulation of all my different fragmented memories or impressions from individuals that I knew well, or that I just happened upon,\u201d she continued. \u201c\u201cThrough the formal aspects of my work, I\u2019m able to address my central conceptual concern that one\u2019s identity is really the sum of many parts. Some of these parts are inherent, but others are projected and collected.\u201d This sense of collecting and gathering is epitomized in a piece in the new show, titled \u201cAnthurium.\u201d The work blends sewn, painted and printed elements to create a scene of domesticity \u2014 a key focal point of Self\u2019s work previously explored in her \u201cHome Body\u201d series, which depicted scenes of intimacy and interiority. Self\u2019s own relationship with the concept of home has evolved in recent years. Now based in upstate New York, the process of leaving her childhood home prompted her to investigate the significance of domestic spaces, both real and imagined. \u201cI think that the home is an actual site, but it also occupies an emotional and psychological space in people\u2019s minds,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic of something other than what it really is in reality, and those are the kind of environments I like to explore in my artwork.\u201d When considering Self\u2019s body of work on display in \u201cAround the Way,\u201d and more broadly, it\u2019s also clear that the physical body embodies a further exploration of \u201chome\u201d as a place of belonging, of community and of self-care. Her figures are as at home in their physicality as they are  in the world. She describes her approach to rendering and depicting Black women in particular as \u201can instinct,\u201d but she says that she was able to articulate this further through researching the significance of the Rubenesque figure. \u201cIt was interesting to me that the women had this physical aesthetic that was speaking to their abundance and plentitude. They did not have any need,\u201d she said. In her own practice then, this sense of abundance shows up in the way Self\u2019s characters boldly claim space within the picture frame, with their power rooted in their identity, femininity and physicality. This conversation with the traditional western canon of painting is ongoing for Self, and influences other facets of her work. In March 2024, Self was awarded the prestigious public art commission for London\u2019s Fourth Plinth \u2014 her sculpture, \u201cLady in Blue,\u201d will sit atop one of the plinths in Trafalgar Square, a landmark and tourist destination in the city also renowned for its commitment to highlighting contemporary art, starting in 2026. The piece will be a bronze statue of a Black woman striding in movement forward, wearing a bright blue dress. That color was inspired by lapis lazuli and ultramarine, a rare pigment used with significance in the western art canon. \u201cA lot of classical paintings have used lapis lazuli to denote a sense of honor and prestige to a revered figure. I wanted to use this color\u2026 to bestow that same significance.\u201d \u201cEspecially being an American artist, I think it\u2019s a great honor and I feel a lot of trust from the people of London,\u201d Self said. In thinking about the concept for \u201cLady in Blue,\u201d Self considered the increased attention on monuments, particularly in recent years. Instead of uplifting or exalting individuals, her preferred approach is to look to symbolic representations of shared identities and societies instead. But the commission also represents much more than the sculpture\u2019s identity or physicality alone, added the artist. \u201cIt\u2019s about having a figure that can simultaneously speak to the future and the past, and I honestly feel like a Black female figure is the best figure to do that for a number of cultural and historical reasons. \u2018Lady in Blue\u2019 can be seen as an historical mother, but also as a representation of our collective future.\u201d Tschabalala Self: Around the Way is presented in collaboration with the Saastamoinen Foundation at EMMA\u2013Espoo Museum of Modern Art from 8 May 2024 - 5 May 2025 as part of the In Collection exhibition series.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/style/tschabalala-self-artist-painting-black-bodies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_sport_fan-caddie-injured-pan-canadian-open-spt-intl", "text": "Soaking up the thrilling climax of the RBC Canadian Open, Paul Emerson wove his way through the crowds to get a good view of the PGA Tour stars on the fourth hole. A few bizarre developments later, he was working for one of them. For two fleeting but fairy tale holes on Sunday, self-professed \u201cgolf nut\u201d Emerson was the star of the show at Ontario\u2019s Hamilton Golf and Country Club, as an injury to C.T. Pan\u2019s caddie Mike \u201cFluff\u201d Cowan presented an impromptu opportunity for one local fan to man the bag at his country\u2019s national open. With Cowan unable to continue after tripping and falling on the third fairway, Taiwan\u2019s Pan saw his clubs picked up by Dan Reynolds, caddie for Irish playing partner Shane Lowry. World No. 33 Lowry had been hauling his own bag as Pan helped Cowan in the direction of medical support, limping past one eager-to-assist spectator in a red Masters T-shirt en route. \u201cWe heard a big tumble and a big sound when Fluff wiped out,\u201d Emerson, a lawyer from nearby Aurora, Ontario, told the PGA Tour. \u201cI just simply offered. I said \u2026 do you need any help?\u201d he told CNN\u2019s \u201cNews Central\u201d on Monday. \u201c(Pan) said yes. And then next thing you know, I\u2019m helping Fluff takeoff the bib and walking up the fairway. It just all happened very fast.\u201d Heart racing, Emerson shook hands with Lowry before throwing the bag over his shoulder \u2013 unprecedented scenes that had not escaped the lenses of TV broadcasters. It was a dream start. Emerson was one-under through one hole for his PGA Tour career after Pan curled home a brilliant birdie putt from just over 20 feet, prompting the 2020 Olympic bronze medalist to toast his new ally with a shout of \u201cgreat caddie\u201d as he plucked his ball from the cup. \u201cOne for one, Paul!\u201d Lowry quipped, adding with a laugh: \u201cIt\u2019s all downhill from here.\u201d Emerson told CNN he had a chance to relax on the next tee. \u201cI just sort of soaked it up and we actually started joking around,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all very, very friendly and fun.\u201d \u2018I didn\u2019t really want to stop\u2019 With his phone now buzzing incessantly in his pocket, Emerson took the walk up the subsequent fairway as an opportunity to ask Pan what he required. There was only one request: \u201cStay off the greens.\u201d \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not very chatty\u2019\u201d Emerson recalled to the PGA Tour. \u201cI was like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ll talk as much or as little as you want. \u201cHe\u2019s a really nice guy \u2013 really friendly.\u201d When asked by CNN whether he gave Pan advice, Emerson chuckled. \u201cThat would be a terrible decision on his part to ask me for guidance,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job was fairly clear, just carry the bag and keep his clubs dry.\u201d Lowry\u2019s tongue-in-cheek jibe was not entirely inaccurate, as Pan bogeyed the par-five hole. The following fairway would mark the end of the road for Emerson\u2019s caddie cameo, as a member of the caddie services team \u2013 Michael Campbell \u2013 arrived to take over from an accepting, albeit reluctant, Emerson. \u201cI said to C.T., \u2018Well, this is your decision,\u2019\u201d added Emerson, whose only previous caddying experience had been for a golfer at a Canadian Women\u2019s Open Pro-Am event. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to stop, but he took the person who has some local knowledge.\u201d Pan had just made back-to-back birdies when he greeted his fourth bagman of the round, Al Riddell, at the 10th tee. Riddell, who had caddied for France\u2019s Paul Barjon until he missed the cut, had the best possible view of Pan\u2019s stunning eagle \u2013 a 121-yard effort that spun back into the cup \u2013 at the 12th hole. World No. 133 Pan, a one-time winner on the PGA Tour, carded a final round one-under 69 amid damp conditions to finish in tied-35th at three-under overall, 13 shots behind champion Robert MacIntyre. Cowan, 76, was treated for \u201cnonserious\u201d injuries at the clubhouse, a PGA Tour official told ESPN. CNN has reached out to the PGA Tour for an update on Cowan. The Caddie Open Quizzed on his plans for the rest of Sunday, Emerson said he was considering a shirt change to help allay the attention he was receiving around Hamilton Country Club. Yet come the end of Sunday, he had a strong rival for the title of most famous emergency caddie. Having parted ways with his bagman just a week ago, homesick MacIntyre had called on the services of his 59-year-old father Dougie, head greenskeeper at a club back home in Oban, Scotland. The duo dovetailed seamlessly as 27-year-old MacIntyre held off a flurry of big-name stars to clinch his first PGA Tour title, stamping his ticket to the US Open later this month and a $1.69 million prize check he said would go toward paying off his parent\u2019s mortgage. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. I\u2019m a grass cutter not a caddie,\u201d MacIntyre senior, wiping away tears, told CBS Sports. \u201cLast Saturday night, I\u2019m sitting on the couch at home and I\u2019m (thinking), \u2018Can I leave my job here? I\u2019m busy at work.\u2019 Eight o\u2019clock the next morning, I\u2019m on a flight out here and wow.\u201d The Canadian Open is building a reputation for throwing up storylines both beautiful and bizarre. At last year\u2019s tournament, home hero Nick Taylor ended the 69-year wait for a men\u2019s Canadian golfer to win their home open with a remarkable 72-foot eagle putt, only for friend and fellow pro Adam Hadwin to be mistakenly tackled by a security guard amid the ensuing bedlam. Hadwin laughed off the case of mistaken identity soon after, and reconnected with his former feller at this year\u2019s tournament, posting a selfie of the duo smiling to X with the caption: \u201cWater under the bridge!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/sport/fan-caddie-injured-pan-canadian-open-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_middleeast_israeli-hostages-dead-intl-latam", "text": "The Israel Defense Forces says its representatives have informed the families of four hostages being held in Gaza \u201cthat they are no longer alive.\u201d The IDF said it had told the families of Chaim Peri, Yoram Metzger, Amiram Cooper, and Nadav Popplewell \u201cwho were brutally abducted to the Gaza Strip on October 7, that they are no longer alive and that their bodies are held by the Hamas terrorist organization.\u201d The IDF said the decision to pronounce the four hostages dead was based on intelligence and was confirmed by a Ministry of Health expert committee, in coordination with the Ministry of Religious Services and the Chief Rabbi of Israel. The circumstances of their deaths in Hamas captivity are still under examination, according to the IDF, which says it uses a \u201ca wide variety of methods to gather information about the hostages who remain in the Gaza Strip.\u201d Chief spokesperson for the IDF, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said \u201cTheir loved ones were killed a few months ago during Hamas captivity in Gaza and their bodies are still being held by Hamas. We assess that the four of them were killed while together in the area of Khan Younis during an operation there against Hamas.\u201d In May, Hamas said Popplewell, an Israeli-British citizen, had died from wounds following a strike by Israeli fighter jets on his place of detention over a month earlier. CNN is not able to independently verify the claim by Hamas. More than 250 people were taken hostage and moved to Gaza during Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel but more than 100 were released during a temporary truce last year. The Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office believes there are still 124 hostages, living and dead, in Gaza \u2013 four of whom were taken before October 7. Of the remaining 120 who were taken on October 7, Israel now believes 41 are dead. Israeli War Cabinet minister and Chairman of Israel\u2019s National Unity Party, Benny Gantz sent condolences to the families of those declared dead on Monday, saying on his Telegram channel the news was \u201ca painful reminder of our supreme moral duty to continue to fight against terrorism and to do everything to return all the hostages home as soon as possible, even at painful costs.\u201d The latest deaths are likely to increase pressure on the Israeli leadership to secure a ceasefire proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden last week. Following news of the four deaths, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum in Israel reiterated its demand to the Israeli government to immediately approve the proposal. The organization called the news of the four deaths a mark of disgrace and a sad reflection on the significance of delaying previous deals. \u201cThe Israeli government must send out a negotiating delegation this evening and return all 124 hostages, both living and murdered, to their homes,\u201d the group said in a statement Monday. \u201cChaim, Yoram, Amiram, and Nadav were kidnapped alive, some of them were with other hostages who returned in the previous deal \u2013 and they should have returned alive to their country and their families,\u201d the statement added. The three-phase proposal outlined by Biden on Friday would secure the release of hostages paired with a ceasefire. The US president outlined the plan \u2013 which he said was proposed by Israel \u2013 in unusual detail in what appears to have been an attempt to pressure both Israel and Hamas into an agreement. On Monday, leaders from the Group of 7 (G7) nations added to that pressure by endorsing the proposal, calling on Hamas to accept it, and claiming that \u201cIsrael is ready to move forward\u201d with it. However, whether Israel is, in fact, \u201cready to move forward\u201d with the plan laid out by Biden remains something of an unknown, as the Israeli government has offered a series of non-committal statements that have created a degree of uncertainty about the plan. British Foreign Secretary David Cameroon also noted the proposal in a post on the social media platform X, in which he said he was \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d by the death of Israeli-British citizen Popplewell. \u201cMy thoughts are with his loved ones at this terrible time for them,\u201d Cameron\u00a0wrote. \u201cWith a new deal on the table, we reiterate our demand for Hamas to send all hostages home.\u201d Husbands, fathers, brothers The Hostage and Missing Families Forum released the following information on the four hostages declared dead Monday. Nadav Popplewell: 51, from Kibbutz Nirim, a family man of distinction and a generous friend, a lover of books and science fiction. Nadav was kidnapped from his home\u2019s safe room along with his mother, Channa Peri, who was released after 49 days in captivity. His older brother, Roy, was murdered on October 7. Amiram Cooper: 84, one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz. He was kidnapped together with his wife, Nurit, who was released from Hamas captivity after 17 days. Amiram saw the establishment of the kibbutz as his life\u2019s mission. He was an economist, poet, and composer. He is survived by his wife, three children, and nine grandchildren. Yoram Metzger: 80, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, kidnapped from his home along with his wife, Tamar, who was released from Hamas captivity after 53 days. Yoram was a man of family and people, stories and humor. He was one of the founders of the Nir Oz Winery. Yoram is survived by his wife Tamar, three children, and seven grandchildren. Chaim Peri: 80, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, a man of peace, art, and cinema. He taught in schools in the area and at Sapir College. He established and built the art gallery in the kibbutz and the sculpture garden. He was one of the founders of the Nir Oz Winery. Chaim was abducted from the safe room in his home while protecting his wife, Osnat. He is survived by his wife, five children, and 13 grandchildren.

The head of the Zaporizhzhia region military administration, Ivan Fedorov, told Ukrainian television that the power plant can no longer produce electricity. Traffic around the plant is \u201ccompletely blocked,\u201d he said, with residents being forced to drive over bridges to get around, he said. Russia has continued its tactic of striking key energy facilities this week, with the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy warning Sunday of a \u201csignificant power shortage\u201d as a knock-on effect of the strikes. The ministry said that emergency blackouts were carried out in several regions of Ukraine after \u201csix massive attacks.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Energy said power facilities in the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kirovohrad, and Ivano-Frankivsk were hit, in what the ministry called \u201cthe sixth massive missile and drone strike on energy facilities since March 22.\u201d Russia\u2019s defense ministry said these attacks were carried out \u201cin response to attempts by the Kyiv regime to damage Russian energy and transport facilities.\u201d Ukraine is on the back foot along the frontlines as it faces continued aerial assaults.

{"id": "2024_06_01_asia_zelensky-shangri-la-dialogue-singapore-intl-hnk", "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy arrived in Singapore Saturday for a previously unannounced appearance at a summit of defense chiefs from across the Asia-Pacific as Ukraine\u2019s troops scramble to counter a major Russian advance into its northeast. Zelensky\u2019s surprise attendance at the gathering is a stark illustration of Kyiv\u2019s determination to keep the international community engaged in Ukraine\u2019s defense \u2013 and its vision for peace \u2013 more than two years into Russia\u2019s devastating invasion. The Ukrainian leader has traveled outside his embattled country sparingly during the war and earlier this month called off international engagements as his troops defended against the surprise Russian offensive in northeastern Kharkiv. A CNN team at the summit witnessed Zelensky and his delegation arriving. His attendance at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore provides a\u00a0rare opportunity for Zelensky to potentially meet with defense chiefs from across the Asia-Pacific, including China which has deepened its relations with Moscow since the war. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and defense heads from US allies Australia, Japan, and South Korea, as well as China\u2019s Defense Minster Dong Jun are expected to be in attendance for the three-day gathering. Announcing his arrival at the summit, Zelensky said in a statement on X that he would hold \u201ca number of meetings,\u201d in particular with Austin, Singapore\u2019s president and prime minister, Timor-Leste\u2019s president and Singaporean investors. The pentagon confirmed on Saturday that Austin would meet Zelensky and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov at the Shangri-La on Sunday, \u201cto discuss the current battlefield situation in Ukraine and to underscore US commitment to ensuring Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself against ongoing Russian aggression.\u201d Zelensky arrives in Singapore weeks ahead of a Ukraine-backed peace summit slated to be held in Switzerland amid a mounting urgency for Kyiv to bolster international support for its peace plan \u2013 especially in the face of the looming US presidential elections, which could see a shift in the level of US support for his cause. Ukraine relies squarely on international funds and weapons \u2013 and faces shortages of manpower and equipment. Months of political wrangling on Capitol Hill as well as lack of supplies from NATO countries have kept Ukraine\u2019s forces significantly outgunned against Russia. A major $61 billion aid injection for Ukraine bill was finally passed by the US in late April. On Friday, Zelenksy was in Sweden for a summit with Northern European leaders where he said Ukraine\u2019s \u201ctop priorities\u201d were to ensure more air defense systems and weapons for Ukraine, as well as \u201cglobal efforts to force Russia to make peace,\u201d according to the leader\u2019s post on the platform X. In Asia, Zelensky may carry a similar message. The conflict, though a continent away, has been watched closely by governments across the region, especially those contending with territorial disputes with another military and authoritarian power in the region, China. The conflict in Europe is also widely seen to have impacted the security climate in Asia. Russia has nurtured a burgeoning relationship with North Korea, believed by Western governments to have supplied Russian forces with munitions in recent months. Moscow and Beijing have also deepened their strategic partnership during Russia\u2019s war, with the US accusing China of bolstering Russia\u2019s defense industrial base with dual-use exports \u2013 and divisions between China and the West deepening over Beijing\u2019s close Kremlin ties. Those exports were raised during a meeting Friday between Austin and his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun. Austin indicated to China that there would be consequences if Beijing continues to support Russia militarily, a senior US defense official said after the meeting. Dong said China, which claims neutrality in the conflict, had honored its \u201cpromise not to provide weapons to either side of the conflict\u201d and has strict controls on dual-use exports, according to China\u2019s spokesperson. Beijing also confirmed Friday that it would not send a delegation to the upcoming, Ukraine-backed peace conference in Switzerland, with its Foreign Ministry citing\u00a0its view that\u00a0any international peace conference should have \u201crecognition by both Russia and Ukraine, equal participation by all parties, and fair discussion of all peace plans.\u201d Zelensky\u2019s 10-point peace plan calls for Russia to withdraw all its troops from Ukrainian territory and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognized borders. Zelensky has previously made surprise appearances at global summits to keep attention focused on Ukraine\u2019s plight and strengthen ties \u2013 he famously dropped in on the Group of 7 (G7) summit last year in Japan. It\u2019s not clear if he will have an opportunity to meet with any Chinese officials during his time in Singapore. Russia is not participating in the gathering. In an interview with Russia\u2019s state news agency RIA Novosti, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov suggested Thursday that China could organize a peace conference involving both Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky\u2019s arrival also comes as US President Joe Biden broke from long-standing policy to give Ukraine permission to use American munitions for limited strikes within Russian territory close to the border with Kharkiv, CNN reported Thursday, citing US officials. Key European leaders have also signaled a similar position shift. However, the US elections have raised uncertainty over the level of US support for Ukraine\u2019s war effort if the fighting continues into next year \u2013\u2013 widely seen as adding another measure of urgency to Ukraine\u2019s push for peace on its terms. Biden, a staunch supporter of Kyiv, competes for office against former President Donald Trump, who in the past refused to say whether he wants Russia or Ukraine to win the war and raised questions about his commitment to America\u2019s NATO allies.

With results in from 22% of polling stations at 4 p.m. local time, support for the ANC stood at 43.5%. The official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), had 24.7% of the vote, while the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) \u2013 a splinter party of the ANC \u2013 had 8.9%, data from the country\u2019s electoral commission showed. The respected research group CSIR modeled the ANC winning less than 45% of the national poll as of mid-morning on Thursday. Officials of the Independent Electoral Commission have stressed that the official tally could take several days and some larger voting wards could take more time to be tallied. In past elections, results from rural areas \u2013 where the ANC has major strongholds \u2013 have come in later, boosting results for the party. Once all the votes are counted, if the ANC remains below 50% it will be forced to enter a coalition with one or more parties. Depending on how low its support dips, it may need to form a deal with one of the larger opposition parties such as the DA or EFF to remain in power. Another ANC splinter party, the uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK), led by former President Jacob Zuma appears to be on course to do well in KwaZulu-Natal, the eastern coastal province where Durban is located. At 10am local time, it had 42.3% of the votes there compared to 20.1% for the ANC. Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of current ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to\u00a0resign as leader in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court.

This year, the commission has set Sunday, June 2, as the final results day.

China claims neutrality in the conflict and has said it is a proponent of peace, even as it has emerged as a key economic lifeline and tightened its already close strategic and diplomatic partnership with Russia since the country\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The US has also alleged that China\u2019s export of dual-use goods to Russia is powering the warring country\u2019s defense industrial base and warned Beijing of consequences for such support \u2013 a claim Beijing has refuted, saying it has not provided weapons to either side and maintains tight export controls on dual use goods. Zelensky alluded to such support in comments Sunday, saying certain elements that make up parts of Russia\u2019s weaponry \u201ccome from China.\u201d The Ukrainian leader\u00a0also warned that Russia was attempting to pressure countries not to join the upcoming international peace summit \u2013 with China\u2019s help. \u201cRussia is trying to disrupt the peace summit and that is true \u2026 (Russia) is now traveling around many countries in the world threatening them with the blockade of the agricultural goods, of the food products, of chemical products \u2026 it is simply pushing the other countries of the world so that they\u2019re not present on the summit,\u201d Zelensky said after delivering an address at the defense conference. When asked later about China\u2019s statement it would not attend the peace summit, the Ukrainian leader accused Russia of using Chinese diplomats to disrupt it. \u201cRegrettably, it is unfortunate that such big independent powerful country as China is an instrument in the hands of Putin,\u201d Zelensky said, speaking through an interpreter. The Ukrainian leader added that he had not had any meetings with Chinese representatives in Singapore, despite interest on the Ukrainian side for more dialogue. China last week said it would not send a delegation to the peace summit, saying any international peace conference should have \u201crecognition by both Russia and Ukraine, equal participation by all parties, and fair discussion of all peace plans.\u201d Chinese Minister of National Defense Dong Jun in an address earlier Sunday said China had been \u201cpromoting peace talks with a responsible attitude.\u201d  Dong also appeared to respond to US allegations that China is bolstering Russia\u2019s defense industrial base with dual-use exports, saying in his remarks\u00a0that China has not provided weapons to either side in the conflict and had put \u201cstricter control\u201d on dual-use exports. US defense chief Lloyd Austin raised those transactions with Dong during a sideline meeting Friday, where he warned of consequences for any Chinese support of Russia\u2019s military. When asked about Zelensky\u2019s comments dur\ufeffing a regular press briefing in Beijing Monday, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry defended China\u2019s trade with Russia as \u201cabove board,\u201d adding it was \u201ccertainly not against the peace summit\u201d and there was \u201cno pressure on other countries.\u201d \u201cWe also attach great importance to our relations with Ukraine \u2026 China and Ukraine have maintained communication and cooperation since the Ukrainian crisis escalated,\u201d spokesperson Mao Ning said. \u2018Time is running out\u2019 The Ukrainian leader\u2019s in-person appeal at the Shangri-La Dialogue comes as Ukraine\u2019s troops scramble to repel a major Russian advance into its northeast region of Kharkiv amid shortages of weaponry and manpower more than two years into Russia\u2019s invasion \u2013 raising the urgency for Kyiv to bolster international support for its peace plan. Zelensky\u2019s plan\u00a0calls for the full withdrawal of Russian forces and a restoration of Ukraine\u2019s internationally recognized borders. The Ukrainian leader has previously said he won\u2019t negotiate with Russia until its forces withdraw. \u201cTime is running out\u201d including for Ukrainian children taken by Russia, Zelensky told a packed hall during an address on the closing day of the three-day security meeting. The summit, he said, would address three points of his peace formula, including \u201cnuclear security, food security, and the release of prisoners of war,\u201d as well as \u201cUkrainian children abducted by Russia\u201d and enable countries to come to a consensus on peace in Ukraine that could be \u201cpassed to Russia.\u201d The International Criminal Court in The Hague last year\u00a0issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. Russia has referred to the peace conference as \u201ctrickery\u201d designed by the United States, with a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson last week saying the \u201creal \u2018peace formula\u2019\u201d was for Western countries to stop providing Ukraine with weaponry. So far more than 100 countries and international organizations have committed to join the gathering, Zelensky said. The upcoming peace summit and Ukraine\u2019s defense were also key topics for Zelensky as he held sideline meetings since arriving in Singapore on Saturday. Those included talks with US Defense Secretary Austin, Indonesia\u2019s President-Elect Prabowo Subianto, and Timor-Leste\u2019s President Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, as well as a delegation of American lawmakers. In his meeting with Zelensky Sunday morning, Austin reiterated \u201cunwavering US support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression\u201d and provided an update on American security assistance to Ukraine, according to a readout from Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder after the meeting. Zelensky said in a post on Twitter that the two sides discussed \u201cthe defense needs of our country, bolstering Ukraine\u2019s air defense system, the F-16 coalition, and drafting of a bilateral security agreement.\u201d He also thanked US President Joe Biden for \u201can important decision\u201d regarding defensive strikes with American weapons, in reference to the White House\u2019s decision, as reported by CNN, to permit Ukraine to use American munitions for limited strikes within Russian territory.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/europe/zelensky-ukraine-shangrila-address-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_americas_mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-profile-intl-hnk", "text": "Known as \u201cla Doctora\u201d for her glittering academic credentials, Claudia Sheinbaum is a physicist with a doctorate in energy engineering, the former mayor of one of the world\u2019s most populous cities, and was part of the United Nations panel of climate scientists that received a Nobel Peace Prize. And on Sunday, she became the first woman, and the first Jewish person, to be elected president of Mexico. Sheinbaum won around 60% of the vote in the largest election in Mexico\u2019s history, marking a historic achievement in a mostly Catholic country known for its deeply patriarchal culture. The 61-year-old is set to replace the outgoing President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, her longtime ally whose social welfare programs lifted many Mexicans out of poverty, making their leftist Morena party favorite in the polls. \u201cOur duty is and will always be to look after every single Mexican without distinction,\u201d Sheinbaum said in a speech early Monday morning. \u201cEven though many Mexicans do not fully agree with our project, we will have to walk in peace and harmony to continue building a fair and more prosperous Mexico.\u201d After her maternal grandparents emigrated from Europe to escape the Holocaust, Sheinbaum was born in Mexico City in 1962 \u2013 a city she would go on to serve in various roles across decades. While studying for her undergraduate degree at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), she became immersed in student politics, protesting against the privatization of public education. After graduating, she studied energy engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, where she became fluent in English and earned a Master\u2019s degree, before returning to UNAM for doctoral studies. Sheinbaum entered politics in 2000, when she was appointed environment secretary of Mexico City by Obrador, then the head of the city\u2019s government. After leaving the role in 2006, Sheinbaum committed herself to the study of energy, joining the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and becoming part of the team that received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. In 2015, she became the first woman elected head of the Tlalpan district of Mexico City, serving until 2017. The next year, she was elected head of the government of the whole city \u2013 again, the first woman to do so \u2013 only stepping down in June 2023 to embark on her run for president. Sheinbaum has two children and one grandchild. Her partner, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Tarriba, whom she met at university while both were studying physics, is a financial risk specialist at the Bank of Mexico. What challenges lie ahead? Had the constitution allowed it, Mexico would likely have re-elected Obrador, one of those rare politicians who \u2013 like FDR and JFK \u2013 is known simply by his initials, AMLO. After riding the wave of AMLO\u2019s popularity, some have questioned whether Sheinbaum will be able to distance herself sufficiently from her longtime ally. One of Sheinbaum\u2019s biographers, journalist Jorge Zepeda, has argued that, once in office, Sheinbaum will likely unfurl her own platform gradually: she will first act as \u201cthe faithful disciple of the leader,\u201d before offering \u201cglimpses\u201d of her own program, taking care not to stoke instability in the movement\u2019s base. But Zepeda has also noted clear differences between the two leaders. In an article for the Spanish daily El Pais, Zepeda recalled asking Sheinbaum what sets her apart from other politicians. \u201cI\u2019m someone who makes decisions based on the data,\u201d she told him. By contrast, Zepeda claimed Obrador could sacrifice data for party loyalty. \u201cIf (a piece of) data gets in the way, another piece is chosen,\u201d he said, whereas Sheinbaum allows herself to be guided by the science. Obrador will leave office with broad support and an impressive record of alleviating poverty, but his premiership was marred by his \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d policy of not confronting cartels, allowing violence to spiral. Violence has loomed large in this election, the bloodiest in Mexico\u2019s history. Dozens of political candidates and applicants have been killed by criminal organizations\u00a0trying to influence\u00a0those coming into power. Mexico\u2019s\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is among the highest in the world, and\u00a0more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country. It also remains a dangerous place to be a woman, with\u00a0sky-high femicide\u00a0rates for\u00a0the region \u2013 with figures showing around 10 women\u00a0are murdered every day. Sheinbaum will have to act quickly on Mexico\u2019s organized crime and security issues, said Will Freeman, a fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning that the governing party could win re-election by a landslide as it seems\u2026 given the sweeping violence, the thing is the opposition didn\u2019t seem to put\u00a0together a much more credible\u00a0set of proposals about what\u00a0they would do,\u201d Freeman said. Sheinbaum comes with a team from her time as Mexico City mayor that has a proven record on improving security but it remains to be seen if she can replicate that on a national scale, Freeman said. US-Mexico relations Both Mexico and the US are holding elections in 2024, something that happens only once every 12 years \u2013 and comes at a time of transition in the relationship between the two countries. Sheinbaum will assume office just a month before Americans head to the polls in November, where immigration is a top issue on the ballot for Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Mexico is a key US ally on a range of issues, from trade to cracking down on drug trafficking to managing migration. Current and former US officials have frequently described the relationship between President Joe Biden and Mexico\u2019s President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador as friendly and professional \u2014 and anticipate a productive relationship with Mexico\u2019s next president. But Mexico\u2019s election also comes at a critical time for the Biden administration. In recent months, the US has relied heavily on Mexico to step up immigration enforcement and help stem the flow of migration to the US southern border. The election in Mexico has raised uncertainty in the minds of some Biden officials about what, if anything, will change with a key partner when it comes to border cooperation. One of the considerations in rolling out a new border executive action was doing so after Mexico\u2019s election. The administration will likely need buy-in and assistance from Mexico to execute the order. Officials expect that a new administration in Mexico would likely continue cooperating with the US on migration given years of partnership, but it\u2019s unclear how migrants \u2014 and especially, smugglers \u2014 might plot their next moves in a moment of government transition.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_europe_russia-sexual-violence-occupied-ukraine-intl-cmd", "text": "Within an hour of being arrested by Russian security forces, Roman Shapovalenko was threatened with rape. On August 25, 2022, the day after Ukraine\u2019s Independence Day, he said three armed, masked officers from Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) stormed his home in the southern Ukrainian port city of Kherson, which was occupied by Russian forces at the time. They turned his house inside out searching for incriminating evidence. A message in Shapovalenko\u2019s phone that called Russian soldiers \u201corcs\u201d \u2014 a derisive reference to the evil forces in J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s Middle-earth books and a popular Ukrainian slur for the Russian army \u2014 was enough for them. He said he was tied up, blindfolded and stuffed into an unmarked car. For days after, Shapovalenko said he was repeatedly electrocuted in his genital area, threatened with being raped with a glass bottle, and was even made to believe he could be sterilized. \u201cThey seemed to have a fetish for genitalia. Sometimes the door would open, and they would say: \u2018We\u2019re going to take out our batons and we\u2019re going to rape everyone here,\u2019\u201d the 39-year-old farm manager told CNN. Describing the graphic detail of his experience matter-of-factly, Shapovalenko sometimes paused to laugh nervously. He said his sense of humor is helping with what he knows will be a long recovery. The Russians, he said, hated it. \u201cI made a little joke, and they didn\u2019t like it. I got punched for that.\u201d Shapovalenko\u2019s experience of sexual violence at the hands of Russian forces is common among Ukrainians \u2013 including civilians and soldiers \u2013 who have been detained since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country more than two years ago. Human rights monitors have long reported on the rampant use of sexual violence by Russian police and security forces against prisoners and detainees in Russia. Now it seems Russia is exporting the practice to occupied Ukraine. Few men have spoken publicly about their ordeal, but Ukrainian prosecutors and rights groups say male victims make up a growing proportion of cases. The crimes often go unreported because of the stigma and shame associated with them. The latest United Nations Security Council annual report into conflict-related sexual violence said that 85 cases had been documented in Ukraine in 2023 \u2013 affecting 52 men, 31 women, one girl and one boy. A separate report from UN rights officials who interviewed 60 male Ukrainian prisoners of war following their release found that 39 were victims of sexual violence while in Russian detention. CNN interviewed four male survivors, two in person and two by phone, and obtained testimonies from two more, who were held by Russian units across five Ukrainian regions that have been occupied or annexed by Moscow: Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv and Crimea. All described being subjected to forced nudity, genital electrocution \u2013 most often with wires from the Soviet-era military field telephone TA-57, known as \u201cTapik\u201d \u2013 and threats of rape. Their accounts tallied with cases documented by regional prosecutors in Kyiv, Kherson and Kharkiv and were corroborated by witnesses held in the same detention facilities in Kharkiv and Kherson. Taken together, their stories capture what prosecutors describe as Russia\u2019s systematic and continuing use of sexual violence in occupied areas as part of its efforts to force the Ukrainian people into submission. \u201cWe see it over and over again in different regions under occupation. They use the same method of committing sexual violence, the same method of humiliation, the same method of how they explain it to their victims,\u201d said Anna Sosonska, a Ukrainian prosecutor and the acting chief of the conflict-related sexual violence division in Ukraine\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor General. Speaking to CNN from her office in Kyiv, Sosonska said that a significant number of documented crimes of sexual violence by Russian troops, including forced nudity, genital mutilation, rape and forced exposure to sexual violence against others, were being carried out against men. \u201cEspecially by using electric current on genitals \u2013 that is the top of the list,\u201d she said. \u2018They all laughed\u2019 Roman Chernenko said he spent seven months in a \u201cpunishment cell\u201d in a prison in the occupied city of Olenivka, in the eastern Donetsk region, after he was captured by Russian troops in Mariupol area. The 29-year-old intelligence officer with the Ukrainian military \u2013 who goes by the call sign \u201cOmen\u201d \u2013 described being tortured as often as three times a day, every day, for four months. \u201cTapik is a military phone with two wires. One is connected to your balls, the other to your finger, and they just keep turning the current up,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThey just keep twisting it until the person tells them what they need.\u201d He said he believes officers from Russia\u2019s GRU, the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) and the FSB, Russia\u2019s main intelligence agency, all took part in the torture. Chernenko was released as part of a prisoner exchange in January 2024 and is still recovering from the ordeal. Speaking to CNN a few weeks after his release, on the day he proposed to his girlfriend, he said it was his thoughts of her and his mother that gave him strength to survive captivity. \u201cThey laughed when they tortured me \u2026 they told me that my mother was being f**ked by Chechens. They took me to be shot twice, they threatened me with rape,\u201d he said. CNN asked Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense, Interior Ministry, FSB, National Guard (Rosgvardia) and the military intelligence agency, known as the GRU, for comment on allegations of sexual violence at specific detention facilities, but has not received any response. Rape and sexual violence are explicitly prohibited by the Geneva Conventions \u2013 the set of international laws that regulate the conduct of armed conflict \u2013 and can constitute a war crime. Mock execution is considered a form of torture under international law. Under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), committing rape and sexual violence in a systematic or widespread way is considered a crime against humanity. According to Ukrainian prosecutors investigating conflict-based sexual violence and abuse, all available evidence indicates that it is a deliberate tactic, part of Russia\u2019s modus operandi in Ukraine. \u201cIt\u2019s in every region that was under occupation. Everywhere that Russian troops were located, we\u2019re seeing cases of sexual violence and gender-based violence. The bottom line is that it looks like it is Russian policy,\u201d Sosonska said. As of early May, Ukraine has officially recorded 293 cases of sexual violence, although Sosonska said that it is impossible to estimate the real number of crimes that are being committed, particularly in occupied territories which remain inaccessible to its investigators and prosecutors. Some 37,000 Ukrainian citizens are unaccounted for, according to the Ukrainian ombudsman\u2019s office, with thousands believed to be held in Russian detention and at risk of torture and sexual violence. But the real scale of sexual violence committed during the war may never come to light. Only a fraction of victims tend to come forward and, according to the UN, this is especially true for men, some of whom may not initially realize that what happened to them was a sexual violence crime. Some male victims of sexual violence may describe what happened to them instead as \u201ctorture.\u201d The distinction, Sosonska explained, is important for any future court cases and war tribunals. Her office is also trying to educate the public about the fact that men can be victims of sexual violence \u2013 something Sosonska said may still not be fully understood. Anna Mykytenko, who heads the Ukraine team at Global Rights Compliance (GRC), an international legal non-profit, said that Ukrainian witnesses and survivors of sexual violence have testified that Russian troops told them it was a \u201cpunishment.\u201d \u201cIn several villages in the south we heard witnesses and survivors say that the Russian servicemen came in, occupied the village, and then looked specifically for the wives of Ukrainian soldiers, or their mothers or sisters,\u201d Mykytenko told CNN. GRC acts as the co-lead of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group, an initiative launched by the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom to provide Ukraine with assistance in the investigation and prosecution of atrocity crimes. Mykytenko said that while most cases of conflict-related sexual crimes that were reported and investigated earlier in the war concerned female victims, many of the cases recently recorded have been against male victims, especially against men held in captivity. \u201cSexual crimes are fairly common in detention centers and it\u2019s very common for prisoners of war or civilians to be threatened with rape or with the sexual abuse of different types, this is something that\u2019s almost normal for the Russian and Russia-related armed forces,\u201d she said. \u2018A systematic approach\u2019 The Ukrainian ombudsman\u2019s office told CNN it believes that the Russian armed forces and Ministry of Defense, as well as the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service, are the Russian government bodies officially responsible for what happens inside detention facilities. However, it is Rosgvardia \u2013 a paramilitary police force deployed to keep order in occupied regions of Ukraine \u2013 and the FSB that appear to be driving the campaign of torture and sexual violence against the Ukrainian people, according to the ombudsman and Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence service. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, the FSB has opened several regional offices in occupied Ukraine to recruit agents and gather intelligence. According to an official organizational chart published on its website, the FSB has directorates in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics, in Crimea and in the occupied portions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Several survivors in these locations told CNN that the Russians who submitted them to sexual violence either identified themselves or were referred to by others as FSB officers. Meanwhile, members of Rosgvardia, part of the Russian security apparatus that reports directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin, are working alongside the Russian military to detain activists, quash protests and spread terror among the civilian population in occupied areas. The SBU, Ukraine\u2019s security service, has managed to track down several Rosgvardia and FSB officials who it said were either the direct perpetrators or the enablers of sexual violence against people held in detention. The SBU and the Ukrainian regional prosecutor\u2019s office in Kherson have identified Aleksandr Naumenko, the deputy head of Rosgvardia in Russia\u2019s Rostov region, as a suspect in more than a dozen cases. Ukrainian authorities said last May he was responsible for overseeing a detention facility in Kherson during the occupation and that he personally ordered sexual torture of several victims who were electrocuted in their genital areas. The notice of suspicion against Naumenko, a legal document seen by CNN, alleges that his subordinates and other members of Russian armed forces acted directly on his orders when they sexually abused at least 17 victims. Two other Rosgvardia officers \u2013 Oleksandr Chilengirov and Yehor Bondarenkov \u2013 have also been\u00a0accused of torture, including electrocuting at least 24 victims in their genitals at a different detention facility in Kherson. Dmitry Laikov, an officer with the FSB\u2019s Department for the Defense of Constitutional Order and Fight against Terrorism, is accused of overseeing genital electrocution of a detained Ukrainian citizen in a police station in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka. All four men have been indicted and their cases are currently being heard in court, according to Kherson prosecutors. Their whereabouts are unknown. Ukrainian officials say that it is difficult, but not impossible, to track down individual perpetrators of sexual violence crimes. As of early May, Ukrainian prosecutors had issued official notices of suspicion against 42 Russian officers, filed 19 indictments against 28 individuals and sentenced five people. All of the trials took place in absentia, according to the prosecutors\u2019 office. Sosonska told CNN a handful of cases are added to her file each month, and that investigations are progressing. However, none of the alleged perpetrators are in Ukrainian custody. Oleksii Butenko, a prosecutor in the Kherson regional prosecutor\u2019s office, said he has no doubt that sexual violence was part of Russia\u2019s strategy to subjugate the Ukrainian people in Kherson and to \u201cdestroy the Ukrainian national identity.\u201d \u201cWe can speak of a systematic approach \u2013 17 men were identified as having been sexually abused inside a single torture chamber,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe can say that the leadership, not only the perpetrators but also the management, is responsible \u2013 they gave permission or orders to commit these crimes.\u201d \u2018They were having fun\u2019 Andrii, a Kherson resident who was held in one of the Russian detention facilities, still remembers the screams of his fellow detainees more than a year and half after he was released. \u201cWe were kept in the basement of an office building. It was a small room with no furniture, we slept on cardboard and used a bucket to go to the toilet,\u201d Andrii said. Speaking to CNN in Kyiv, Andrii was clutching his hands nervously, looking away when describing what happened during his time in detention. He asked for his name to be changed and that no identifiable information about him be published. \u201cI was the last one to be taken in for interrogation, so I could hear them all being tortured in the next room. I couldn\u2019t hear the conversations, only the screams and the moans. It was impossible to sleep because of these screams,\u201d he said, recalling one particularly horrifying incident. \u201cI don\u2019t know who this man was and what happened to him \u2026 he was taken out into the corridor, where he was raped with a baton so that everyone could hear and see him.\u201d According to Andrii, the threats of rape and genital electrocution were the norm among the Russian forces. \u201cThey enjoyed it. They were having fun,\u201d he said. Ukrainian prosecutors have recorded incidents of Russian officials raping or attempting to rape victims using objects including batons, a pipe, a bottle, a handle of a shovel, a stick and a pen. Sosonska said her office is determined to bring to justice not just the direct perpetrators, but also those who were in charge \u2013 whether they ordered them or failed to prevent them. Her office is focused on prosecuting individuals, but it is also collecting evidence that will be shared with international courts, including the ICC, which prosecutes individuals over grave offenses such as genocide and war crimes, and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which hears cases brought up against states. The ICC has already issued an arrest warrant for Putin and Russia\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, over an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. The Kremlin has denied the allegations and called the ICC\u2019s actions \u201coutrageous.\u201d Sosonska said she believes that, just like the child deportations, sexual violence is part of what she called \u201cRussia\u2019s genocidal campaign\u201d against Ukraine. \u2018It is happening now\u2019 Oleksii Sivak knew the Russians were coming for him after his neighbor Shapovalenko, the farm manager, was taken. The 39-year-old sailor from Kherson had helped him put up Ukrainian flags around their neighborhood on Ukrainian Independence Day. Both men were civilian volunteers. Shapovalenko had been distributing supplies, helping people evacuate and sharing information about the location of Russian troops with Ukrainian military acquaintances, while Sivak ran a soup kitchen, organizing assistance, distributing leaflets and putting up posters and flags. \u201cWe already knew about these torture rooms; we knew that people do not return from there. I went to deliver soup, warned the people I was helping, cut off all contacts and came home to wait for them,\u201d he said. Hiding or trying to go on the run was not an option, he added, saying he was aware Russian forces were targeting the relatives of people they were interested in. He said eight men came to arrest him \u2013 four in military uniforms and four wearing civilian clothes, all with their faces covered. They took him to a local police station and then handed him over to what they said was the FSB. He recalled being beaten and tortured with an electric current from the same kind of field telephone described as being used in other detention facilities. \u201cThey called it \u2018the lie detector\u2019 and they were obviously having fun when spinning the dynamo, asking me \u2018do you want to call Zelensky?\u2019\u201d he told CNN in an interview in Kyiv. \u201cFirst, they put the clamps on my ears and while they were shocking me, they were also beating me with a stick, kicking me, and hitting me with their hands \u2026 then they moved these wires from my ears to my genitals. They said, \u2018we\u2019re going to sterilize you now\u2019 and things like that, while they were electrocuting my genitals.\u201d Sivak believes he has a pretty good idea why the Russian troops chose to torture him in the way they did and threatened him with rape. \u201cThey wanted to humiliate me. It\u2019s obvious. What do you do to cause a man the most pain? You hurt his wife or his genitals,\u201d he said. Of the dozens of men he was held with, Sivak said roughly half were subjected to sexual violence. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole system. Four people (tortured me) but they were just the hatchet men. Yes, they have no brains, yes, they are animals, but even if they are imprisoned, what about their bosses? Someone was managing them; someone was giving them orders.\u201d Sivak said he and several other survivors have formed an informal support group and are trying to raise awareness of the fact that men can be victims of sexual violence. Sivak has attended meetings with government officials and conferences where he shared his experiences. Ukraine is prepared for a lengthy process to bring perpetrators to justice \u2013 while protecting the victims. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Sosonska\u2019s prosecutors, as well as other civil servants and local government officials, have received specialized training on victim-oriented approaches, learning how to recognize conflict-related sexual violence, run investigations and communicate with victims. Some of the training programs have been provided by the UN in a direct response to the large number of sexual crimes occurring during the occupation. Others are run in cooperation with local non-governmental organizations and victim support groups. The UN has also co-sponsored a psychological helpline specifically aimed at male survivors. It can take years or even longer for courts to rule and victims to speak out. Some survivors of sexual violence committed by the Bosnian Serb army during the Bosnian war in the early 1990s are only now coming forward. \u201cSome survivors might be willing to testify within a few months, for some, it may never happen, they may never be ready,\u201d Sosonska said. As for Shapovalenko, he said he wanted everyone to know what happened to him \u2013 and what is still happening to others. \u201cI want to tell everyone, tell the international community, that it is not like they came, occupied us, stood there with machine guns and left. No, it wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the most terrible thing is not what I am telling you now. The most terrible thing is that it is happening now in the occupied territories.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/europe/russia-sexual-violence-occupied-ukraine-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_tech_fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close", "text": "The Affordable Connectivity Program, which helped low-income Americans get online, is no more. On Friday, the US government announced the final closure of the broadly popular federal program, which has helped tens of millions of households afford internet service, after Republicans in Congress ignored calls by consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers to approve more funding this spring. The program\u2019s lapse threatens to throw nearly 60 million Americans into financial distress,\u00a0CNN has reported. The program officially ends on June 1, said the Federal Communications Commission, which administered the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) to approximately 1 in 5 households\u00a0across the country and\u00a0on tribal reservations. The 2.5-year-old ACP provided eligible low-income Americans with a monthly credit off their internet bills, worth up to $30 per month and as much as $75 per month for households on tribal lands. The pandemic-era program was a hit with members of both political parties and served tens of millions of seniors, veterans and rural and urban Americans alike. Program participants received\u00a0only partial benefits\u00a0in May ahead of the ACP\u2019s expected collapse. \u201cThe Affordable Connectivity Program filled an important gap that provider low-income programs, state and local affordability programs, and the Lifeline program cannot fully address,\u201d said FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement, referring to the name of another, similar FCC program that subsidizes wireless and home internet service. \u201cThe Commission is available to provide any assistance Congress may need to support funding the ACP in the future and stands ready to resume the program if additional funding is provided.\u201d Some US lawmakers proposed bipartisan legislation to extend the ACP in the months leading up to the deadline. But the bills languished in the face of inaction by Republican leaders who showed little interest in engaging with the issue. President Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers have\u00a0publicly blamed\u00a0GOP leadership for allowing the ACP to end. A spokesperson for House Speaker Mike Johnson didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. On Friday, Biden reiterated his calls for Congress to pass legislation extending the ACP. He also announced a series of voluntary commitments by a handful of internet providers to offer \u2014 or continue offering \u2014 their own proprietary low-income internet plans.The list includes AT&T, Comcast, Cox, Charter\u2019s Spectrum and Verizon, among others. Those providers will continue to offer qualifying ACP households a broadband plan for $30 or less, the White House said, and together the companies are expected to cover roughly 10 million of the 23 million households relying on the ACP. The ACP was initially funded by Congress with a one-time budget of $14 billion. Biden has asked for $6 billion to continue the program and one bipartisan bill proposed renewing the ACP with $7 billion in additional funding. Kathryn de Wit, director of the Pew Charitable Trust\u2019s broadband access initiative, said reaching the deadline without a solution from Congress was a \u201cdisheartening\u201d outcome. \u201cWithout intervention, households participating in the program will immediately see their internet bills go up,\u201d de Wit said. \u201cWe know cost is a key barrier to connecting low-income families to the internet, so without ACP we can expect most participating households to either downgrade or drop their plans altogether.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/tech/fcc-affordable-connectivity-program-acp-close/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_americas_mexico-election-result-first-female-president-intl-hnk", "text": "Mexico has elected its first female president,\u00a0with preliminary results showing Claudia Sheinbaum, a climate scientist and Mexico City\u2019s former mayor, is on track to win the country\u2019s largest election in history. Sheinbaum has won between\u00a058.3% and 60.7% of the vote,\u00a0according to what is known as Quick Count, an exercise that the National Electoral Institute (INE) carries out based on a statistical sample of ballots from polling stations. The 61-year-old rode the wave of popularity of her\u00a0longtime political ally, the outgoing leftist Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and their Morena party. Sheinbaum is not only set to be Mexico\u2019s first female president, but also the country\u2019s first Jewish leader, although she rarely speaks publicly about her personal background and has governed as a secular leftist. Sheinbaum said her administration would govern all Mexicans \u201cwithout distinction.\u201d \u201cEven though many Mexicans do not fully agree with our project, we will have to walk in peace and harmony to continue building a fair and more prosperous Mexico,\u201d she told crowds of supporters that filled the main square in Mexico City, the Z\u00f3calo, in the early hours of Monday. She spoke about the historical significance of becoming the first female president of the country. \u201cI am also grateful because, for the first time in 200 years of the republic, I will become the first woman president of Mexico,\u201d she said. Trailing Sheinbaum is opposition candidate X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez, backed by a coalition of the National Action (PAN), Institutional Revolutionary (PRI) and Democratic Revolution (PRD) parties,\u00a0with between 26.6% and 28.6% of the votes. In third place is the Citizens\u2019 Movement candidate, Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez, with\u00a0between 9.9% and 10.8% of the votes. According to the quick count results, participation in the presidential election\u00a0was\u00a0between 58.9% and 61.7% of the electorate of nearly 100 million people. Obrador, the outgoing president and Sheinbaum\u2019s political mentor, congratulated Sheinbaum on her win. \u201cWith all my affection and respect I congratulate Claudia Sheinbaum who came out victorious with an ample margin. She will be the first (female) President of Mexico\u2026 but also the President, possibly, with most votes obtained in all of the history of our country,\u201d he said in a\u00a0video\u00a0posted on X. Sheinbaum\u2019s projected win is a remarkable moment for a country that is a world leader when it comes to gender equality in elected office, a position it cemented in 2019 with constitutional reform. It\u00a0outflanks\u00a0several countries in\u00a0terms of women\u2019s\u00a0parliamentary representation. Yet Mexico remains a dangerous place to be a woman: it has\u00a0sky-high femicide\u00a0rates with around 10 women\u00a0murdered in Mexico every day. Sheinbaum ran Mexico\u2019s most important city for\u00a0five years until her resignation last June to run for the presidency. She is also the co-author of a Nobel-winning\u00a0Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report\u00a0and is married to Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda Tarriba Unger. She is seen as a continuation of the status quo left by L\u00f3pez Obrador, whose\u00a0social welfare programs boosted the Morena party\u2019s\u00a0popularity and had a positive impact on the lives of poorer Mexicans. Under the Mexican constitution, presidents can only be elected to one term and cannot run again. Sheinbaum has pledged to continue her predecessor\u2019s policies, including a pension for all senior citizens, scholarships for more than 12 million students and free fertilizers for small farm owners, but has rejected criticism of her close political alignment with\u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador. She is set to be replaced as the mayor of Mexico City by another women, Clara Marina Brugada Molina from Scheinbaum\u2019s Morena party. She secured between 49% and 52.8% of the votes, according to the Quick Count, while the opposition Santiago Taboada got 37.2% to 40.5% of the votes. Largest election Sunday\u2019s poll was the largest election in the country\u2019s history. More than 98 million voters were registered to cast a ballot, and 1.4 million Mexicans were eligible to vote abroad. In addition to the presidency, more than 20,000 positions\u00a0were being contested by an estimated 70,000 candidates vying to become senators, mayors and governors. But the elections were plagued by immense violence. There have been more than 20 political killings since September, according to the Mexican government. By some estimates though, that number is even higher. According to Mexican consultancy firm Integralia, at least 34 candidates were murdered in the run-up to the vote. Voting was suspended for several hours on Sunday in the southeastern Mexican town of Coyomeapan due to violence at the polling centers, according to state electoral authorities. And while\u00a0the murder rate fell\u00a0in Mexico\u00a0between 2019 and 2022, in absolute numbers the country is still reeling from historically high levels of around 30,000 homicides\u00a0each year. The true number is likely higher, experts say. The violence appeared to have been a top concern for voters as cartels extend their grip through Mexico. Sheinbaum has been coy about her security proposals but has pointed to her record as Mexico City mayor, when, according to her team, she improved the police force\u2019s working conditions and intelligence-gathering abilities. One big challenge for her will be\u00a0convincing voters that she can end the culture of impunity in Mexico, where around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved in\u00a02022, according to think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua. After the final results come in, the Electoral Tribunal of the Judicial Branch of the Federation (TEPJF) must receive and analyze any possible challenges to the process, as well as qualify the presidential election no later than September 6. If the court validates the election, Sheinbaum will take office on October 1. Her term will last six years, from 2024 to 2030.

{"id": "2024_06_03_americas_mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-challenges-intl-latam", "text": "Claudia Sheinbaum won a landslide victory to become the first female president of Mexico and first Jewish person in the role, adding to the growing list of accolades to the climate scientist and former mayor of Mexico City. But\u00a0when\u00a0she formally takes office in October,\u00a0how\u00a0will\u00a0she\u00a0tackle the biggest challenges facing the country as concerns about its security and the future of its democracy loom large? Complicating her administration\u2019s debut,\u00a0Sheinbaum will also have to contend with the shadow of her polarizing mentor, the outgoing President Andres Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, from the same Morena party. Sunday\u2019s vote was widely seen as a referendum on L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s term. And while his popular social welfare policies have helped push many Mexicans above the poverty line, experts say his security measures have done little to address the expanding reach of organized crime in the country. In a speech following the election, Sheinbaum promised to govern for all and to be an investor-friendly president. \u201cWe know that dissent is part of democracy. And although the majority of the people support our project, our duty is and will always be to look after each and every one of the Mexicans without distinction,\u201d she said as she struck a conciliatory tone at the end of the highly partisan race. \u201cSo, although many Mexicans do not fully agree with our project, we will have to walk in peace and harmony to continue building a fair and more prosperous Mexico.\u201d She promised a government \u201cwithout corruption or impunity\u201d and guided by \u201crepublican austerity, financial and fiscal discipline and autonomy of the Bank of Mexico.\u201d A victory for the Morena party While Sheinbaum\u2019s victory was widely expected this weekend, the \u201cbiggest story of last night\u201d was that the Morena party looked set to gain supermajorities in both houses of Congress,\u00a0said\u00a0Carin Zissis, a Mexico expert, and editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council\u2019s website. On Monday morning, the Mexican peso slipped roughly 3% against the US dollar amid rising concern that the ruling party will have a clear path to pass controversial constitutional reforms sought by L\u00f3pez Obrador. The reforms include a range of issues in areas like pensions and the energy sector, but they also include controversial judicial and institutional reforms,\u00a0which critics say\u00a0would weaken the separation of powers and see the disappearance of some independent regulatory agencies. \u201cWe have to see what happens when she comes into office: There has been a history of Mexican presidents breaking the path of their predecessors, even when their predecessors more or less selected them,\u201d Zissis said, adding: \u201cThough, [Sheinbaum] has pledged throughout her campaign to continue his legacy.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador has pushed back on suggestions that he would be giving Sheinbaum cues, saying on Monday that he would not \u201cinfluence\u201d his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\u00a0Sheinbaum is now \u201cthe one empowered to make all the decisions,\u201d he said. One of Sheinbaum\u2019s biographers, journalist Jorge Zepeda, has\u00a0speculated\u00a0that, once in office, Sheinbaum will unfurl her own platform gradually: she will first act as \u201cthe faithful disciple of the leader,\u201d before offering \u201cglimpses\u201d of her own program, taking care not to stoke instability in the movement\u2019s base. Gang violence and security Violence has dominated this year\u2019s election, with dozens of candidates murdered in the run-up to the vote and gangs trying to influence who was coming to power. Sheinbaum inherits a tragic epidemic of unsolved disappearances in the country:\u00a0More than 100,000 Mexicans and migrants have disappeared, with no explanation of their fate for families.\u00a0According to the think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua,\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved\u00a0in the country in\u00a02022. Mexico also remains a dangerous place to be a woman and is \u201csadly, known for high levels of femicide gender-based violence where the number of disappeared women has gone up and up year to year,\u201d Stephanie Brewer, Mexico Director at the Washington Office for Latin America (WOLA), told CNN. With security at the top of voters\u2019 concerns, Sheinbaum\u00a0has pointed to her record as Mexico City mayor, with her team crediting her for improvements to the police\u2019s pay, working conditions and intelligence-gathering capabilities \u2013 although there is some debate as to how much impact these measures had on bringing down the crime rate, experts said. But will\u00a0Sheinbaum\u2019s tactics as mayor of\u00a0Mexico City\u00a0be replicable\u00a0at the federal level and in Mexico\u2019s 31 states, home to more than 126 million people?\u00a0She will have to tackle a landscape\u00a0where criminal groups have expanded their reach. An hour away from Mexico City, in the state of Morelos, Will Freeman, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said he was told that organized criminal groups had \u201ctheir own political candidates\u201d in the town of Cuautla who could rely on armed wings to intimidate other people. Gangs in the country have also diversified to sectors beyond the illicit manufacture of drugs.\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re doing illegal logging, illegal mining. They\u2019re taking control of the water supply, which is increasingly scarce,\u201d Freeman said. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s\u00a0term saw the expansion of the militarization of public security to tackle crime, a two-decades-long approach that\u00a0has coincided with historically high levels of homicides. A\u00a0May\u00a0report by the Crisis Group\u00a0found official corruption and collusion was hampering effective law enforcement. (CNN has yet to receive comment from Mexican Secretary of Defense and the president\u2019s office over the findings.) Sheinbaum has largely remained coy about her security programs, but has said \u201cthat at the national level we can advance even more in terms of security,\u201d she said in a\u00a0tweet on X, which listed out her security strategy that included the consolidation of the National Guard, strengthened intelligence and research, and better\u00a0coordination between the police, state prosecutors\u2019 offices and the attorney general\u2019s office. Where Washington and Mexico City meet Sheinbaum has\u00a0previously signaled\u00a0the importance of the US-Mexico relationship, especially around trade. \u201cWith the United States there will be a relationship of friendship, respect, mutual respect and equality as it has been until now, and we will always defend the Mexicans who are on the other side of the border,\u201d she said late on Sunday, local time. But analysts note there will probably be differences between US and Mexico when it comes to foreign policy.\u00a0Sheinbaum is from the ideological and political left, and \u201cI think she will be as friendly as L\u00f3pez Obrador towards Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua [and] will not probably take the geopolitical positions the US would hope for\u201d over Gaza and Ukraine, Freeman said. L\u00f3pez Obrador has angered advocates\u00a0on both sides\u00a0of the Israel and Gaza conflict.\u00a0Mexico has ruled out breaking diplomatic relations with Israel, in contrast to some of its Latin American counterparts, but it has also sought to join South Africa\u2019s genocide case against Israel. Sheinbaum\u00a0condemned\u00a0the violence following Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel and has\u00a0previously\u00a0called for a Palestinian state. In a 2009 letter to the editor of a Mexican newspaper, Sheinbaum wrote that many of her relatives from her grandparent\u2019s generation \u201cwere exterminated in the concentration camps.\u201d She added that \u201cbecause of my Jewish origin, because of my love for Mexico and because I feel like a citizen of the world, I share with millions the desire for justice, equality, fraternity and peace, and therefore, I can only see with horror the images of the state bombings,\u201d referring to an Israeli bombing campaign of Gaza that year. \u201cNo reason justifies the murder of Palestinian civilians,\u201d she wrote in\u00a0La Jornada. A partner to the US on migration? Sheinbaum will assume office just a month before Americans head to the polls in November, where immigration is a top issue on the ballot for candidates President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump \u2013\u00a0both of whom have\u00a0relied heavily on Mexico to step up immigration enforcement and help stem the flow of migration to the US southern border. While migration across the countries\u2019 1,933 miles long border is a shared concern,\u00a0migration is not a major issue among Mexican voters, Zissis said. Still, under L\u00f3pez Obrador, the Mexican government has accepted US deportations of tens of thousands of non-Mexican citizens under a 2023 Biden administration rule. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration\u00a0also stepped up efforts to block the path of migrants heading to the US by transporting large numbers of people from the north of Mexico to the south. But while Mexico\u2019s policies may have become a \u201cmajor factor\u201d\u00a0in reducing\u00a0some\u00a0migrant crossing\u00a0at\u00a0the United States\u2019 southern border, Brewer said it is \u201cnot a sustainable model for anyone\u201d \u2013 especially\u00a0not for\u00a0migrants who\u00a0are often targeted for\u00a0violence in Mexico. Will Sheinbaum keep up Mexico\u2019s assistance to US immigration policy?\u00a0The transition of power\u00a0is likely now\u00a0raising\u00a0uncertainty in the minds of some Biden officials about what\u00a0could\u00a0change\u00a0with its key partner\u00a0at the border.

{"id": "2024_05_31_asia_shangrila-dialogue-philippines-china-intl-hnk", "text": "The death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war, Philippines President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. warned Friday as his nation faces increasingly fraught clashes with Chinese vessels in the South China Sea. Marcos delivered the keynote speech of the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, a regional gathering of global security leaders, including US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart Adm. Dong Jun. The Philippine president was asked by a member of the audience whether a \u201cred line\u201d would be crossed if Chinese Coast Guard ships, which have frequently deployed water cannons against Philippine vessels in recent months, ended up killing a Filipino sailor. \u201cIf a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act, that is, I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war and therefore we will respond accordingly,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd our treaty partners, I believe, also hold that same standard,\u201d he added. China has increasingly pushed its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and China Coast Guard ships, reinforced by maritime militia boats, have been involved in a series of fraught clashes over the last year that has seen Philippine ships damaged and Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. With confrontations increasingly souring the Beijing-Manila relationship, Marcos has sought out closer ties with the United States, with which the Philippines maintains a mutual defense treaty. As part of that relationship, the US has gained increased rights to use Philippine military bases and the two allies have expanded bilateral military exercises. US officials consistently say the mutual defense pact is \u201ciron-clad\u201d and Philippine naval, coast guard and civilian vessels are covered by it. That raises the prospect that should one of the many maritime clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the South China Sea turn deadly, it could pile pressure on Washington to support its ally \u2013 and even drag the US military into a conflict. \u201cWe already have suffered injury. But thank God we have not yet gotten to the point where any of our participants, civilian or otherwise have been killed,\u201d Marcos said, referring to increasingly fraught clashes with China\u2019s coast guard ships. \u201cBut once we get to that point (a fatality)\u2026 we would certainly have crossed the Rubicon. Is that a red line? Almost certainly it is going to be a red line,\u201d he said. Key global waterway China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea \u2013 one of the world\u2019s busiest waterways. But portions of it are also claimed by governments in Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan as well as the Philippines. In 2016, in a case brought by the Philippines, an international tribunal in the Hague ruled that China\u2019s claim to historic rights to the bulk of the sea had no legal basis. But Beijing has rejected the tribunal\u2019s ruling and continued its military buildup, with many features lying hundreds of miles away from China\u2019s mainland. It also maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels \u2013 which has frequently stoked tensions with its neighbors. Marcos addressed the dispute multiple times in his speech. \u201cIllegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction,\u201d he said, adding that the Philippines would defend it\u2019s sovereignty to \u201cthe last square millimeter.\u201d \u201cThe life-giving waters of the West Philippine Sea flow in the blood of every Filipino. We cannot allow anyone to detach it from the totality of the maritime domain that renders our nation whole,\u201d he added. In the past week, Marcos has been raising concerns over a new Chinese policy that give its coast guard new powers of detention in Chinese-claimed areas of the South China Sea, including areas that lie within the Philippines Exclusive Economic Zone. Meanwhile, the Philippine Navy said it is prepared to protect the rights of Filipinos and would be increasing patrols in the South China Sea, including the areas of contested sovereignty, according to the PNA. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said earlier this week that the new regulations are \u201cin line with common international practices.\u201d \u201cAs long as there is no illegal behavior by any individual or entity, there is no need to worry,\u201d spokesperson Mao Ning said. \u201cWhat I want to emphasize is that it is not China but the Philippines that has frequently escalated the situation in the South China Sea,\u201d Ning added. In his speech Marcos also warned that growing rivalry between the United States and China was impacting the entire Asia-Pacific region. \u201cThe strategic competition between China and the United States is permeating the evolving regional landscape. This rivalry is constraining the strategic choices of regional states. This contest is exacerbating flashpoints, it has created new security dilemmas,\u201d Marcos told delegates. \u201cThe continued stability of this region requires China and the United States to manage that rivalry in a responsible manner,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/asia/shangrila-dialogue-philippines-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_tech_elon-musk-byd-china-nightcap", "text": "The most important carmaker in the world right now is the Chinese-owned, Warren Buffett-backed company that has Elon Musk in a pickle. BYD, a carmaker Musk once laughed at, overtook Tesla at the end of last year as the top seller of electric vehicles on the planet (Tesla overtook it in the first quarter of this year, but they\u2019re neck and neck). And now it\u2019s giving Toyota a run for its money, unveiling a new hybrid powertrain that BYD says is capable of taking you from New York to Miami without refueling. That\u2019s 1,300 miles in one go \u2014 hundreds of miles beyond the standard ranges for other hybrids on the market. According to The Wall Street Journal, ranges of major global hybrid carmakers typically top out just above 680 miles. BYD\u2019s Hong Kong shares shot up more than 5% on Wednesday. There are a few reasons why all of that matters. One: Tesla is America\u2019s best-selling EV, but it\u2019s losing market share overseas to foreign competitors that can make their cars cheaper. And while Tesla is an EV pioneer, it hasn\u2019t rolled out any significant innovations in recent years that would help justify its loftier price point. That\u2019s why BYD \u2014 which makes both EVs and hybrids \u2014 is now eating Tesla\u2019s lunch on the global stage. China is the world\u2019s biggest auto market, and BYD is its top seller, surpassing Volkswagen last year. On top of all that, BYD\u2019s sedans are cheap. The two models that will boast the new drivetrain start at around $14,000. (For comparison, the best-selling hybrid in the US, the Toyota Prius, starts at $28,000.) BYD\u2019s evolution from a small producer of clunkers to a global powerhouse brand has surprised its skeptics, including Musk, who roundly dismissed BYD in a 2011 Bloomberg interview. In that exchange, Musk responds to an honest question about BYD rivaling Tesla with a smug laugh. \u201cHave you seen their car?\u201d he asks the interviewer rhetorically. When the reporter presses him, he clarifies that he thinks BYD\u2019s product is not \u201cparticularly attractive\u201d and that the technology is \u201cnot very strong.\u201d Of course, a lot happened in the decade that followed, and Musk ate his words this January, saying on an earnings call that he believes Chinese EV makers could \u201cpretty much demolish most other car companies in the world\u201d unless stronger trade barriers are put in place. (They were two weeks ago.) Meanwhile, BYD has another edge that Tesla lacks: It makes hybrids. Hybrid cars like the Prius were supposed to be the short-lived stepping stone to our all-electric future. But in the United States, at least, EV sales are flagging in part because the nation\u2019s roads lack the infrastructure to support them. EV ranges have come a long way \u2014 most get more than 300 miles of range per charge, which is more than most people would drive before stopping even in a traditional car. Problem is, we don\u2019t have enough charging stations along the roads or within cities to make customers comfortable with the idea. The top reason US customers won\u2019t consider an EV \u2014 cited by 52% of consumers in a recent JD Power survey \u2014 is lack of charging station availability. Instead, we\u2019re buying more hybrids, which are largely cheaper than EVs, reduce the cost of fuel over the long term and are ever so slightly better for the environment than regular engines. (Emphasis on slightly\u2026 Hybrids still run on fossil fuels, they\u2019re not doing much to help the world meet its climate goals the way mass adoption of EVs would.) For now, Tesla and other US carmakers are being thoroughly shielded from Chinese competition via strict tariffs and major regulatory hurdles. But it\u2019s not clear how long those protections will hold if American consumers begin demanding the cheaper options available overseas.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/tech/elon-musk-byd-china-nightcap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_middleeast_israeli-ministers-biden-ceasefire-plan-intl", "text": "Two far-right Israeli ministers have threatened to resign and bring down the governing coalition of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he accepts a peace proposal laid out by US President Joe Biden. Biden unveiled on Friday what he said was a three-phase Israeli proposal to end the conflict in Gaza that would pair a release of hostages with a \u201cfull and complete ceasefire.\u201d During a speech at the White House, Biden said Hamas had been degraded to a point where it could no longer carry out the type of attack seen on October 7 that launched the current war in Gaza. \u201cIt\u2019s time\u00a0for this war to end,\u201d he said, a clear indication that \u2013 as far as he is concerned \u2013 Israel\u2019s war goals have been met. But the Israeli government\u2019s two most prominent far-right members, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, made it explicitly clear they reject an immediate ceasefire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also signaled he is not ready either, casting doubt over Biden\u2019s proposal. In a statement on social media, Smotrich said he had \u201cmade it clear\u201d to Netanyahu that he would not \u201cbe part of a government that will agree to the proposed outline and end the war without destroying Hamas and returning all the hostages.\u201d Smotrich demanded the fighting to continue until the \u201cdestruction of Hamas and the return of all the hostages,\u201d as well as the \u201ccreation of a completely different security reality in Gaza and Lebanon.\u201d National Security Minister Ben Gvir meanwhile described the deal as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201ca victory for terrorism,\u201d as well as a security danger to Israel. \u201cIf the prime minister implements the reckless deal under the conditions published today, which mean the end of the war and the giving up on the elimination of Hamas, Otzma Yehudit will dissolve the government,\u201d he said, referring to the far-right party he leads and which helps prop up Netanyahu\u2019s majority in parliament. Biden had alluded to the tensions in the Israeli government in his speech, making a direct appeal to ordinary Israelis to voice their support. \u201cI know there are those in Israel who will not agree with this plan and will call for the war to continue indefinitely. Some, some are even in the government coalition,\u201d he said. Netanyahu under pressure The proposal would first see hostages freed and Israel withdrawing from \u201call populated areas of Gaza,\u201d and eventually culminate in a reconstruction plan for Gaza, which has been left in ruins from the fighting. The plan has been widely welcomed, with the UN and other international powers urging Israel and Hamas to accept it. Hamas said it viewed the plan \u201cpositively\u201d and was ready \u201cto deal positively and constructively with any proposal based on a permanent ceasefire.\u201d Less than an hour after Biden detailed the proposal, Netanyahu insisted Israel will not end the war in Gaza until it had achieved all of its goals, including the destruction of Hamas. The extent to which Netanyahu agrees with the plan is unclear, as the statement also said that the \u201cexact outline\u201d of Israel\u2019s proposal allows Israel to \u201cmaintain these\u00a0principles.\u201d On Sunday, the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant warned Israel will \u201cnot accept\u201d any deal to end the war which would allow Hamas to rule over Gaza. During a visit to the Israeli military\u2019s Southern Command headquarters on Sunday, Gallant said options for a \u201cgoverning alternative to Hamas\u201d are being considered. \u201cWe will not accept the rule of Hamas in Gaza at any stage in any process aimed at ending the war,\u201d Gallant said, according to a readout from his office. However, Hamas has made it clear it will not accept any other group governing Gaza. On May 16, the group\u2019s political leader Ismail Haniyeh noted that, in regards to \u201cthe day after the war,\u201d there had been \u201ccalls to remove Hamas.\u201d \u201cWe say that Hamas is here to stay,\u201d Haniyeh responded. On Sunday the White House National Security Council spokesperson John\u00a0Kirby said the administration was currently \u201cwaiting for an official response from Hamas\u201d on the Israeli ceasefire proposal. Pressed on whether there would be a situation in which Hamas would agree to the proposal but Israel would not, speaking on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d Kirby said that the Biden administration has \u201cevery expectation\u201d that Israel would agree. \u201cWe have every expectation that if Hamas agrees to the proposal, as was transmitted to them, an Israeli proposal, that Israel would say yes,\u201d Kirby added. Netanyahu faces pressure from more than just within his own coalition. On Saturday protesters again took to the streets, demanding his resignation and early elections. Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has offered to back Netanyahu in accepting the proposal, and condemned the comments by Smotrich and Ben Gvir. \u201cThe threats of Ben Gvir and Smotrich are the neglect of national security, of the hostages and of the residents of the north and the south,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the worst and most reckless government in the country\u2019s history. For them, there will be a war here forever, zero responsibility, zero management, a complete failure. Netanyahu\u2019s government is facing growing international calls to end the war in Gaza as the conflict approaches its ninth month. The war was triggered by Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians on October 7, which left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 200 people taken hostage. The Israeli campaign in Gaza since then has killed more than 36,000 people.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/02/middleeast/israeli-ministers-biden-ceasefire-plan-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_02_europe_russia-defense-ministry-shakeup-intl", "text": "Removing a long-time defense minister from his post is nothing out of the ordinary. Arresting five of his senior staff, however, is clearly more than just a search for fresh blood \u2014 especially in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. After the shock ouster, two weeks ago, of Sergei Shoigu as the minister for defense, a wave of arrests has gutted the defense ministry\u2019s top brass under the guise of an anti-corruption campaign. The timing is as intriguing as the arrests and reshuffle. After almost three years of failure on the battlefields in Ukraine, Russia has just gained the upper hand. It has, in recent weeks, launched a largely successful offensive in the north, toward Kharkiv, coupled with victories in the Donbas region in the east, too. Ukraine\u2019s crippling manpower shortage and dwindling ammunition supplies \u2014 exacerbated by months of stalling in the US Congress to approve a military support package \u2014 have also helped reverse Russia\u2019s fortunes. So the question then is, why shake up the ministry in charge of winning the war now? Analysts who spoke to CNN described the defense ministry as one of the most corrupt in the country. Russian state media has been disclosing military contracts worth eye-watering sums of money and publicly shaming the ministry\u2019s senior officials and their lavish lifestyles. But as one analyst told CNN, what we are witnessing is a \u201cvery complex polycentric game,\u201d one that is related to timing and Putin\u2019s existential search for victory against the West. Prigozhin message from the grave Hanging over this shake-up is the ghost of Yevgeny Prigozhin, boss of the Wagner mercenary group, who was also formerly known as \u201cPutin\u2019s Chef.\u201d Before his death, he had expressed hatred for Shoigu and Russia\u2019s top general, Valery Gerasimov, through profanity-laden tirades, accusing them and the ministry of corruption and incompetence. Prigozhin led a mutiny on Moscow that was supposed to end with the overthrow of Shoigu and Gerasimov. Instead, he put the president in an awkward position and challenged his authority. Putin responded by describing Prigozhin as a traitor and stripped him of his assets, all before he died in a suspicious plane crash, alongside his most senior advisers. Since then, Putin has kept the inefficiencies of the ministry\u2019s weapons procurement, as well as its bungled invasion of Ukraine and corruption allegations, out of the public eye, keen to show he would not make any knee-jerk reactions following the mutiny. Doing so might question his authority and strength to the Russian people. Putin was likely awaiting his reelection by the Russian people in March before making moving in on the defense ministry. The changes came shortly after Victory Day celebrations on May 9, which Putin and Shoigu attended, side by side, in a seemingly amicable appearance. Despite his removal as defense minister, Shoigu will remain in Putin\u2019s orbit after being moved sideways to a new role as secretary of the security council. Putin\u2019s interests: Ukraine Tatiyana Stanovaya, Senior Fellow at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told CNN that whether Prigozhin may have been right about the officials\u2019 corruption is not what\u2019s important. In Russia, she said, \u201cright and wrong doesn\u2019t exist in politics \u2014 only interests matter.\u201d Putin\u2019s interest is in keeping his house in order but, more pressingly, achieving victory in Ukraine. The defense ministry is central to how that war ends. With Putin installing a civilian economist, Andrey Belousov, as the new defense minister, he has signaled he wants the ministry, with its vast budget, to procure weapons more quickly and economically. Russia\u2019s 2024 budget shows it is seeking to spend 6% of GDP on defense, the highest in modern Russian history, and will outpace social spending \u2014 a sign of the country\u2019s transition to a wartime economy. The corruption in question \u2013 Shamarin and Ivanov Mikhail Komin, a Russian political scientist and Visiting Fellow at the European Council of Foreign Affairs based in Vienna, told CNN that \u201cShoigu\u2019s group, among the Russian elites, is one of the most rent-seeking. More, for example, than some of Putin\u2019s inner circle.\u201d Last Friday, Lieutenant General Vadim Shamarin, chief of the Main Communication Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces, was charged with \u201creceiving a bribe on an especially large scale,\u201d of 36 million rubles (around $393,000) from a factory that supplies the ministry with communications equipment. In exchange, he is alleged to have awarded the company lucrative government contracts. Shamarin has pleaded not guilty, according to Russian state media. Russian state media has also played a role in communicating the Kremlin\u2019s crackdown on the ministry. Following Shamarin\u2019s arrest in May, state-run Ria Novosti reported that his wife had purchased a Mercedez-Benz GLE in 2018 for 20 million rubles (about $218,000) at a time when his income was no higher than $34,000. A separate report found her income that year was 872,000 rubles ($9,740). The highest profile of the five officials arrested was Timur Ivanov, the deputy defense minister. He was put under house arrest in late April, also on suspicion of taking bribes. Ivanov had become a focus of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, founded by Alexey Navalny, who was killed in a Russian prison in February. He and his organization exposed the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by Ivanov\u2019s partner \u2014 visiting invite-only jewelers, wearing couture clothing and owning a chalet in the chic ski resort of Courchevel in France. They questioned how she afforded such a lifestyle when her husband\u2019s salary was officially $175,000 a year. Russian state media reported that Ivanov maintains his innocence, citing its own source. There can\u2019t be overlap, but corruption will still remain For Stanovaya, the reasons for replacing figures such as Ivanov and Shamarin are simple. \u201cPart of Putin\u2019s logic is that you can\u2019t field someone in this position (as defense minister) where there are significant interests of the previous.\u201d To help clean up the ministry, Putin has appointed Oleg Savelyev, a former auditor at the Russia Accounts Chamber, as the deputy minister of defense. He will be \u201caware of the corruption that already exists in the defense sector,\u201d Komin said. Prigozhin\u2019s final wish Given the sweeping changes made by the president, rumors have swirled about the position of the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Valery Gerasimov, the other target of Prigozhin\u2019s rants. Stanovaya said, \u201cThere are so many rumors now that he [Gerasimov] might be dismissed soon,\u201d but the fact he has so far been spared gives Gerasimov \u201ca window to start fighting for his own interests,\u201d she added. \u201cGerasimov is fighting against his enemies, trying to secure his future,\u201d Stanovaya said. Komin agreed that Gerasimov may keep his position for now, as Putin has said he does not intend to make any other changes. Crucially, Komin suggested that Gerasimov\u2019s luck may be that there lacks a position, similar to Shoigu\u2019s where he can publicly be moved aside without completely tarnishing his reputation, \u201cit\u2019s not a big deal to find the new guy. It\u2019s more a big deal to find the place for the previous guy.\u201d In Putin\u2019s Russia the president remains laser focused on winning in Ukraine, but recent overtures have shown that the supporting cast may change and the president is ready to be ruthless in his search of victory.

{"id": "2024_06_01_americas_mexico-election-explainer-intl-latam", "text": "On June 2, Mexicans will vote to pick their next president in a historic race that could see a woman take the top job for the first time. In addition to the presidency, there are more than 20,000 positions to fill and an estimated 70,000 candidates vying for those offices, including 128 senate seats and 500 deputy seats; the mayorship of Mexico City; and governor\u2019s offices in Chiapas, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Morelos, Puebla, Tabasco, Veracruz and Yucat\u00e1n. Here\u2019s who is running for president: Claudia Sheinbaum The 61-year-old Sheinbaum is a former Mexico City mayor and climate scientist. A longtime political ally of incumbent President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, she was the\u00a0Mexico City\u00a0environment secretary\u00a0from 2000-2006\u00a0when he\u00a0was mayor. If she wins, Sheinbaum would be not only the first female president in Mexico, but the first president with Jewish heritage, although she rarely speaks publicly about her personal background and has governed as a secular leftist. Her close alignment with L\u00f3pez Obrador has been both a blessing and a curse politically. Sheinbaum has said she\u2019s\u00a0\u201cnot a close copy\u201d of L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 but she also doesn\u2019t shy away from touting the principles they share, even repeating his slogans on the campaign trail. (L\u00f3pez Obrador has repeatedly dismissed whispers that he favors a candidate that he could influence, telling press in February that he would \u201cretire completely\u201d after his term.) Among her policies,\u00a0Sheinbaum has promised: \u2022 Continuing Lopez Obrador\u2019s pension for all senior citizens\u2022 Scholarships for more than 12 million students\u2022 Free fertilizers for small farm owners\u2022 On security, she proposed consolidating\u00a0the\u00a0National Guard, reform of judiciary, strengthening intelligence and research and coordination with law enforcement authorities. X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez Backed by an opposition coalition of Mexico\u2019s PRI, PAN and PRD parties, X\u00f3chitl G\u00e1lvez is a former senator and previously served as the top official for indigenous affairs under former President Vicente Fox. The daughter of an indigenous father and a mixed-race mother, the 61-year-old was a businesswoman before entering politics. For a relative newcomer, Galvez\u2019s entry into the presidential race has\u00a0gained impressive momentum, experts say. Her proposals include: \u2022 Continuing Lopez Obrador\u2019s pension for all senior citizens\u2022 A \u201cuniversal social protection system\u201d of welfare programs for middle and lower classes\u2022 A security approach that would strengthen local and state police\u2022 Galvez has also hinted that that oil-rich Mexico should invest more in renewable energy, saying earlier this year: \u201cWe haven\u2019t done it because we are dumbasses.\u201d Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez A late entrant in the race, Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez shot to international attention earlier this month, when a stage collapsed at his campaign event in the northeastern city of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda, killing nine people and leaving at least 121 people injured. The 38-year-old has pledged to: \u2022 Eliminate the crime of simple drug possession to to stop criminalizing poverty, and move from prohibitionism to regulation of drugs\u2022 End the\u00a0longstanding militarization of Mexico\u00a0and instead focus on training and strengthening police\u2022 He has also proposed a gradual economic reform\u00a0including\u00a0a universal pension system, guaranteed labor rights and income and progressive tax reform\u2022 M\u00e1ynez\u00a0has also called for\u00a0transforming the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) and Pemex into renewable and clean energy companies,\u00a0and\u00a0for closing some refineries The key issues: Security and migration Security and immigration are top issues for all of Mexico\u2019s presidential candidates. Campaigning in the run-up to the election has been marred by dozens of assassination attempts and other political violence. There are concerns now that that the attacks have already\u00a0cooled off campaigns; experts and political parties say some candidates have renounced their bids in fear of their lives. But electoral violence is just a part of Mexico\u2019s broader security crisis, with sky-high\u00a0crime\u00a0and\u00a0homicide rates.\u00a0In the first four and a half years of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s government,\u00a0160,594 homicides were recorded\u00a0\u2013 a figure surpassing that\u00a0of\u00a0the previous administration. However, a report from the Mexican Peace Index (MPI), prepared by the\u00a0Institute for Economy and Peace\u00a0(IEP), has\u00a0offered\u00a0some reason for optimism, reporting improvements in\u00a0five key indicators: homicides, crimes with violence, fear of violence, crimes committed with firearms, and crimes of violence.\u00a0Homicides and crimes committed with\u00a0firearms peaked\u00a0in 2019, according to the May 2024 report,\u00a0and have since improved. Meanwhile, pressure is growing on Mexico\u2019s southern and northern borders. In 2023, the National Migration Institute (INM) recorded a\u00a077% increase in migrant arrivals compared to 2022. And as it grapples with the surge of migrants and asylum seekers entering and crossing its own territory, Mexico will also have to contend with external policies on migration. As an example, Myriam Guadalupe Castro Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, an academic at the National School of Social Work of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), points to a recent state law in Texas that has already caused waves in Mexico. In December, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u00a0signed a bill\u00a0that would allow state officials to detain and deport people suspected of having entered the United States illegally. The law is currently blocked in a US federal court, but the L\u00f3pez Obrador government has warned that it will not receive people deported by Texas and that it will only discuss immigration issues with Washington. Both Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez have stated their support for this stance.

{"id": "2024_05_30_asia_japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk", "text": "Wearing a toy whale hat, whale tie and a whale motif shirt, Hideki Tokoro spends much of his days thinking about the world\u2019s largest mammals. But he doesn\u2019t want to protect them. He wants to hunt them. To do that his company Kyodo Senpaku has built and launched a brand-new whaling $48 million \u201cmothership\u201d \u2013 the Kangei Maru. \u201cWe are proud of catching whales and are very proud of this ship which will allow us to begin offshore mothership-style whaling this year,\u201d Tokoro told reporters as he escorted them around the 370-foot, 9,300-ton vessel that set sail last Saturday for an eight-month tour of the country\u2019s northern waters. The new ship replaces the Nisshin Maru, the infamous whaling factory vessel dubbed by activists as a \u201cfloating slaughterhouse\u201d that was decommissioned in 2020 after more than 30 years of service, during which it frequently clashed with anti-whaling activists. The Kangei Maru is bigger and faster than its predecessor, the company says, and is equipped with state-of-the-art drones able to travel a reported 100 kilometers (62 miles) to allow crews of smaller boats to quickly locate and kill whales. But activists say the ship\u2019s high-powered features, including a cruising range of 13,000 kilometers (more than 8,000 miles) and its ability to sail for up to 60 days, suggests that Japan is setting its sights on whales far beyond its northern waters. \u201cJapan has never given up on its whaling ambitions,\u201d veteran anti-whaling activist Paul Watson told CNN. \u201cThe only purpose of a vessel like that is so it can travel long distances to the Southern Ocean to hunt whales, (and) what the whalers are doing right now is really just a test run. They are testing out the new ship in their waters.\u201d \u2018We need to cull whales\u2019 The Kangei Maru boasts a slipway large enough to haul 85-foot whales from the sea that leads to an indoor flensing deck the size\u00a0of two basketball courts. There, workers will strip away the blubber before cutting up the whale flesh on enormous cutting boards, before vacuum-packing and storing the meat in 40 industrial freezers, ready for sale. \u201cWhales are at the top of the food chain. They compete with humans by eating marine creatures that should be feeding other fish,\u201d Tokoro said on the tour. \u201cWe need to cull whales to keep the balance of the ecosystem \u2013 it\u2019s our job and mission to protect oceans for the future.\u201d He also told CNN that most of the ship\u2019s catch would be killed \u201calmost instantly\u201d by cannons at sea. \u201cWe aim for perfection, but some of them may suffer. In such cases, we will use a rifle to finish the job.\u201d Besides objecting to the slaughter one of the ocean\u2019s most majestic creatures, marine conservation groups and scientists have highlighted the important role which whales play in helping to tackle the climate crisis through sequestering and storing planet-heating carbon emissions. \u201cWhales are not just consumers in ocean eco-systems \u2013 they recycle a ton of nutrients into the environment which helps stimulate plant-life growth,\u201d\u00a0said marine ecologist Ari Friedlaender, also rejecting pro-whaling arguments that commercial hunts could be \u201csustainable.\u201d \u201cHumans have a very long history of killing whales and have not done a good job of being able to sustainably harvest animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to sustainably harvest a wild animal like that.\u201d Why is Japan so determined to keep whaling? Commercial whaling was banned in 1986 under a moratorium by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) after whale populations were almost driven to extinction by humans. Japan is one of three countries \u2013 along with Norway and Iceland \u2013 that continues to hunt whales, and officials argue that the industry is an important part of its culture and history \u2013 and also provides food security. Iceland, which has fiercely defended commercial whaling, said it would end whaling in 2024, citing falling demand for whale meat as well as \u201chigh operation costs and little proof of any economic advantage.\u201d Commercial whaling continues in Norway, which experts say has quietly become the world\u2019s leading whaling nation \u2013 killing more whales than Japan and Iceland combined. For decades, Japan has justified whaling under the guise of \u201cscientific research.\u201d In 2018, it tried one last time to persuade the IWC to allow it to resume commercial whaling \u2013 and failed. So, it withdrew from the body and resumed commercial whaling months later, in defiance of international criticism. \u201cJapan is no longer party to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and can argue that it is no longer bound by provisions and constraints,\u201d Donald Rothwell, an international law professor at the Australian National University (ANU), told CNN. \u201cWithin its waters, it\u00a0has the absolute authority to control the management of living resources \u2013 and that includes whales.\u201d Under Japanese law, three species of whale are permitted to be hunted in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones \u2013 endangered sei whales and threatened minke whales and Bryde\u2019s whales, with endangered fin whales set to be added to kill lists. \u201cWhales are important food resources and should be sustainably utilized based on scientific evidence,\u201d said government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi this month, as he announced a proposal to hunt fin whales, the second-largest species of whales after blue whales. The World Cetacean Alliance (WCA) marine conservation group said that whale watching in Japan was \u201ca far more successful industry\u201d than harvesting whale meat. \u201cCommercial whaling in the 21st century is unjustifiable,\u201d it said. \u00a0\u201cThe whaling industry in Japan recognizes that it is a challenge to increase whale meat consumption and there is currently no market,\u201d WCA said. \u201cSo why keep slaughtering these wonderful and intelligent animals?\u201d Tokoro ruled out whale watching. \u201cWe will not switch to whale watching but eating whale meat while watching whales might be quite a nice touch,\u201d he told CNN. Demand for whale meat in Japan Over the years, Kyodo Senpaku has launched aggressive public relation campaigns to promote whale meat and win over new generations of young diners. Tokoro says he eats whale meat every day. \u201cWhale meat is not only delicious, it\u2019s good for you,\u201d Tokoro told reporters during the tour of his ship, as he talked\u00a0up the purported \u201chealth benefits\u201d of eating whale, claiming that the meat could cure hair loss and cancer. \u201cI can definitely say whale meat and rice is a really good (combination) for Japanese people. There is no doubt about that, much better than beef and bun.\u201d Last year Tokoro, again wearing his whale hat, launched controversial whale meat vending machines, offering whale sashimi, whale steak and whale bacon. The company has also sponsored influencers from countries such as Russia, Thailand and South Korea \u2013 hosting them at a local izakaya in Osaka, where they sampled dishes like whale sashimi and skewers and encouraging them to take the message back to their followers that whale meat was delicious and acceptable. Japan may have a long and storied history of whaling dating back to the Edo period in the 1600s, but experts say whale meat consumption only really peaked after World War II \u2013 when food sources, especially protein, were scarce. Today, whale meat is now\u00a0considered more of a \u201cluxury\u201d dish, said Nobuhiro Kishigami, a professor at the National Museum of Ethnology, one of the country\u2019s largest research institutes. \u201cThe fact is that there is little interest in whaling and whale meat among Japanese people as a whole,\u201d Kishigami told CNN. \u201cMost young people, especially the majority that live in cities, do not know or care much about whaling and its history and remain indifferent.\u201d The same goes for dolphin meat, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just a sign of the times. But if we were asked to stop eating blue fin tuna, there would be a huge uproar. We would react very badly to that.\u201d Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry estimates that between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of whale meat are consumed annually in the country, compared to average annual totals of more than 230,000 tons during the 1960s. \u201cThere is still certainly a market (for whale meat in Japan) but market size and production volume have shrunk dramatically,\u201d economics professor Mitsuhiro Kishimoto from the Shimonoseki City University told CNN, noting that several major whaling companies had since withdrawn from the trade. \u201cThe demand for whale blubber disappeared after the discovery of oil and petroleum products, so many countries stopped whaling and with international regulations, the number of caught whales decreased and as a result, whale meat production decreased while beef, pork and chicken became more popular,\u201d he said. Scientists have also expressed\u00a0concern about the risks of consuming whale meat, with studies pointing to high levels of mercury found in whale and dolphin meat, which could prove dangerous to consumers \u2013 especially pregnant women and young children. Could Japanese whalers return to the Southern Ocean? Located in deep waters surrounding the entire continent of Antarctica, the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary hosts dozens of whale species including humpbacks, blue whales and fin whales. It was established by the IWC in 1994 to protect whale species after centuries of hunting, but until 2019 Japan took regular trips to the region to hunt for self-stated \u201cscientific research\u201d purposes. Japanese whalers killed 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean in 2018/2019, according to the IWC, before abandoning the region after it left the international body. Takaaki Sakamoto, director of the Whaling Affairs Office in Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency, told CNN that Japan sent ships to the Antarctic last year to collect numbers and skin surface samples, but those expeditions did not involve killing whales. He said they planned to return this year to do the same. Tokoro told CNN that the Kangei Maru is not planning on killing whales beyond Japanese waters because it doesn\u2019t make economic sense. \u201cCommercial whaling is not profitable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take 50 days to get to the Antarctic and back and we are not confident we can make a profit by paying the wages of employees and fuel for 50 days. However, I will go only when the government orders me to go \u2026 Until then, I will not go commercial whaling at all.\u201d But\u00a0activists aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cGiven the ship\u2019s long-range capabilities and drones, and recent announcements from Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry that it is keen to start hunting fin whales, we believe there is a high likelihood that Japanese whalers will return to the Southern Ocean,\u201d said James Anderson, activist and founder of the Whale Defense Agency (WDA). \u201cThe Southern Ocean is a critical habitat for many whale species that provides a safe haven for breeding and feeding \u2026 protecting it is more important than ever due to the increasing threats posed by climate change and illegal whaling.\u201d Rothwell, from ANU, said that if Japan looks to kill whales beyond its territorial waters, it can expect an international response. \u201cIt would immediately trigger global interest and action about the conservation and protection of whales, especially in waters sanctioned by the IWC as a whale sanctuary,\u201d Rothwell said. Watson, the veteran anti-whaling activist, told CNN he\u2019s prepared to mount a physical response \u2013 with a former Japanese fisheries patrol vessel he\u2019s acquired in anticipation of Japanese whalers returning to the Antarctic by the end of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary for a reason \u2013 you don\u2019t kill whales there,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe want to be able to track them down and intercept them like we\u2019ve done before \u2013 and we are more than prepared to do it again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/asia/japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_03_china_tiananmen-square-tank-man-photo-intl-hnk", "text": "The shot is iconic: an unidentified man in a white shirt, hands full of bags, facing off against a column of tanks on Beijing\u2019s Avenue of Eternal Peace, after the Chinese Communist Party ordered a bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. The photo and footage of the so-called \u201ctank man\u201d became the defining image of the Tiananmen Square crackdown whose 35th anniversary passed on Tuesday. On the night of June 3, 1989, after nearly two months of demonstrations by students and workers demanding faster political reform and an end to corruption, convoys of armed troops entered central Beijing to clear the square. It was a bloodbath; witnesses described tanks driving over unarmed protesters, and soldiers firing indiscriminately into the crowd. To this day the massacre remains one of the most sensitive political taboos in mainland China, with all mention of it strictly censored. Commemoration can lead to imprisonment. Chinese authorities have not released an official death toll, but estimates range from several hundred to thousands. Still, each June 4 since, diaspora communities and surviving protesters in exile around the world have commemorated the event\u00a0\u2013 often resharing the historic photo by Jeff Widener, then a photographer for the Associated Press (AP), as well as footage shot by CNN\u2019s crews. The journey of the photograph, too, captured the tension and fear of the time \u2013 involving smuggling equipment and film past authorities and across borders. By that point, the Chinese government was trying desperately to control the message going out to the world \u2013 and was trying to stop all American news outlets, including CNN, from broadcasting live from Beijing. These interviews, excerpted from \u201cAssignment China: An Oral History of American Journalists in the People\u2019s Republic\u201d by Mike Chinoy, CNN\u2019s Beijing bureau chief during the crackdown, offer the behind-the-scenes story of perhaps the most famous moment in the crisis. Chinoy was there, broadcasting live from a balcony overlooking the scene, and spoke to witnesses during and after the historic event. Sneaking in and smuggling equipment It was Monday, June 5, 1989, and Beijing was reeling from the crackdown the day before. Liu Heung-shing, the photo editor for the AP in Beijing, asked Widener to help get photos of Chinese troops from the Beijing Hotel \u2013 which had the best vantage point of the square, now under military control. Widener had flown in from the news agency\u2019s Bangkok office a week before to help with coverage, and was hurt when the crackdown began, he told CNN previously \u2013 after having been hit in the head by a rock, and laid low with the flu. He set off, with his camera equipment hidden in his jacket \u2013 a long 400-millimeter lens in one pocket, a doubler in another, film in his underwear and the camera body in his back pocket. \u201cI\u2019m biking towards the Beijing Hotel and there\u2019s just debris and charred buses on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden, there\u2019s four tanks coming, manned by soldiers with heavy machine guns. I\u2019m on my bicycle thinking I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this.\u201d \u201cI hear rumors that other journalists had had their film and cameras confiscated. I had to figure out a way to get into the hotel,\u201d he added. \u201cI look inside the darkened lobby, and there\u2019s this Western college kid. I walked up to him and whispered, \u2018I\u2019m from Associated Press, can you let me up to your room?\u2019 He picked up on it right away and said, \u2018Sure.\u2019\u201d That young man was Kirk Martsen \u2013 an American exchange student who snuck Widener into his sixth-floor hotel room. From there, Widener began photographing the tanks rolling by on the roads below \u2013 sometimes hearing the ring of a bell that signified a cart passing by with a body, or an injured person being taken to the hospital, he said. Capturing the shot Other journalists were at the hotel, too \u2013 including Jonathan Schaer, CNN\u2019s US-based cameraman who flew into Beijing to support his exhausted colleagues. He\u2019d set up a camera on the balcony of CNN\u2019s room at the hotel, where the network had been broadcasting live reports of the crackdown throughout the weekend. \u201cAnother cameraman said, \u2018Hey, look at the guy in front of the tanks!\u2019 I just zoomed in and started videotaping,\u201d Schaer recalled. \u201cWhen the column stopped and the man blocked the tanks, they were trying to scare him off by shooting over his head. Well, shooting over his head was basically where our position was. The bullets were so close you could hear them whizzing by.\u201d Back in Martsen\u2019s room, Widener was at the window, preparing to photograph the column of tanks coming down the road, when \u201cthis guy with shopping bags walks out in front and starts waving the bags,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for him to get shot, holding the focus on him, waiting and waiting.\u201d The tank stopped and tried to go around the man. The man moved with the tank, blocking its path once again. At one point during the standoff, the man climbed aboard the lead tank and appeared to speak to whoever was inside. But Widener had a problem \u2013 the scene was too far away for his 400-mm lens. His doubler, which would allow him to zoom in twice as much, lay on the bed, leaving him a choice: Should he go grab the doubler, and risk losing the shot in those precious seconds? He took the chance, got the doubler on the camera, took \u201cone, two, three shots. Then it was over,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people came, grabbed this guy, and ran off. I remember sitting down on this little sofa next to the window and the student (Martsen) said, \u2018Did you get it? Did you get it?\u2019 Something in the back of my mind said maybe I got it, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Liu remembers getting the call from Widener, and immediately firing off instructions: roll up the film, go down to the lobby, and ask one of the many foreign students there to bring it to the AP office. The pictures were soon transmitted over telephone lines to the rest of the world. Widener did, sending the student bicycling away with the film hidden in his underwear. Forty-five minutes later, \u201can American guy with a ponytail and a backpack showed up with an AP envelope,\u201d said Liu. They quickly developed the film, \u201cand I looked at that frame \u2013 and that\u2019s the frame. It went out.\u201d Schaer, the CNN photojournalist, didn\u2019t initially realize what they had captured on tape. This was in the early days of email, which didn\u2019t yet handle large video \u2013 so CNN was using a \u201cgizmo that could send video \u2026 a prototype that Sony had given us to try out,\u201d which took an hour to scan one frame of video and send it over a phone line, he said. So they sent five frames, made copies of the tape and sent it to the airport in Beijing \u2013 where they enlisted a tourist to take the tape to Hong Kong, which at the time was still a British colony and not subject to Chinese rule. Several media outlets took a photo of \u201cTank Man,\u201d but Widener\u2019s shot was the most used. It appeared on the front pages of newspapers all around the world, and it was nominated that year for a Pulitzer Prize. Widener said he didn\u2019t know the image had made such an impact until the next morning, when he arrived at the AP office to find messages from viewers and journalists all over the world. To this day, we don\u2019t know who the man is and what happened to him. But he remains a powerful symbol of the individual standing up to the power of the state. \u201cI suppose for a lot of people it\u2019s something personal, because this guy represents everything in our lives that we\u2019re battling, because we\u2019re all battling something,\u201d Widener said. \u201cHe\u2019s really become a symbol for a lot of people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/china/tiananmen-square-tank-man-photo-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_20_style_park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli", "text": "Everyone knows the familiar shapes that make up New York\u2019s skyline. There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_02_india_india-heatwave-poll-worker-deaths-intl-hnk", "text": "Extreme heat in India has killed at least 77 people over the past 10 days, including dozens of poll workers, as voting wrapped up in the world\u2019s largest general election. India has endured a scorching summer \u2014 with a part of the capital of Delhi recording the country\u2019s highest-ever temperature of 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit) on Tuesday last week \u2014 as voters have hit the polls over a six-week election. At least 33 poll workers died in a single day in India\u2019s most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, the state\u2019s chief election officer, Navdeep Rinwa, told reporters Sunday. Their families will receive $18,000 each in compensation, he said. Despite being fitted out with water dispensers, mist machines and shaded areas, polling stations in Delhi were unusually quiet on Saturday, the penultimate day of voting. For some, casting a ballot was not worth the risk. Others urged eligible voters to try and tolerate the heat. Standing on the sweltering streets, a Delhi resident called Haseem told CNN that voting is \u201ca fundamental right and the foremost duty for every citizen of any republic or any democracy. We should be coming out, whatever the weather.\u201d A woman selling lemonade on the streets of Delhi told the AFP French news agency: \u201cThe heat is so harsh here, that when the wind comes, it feels like someone is slapping your face.\u201d With the peak of summer still weeks away, temperatures are expected to rise further. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we will do,\u201d she said. Home to more than 1.4 billion people, about 969 million Indians were eligible to cast their vote in the election \u2014 more than the populations of North America and the European Union combined. Around 642 million showed up, the most ever to participate, Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar told a press conference on Monday. Voters and election workers have endured an extended period of extreme heat since polls opened on April 19, in a mammoth democratic exercise that ended Sunday. Polls suggest Prime Minister Narenda Modi will secure a rare third consecutive term in office, with results expected Tuesday. To carry out such a huge election, India relies on a network of some 15 million polling officials and security staff, with some of these election workers traveling via road, boat, camel, train and helicopter to reach citizens across the vast nation. But the event has been marred by the deaths of dozens of poll workers and voters. Some 20 people were reported dead due to \u201csun stroke\u201d between May 31 and June 2 in the eastern state of Odisha, according to the state\u2019s disaster management agency. \u201cIn Odisha we have been experiencing severe temperatures the last few days, the heat here isn\u2019t as high as northern India but here high humidity is also a factor,\u201d Satyabrata Sahu, Odisha\u2019s special relief commissioner told CNN Monday. Sahu said rainfall over the weekend could reduce the heat in the coming days. Another 24 people died across the capital territory of Delhi, the eastern Indian states of Bihar and Jharkhand and the western Indian state of Rajasthan since May 24, local officials said. Election duty is compulsory in India for public sector employees, who are assigned by the election commission before polling begins. \u201cHeat wave conditions over Northwest, Central & East India are likely to continue with reduced intensity during next 3 days,\u201d the Indian Meteorological Department said on Sunday. India is among the countries expected to be worst affected by the climate crisis, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), threatening its development while risking reversing its progress on poverty alleviation, health and economic growth. The country often experiences heat waves during the summer months of May and June, but in recent years they have arrived earlier and become more prolonged. Experts say the climate crisis is only going to cause more frequent and longer heat waves in the future, testing India\u2019s ability to adapt.

Allen was 52. The seven-time All-Pro died suddenly while in Mexico vacationing with his family, according to the Cowboys, where Allen played 12 of his 14 NFL seasons. \u201cThe National Football League is filled with gifted athletes, but only a rare few have combined the size, brute strength, speed and agility of Larry Allen,\u201d Pro Football Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said Monday. \u201cWhat he could do as an offensive lineman often defied logic and comprehension.\u201d The Cowboys drafted Allen as the 46th player overall in the 1994 NFL draft. At the end of his career, he played two seasons with the San Francisco 49ers (2006-07). In 2019, he was selected to the NFL\u2019s 100 greatest players team to celebrate the first 100 years of the league. \u201cMy goal was simple, to earn a seven-word letter called respect.\u00a0The respect of my teammates, opponents, and the NFL.\u00a0Today, my mission is complete,\u201d he said at his 2013 Hall of Fame Induction.\u00a0\u201cI also played hard, whistle to whistle, to make my opponents submit.\u00a0And today, I\u2019m submitting to you.\u201d According to the Cowboys, Allen was the strongest player to play in the NFL, having bench pressed 700 pounds and squatted 900 pounds. His rise to NFL stardom was remarkable as he came from small schools, starting his college career at Butte Junior College in Oroville, California, before transferring to Division II school Sonoma State, near San Francisco. Allen played in 203 career games and was the starting right guard for Dallas when the Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-17 in Super Bowl XXX. Allen\u2019s name adorns the Cowboys\u2019 Ring of Honor. His competitive nature is captured on his Hall of Fame profile page, stating, \u201cMy objective is to make the other guy quit. \u201cYou can tell when it\u2019s starting to happen because he stops rushing as hard and when you run-block he doesn\u2019t resist as much. \u2026 I like when they have to keep rotating three or four people into the game to try to find someone to get the job done.\u201d The NFL posted condolences on X Monday, stating, \u201cThe NFL family is deeply saddened by the passing of Hall of Famer, Super Bowl Champion and Cowboys legend, Larry Allen. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones.\u201d Allen is survived by his wife, Janelle, and his daughters Jayla and Loriana and son, Larry III, the Cowboys said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/03/sport/larry-allen-dallas-cowboys-death-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/04/2024", "section": "world"}}

Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s move from Paris Saint-Germain comes two days after Real won a record-extending 15th European Cup with victory over Borussia Dortmund, adding further star quality to the team\u2019s attack. The 25-year-old, who became PSG\u2019s record scorer during the seven years he spent at the French club, will link up with the likes of Vin\u00edcius Jr. and Jude Bellingham \u2013 two of the world\u2019s best players \u2013 in the Spanish capital to form a potential soccer dynasty. Mbapp\u00e9 wrote on social media shortly after the announcement was made that the move was \u201ca dream come true.\u201d \u201cSo happy and proud to join the club of my dream @Real Madrid,\u201d he said alongside a photo of himself when he was younger in a Madrid jacket. \u201cNobody can understand how excited I am right now.
