They were known as pious and prominent members of the community. While people knew they had connections to Hamas, neighbors say no one could have guessed how deep those links truly went. When Israeli forces stormed the Aljamals\u2019 building on June 8 they found Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv, hostages who had been captured from the Nova music festival on October 7, cowering in a darkened room. The experience of the three men \u2013 alongside that of Noa Argamani who was held in another house nearby, belonging to the Abu Nar family \u2013 echoes testimony from previously released hostages. They describe being confined among the civilian population, rather than in Hamas\u2019 vast tunnel network under Gaza. In the aftermath of last month\u2019s rescue, neighbors in Nuseirat, a refugee camp in central Gaza, told CNN they were shocked to learn that Ahmed Aljamal, a physician, and his family had kept hostages in their midst. \u201cHad we known, had he told us, we would have taken safety precautions, hide or move to somewhere else,\u201d one neighbor, Abu Muhammad El Tahrawi, said. Dr. Aljamal, 74, was a general practitioner and also led the call to prayer at the local mosque, waking early every day to get there before dawn. \u201cHe was a pious man,\u201d neighbor Abdelrahman El Tahrawi said. \u201cHe leads the prayer, then he goes back to his home. He didn\u2019t mix with people, didn\u2019t complain about other people, and no one complained about him. He was a man who minded his own business.\u201d Dr. Aljamal\u2019s son Abdallah, 36, was a freelance journalist who most recently wrote for the US-based Palestine Chronicle, for which he filed regular dispatches on the war in Gaza. Neighbors told CNN it was no secret that the family had links to Hamas. \u201cWe were worried about the Aljamal house. They are with Hamas,\u201d said a neighbor and family acquaintance. Abdallah had served as a spokesman for Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Labor as recently as 2022, a position entrusted only to Hamas members, according to political analysts. He also showed his support for the group on social media. On Facebook, he posted pictures of his young son dressed in the fatigues of Hamas\u2019 armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, and on October 7 openly praised the group\u2019s attack on Israel. In a 2022 video post, Abdallah commended the Hamas operation to kidnap Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was held in Gaza between 2006 and 2011, and proclaimed: \u201cBrothers, all of us are prepared to die for the resistance.\u201d Public support for Hamas as a political movement in Gaza has ranged from 34 to 42% over the past seven months, according to polls by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research.\u00a0Polling in Gaza faces multiple challenges, including population displacement, people\u2019s reluctance to criticize Hamas publicly and the risks to personal safety in war time. The true level of support for Hamas may be lower, according to Dr. Mkhaimar Abusada, associate professor of Political Science at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, who is now based in the Egyptian capital of Cairo. A higher proportion of Gazans are more broadly supportive of armed resistance, the polling suggests, despite more than nine months of war that has obliterated the strip. Some people who were not affiliated with Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups took part in the October 7 incursion into southern Israel, streaming through the border fence after it was breached by fighters \u2013 some stealing from Israeli communities and others taking hostages back into Gaza. At least 1,200 people were killed and\u00a0some 250 people in total were taken from Israel into the strip, according to Israeli authorities. A senior Hamas official last month told CNN the group does not know how many hostages are still alive, suggesting it may not have full oversight of their whereabouts. Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz told an Israeli TV channel that Israel knows to a \u201cvery close number\u201d how many hostages remain alive. Despite the level of support in Gaza for Hamas, which has governed the territory since 2007, far fewer people would be accepted into the trusted inner circles of the Islamist movement. Hostages being held by civilians under the direction of Hamas is unlikely unless they have very strong ties to and are well trusted by the group, according to Abusada. \u201cHamas only trusts Hamas when it comes to those very sensitive issues such as Israeli hostages,\u201d he said. There may be other reasons why Hamas chose to house hostages in civilian homes, however. Hussein Ibish, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, said that approach fits Hamas\u2019 strategy to get Israel \u201cbogged down in the urban centers of Gaza and push them into a counterinsurgency that cannot end, which is the perpetual war Hamas says it wants.\u201d \u2018Creative punishment\u2019 The three hostages who were held in the Aljamal family building were kept there for around six months, according to Andrey Kozlov, who spoke last week to CNN. Kozlov described physical and psychological abuse he received at the hands of his guards. One in particular, he said, \u201cwas a big fan of creative punishment\u201d who on one occasion forced him to spend two days on a mattress without moving or talking as a penalty for standing near an open window, and on another occasion covered him with blankets in the summer heat for washing his hands with drinking water. \u201cI was trying to breathe through the space between the mattress and blankets,\u201d he said. During that time the hostages could hear the family, including children, going about their daily lives on the floor below, according to Aviram Meir, the uncle of Almog Meir Jan. In the weeks before Israel\u2019s hostage raid, the Aljamal family had been continuing as usual, outwardly at least, and Abdallah\u2019s most recent article for the Palestine Chronicle was published just the day before. Then, on the morning of June 8, Israeli forces stormed Nuseirat. Zainab Aljamal, Abdallah\u2019s sister, who was in the family house at the time of the raid, wrote a Facebook post that day describing what happened. The Israeli soldiers entered and shot Abdallah\u2019s wife Fatima first, before killing Ahmed and Abdallah, she wrote. Zainab hid with Abdallah\u2019s children under a bed, according to the now-deleted Facebook post which was shared with CNN by independent open-source researcher Thomas Bordeaux. \ufeffZainab said in the post that the family had been waiting for the moment they would be killed by Israeli forces. \u201cSince the start of the war, we have been waiting for this moment. We did not know how it would come and in what horrific way it would happen, but we were aware that it would inevitably come.\u201d As the three hostages were rescued from the Aljamal house, around 200 meters (650 feet) away Israeli forces carried out a simultaneous raid on a second apartment block \u2013 which was home to the Abu Nar family, according to Israeli officials \u2013 to retrieve Argamani. Argamani had become one of the most recognized Israeli hostages when widely circulated footage showed her being hoisted onto the back of a motorcycle and driven away from the Nova music festival on October 7 as her partner was seized and made to walk with his hands behind his back. Less is known about Argamani\u2019s captors. Her family members told Israeli media she had been held by a relatively well-off family who made Argamani wash dishes for the household, reportedly telling her she was lucky to be held by them as other hostages were experiencing much worse. In a video released by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that shows Argamani\u2019s rescue, troops are seen inside an apartment on the upper floor of a building, passing a small kitchen. The Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office told CNN she was held by the Abu Nar family but did not provide further details. According to unofficial lists of those killed circulated on Arabic-language media and social media, Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar died alongside his wife and child in Israel\u2019s\u00a0 Nuseirat operation last month. Three relatives of Abu Nar also posted on social media announcing he had been killed by Israeli forces that day. CNN cannot independently confirm whether Abu Nar was involved in holding Argamani and his relatives have not responded to requests for comment. \u2018A normal man\u2019 Neighbors of the Abu Nar house in Nuseirat told CNN they saw Israeli special forces enter and leave the building without much of a fight. Bilal Mazhar, a 16-year-old student, said his window was opposite the window of the apartment in which Argamani was being held, just half a meter away, but he never saw any sign of her presence until Israeli forces brought her out. \u201cThey pulled her out normally and no one intervened, and there was no shooting at them,\u201d Mazhar said. Mohamed Ahmad Abu Nar seemed to share very little online about his life, and local people were reluctant to share many details about the Abu Nar family, but they did express surprise and concern that a hostage had been held in their midst. \u201cHe had young children at home,\u201d said Khalil Al-Kahlot, a civil servant in Gaza. \u201cNo one would expect him to hold a hostage like this, in homes and among people.\u201d Al-Kahlot, who told CNN he\u2019d been in Nuseirat for the past four months, said Mohamed Ahmed was \u201cordinary\u201d and \u201ca normal man,\u201d adding that he had never suspected he was affiliated with Hamas. \u201cThey are people in Hamas, but we did not know that,\u201d said another neighbor of the Abu Nar family. \u201cIf we had known there was something there, no one would have stayed in the area.\u201d After Israeli forces evacuated the hostages, airstrikes hit both of the buildings they were rescued from and now only rubble remains at each site. More than 270 Palestinians were killed in Nuseirat on June 8, according to Gaza health ministry officials, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between militants and civilians, and hundreds more were injured. Israel puts the number of deaths at under 100. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures. Many locals questioned why so many Palestinians had to die for the Israeli forces to rescue just four hostages. Al-Kahlot said: \u201cPeople died because they were freeing her, and no one was looking at us.\u201d CNN is not identifying some interviewees for their own security.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/gaza-neighborhood-israeli-hostages-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_19_sport_shane-lowry-cameraman-open-championship-spt-intl", "text": "Rivals and cameramen, make way \u2013 Shane Lowry is coming through at the Open Championship. The Irishman lifted the red mist that momentarily descended upon him at Royal Troon in Scotland to wrestle control of the major, as his second round two-under 69 on Friday sent him into the weekend with a two shot lead. After opening with a bogey-free 66 on Thursday, 2019 champion Lowry had been motoring along smoothly at the summit before his advantage was derailed by a disastrous 30-minute saga on the notorious par-four 11th \u201cRailway\u201d hole. Having narrowly survived sending his tee shot onto the train tracks that run alongside the 488-yard hole, the world No. 33 went from frying pan to fire as his subsequent effort from the rough went careening left into the thick gorse across the other side of the fairway. A visibly disgruntled Lowry then gesticulated and pointed animatedly at a nearby cameraman, later admitting that he had \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 \u201clost his train of thought\u201d after becoming \u201ca little distracted\u201d while stood over his shot. \u201cThere was a cameraman there, and he was walking up. I asked him to stop or move back, and he just kind of stayed there,\u201d Lowry told reporters on his return to the clubhouse. \u201cAs it was over, he put his camera up. I kind of saw it out of the corner of my eye, and I should stood off it, (it was) my own fault.\u201d The drama continued when Lowry struck a \u201cgreat\u201d provisional shot \u2013 taken when a ball is presumed lost outside a penalty area or out of bounds \u2013 to within 12 feet of the hole, only for one eagle-eyed fan to subsequently find his original ball and void his provisional effort in the process. After a lengthy discussion with a rules official regarding where to take a drop from, the 37-year-old golfer eventually left with a double bogey \u2013 enough to erase his two-shot cushion, but \u201cnot a disaster\u201d, he later reflected. If Lowry had lost his cool, he quickly found it in abundance. After rebounding with four steady pars, the Irishman signed off with his second birdie in three holes to restore the gap to English duo Justin Rose and Daniel Brown heading into the weekend. As he seeks to turn back the clock to his dominant triumph at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland five years ago, Lowry has no intention of throttling the passion that helped him clinch his sole major to date. \u201cI can get a bit down on myself and a bit hot headed at times, but I really feel like that\u2019s why I\u2019ve had the career I\u2019ve had,\u201d Lowry, who has nine combined wins on the PGA Tour and European Tour, said. \u201cIf I go out there and try to be somebody I\u2019m not, you\u2019re just not going to be successful \u2026 [But] If I go out there and be myself, I feel like I can do very well. So allowing myself to do that, without getting in your own way.\u201d McIlroy among big stars to crash out It was an entirely contrasting day for Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy, as the world No. 2 capitulated to become the highest profile casualty of a host of big names that failed to make the cut. The 35-year-old star had been out to exorcise the demons of his latest heartbreaking major near-miss at the US Open last month but found only more woe at Royal Troon, finishing 11-over par overall to fall well short of the top-70 players and ties that progressed to the weekend. Needing a fast start after a grueling first round 78, McIlroy\u2019s hopes of making the cut were effectively extinguished by the end of the sixth hole after a nightmarish stretch. Having bogeyed the third, McIlroy triple bogeyed the following par-five hole before back-to-back bogeys. A solid back nine saw him go two-under par down the stretch but the damage was done, his closing 75 ensuring his wait for a fifth major will continue into an 11th year. \u201cOnce I made the eight on the 4th hole, that was it. 22 holes into the event and I\u2019m thinking about where I\u2019m going to go on vacation next week,\u201d McIlroy admitted to reporters. \u201cIt was a pretty meaningless 14 holes after that, but at least I played okay and at least feel like, when the wind dropped, my game felt a little more comfortable and I hit some good shots.\u201d Tiger Woods will also be absent from the weekend, resigning him to a third consecutive missed major cut for just the second time in his career. The 48-year-old shot 79 and 77 to finish on 14-over par, the joint-highest 36-hole score he has ever recorded at a major, but insisted he still enjoyed the challenge. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved playing major championships. I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the majors,\u201d Woods, who added he will \u201cdefinitely\u201d compete at next year\u2019s Open at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland, told reporters Friday. \u201cObviously it tests you mentally, physically, emotionally, and I just wasn\u2019t as sharp as I needed to be. I was hoping that I would find it somehow, just never did. Consequently, my results and scores were pretty high.\u201d Other big names that failed to survive the cut included last month\u2019s US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau, and last year\u2019s US Open champion Wyndham Clark. With McIlroy, world No. 4 Ludvig Aberg and world No. 7 Viktor Hovland also missing out, only half of the world\u2019s top-10 ranked players \u2013 Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, Collin Morikawa, Patrick Cantlay and Jon Rahm \u2013 will tee up Saturday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/sport/shane-lowry-cameraman-open-championship-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_americas_venezuela-election-maduro-bloodbath-speech-intl-latam", "text": "The United States has raised concerns about the recent arrests of Venezuelan democratic opposition figures ahead of the country\u2019s elections this month, as authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro told his supporters he must win at the polls to avoid a possible \u201cbloodbath.\u201d \u201cIf they do not want Venezuela to fall into a bloodbath, into a fratricidal civil war,\u201d the ruling party must win the presidential elections on July 28, Maduro told a campaign event in Caracas on Tuesday. Only a win for his party would ensure \u201cpeace\u201d in the country, Maduro said, adding that he expects \u201cirreversible results\u201d in his favor. CNN has reached out to Maduro\u2019s office for further comment on his statements. Maduro\u2019s remarks come as his government attempts to cling on to power for another six years while facing a credible challenge from opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia. Many experts believe the opposition has a real chance of pushing Maduro out of office. In the run up to the vote, Venezuela has \u201cunjustly detained\u201d democratic opposition figures, civil society members and journalists, according to the US State Department, which called for their release in a statement Wednesday. Strongman Maduro has been in power in for more than a decade, having assumed the presidency following the death of predecessor Hugo Chavez in 2013, during which time his government has often been accused of rigging votes and silencing the opposition. The 2018 election that returned Maduro to office was largely boycotted by the opposition. The poll was described as illegitimate by an alliance of 14 Latin American nations, Canada and the United States and as a \u201cfarce\u201d by the Organization of American States. There were hopes the 2024 election might be different after Maduro promised Washington last year in a historic agreement that he would hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief. However, more recently the opposition has accused him of reneging on that pledge. Two opposition candidates \u2013 Maria Corina Machado and Corina Yoris \u2013 have been barred from running while a report this week by a human rights group suggested there had been a spate of \u201carbitrary detentions\u201d since the beginning of the campaign season on July 4. Human rights NGO Laboratorio de Paz reported Monday there had been 71 arbitrary detentions in the first 10 days of campaigning, the majority of them involving people who had provided some type of service to the campaign command of the opposition candidate Gonz\u00e1lez, of the Democratic Unitary Platform. Two days after Laboratorio\u2019s report came out, the barred opposition leader Machado said in a post on X that her security chief had also been arrested. Machado said her security chief Milciades \u00c1vila was \u201ckidnapped\u201d on Wednesday \u201cby the Maduro regime and accused of gender violence against some women.\u201d The opposition leader said the women who accuse \u00c1vila of gender violence tried to \u201cattack\u201d her and Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia in a restaurant last Saturday. \u201cThere are dozens of witnesses and videos that demonstrate that this was a planned provocation to leave us without protection 11 days before July 28,\u201d Machado wrote. CNN has reached out to Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office for comment on \u00c1vila\u2019s arrest and to determine whether he has legal representation. The US was concerned about \u00c1vila\u2019s arrest and called for his immediate release, a State Department spokesperson said Wednesday. The US also urged Venezuela to release all those who were \u201cunjustly detained\u201d during the presidential election campaign. Costa Rica, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Panama meanwhile called on Venezuelan authorities to guarantee that elections are \u201cfree, fair, and transparent,\u201d in a joint statement released Wednesday by the Alliance for Development in Democracy. CNN has asked the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry for a response to the joint statement. Maduro is one of 10 candidates vying for the presidency, however, several of them have minimal support and are viewed by the main opposition as government allies.

{"id": "2024_07_19_style_skywalkers-rooftopping-documentary-culture-queue", "text": "What was your most thrilling first date? In 2016, two young Russians known for their extreme \u201crooftopping\u201d adventures \u2014 where they attempt to illegally climb vertiginous landmarks like La Sagrada Familia and the Eiffel Tower \u2014 skipped the perfunctory happy hour cocktail and instead ascended China\u2019s tallest incomplete skyscraper, the 1,957-foot-high Goldin Finance 117. At the time, Ivan Beerkus and Angela Nikolau didn\u2019t know they\u2019d end up together. Beerkus had invited Nikolau, a rare female member of the rooftopping community (she was scaling the proverbial glass wall before breaking it), to join him for the climb to produce sponsored social media posts. But it was the beginning of a long romantic and creative partnership, which has led them to travel thousands of miles\u00a0\u2014 and thousands of feet in the air \u2014 together. Eight years later, the documentary film \u201cSkywalkers: A Love Story\u201d takes an intimate look at their unusual romance through hundreds of hours of footage that, of course, includes heart-dropping POV footage from impossible heights and the occasional run-in with law enforcement. Like all couples, Beerkus and Nikolau have their ups and downs, and when they argue the stakes are a just bit higher than most (in one scene, Beerkus\u00a0bravely accuses his girlfriend of being \u201ctoo negative\u201d as she gears up to nail a precarious acrobatic pose literally above the clouds). Through the pair\u2019s unusual lifestyles, \u201cSkywalkers\u201d becomes a meditation on trust and commitment, though their stunts will also get your palms sweaty, if that\u2019s your thing. Directed by Jeff Zimbalist, a filmmaker with rooftopping experience of his own, and co-directed by Maria Bukhonina, \u201dSkywalkers\u201d debuted at Sundance Film Festival in January and is now streaming on Netflix. It follows the couple, who utilize Nikolau\u2019s background as a trained gymnast to create acrobatic stunts on narrow ledges, poles and scaffolding, as they take on increasingly difficult challenges and navigate their own budding relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the fear of falling from heights, but more about the fear of falling in love,\u201d Zimbalist said in a video call with CNN. \u201cAngela first told me that they were\u2026 competitors and rivals. But you could sense under the surface that there was this bubbling flirtation there.\u201d An architectural dare As the documentary progresses, the pair plot out their most difficult climb yet: Kuala Lumpur\u2019s Merdeka 118, the world\u2019s second-tallest building. The gleaming 2,227-foot-tall tower, which opened earlier this year, is crowned with a 527-foot-tall spire whose apex is only accessible via a narrow internal ladder. In 2022, when Beerkus and Nikolau made their plans, the \u201csupertall\u201d skyscraper had topped out but was still under construction. Evading security and reaching its apogee safely required an intense and elaborate scheme \u2014 one conjured while they worked through relationship issues. (At the time of their climb, the tower\u2019s owner said police were investigating the pair for trespassing, although Malaysian authorities did not respond to CNN about whether further legal action was taken.) Rooftopping is a contentious pastime \u2014 both for the danger it poses and participants\u2019 reliance on illegal trespassing.  With the urban \u201csport\u201d emerging as one more of the more extreme ways to get likes on social media, several harrowing deaths have followed. For \u201cSkywalkers\u201d the film crew followed Beerkus and Nikolau to document their stunts, but only to a point. Zimbalist emphasized his team\u2019s safety measures, which were designed to ensure the crew neither endangered themselves nor presented any distractions for the couple. \u201cWe talked a lot with Ivan and Angela, saying, \u2018Please, don\u2019t go do anything additionally crazy beyond what you would usually do,\u2019\u201d Zimbalist said. \u201cBecause to us, this isn\u2019t a movie about whether or not you succeed at Merdeka or any other climb\u2026 the genuine suspense here is if you choose to trust each other.\u201d An \u2018expanded state of mind\u2019 For the couple, rooftopping isn\u2019t just about thrill-seeking. Nikolau, the daughter of circus performers, says in the film that pushing herself to her limits was engrained from childhood and that she is always striving to better herself. For Beerkus, who scaled buildings alone in Moscow for years, rooftopping offers a sense of mental clarity. \u201cThe higher I went, the easier it was to breathe,\u201d he says to camera, recalling his earliest climbs. \u201cThis extreme life, this expanded state of mind, it\u2019s essential for me.\u201d Zimbalist recognizes the dangers of rooftopping and says his film is not\u00a0 about\u00a0\u201cdefending what they do against critics.\u201d Instead, he hope that \u201dSkywalkers,\u201d in addition to its message on love and trust, provides a rare look at the hard work and planning behind the rooftoppers\u2019 \u201cpolished\u201d social media posts. \u201cWith any activity that\u2019s dangerous, social media tends to disguise the difficulty,\u201d he said. \u201cTelling the story behind a stunt helps to give context and just how challenging and how dangerous some of these things are.\u201d Believe it or not, Nikolau maintains that she is afraid of heights, something she has had to confront repeatedly to keep up with her chosen line of work. \u201cThe fear never really went away; I just got better and better at facing it,\u201d she explains in one clip. So while the makers of \u201cSkywalkers\u201d would probably rather you don\u2019t climb your nearest skyscraper, their film encourages us to dare \u2014 and say \u201cyes\u201d to the thing that scares us the most. \u201cSkywalkers: A Love Story\u201d is available to watch on Netflix Add to Queue: Such great heights WATCH: \u201cFree Solo\u201d (2018) If you prefer watching daring feats on rock cliffs instead of skyscrapers, this Academy Award-winning documentary by filmmaker Chai Vasarhelyi and photographer-mountaineer Jimmy Chin follows climber Alex Honnold as he prepares to summit Yosemite\u2019s very vertical 3,000-foot-tall rock formation, El Capitan, without a rope or a harness.

{"id": "2024_07_18_asia_japan-south-korea-military-ties-china-north-korea-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "America\u2019s two most powerful allies in the Pacific are taking their defense ties to new heights amid increasing concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness in the region and North Korean threats, Japan\u2019s top general said Thursday. Before a trilateral meeting with US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. CQ Brown and South Korean Adm. Kim Myung-soo, Japanese Gen. Yoshihide Yoshida said China was trying to \u201cchange the status quo by force\u201d in the East China and South China seas, while North Korea was carrying out \u201crepeated ballistic missile launches and continuous arms transfers\u201d to Russia. Yoshida called on Japan, South Korea and the United States to \u201cdemonstrate our strong unity domestically and globally to ensure regional peace and stability.\u201d But bilateral cooperation between Japan and South Korea is the most noteworthy result of this week\u2019s meeting in Tokyo. On Wednesday, Yoshida met South Korea\u2019s Kim for the first such meeting between the East Asian defense chiefs in six years - a moment a US defense official stressed was significant. Kim said he and Yoshida \u201cshare a lot of the same thoughts,\u201d an acknowledgment of the mutual perspective on the regional threat posed by China and North Korea. \u201cWe developed strong trust between us,\u201d said Yoshida, adding the meeting sets the stage for the Japan-South Korea bilateral \u201cdefense cooperation to achieve a new height.\u201d Regional analyst James Brown said the Japan-South Korea meeting showed just how far the bilateral relationship has come under South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who succeeded Moon Jae-in in 2022. \u201cThe political mood has improved significantly, and now we\u2019re having the defense side of things aligning with that,\u201d said Brown, a professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo. \u201cThe Japanese government\u2019s feeling about this is that this is the relationship they\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d Japan felt the previous administration in Seoul was \u201cfixated on historical issues\u201d as it \u201cdemonized Japan\u201d and tried to improve relations with North Korea, Brown said. Last month, Japan and South Korea joined the US in the inaugural Freedom Edge in the Pacific, a military exercise that focused on ballistic missile and air defense, anti-submarine warfare and more. The goal of the exercise, which is set to expand in future years, was to allow the militaries to better work together against a common adversary. For years, historical acrimony between the two East Asian countries prevented high-level meetings and cooperation, with decades of deep mistrust dating back to Japan\u2019s colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula a century ago. But as the countries faced an increasingly assertive China and threats from North Korea, efforts to cooperate quickly supplanted past animosity, driven in large part by the efforts of US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. In March 2023, the two countries promised to resume ties at a fence-mending summit in Tokyo. Four months later, Biden hosted the leaders of Japan and South Korea at Camp David, where they pledged to \u201cinaugurate a new era of trilateral partnership.\u201d Then last month, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met his Japanese and South Korean counterparts on the sidelines of a security conference in Singapore, where they announced joint military exercises - nearly unthinkable just a few years ago. The trilateral meeting of the chiefs of defense at the Japanese Defense Ministry on Thursday, held for the first time in Tokyo, underscored the rapidly developing cooperation. \u201cI expect that the three of us sitting here in Tokyo today will send a message to the regional threats but also more globally on the strength of our relationship, our alliances, and the work that we need to continue to do,\u201d said Gen. Brown, sitting alongside his counterparts at the beginning of the meeting. The meeting comes on the heels of the NATO summit held last week in Washington, on the 75th anniversary of the alliance. The NATO communique specifically mentioned the importance of the Indo-Pacific, \u201cgiven that developments in that region directly affect Euro-Atlantic security.\u201d In their opening remarks Thursday, the Japanese and South Korean defense chiefs both mentioned their concern over Russia\u2019s expanding relations with North Korea. Earlier this week, Brown told CNN: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is NATO nations increasing interest in what happens in the Indo-Pacific, and Indo-Pacific nations having an interest in what goes on in Europe as well.\u201d Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said there was some sense of urgency behind the rapidly developing cooperation. The East Asian nations, he said, want to triangulate a coordinated response to common adversaries before potential changes in Seoul or Washington could put the relationship in jeopardy. \u201cDomestic politics remain complicated in Seoul and Tokyo, but policymakers and military professionals want to lock in coordinated responses to North Korea, Russia, and China before any major political changes occur in Washington,\u201d Easley said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/asia/japan-south-korea-military-ties-china-north-korea-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_19_travel_global-tech-outage-what-to-know-if-youre-traveling-this-weekend", "text": "Unexpected tech outages have been impacting airlines and airports across the world. Major hotel brands have also reported outages. Here\u2019s what to know if you\u2019re planning to travel this weekend. What\u2019s going on? Widespread IT problems are impacting global travel. It\u2019s believed the issue stems, at least in part, from a software update issued by software company CrowdStrike on Microsoft Windows operating systems. The CEO of CrowdStrike said in a statement obtained by CNN early Friday that the IT issue causing a global outage had been identified and a fix had been deployed. Meanwhile, Microsoft said the \u201cunderlying cause\u201d that led to the global outage \u201chas been fixed,\u201d but added that residual impact is still affecting some services. Airports, airlines and travelers across the globe continue to navigate the fall-out. Which airlines and airports are impacted? US-based carriers American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Allegiant Airlines, SunCountry and Frontier Airlines all reported issues on Friday. American Airlines has since said it has \u201csafely reestablished\u201d operations, while United resumed \u201csome flights\u201d Friday morning. Delta Air Lines resumed some flight departures but additional delays and cancellations were expected Friday. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in a statement early Friday that was \u201cclosely monitoring a technical issue impacting IT systems at U.S. airlines,\u201d adding that \u201cseveral airlines have requested FAA assistance with ground stops until the issue is resolved.\u201d The agency provided an update later in the day: \u201cCurrently FAA operations are not impacted by the global IT issue. We continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d The\u00a0agency also said\u00a0the IT issue \u201ccould continue to affect flights this weekend.\u201d Ryanair, Air France and Turkish Airlines also reported issues, while KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said the outages are \u201cmaking flight handling impossible.\u201d AirAsia said its \u201ccore reservation and check-in system\u201d have been impacted by the tech issues. Cirium, an aviation analytics company, said there were around 110,000 scheduled commercial flights Friday. By 3 p.m. ET, Cirium said there were more than 5,000 flights canceled globally. Many airports across the globe also logged tech-related issues. Dubai Airport reported issues on Friday morning, but the airport said in a post on X that normal operations had resumed. Passenger William Sikora III told CNN Friday morning that the situation at Philadelphia International Airport is \u201cabsolutely insane right now\u201d in the wake of the disruption. Airports across the US cautioned travelers to expect delays and to check their flight status before going to the airport. In Europe, London\u2019s Gatwick Airport said it is \u201caffected by the global Microsoft issues\u201d and that passengers may experience delays checking in and going through security. London\u2019s Heathrow Airport said it was working with \u201cairport colleagues to minimize the impact\u201d and advised passengers to check with their airlines for the latest flight information. Berlin Airport said it is experiencing delays to check-in, while Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol Airport stated the impact on its airport is \u201cbeing mapped.\u201d Scotland\u2019s Edinburgh Airport said the outages mean \u201cwait times are longer than usual at the airport.\u201d Spain\u2019s airport authority, AENA, which supervises airports in Madrid, Barcelona and others across the country, said the tech issues \u201ccould cause delays\u201d and that its staff are working to solve the problems. Airports and airlines in Asia and Latin America were also reporting disruptions caused by the IT outage. This is not an exhaustive list, so it\u2019s best to check the status of any airports you\u2019ll be transiting through this weekend before you travel. This is also a fast-moving situation heading into Friday night and the weekend, so if you\u2019re planning on flying, it\u2019s best to keep tabs on your chosen airline\u2019s social media channels, apps and website for up-to-date information. Check your flight status before you head to the airport, if you can. How long will it take for things to get back to normal? Travel will likely take a while to get back on track, even once the outage is sorted. The stoppage of flights means that thousands of aircraft have been grounded around the world and could be stuck in the wrong airports. Crews have limits on their working hours, so staffing challenges cascade along with flight delays. Getting schedules back on track is a complicated process that can take several days to fully iron out. The best course of action is to monitor your airline for announcements and to know your rights as a consumer. What do I do if my flight is canceled? First off, if you can, check the status of your flight before you leave for the airport. It\u2019s better to find out your flight is canceled from the comfort of home or a hotel room and make new arrangements from there, if at all possible. If you\u2019re already at the airport, head to the airline help desk. While you\u2019re standing in line, it\u2019s worth phoning the airline help number and trying to contact the company via social media or email. If you are a member of an airline executive club and have access to a special phone number, now is the time to use it. If it looks like the airline won\u2019t be able to put you on a flight until the following day, ask for a hotel room or hotel voucher. There are fewer consumer protections for situations outside of airlines\u2019 control, but it\u2019s worth requesting. And if your airline seems to be impacted, but another airline is still operable \u2013 ask about flying with other carriers. \u201cWhen flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier\u2019s flight because they have interline agreements,\u201d Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel in our guide to flight cancellations, which you can read here. \u201cThis means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.\u201d If you can plausibly take a train rather than fly \u2013 for instance, if you\u2019re in the UK heading to mainland Europe \u2013 it could be worth checking last-minute ticket availability. What are my rights as an air traveler? That depends on where you\u2019re flying to and from \u2013 in the US, for example, passengers have the right to a refund for canceled flights, but additional compensation or accommodation for delays or cancellations outside of carriers\u2019 control is up to each airline. On flights to and from EU countries, the laws are different. If your airport of origin is within the EU or if you\u2019re arriving to the EU on an EU airline, you\u2019re entitled to a refund for delays longer than five hours and additional compensation for some shorter delays. Wherever you\u2019re traveling, it\u2019s worth familiarizing yourself with the airline terms and conditions associated with your booking. And if you have travel insurance, look up your rights there too. Can I cancel my flight if I no longer want to travel? That all depends on the type of ticket you have, the airline you\u2019re flying with and whether you have travel insurance (which is always a good idea). Insurance covers missed departures and connections \u2013 if your flight is delayed, your company may be able to help change your travel plans, though it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll refund you if your flight is not affected but you no longer want to travel. Check your airline to see if it\u2019s offering passengers the chance to cancel or change dates. As the situation spirals and airlines reroute passengers on canceled flights, the flexibility may increase. At the time of writing, American Airlines is offering free changes for those due to fly on July 19 through eight major hubs (there are caveats as to rebooking dates). British Airways said it has increased flexibility for customers flying shorthaul routes over the weekend. Delta, United and American all issued waivers for impacted customers Are hotels or rental cars affected? Marriott International says some of its hotel systems have been impacted by the ongoing global IT outage. \u201cWe are actively working with our vendors to resolve issues that have impacted certain hotel systems. We apologize for any inconvenience that guests may experience,\u201d the company said in a statement to CNN Friday afternoon. CNN has reached out to\u00a0Hilton\u00a0Hotels for information on outages. One employee at the\u00a0Hilton\u00a0Phoenix Tapatio Cliffs Resort in Phoenix, Arizona, told CNN that guests had to wait for a bellhop to open their rooms for them because an outage hit the software the hotel uses to make key cards. Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty locations are open, according to a statement from Hertz. \u201cWe are seeing an increase in volume at our call centers and sustained demand for bookings, reservation modifications and one-way rentals. Some customers might experience longer than anticipated waits, and we are working diligently to get people on the road as quickly as possible,\u201d the statement said. Are trains and other public transport systems affected? Some train systems are reporting issues related to the tech outage. In the UK, National Rail reported \u201cwidespread IT issues across the entire network\u201d on Friday. National Rail said UK train operators are unable to access driver diagrams at certain locations, so there\u2019s the potential for short-notice train cancellations. In Italy, the transport ministry said Trenitalia and Italo train networks were suspended after systems went offline. Passengers called emergency services and demanded to be let off the trains because of extreme heat, after enduring delays up to 140 minutes. Some trains on rural Italian rail lines have been stopped because of extreme heat. In the United States, trains and buses in Washington, D.C., have been impacted by Friday\u2019s outages, according to the US capital\u2019s transit authority. In New York, Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) customer information systems went temporarily offline Friday morning, according to officials. However the MTA said \u201ctrain and bus service is unaffected.\u201d Again, this isn\u2019t an exhaustive list. If you\u2019re set to travel soon, wherever you are in the world, it\u2019s worth double checking your individual journey status before you travel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/travel/global-tech-outage-what-to-know-if-youre-traveling-this-weekend/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

The town council reminded beachgoers in a news release Wednesday that under the Municipal Ordinance of Use and Management of the Coast, they are prohibited from installing items such as chairs, hammocks and beach umbrellas before 9 a.m. in order not to hinder the clean-up of the beaches. Those who do not comply with this rule face being reported, their belongings being removed and fines of \u20ac250 euros (around $270). Chairs, hammocks and umbrellas that are left unattended for more than three hours during the day may be removed, the council said. It added that it has received complaints for some years now about people reserving space on the beach, with visitors arriving mid-morning to find it already staked out with belongings but no sign of their owners. The issue of space-hogging beachgoers is also a daily problem in nearby holiday hotspot Benidorm, according to local news site Informaci\u00f3n. Over the past few months, there has been increasing pushback against holidaymakers in Spain and its islands. Last month, the government of Barcelona \u2013 where thousands have been protesting against mass tourism \u2013 announced that it will bar apartment rentals to tourists by 2028, as it seeks to rein in soaring housing costs and make the city liveable for residents. In May, there were further crackdowns on party boats and public drinking on the islands of Ibiza and Mallorca. And in April, locals in the Canary Islands protested against excessive tourism, blaming visitors for pricing them out of their homes and causing environmental damage.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/travel/calpe-fine-sunbed-hoggers-spain-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_world_mh17-ukraine-australia-anniversary-intl", "text": "Relatives of passengers killed when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine gathered with officials at Australia\u2019s Parliament House on Wednesday to mark the 10th anniversary of the tragedy that claimed 298 lives. One of those relatives, Paul Guard, mostly blames the conflict raging in eastern Ukraine a decade ago for the missile attack that killed 38 Australian citizens and permanent residents including his parents, Toowoomba doctors Roger and Jill Guard. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone intended to bring down a passenger plane. So in that sense, I\u2019m heartbroken that the conflict continues,\u201d Paul Guard told Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC). \u201cBut I think that a lot of families would really have just liked an acknowledgement that what happened was wrong and that Russia should not have been waging war,\u201d the son added. The conflict has since escalated into a full-scale war with Russia\u2019s invasion of its smaller neighbor in February 2022. The pro-Russia rebel-held border region from where a Soviet-era Buk surface-to-air missile was fatefully launched and the fields where much of the debris landed after the Boeing 777 disintegrated is now territory controlled by the Russian military. Moscow has repeatedly denied responsibility for MH17\u2019s destruction and refused to hand over two Russians and a Ukrainian convicted by a Dutch court in absentia in 2022 of murder. Russia continues to be pursued under international law by the Netherlands through the European Court of Human Rights and by Australia and the Netherlands jointly through the International Civil Aviation Organization Council, or ICAO, over its alleged role in bringing down MH17. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong told Wednesday\u2019s service she was \u201cappalled\u201d that Russia had withdrawn from the ICAO proceedings in June. \u201cThe case will continue and we will not be deterred in our commitment to hold Russia to account,\u201d Wong told the gathering that included foreign diplomats. \u201cToday, on behalf of the Australian government, I recommit again to our collective pursuit of truth, justice and accountability for the outrages perpetrated on 17th July, 2014,\u201d she added. A commemoration is also planned in the Netherlands later Wednesday at a monument near Schiphol Airport, from where MH17 left on its way to the Malaysian city of Kuala Lumpur. Australian Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus will represent Australia at that monument, where 298 trees were planted to commemorate each victim and sunflowers like those that grew at the crash site. He expected the Netherlands-Australia case against Russia would be back before the ICAO in October despite Moscow\u2019s withdrawal. \u201cWe won\u2019t let this go until we\u2019ve brought Russia to account,\u201d Dreyfus said. The Netherlands was home to 196 victims. As well as Australia, victims also came from Malaysia, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, the Philippines, Canada, New Zealand, Vietnam, Israel, Italy, Romania, the United States and South Africa. An international investigation initiated in the U.N. Security Council by the Netherlands, Malaysia and Australia concluded that the Buk missile system that destroyed MH17 belonged to the Russian 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade. The investigation concluded the missile was driven into Ukraine from a Russian military base near the city of Kursk and returned there after the plane was shot down. Tony Abbott was Australia\u2019s prime minister when MH17 was shot down. Abbott recalled on Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin became physically aggressive when the Australian raised MH17 and the Ukraine conflict on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders\u2019 summit in Beijing in 2014. Putin said through an interpreter that Ukrainians were all fascists, had brought down MH17 themselves and that Ukraine had no right to exist, Abbott said. \u201cThen as we were going back into the conference \u2014 and this was really quite an extraordinary thing \u2014 he suddenly turned, grabbed the elbows and tried to shake me and then pushed me away. And he said in English, where he\u2019s quite fluent: \u2018Look, you are not a native Australian but I am a native Russian,\u2019 and pushed me away,\u201d Abbott told ABC. \u201cI think what he was trying to say to me in his own rather blunt and brutal way was that how could I as a citizen of a settler society understand the blood and soil and mystical attachment that he had to every last inch of Mother Russia?\u201d Abbott said. \u201cSo it was pretty obvious to me right back then what he was on about. I just think it\u2019s a pity that more wasn\u2019t done to arm up the Ukrainians in the meantime,\u201d Abbott added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/world/mh17-ukraine-australia-anniversary-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_18_europe_american-citizen-travis-leake-russia-penal-colony-intl", "text": "American citizen\u00a0Travis\u00a0Leake has been sentenced to 13 years in a penal colony in Russia, state media RIA Novosti reported Thursday, after he was detained on drug charges last year. A Moscow court had accused the \u201cformer paratrooper and musician\u201d of engaging in a narcotics business, according to RIA. Leake\u00a0pleaded not guilty to the charges, Russian state media TASS said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m here. I don\u2019t admit guilt, I don\u2019t believe I could have done what I\u2019m accused of because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m accused of,\u201d Leake reportedly said in his statement to police when he was arrested in June 2023, per tabloid outlet Ren TV. His sentencing comes as diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow are at a historic low, with Russia\u2019s brutal invasion of Ukraine raging on. Leake is one of at least a dozen US citizens and dual nationals currently being detained in Russia, including Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in\u00a0the country\u00a0since the Cold War. Leake is a frontman in Lovi Noch, which translates to \u201cCatch the Night,\u201d and was also a producer for other music groups in Moscow. In 2014, he expressed his frustrations with censorship as part of an interview with CNN. Host Anthony Bourdain personally chose Leake for the episode of Parts Unknown in Moscow and St. Petersburg. From January to June 2023, Leake allegedly\u00a0purchased narcotic drugs from an accomplice in another criminal case, Russian state media reported, citing Moscow\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office. Leake\u00a0packaged the narcotics for sale, prosecutors said, after which he transferred the drugs to an accomplice to hide.

{"id": "2024_07_19_middleeast_israel-tel-aviv-explosion-us-embassy-intl-hnk", "text": "Israel authorities are investigating the circumstances and potential security lapses around a deadly drone blast in Tel Aviv that killed one man and injured at least 10 others on Friday. The attack was claimed by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, in what the Iranian proxy group said was a response to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Houthi spokesperson Yahya Sare\u2019e said the\u00a0operation was performed by a new drone capable of \u201cbypassing the enemy\u2019s interception systems.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy\u2019s massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Sare\u2019e said. \u201cOur operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.\u201d The attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis. In a televised briefing on Friday, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range.  A second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli territory to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders. An Israeli military official said the drone was detected by an Israeli aerial defense system, but not intercepted due to \u201chuman error.\u201d It was armed with a warhead\u00a0and crashed into an apartment building, the official added, without providing further details of the device\u2019s payload. The official didn\u2019t provide details about what the human error was but noted that Israel\u2019s aerial defense systems don\u2019t always operate autonomously. The Iron Dome defense system, for example, can operate in manual mode, where its radar detects and tracks incoming threats but needs input from an operator before launching an interceptor missile. According to an initial inquiry \u201cno sirens were activated\u201d during the incident,\u00a0the IDF said earlier. Jack Lew, the US Ambassador to Israel, said Friday he was \u201cshocked by the brazen Houthi drone attack\u201d and sent his condolences to the victims\u2019 families. \u201cWe are thankful our US Embassy Branch Office personnel are safe,\u201d he added. Deadly explosion The explosion occurred in a central district home to a number of diplomatic missions, and hit about 100 meters (330 feet) from a US Embassy branch office, according to CNN analysis and information from local authorities. There was no damage to the US diplomatic mission\u00a0and\u00a0no reports of injuries of US personnel or \u201clocally engaged staff,\u201d the US State Department said. \u201cWe are in close contact with Israeli authorities to fully investigate the source of the explosion and its intended target,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding the embassy in Jerusalem and the branch in Tel Aviv are ready to provide consular assistance to US citizens. Emergency crews responded to \u201can object\u201d that had exploded on Shalom Aleichem Street, Israel\u2019s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said. \u201cThe dead man had suffered penetrating injuries,\u201d MDA paramedic Roi Klein said. At least four of the injured sustained shrapnel wounds, the MDA said. Israeli far-right\u00a0National Security\u00a0Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the Israeli government for being unable to protect the country, saying on social media that the attack showed the government \u201ccannot give security to the citizens of Israel.\u201d \u201cThere are no policies, no plans, all public relations and discussions are about themselves,\u201d he said. Ben Gvir said the attack on Tel Aviv and other areas of Israel are \u201cprecisely why I insist on being around the table in determining Israel\u2019s\u00a0policy.\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June disbanded the country\u2019s war cabinet after former war cabinet member Benny Gantz announced his withdrawal from the body, and Ben Gvir asked to join. Houthi attacks The Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted Israel with drones and missiles since the start of the country\u2019s war with Hamas, most of which have been intercepted by Israel\u2019s defenses. The Houthis have also been attacking US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas\u2019 October 7\u00a0attack, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others kidnapped. Israel\u2019s air and ground offensive\u00a0on Gaza has killed more than 38,000 people in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. The war has displaced almost all of the strip\u2019s population of more than 2 million people, turned swaths of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis. The war has raised fears of a wider regional conflict, with the potential consequences of further human suffering and shocks to the global economy. The Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, for instance, have forced some of the world\u2019s biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through one of the most important maritime trade routes. Sare\u2019e, the Houthi spokesperson, said the operation targeting Tel Aviv was carried out with a new drone called \u201cYafa\u201d that can \u201cbypass the enemy\u2019s interception system and (is) undetectable by radars.\u201d Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, wrote on X that Houthi claims shouldn\u2019t be taken at face value. \u201cIn general, Houthi claims are a mixed bag. Sometimes they are accurate, sometimes they are exaggerated, sometimes they are just straight-up fabrications,\u201d he wrote, adding that \u201ctheir factual claims have to be taken with a much bigger grain of salt than Iran\u2019s or Lebanese Hezbollah\u2019s.\u201d He said however that the drone used in the Tel Aviv attack is likely to be a Sammad, \u201cthe Houthi\u2019s standard long-range strike drone\u201d that has already been used in attacks against Israel, but with a more powerful engine. For the Houthis, he wrote, an extended drone range would be attractive \u201cas it would allow them to strike targets further away, fly routes evading enemy defenses, and attack from unexpected angles.\u201d Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, told CNN that the Houthis are likely to capitalize on the attack, especially as Israel\u2019s defenses failed to intercept it. \u201cThey will capitalize on it, not just inside Yemen but also outside Yemen,\u201d Nagi said, adding that the attack took place ahead of the rebel group\u2019s weekly rallies, which take place every Friday in support of Gaza in Houthi-controlled Yemeni cities. The attack \u201cgives momentum\u201d to these rallies, he said. The drone attack Friday in Tel Aviv comes after the Houthis claimed earlier this month that they had targeted ships in the Israeli port of Haifa with a number of drones in joint military operations with Iran-backed militias based in Iraq. The IDF told CNN at the time that it was not aware of such an incident.

Ultra-Orthodox Jews, or Haredi, have traditionally been exempt from military service so as to be able to study the Torah. But a Supreme Court ruling in June said the Israeli government must enlist draft-age ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military, reversing a de facto exemption in place since the country\u2019s founding 76 years ago. The move sparked fierce protests among Haredi communities. Shas described summons for military service as outrageous, and added: \u201cThe Great Rabbis have instructed, categorically, that as of now, as a new law defining the status of Yeshiva students has not been passed, there shall be no response to any summons or even summons for a first order, and therefore, not to show up to the recruitment stations.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s our duty now to stand strong, like a wall that can\u2019t be breached, and make clear for the world to know, that there\u2019s no force in the world that will, God forbid, succeed in detaching the students of the Torah from their studies.\u201d The IDF said this week that it will begin issuing initial summonses on Sunday to those designated for security service from among the ultra-Orthodox sector \u201cfor screening and evaluation processes in preparation for the recruitment\u201d for the upcoming year. The IDF said it \u201cworks to recruit to its ranks from all parts of this society in light of the conscription obligation in the state of Israel, by virtue of being the people\u2019s army and in light of the increased operational needs at this time, in view of the security challenges.\u201d The announcement sparked further protests. Nine people were arrested Tuesday for blocking a highway. On Monday, senior IDF officers were assaulted by dozens of ultra-Orthodox protesters, who threw bottles and other objects at them, after they\u2019d had a meeting in Bnei Brak. The commander of the IDF Training Command, Major General David Zini, and Major General Shay Tayeb, were attacked at the end of a meeting with Rabbi David Label, who has been working in recent days to establish the ultra-Orthodox division in the IDF. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s fragile government coalition relies on two Haredi parties \u2013 United Torah Judaism and Shas \u2013 to govern.

Archaeologists in the square outside the Archbasilica of St John Lateran in the city center unearthed a complex architectural structure including walls believed to have protected the Patriarchio, a monumental basilica envisaged by Emperor Constantine in the 4th century, the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThis is an extraordinarily important find for the city of Rome and its medieval history, as no extensive archaeological excavations have ever been carried out in the square in modern times,\u201d the ministry said. The initial structure of the building, which follows Constantine\u2019s declaration of tolerance for Christianity in the Roman Empire in 313, was expanded in stages between the 9th and 13th centuries and housed the papacy until 1305 when it temporarily moved to Avignon in France, the ministry added. The area around St John Lateran is being spruced up ahead of the Jubilee, a year-long event starting in December that is expected to attract more than 30 million pilgrims and tourists to the Italian capital. During a Jubilee, Catholics can obtain special indulgences, or remission of their sins, if they fulfill certain conditions and do good works or make pilgrimages. Rome\u2019s long history, stretching back almost 2,800 years, means that roadworks often lead to archaeological discoveries.

The shutdown of Kaspersky Lab\u2019s US operations will start on July 20, ending nearly two decades of the company operating in the country, according to the company\u2019s statement. \u201cThe company has carefully examined and evaluated the impact of the US legal requirements and made this sad and difficult decision as business opportunities in the country are no longer viable,\u201d Kaspersky Lab said. Independent journalist Kim Zetter first\u00a0reported\u00a0the news of the company\u2019s shutdown. The Commerce Department last month\u00a0announced\u00a0the ban of the sale and provision of Kaspersky software in the United States, citing national security concerns. US officials have claimed that the Russian government could use Kaspersky\u2019s popular anti-virus software to surveil Americans through hacking or data collection. Kaspersky has strenuously denied those claims. More than 400 million people and 240,000 companies worldwide use Kaspersky Lab\u2019s software products, according to the company. Just how many of those people and companies are in the United States is not clear. US government agencies were already banned from using Kaspersky\u00a0Lab software but the Commerce Department\u2019s move to prevent the sale of the software in the United States was unprecedented.

{"id": "2024_07_17_asia_cyanide-thai-hotel-deaths-intl-hnk", "text": "Six people, including two US citizens,\u00a0who were found dead inside a luxury hotel room in central Bangkok likely drank from tea and coffee cups laced with cyanide following a dispute linked to\u00a0bad investments, Thai police said Wednesday. The grisly discovery was made on Tuesday when staff at the five-star Grand Hyatt Erawan in the Thai capital entered the fifth-floor suite after the guests missed check out by more than 24 hours. When police arrived at the scene, they found the bodies of three men and three women, a table full of untouched food wrapped in plastic and used cups with traces of a white powder. The door was locked from the inside, police said, though a backdoor was left unlocked. Authorities initially said they were searching for a seventh person who was part of the hotel booking. But on Wednesday they dismissed this line of inquiry, saying\u00a0they believe one of the deceased poisoned the others with the deadly fast-acting chemical cyanide. Among the dead\u00a0are two Vietnamese Americans and four Vietnamese nationals including a married couple aged between 37 and 56,\u00a0Thai police said. Chief of the Police Forensic Office Trairong Phiewphan said in a press conference that cyanide was found in mugs and cups in the hotel room and at least one of the blood samples collected from a deceased man had traces of the chemical. \u201cCyanide was found in the liquid inside the teapot, in all six coffee cups,\u201d Trairong said. Images issued by the Royal Thai Police showed cups on a coffee table next to two metal thermos flasks and a dining table laden with plates of food, prepared as if people were about to sit down to eat. The question police are now trying to answer is whether the victims were murdered or chose to take their lives. Wednesday\u2019s press conference suggested police were leaning toward the former. Deputy Metropolitan Police Commissioner Noppasin Poonsawat told reporters they believe one of the members of the group may have poisoned the five others. That person, police said, had ordered the food and tea to the room and \u201clooked under stress\u201d when staff arrived. Noppasin said from interviews with hotel staff, one of the members of the group was alone in the room when the food arrived and was later joined by the other guests. He added that the incident was likely linked to a \u201cpersonal matter\u201d and not related to organized crime as interviews carried out with relatives of the dead indicated a dispute over debt. \u201cOne of the relatives said one of the deceased was an investment agent and all (the deceased) invested, but the business was not going as expected. They made an appointment to discuss the matter in Thailand,\u201d Noppasin said. Two of the deceased were found in the bedroom, another at the dining table, and police believe one member of the party tried to reach the door but fell before they were able to do so. Police said the group had arrived in Thailand on various dates and had booked separate rooms at the hotel. On July 15, the party all moved into the same room and had room service delivered at about 2 p.m. local time. No one left or entered the suite after 2:17 p.m., according to police. The Grand Hyatt hotel, where the deaths occurred, is located in a bustling tourist area in the heart of Bangkok that\u2019s home to luxury shopping malls and restaurants. Next to the hotel is the Erawan shrine, a famous landmark popular with Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh communities and tourists. The shrine, a preferred spot for those seeking good luck, was also the target of a bombing in 2015 that killed at least 20 people. The US State Department said it was \u201caware of reports of the deaths of two US citizens in Bangkok\u201d and Reuters reported that Vietnam\u2019s government said its embassy in the Thai capital was closely coordinating with Thai authorities. \u201cWe offer our sincere condolences to the families on their loss. We are closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to provide consular assistance to those families,\u201d US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a briefing Tuesday. Last year Sararat Rangsiwuthaporn, a Thai woman who was\u00a0arrested\u00a0on suspicion of murdering her friend with\u00a0cyanide,\u00a0was\u00a0charged with at least 13 counts\u00a0of premeditated murder, in a separate poisoning case that stunned the country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/asia/cyanide-thai-hotel-deaths-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_uk_starmer-nato-biden-interview-tapper-gbr-intl", "text": "Winston Churchill, often considered Britain\u2019s greatest leader, resigned at 80 in the face of mounting health problems. Keir Starmer, Britain\u2019s newest leader, wants to force lawmakers in the country\u2019s upper chamber to step down at the same age. Does this mean he thinks octogenarians like President Joe Biden should step back from politics? \u201cObviously in America, it\u2019s for the American people to decide who they want to be their president,\u201d Starmer told\u00a0CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper\u00a0in an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington, a week after he became prime minister of the United Kingdom. Despite growing questions about Biden\u2019s mental acuity and fitness for a second term, Starmer said the 81-year-old president had been \u201cin good form\u201d when the two met for talks,\u00a0but \u201cof course\u201d he would say if he was concerned about him. In the interview on CNN\u2019s The Lead,\u00a0Starmer also reaffirmed his new government\u2019s \u201cunshakable support\u201d for the NATO alliance,\u00a0described King Charles III as \u201cincredible,\u201d\u00a0and discussed how he \u201cdragged\u201d his party back to the center ground in British politics, a feat which helped him consign the Conservative Party to its worst-ever defeat in last week\u2019s election. Starmer, 61, is the latest in a series of world leaders who have been asked whether Biden is too old to campaign and govern effectively. But he spoke positively about their discussions at the summit on Wednesday. \u201cWe were billed for 45 minutes. We probably went on for the best part of an hour, covered a lot of ground \u2013 and he was in good form,\u201d Starmer\u00a0told Tapper. Starmer said the talks were \u201ca really good opportunity\u201d for him to \u201cspeak to the president about the special relationship\u201d between their two countries. He said Biden \u201cdeserves credit\u201d for presiding over a summit that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has called a success. Zelensky\u2019s comments were made before Biden mistakenly introduced the Ukrainian leader as \u201cPresident Putin,\u201d having to correct himself hastily. In a press conference later Thursday evening, Biden also mistakenly called his Vice President, Kamala Harris \u201cVice President Trump\u201d when discussing if she could beat the former president. On his plan to force lawmakers in the House of Lords \u2013 which scrutinizes the government and makes recommendations on laws \u2013 to step down after turning 80, Starmer said the policy was \u201cmore to do with the size\u201d of the unelected upper chamber than the fitness of elderly politicians. \u201cOur second chamber is the biggest second chamber in the world. We\u2019ve got over 800 members. We\u2019ve got to get the size down,\u201d he said. Starmer is not alone in trying to downplay concerns about Biden\u2019s age. French President Emmanuel Macron, attending the summit in a weakened position with his country in political limbo after a snap parliamentary election, said Biden remained \u201cin charge\u201d and \u201cclear on the issues he knows well.\u201d Starmer was\u00a0also\u00a0asked\u00a0by Tapper\u00a0to clarify comments made by David Lammy, a longstanding Labour politician who became Britain\u2019s foreign secretary last week. In 2018, Lammy called then-President Donald Trump \u2013 who will also turn 80 in office if re-elected to a second term in November \u2013 a \u201cwoman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathizing sociopath\u201d and a \u201cprofound threat to the international order.\u201d Starmer said his government will \u201cwork with whoever is elected\u201d in November, but stressed \u201cI\u2019m a progressive and we\u2019re sister parties with the Democrats.\u201d Starmer\u2019s comments echoed his previous remarks on a potential Trump presidency; he told the BBC last year he would \u201chave to make it work,\u201d though that doesn\u2019t mean \u201cwe would agree on everything.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s threats to leave NATO and cut a deal with Putin, likely ending the war in Ukraine on terms favorable to Russia, Starmer praised the \u201cclarity of purpose\u201d that other members have shown in the alliance during the summit. He also said Britain remains \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to raising its defense spending to 2.5% \u2013 above the NATO guideline of 2% \u2013 but did not provide a timeline for this. \u201cMy position as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom could not be clearer, which is an unshakable support for NATO,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were proudly one of the countries that was there at the founding of NATO\u2026 We\u2019re proud of that history.\u201d Tacking to the center A week ago, Starmer guided the Labour Party to a historic victory, winning a majority of 172 seats in the House of Commons and bringing to an end 14 years of Conservative rule. But, almost immediately, Starmer\u2019s victory was described as hollow and his mandate fragile, with critics pointing out Labour\u2019s relatively low share of the popular vote, despite its commanding victory under Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system. Asked if his victory was fueled more by anger towards the Conservatives than enthusiasm for Labour, Starmer hit back, saying his team deserved praise for turning the party around after it slumped to a dismal defeat in 2019 under the left-wing leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cI took over the Labour Party four and a half years ago. We\u2019d just had the worst general election result since 1935. The pessimists were saying, \u2018The Labour Party will never win a general election again.\u2019 The optimists said, \u2018Well you might, but it will take you 10 years,\u2019\u201d Starmer said. \u201cI said, \u2018No, we\u2019re going to do it in one parliamentary term. But we\u2019ve got to be ruthless, we\u2019ve got to be steely, we\u2019re going to change the Labour Party, we\u2019re going to turn it inside out and make sure it\u2019s a party that always says: Country first, party second.\u2019\u201d He said he had managed to pull his party back to the center ground, shunning the extremes. \u201cBrits are reasonable, tolerant \u2013 they don\u2019t much like the extreme left, they don\u2019t much like the extreme right. And we underestimate that,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the phrases I used in the election was we need a politics that trod more lightly on people\u2019s lives. And that\u2019s very important in Britain.\u201d Although he ruled out trying to rejoin the European Union, Starmer said he wanted to \u201creset\u201d Britain\u2019s relationship with the bloc. Starmer\u2019s \u201cnumber one mission,\u201d he said, is to restore Britain to economic growth, which has virtually flatlined since the 2008 financial crisis Starmer has softened his view on the British monarchy, having once talked about abolishing it, and said he was looking forward to his weekly audience with King Charles III, now he\u2019s become prime minister. \u201cIt is always valuable to listen to what he has to say. He\u2019s incredibly interested in politics, in the affairs across the United Kingdom, and global affairs,\u201d said Starmer. \u201cThey\u2019re a really good frank exchange of views and long may they continue.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/uk/starmer-nato-biden-interview-tapper-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) both said they had carried out tests and found samples of the virus in sewage water. \u201cPoliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) had been identified at six locations in sewage samples collected on 23 June from Khan Younis and Deir al Balah,\u201d WHO said Friday. WHO said the findings are linked to the \u201cdisastrous sanitation situation\u201d created by Israel\u2019s brutal military assault in Gaza since the Hamas attacks of October 7. \u201cIt is important to note the virus has been isolated from the environment only at this time; no associated paralytic cases have been detected,\u201d WHO added. It said no one has yet been treated in Gaza for paralysis or other symptoms of polio, but that residents must now \u201ccontend with the threat\u201d posed by the disease. Various United Nations agencies \u2013 including UNICEF, the children\u2019s fund, and UNRWA, the agency for Palestinian refugees \u2013 are working with local health authorities to determine how far the virus has spread. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said polio vaccination rates prior to the conflict were \u201coptimal,\u201d but that Israel\u2019s war against Hamas had created \u201cthe perfect environment for diseases like polio to spread.\u201d \u201cThe decimation of the health system, lack of security, access obstruction, constant population displacement, shortages of medical supplies, poor quality of water and weakened sanitation are increasing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, including polio,\u201d Tedros warned. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza called for practices to improve hygiene and safety. \u201cDetecting the virus that causes polio in sewage portends a real health disaster and exposes thousands of residents to the risk of contracting polio,\u201d it said in a statement, demanding \u201can immediate halt to the Israeli aggression.\u201d Wild polio was eradicated from Gaza more than 25 years ago, with pre-war vaccination coverage reaching 95% in 2022, according to WHO. Poliovirus can emerge when poor vaccination\u00a0coverage allows the weakened\u00a0form of the orally administered vaccine virus\u00a0strain\u00a0to mutate into a stronger version\u00a0capable of causing paralysis, a spokesman from WHO\u2019s global Polio Eradication program said. Meanwhile, hospitals in central Gaza said more than 20 people were killed after two Israeli air strikes on houses in the Nuseirat area. A CNN stringer on the ground said the majority of the casualties were women and children. CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) about the reported strikes.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/middleeast/israel-gaza-polio-detected-water-sewage-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2021_12_27_travel_what-to-do-flight-canceled-delayed", "text": "Computer glitches. Bad weather. Air traffic controller shortages. Holiday crunches. Accidents and investigations. Unruly passengers. So many things can cause a flight to be delayed or canceled. It\u2019s no wonder travelers are wary about making it to their destinations on time \u2013 or at all. (And even if they make it, their lost luggage might not). In the midst of a global IT fiasco on July 19 and a record-setting summer for air travel, here\u2019s some general advice for navigating a very complicated and frustrating system when flights are delayed or canceled. Avoid getting trapped at the airport As bad as it is to find out your flight has been delayed for a long time, or worse, canceled, it\u2019s better to find out from the comfort of home or a hotel room. \u201cCheck your flight status before you go the airport. Most of these notifications are not happening at the last minute,\u201d said Scott Keyes, the founder of Going.com. \u201cSave yourself the drive to the airport.\u201d  Keyes told CNN Travel that you should sign up for airlines\u2019 free text alerts on the status of flights when you buy your ticket. You should also download your carrier\u2019s app. You can also put your airline and flight number directly into a Google search bar to retrieve the status that way. That\u2019s also handy for friends or family who are on standby to pick you up. Keyes also suggested checking the website FlightAware to track larger flight trends across the country. Days ahead of the now-infamous December 2022 bomb cyclone, many US airlines offered their passengers a chance to change their flights for no fee. When you know a major weather event is forecast, hop on those waiver offers quickly, said Keyes, The early birds have the best choices of the remaining worms (that is seats and flights). If you\u2019re at the airport already  Sometimes, the delays and cancellations happen after you\u2019ve arrived at the airport. Once the bad news has been delivered, what should you do? Keyes said to head as fast as you can to the airline agents\u2019 desk \u2013 and get ready to multitask while you\u2019re in line. Fast is a key word here. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make a difference who arrives first. It\u2019s first-come, first-serve. Positioning yourself close to the desk can pay off,\u201d Keyes said. Then you might want to call up your carrier while you\u2019re waiting. Depending on your spot in line, it might be faster to get through to a call center. \u201cWhatever happens first, great,\u201d he said. Calls to US domestic numbers might have really long waits. Keyes suggested trying an international call center for your carrier instead. \u201cMost US-based travelers aren\u2019t thinking to call the Canadian help line for Delta. You might get through to an agent much quicker. They can all handle your reservations just the same.\u201d You can also use a self-serve kiosk, American Airlines says. \u201cScan your boarding pass or enter your record locator to see your updated trip details. From there you can also switch your flight and print your new boarding passes.\u201d The travel advice website Travel Lens suggests using social media to your advantage. \u201cNot all customer service teams are as helpful as they should be and getting in touch with them via a phone call isn\u2019t always easy,\u201d it told CNN Travel in an email. \u201cAirlines value their reputation on social media and platforms like Twitter [now X] are a great way to get in contact with an employee. If you do use Twitter to reach out, then it\u2019s important to remain polite and calm as this will work in your favor.\u201d Attitude and research matter  Whether you\u2019re dealing with an agent in person or over the phone, how you approach things can make a big difference. That starts with attitude. \u201cHoney attracts more flies than vinegar,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cLook at this from the airline agents\u2019 perspective. They\u2019ve been dealing with irate customers really since the pandemic began. The agent is the one who has the most ability to help you. \u201cAsking nicely and sympathetically is far more likely to get what you want than being a jerk about it.\u201d He had another tip when it\u2019s your turn to talk to an agent about making new arrangements: \u201cCome prepared to offer your own options already. Doing your own research is absolutely helpful.\u201d Your agent can expedite things if you\u2019ve already looked up new routes and possible suggestions while you\u2019ve been waiting.  If you\u2019ve booked through Expedia or another third-party site, you\u2019ll have to deal through them when there\u2019s a cancellation.  If the price is the same, Keyes suggested you book directly with the airline. In case something goes wrong, \u201cit makes it much more complicated with multiple sets of policies\u201d when you booked via a third party. US PIRG, a consumer advocacy group, suggests you avoid layovers when booking if possible. The more times you stop, the more chances for something to go wrong. The group also backs up the advice from Keyes to be nice and polite to agents but also says consumers should be persistent in trying to get the situation resolved satisfactorily.   Help from other airlines Cooperation between airlines could work in your favor. \u201cWhen flights are canceled, many airlines have the option of putting you on another carrier\u2019s flight because they have interline agreements,\u201d Lousson Smith, product operations specialist at Going.com, told CNN Travel.  \u201cThis means, for example, if Delta is having service interruptions but American is running a flight to your destination, you may be able to get on that flight.\u201d \u201cIf you elect not to be accommodated on a later flight and you book a new ticket out of your own pocket, you are entitled to a cash refund, though that may not help you get to where you need to go,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAs we all know, last-minute flights are very expensive.\u201d Trapped for the night   What do you do if it looks like you\u2019re not going to be able to fly out until the next day and you\u2019re not in your home city? \u201cAsk the airline to put you up in a hotel or give you a hotel voucher. They might do it; they might not. It\u2019s not required by law,\u201d Keyes said.  They\u2019re less likely to do it if it\u2019s weather related, he said, than if the problem is a mechanical issue with the plane or staffing issues. Many airlines have committed to offering meal and hotel vouchers in certain cases. The US Department of Transportation has a dashboard that tracks those commitments.     Get to know policies. For instance, Delta Air Lines says it will provide a hotel voucher in some circumstances when the delay is between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.  Whatever you do, at least ask, Keyes said. A voucher for hotels and even ground transport and meals aren\u2019t likely to just be offered. Also, your credit card could be your friend in this situation. \u201cThe good news is that many credit cards offer travel protections such as reimbursement if a flight cancellation forces you to get a hotel, meals, etc.\u201d Smith said. \u201cThese travel protections are typically included automatically as long as you used the card to pay for your flight. Google your credit card plus travel protections to see what specific offerings your card carries.\u201d If your flight is delayed instead of outright canceled, you might want to weigh whether to wait at the airport. Depending your personal circumstances, hunkering down there for five or six hours might be easier than going to and from a hotel. Also, Keyes said, check whether there is a hotel within the airport. The Points Guy advises trying to get into an airport lounge if you can, where you can recharge your phone and rest more easily. Stay safe. If extreme weather is causing air travel disruption, trying to make the journey by road could be hazardous. Frustrating though it is to stay put, it\u2019s always better to arrive late than not at all. Travel insurance and receipts Consider buying travel insurance, advises Airport Parking Reservations in an email to CNN Travel. It said \u201cmost travel insurance policies provide additional cover for travel uncertainty. Additional [coverage] usually becomes applicable if your flight is postponed by more than 12 hours due to a strike, adverse weather or a mechanical breakdown.\u201d  The site also advises that you keep any receipts of airport purchases. You can try to get the money back from the airline later.  But keep it to the basics. \u201cAirlines only pay for \u2018reasonable\u2019 expenses though, so you are unlikely to get money back for purchases such as alcohol, expensive meals or extravagant hotels. \u201c  Refund entitlements for your flight The US Department of Transportation says you are entitled to a refund of your ticket cost because of a cancellation or \u201csignificant delay\u201d or \u201csignificant change\u201d to your flight and you choose not to travel. This is the policy for cancellations regardless of the reason the airline cancels. In cases of \u201csignificant\u201d delays or changes to itineraries, what constitutes \u201csignificant\u201d remains open to interpretation and depends on a number of factors. New federal rules say travelers deserve cash refunds when inconvenienced by their airline \u2013 not vouchers or travel credits. \u201cFrom now on when your flight is canceled for any reason, you are entitled to an automatic cash refund and it has to be prompt,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN when the new rule was announced in April. Tomasz Pawliszyn, CEO of AirHelp, said in an email to CNN Travel before the new rules came into effect that flyers should try to avoid vouchers. \u201cIf travelers are denied boarding, they should not volunteer their seat in exchange for perks or a voucher. If they do, they could be giving up their right to any additional compensation,\u201d Pawliszyn said. \u201cOf course, if the airline makes a compelling enough offer, they may prefer to take it.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2021/12/27/travel/what-to-do-flight-canceled-delayed/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra and former British prime ministers Tony Blair and Boris Johnson were just some of the famous faces who flew in to Mumbai to attend the star-studded event. The wedding also attracted many of the biggest names in Indian entertainment, sport, business and politics, from Bollywood stars like Rajinikanth and Sanjay Dutt, to former president Ram Nath Kovind, the chief ministers of various states and numerous members of the country\u2019s revered cricket team. No expense was spared by the Ambanis, the family behind India\u2019s largest private corporation, Reliance Industries. Founded by Anant\u2019s grandfather, the conglomerate is now run by his father Mukesh, who is worth over $122 billion, according to Forbes. In a rain-soaked Mumbai, police closed roads in the area surrounding the Ambani-owned, 16,000-capacity Jio World Convention Center ahead of a red-carpet-style arrival event. Attendees dressed the part, streaming past photographers in custom sarees, lehengas and kurtas at an event that may set forthcoming trends in Indian wedding fashion. International guests also honored the traditional dress code, with many seen wearing designs by major Indian fashion designers. John Cena walked the red carpet in an embroidered sky blue sherwani and white pants, while Jonas sparkled in a\u00a0baby pink version \u2014 made from a boucl\u00e9-style woven fabric embedded with sequins\u00a0\u2014 and matching satin trousers. Jonas arrived with his wife and actor, Priyanka Chopra, who opted for an intricately embellished sunshine yellow lehengai. The fashion crowd were out in full force too. Zendaya\u2019s longtime stylist Law Roach arrived in a mauve velvet jacket, purple tunic and a pair of Schiaparelli gold toed shoes, while designer and New York Fashion Week staple Prabal Gurung wore a rose-colored sherwani and aviator sunglasses. Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, who skipped the red carpet entirely, were seen on social media dressed in gold and red saris respectively. Kim\u2019s ensemble featured an off-the-shoulder tasseled bodice, whereas Khlo\u00e9 opted for long, ornate sleeves, stacked necklaces and an opulent maang tikka. In an Instagram story, Kim teased that their film crew was in tow for an episode of their show \u201cThe Kardashians.\u201d Once inside the venue, which was transformed into a miniature version of the holy Indian city of Varanasi, celebrities including Chopra and Cena were seen dancing and letting loose. Footage widely shared on social media also showed members of the Ambani family dancing on stage with Indian singer, Daler Mehndi. The night\u2019s other performers included Afrobeats star Rema, who performed his hit song \u201cCalm Down.\u201d As for the couple itself, the groom first arrived on the red carpet in a golden sherwani paired with sneakers, which he later changed for the ceremony. The bride dazzled in hand-embroidered bridal couture by the Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla. Merchant followed the Gujarati tradition of wearing red and white in an opulent red-trimmed ivory ensemble. It featured a 16-foot-long veil adorned with stones and sequins and a long ghagra, or traditional skirt, with a nearly seven-foot-long detachable train, according to her stylist Rhea Kapoor, who shared a first look on Instagram. Ahead of her \u201cvidai,\u201d the ceremony in which Indian brides symbolically bid farewell to their\u00a0relatives before joining their groom\u2019s family, Merchant changed into an\u00a0opulent red and gold outfit\u00a0featuring a woven blouse, lehenga, veil and embroidered\u00a0head covering. In a video posted to social media on Friday morning, Anant\u2019s mother Nita Ambani recounted a recent trip to Varanasi, in India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state, where she sought blessings for the pair. She said she hoped to \u201creimagine and present the purity, positivity and beauty of Varanasi at the wedding,\u201d adding that the event would \u201cpay a tribute to India\u2019s glorious culture and heritage, brought to life by thousands of artisans\u2026 weavers and craftspeople.\u201d It was also revealed that the gown Nita Ambani wore on the event red carpet took more than 40 days to create. The custom peach silk ghagra was designed by couture house Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and artisans Vijay Kumar and Monika Maurya. A lavish affair The Ambani family has remained tight-lipped about proceedings in the build-up to Friday\u2019s wedding, though rumors about the guest list and the identity of star performers have swirled in recent weeks. Local press and Indian social media users have also pored over speculation over everything from the dinner menu to the items of jewelry that might be on display from the family\u2019s sizable collection. One of India\u2019s best-known fashion designers, Manish Malhotra, served as the event\u2019s creative director. The celebrated couturier produced bespoke outfits for various members of the Ambani family throughout the month-long wedding celebrations. \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event \u2026 is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he told CNN via e-mail ahead of the wedding. In the days leading up to Friday\u2019s ceremony, the couple took part in several traditional pre-wedding rituals. Justin Bieber performed at the pair\u2019s \u201csangeet,\u201d a night of music and dance, last Friday. The couple then attended a private \u201chaldi\u201d ceremony, which traditionally sees friends and family bless the bride and groom by applying a turmeric paste to their heads, faces or bodies. As per Hindu tradition, the wedding dates were reportedly chosen according to auspicious days on the bride and groom\u2019s birth charts. A Brown University graduate, 29-year-old Anant Ambani is Mukesh\u2019s youngest child and serves as director at an energy business operated by Reliance. His bride Radhika Merchant, also 29, is the daughter of Viren and Shaila Merchant, the founders of pharmaceutical company Encore Healthcare. It is not known precisely how much money the Ambani family has spent on the pair\u2019s wedding celebrations. Industry estimates have placed the total firmly in the hundreds of millions of dollars, with musical performers reported to be receiving seven- or even eight-figure sums. On the streets of Mumbai, residents spoken to by Reuters had mixed feelings about the extravagant event \u2014 and the wealth on display. \u201cIt\u2019s their wealth but it is beyond ridiculous what they are doing,\u201d said preschool teacher Devanshi Zaveri, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to show off that much.\u201d Banker Jenica Kothari meanwhile welcomed the boost to local businesses: \u201cIt\u2019s helping the economy, it\u2019s helping everyone\u2026 So, I think if they have the money, they should spend it.\u201d Local hotel rates reportedly soared as the thousands of guests prepared to jet to Mumbai, a financial hub that serves as India\u2019s commercial capital. Months of celebrations Festivities are set to continue through the weekend at the Ambani family\u2019s soaring 27-story Mumbai residence, Antilia. Saturday is expected to see a \u201cShubh Ashirwad,\u201d or divine blessings ceremony, while a Sunday reception (with an \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code) will give guests a final chance to celebrate with the couple. The weekend schedule concludes seven months of build-up to what has been described as India\u2019s wedding of year. Celebrations kicked off with a celebrity-filled engagement party in January. Two months later, the Ambanis hosted a communal dinner for more than 50,000 villagers and a 1,200-guest pre-wedding bash \u2014 attended by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump \u2014 featuring a rare live performance by Rihanna. In May, the family then chartered a cruise ship to take guests on a four-day trip around the Mediterranean. The schedule included multiple stops through Europe and on-deck concerts from the Backstreet Boys and Pitbull, among others. Anant\u2019s older sister, Isha, also held a lavish wedding in 2018. Her marriage to businessman Anand Piramal was watched by celebrities, politicians and business tycoons, while her pre-wedding bash featured an intimate private concert by Beyonc\u00e9.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/style/anant-ambani-radhika-merchant-wedding-mumbai-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_uk_king-charles-iii-unveils-keir-starmers-plans-for-britain-in-state-opening-of-parliament", "text": "Keir Starmer, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, pitched himself as an antidote to \u201cthe snake oil charm of populism\u201d on Wednesday, unveiling sweeping plans to target housebuilding, crime, illegal migration and a breakdown in public trust during the first ceremonial King\u2019s Speech of his government. King Charles III formally opened a new session of parliament by reading out Starmer\u2019s agenda at a grandiose event that brings together Britain\u2019s royal pageantry and political class, two weeks after his landslide landslide election win brought a 14-year era of Conservative rule to an emphatic end. The speech focused on Starmer\u2019s central slogan of \u201cnational renewal,\u201d and included pledges to nationalize Britain\u2019s railways, tackle a housing crisis by changing planning laws to build more affordable homes, and intensifying efforts to tackle illegal migration. Starmer more broadly took swipes at the Tory governments that had ruled Britain since 2010, and at the swell of populism that has rippled across the UK and Europe, attempting to lay claim to Britain\u2019s center ground with a public push for pragmatism. \u201cNo more wedge issues. No more gimmicks,\u201d Starmer told lawmakers in the House of Commons as debate on his agenda began, insisting his government would \u201csolve problems, not exploit them.\u201d \u201cThe fight for trust is the battle that defines our political era,\u201d Starmer said. His 40-bill agenda includes measures crafted to appeal to both older and younger generations, as Starmer seeks to maintain the broad coalition of voters that put him into Downing Street earlier this month. But his introduction to that agenda also contained an effort to counteract the rise of populism in the UK and Europe. \u201cThe snake oil charm of populism may sound seductive, but it drives us into the dead end of further division and greater disappointment,\u201d Starmer said. While the speech fleshed out some of the growth-orientated vision Starmer pitched during the summer\u2019s election campaign, it was light on details on other areas, including how Starmer would meaningfully bolster Britain\u2019s border security after an election campaign disrupted by public concern over small boat crossings to the UK. And Starmer opted to swerve some of the thornier constitutional and voting changes he had pledged to make during the campaign, including an upper age limit on peers allowed to sit in the House of Lords, and the lowering of the voting age to 16. Pomp and politics collide The state opening of parliament is a rare collision of pomp and politics, featuring a series of centuries-old flourishes and conventions that catch even many of Britain\u2019s lawmakers off guard. The production began when King Charles III and his wife, Camilla, made their way by carriage from Buckingham Palace to the Houses of Parliament, before MPs were summoned by Black Rod \u2013 a role established in the 1300s \u2013 to watch his speech in the House of Lords chamber. Starmer and his defeated rival, Conservative leader Rishi Sunak, shared a warm conversation before and after the speech, their roles dramatically reversed after the election on July 4 that saw Labour win a landslide in parliament, although with a modest share of the votes. Once the speech began, focus shifted to the first Labour legislative plan in a decade and a half. It put at its heart an effort to build, after a decade of stalled growth that had seen housing and infrastructure projects scuppered across Britain. Starmer also formalized plans to renationalize Britain\u2019s rail network in the coming years, and to create a publicly-owned renewable energy company. Other parts of the speech continued Labour\u2019s efforts to appeal to traditionally conservative voters who have lost faith in the Tory party after a tumultuous stretch in government. In particular, Starmer promised a clampdown on illegal migration and small boat crossings across the Channel \u2013 an issue that plagued successive Conservative governments and gave rise to a surge in support for Reform UK, a populist anti-migrant bloc that won more than 4 million votes in the election. The speech pledged extra powers for law enforcement to investigate people smuggling, including stopping and searching at the border, and the creation of a new Border Security Command. It also promised to clear Britain\u2019s vast asylum backlog, which has ballooned to near 100,000 people in recent years and forced the government to accommodate asylum seekers in hotels and detention centers for months while they await news on their claim. At home, a number of institutions were targeted for modernization \u2013 most awkwardly, the very room in which Charles gave his speech. Under government plans, hereditary peers will no longer be able to sit and vote in the House of Lords, in a \u201cfirst step in wider reform\u201d to the chamber. A new draft Race Equality Bill will meanwhile make it mandatory for large employers to report ethnicity and disability pay in the same way they currently report gender pay. And legislation for a long-awaited ban on both gay and transgender conversion therapy \u2013 efforts to change someone\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity \u2013 was announced, having been first trailed by Theresa May in 2018 but never brought to light. Sunak tells Starmer he \u201cmust now deliver change\u201d Starmer acknowledged a breakdown in belief among the British public that politics can be a force for good \u2013 trust in politics is at record lows, studies have suggested, after a lengthy period dominated by scandal in Westminster. But his agenda will be underpinned by a large dealing of skepticism that Britain\u2019s public services can be revived without a much larger infusion of cash than the government is offering. Little in the speech focused on Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS), or on its social care sector, where the priority will be management rather than new legislation. After the King read Starmer\u2019s speech, MPs gathered in the Commons to debate Labour\u2019s agenda, with former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promising to lead the opposition constructively while a drawn-out contest to replace him as Conservative leader takes place. \u201cThe party opposite has successfully tapped into the public\u2019s desire for change, but they must now deliver change,\u201d Sunak said. He and Starmer had shared warm exchanges earlier in the day \u2013 which Starmer said had partially focused on England\u2019s football team \u2013 but the rigor of Britain\u2019s politics returned and tension crept back into the chamber as Sunak criticized the scrapping of his plan to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, and claimed that Labour had inherited, thanks to his work, an economy on an upward trajectory. And Sunak urged Starmer to match his committment to increase the UK\u2019s defense spending to 2.5% of its GDP, saying it \u201cwill show the Americans that we do not expect them to bear every burden\u201d within NATO. Those arguments will intensify in the coming weeks, as Labour introduces its first bills to Parliament \u2013 beginning with three priority measures from the speech later this week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/uk/king-charles-iii-unveils-keir-starmers-plans-for-britain-in-state-opening-of-parliament/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

In an earlier pitch to the European parliament in Strasbourg, France, von der Leyen on Thursday pledged to invest in infrastructure and industry, create a new \u201cEuropean Defense Union\u201d and stay the course on the continent\u2019s green transition. After a secret ballot, von der Leyen was reelected with 401 votes in favor and 284 against. She needed more than 360 ballots to secure a majority in the 720-seat parliament. Von der Leyen, who led the commission through the Covid-19 pandemic and the beginning of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, will now preside over a bloc that shifted rightward after last month\u2019s European elections, when far-right parties won a record number of seats. Addressing the parliament before the lunchtime vote, von der Leyen said the next five years of her term \u201cwill define Europe\u2019s place in the world for the next five decades. It will decide whether we shape our own future or let it be shaped by events or by others.\u201d Von der Leyen, a 65-year-old German national, was parachuted into the presidential candidacy process as a compromise candidate in 2019, but has since become one of Europe\u2019s most solid pillars. Several of the continent\u2019s other leaders \u2013 from Germany\u2019s former Chancellor Angela Merkel to French President Emmanuel Macron \u2013 have retired or been weakened by domestic politics. Von der Leyen\u2019s own position was somewhat diminished by last month\u2019s election, which saw a surge in support for the far right and saw Brussels\u2019 center ground shrink. Her reelection was not certain but widely expected, after she was proposed by EU leaders and could rely on the support of her center-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP), as well as the center-left Socialist and Democrats (S&D) and liberal Renew blocs. Shortly before Thursday\u2019s vote, the Green bloc also announced it would support her. After the vote, von der Leyen said her reelection was \u201ca very emotional and special moment\u201d and that she was grateful for the trust the parliament had placed in her. \u201cWe have spared no effort. We have navigated the most troubled waters that our union has ever faced. And we have kept the course on our long-term European goals,\u201d she said, praising the work done under her first term. Earlier Thursday, von der Leyen published a 31-page policy proposal, setting out her priorities if she won a second term. Echoing remarks she made after last month\u2019s vote, she stressed \u201cit is essential that the democratic center in Europe holds\u201d in the face of resurgent extremes, calling on mainstream parties to \u201clive up to the scale of the concerns and the challenges that people face in their lives.\u201d Von der Leyen pledged to \u201cturbo charge investment\u201d needed by cash-strapped EU governments for their \u201cgreen, digital and social transition.\u201d She also vowed to create a European Defense Union and appoint a commissioner for defense, a new role for the bloc that was forged in peacetime but has since had to respond to Russia\u2019s brutal war in Ukraine, and the prospect of a Donald Trump-led United States retreating from the world stage. Under the proposed new defense union, member states will retain responsibility for their own troops, but will work more closely with others to \u201ccoordinate efforts to strengthen the defense industrial base.\u201d She also proposed a Europe-wide air defense system and cyber protection measures. Speaking in Strasbourg before her reelection, von der Leyen said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s recent trip to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin was \u201can appeasement mission,\u201d and pledged to maintain EU support for Ukraine. Von der Leyen\u2019s reelection comes a day after the EU\u2019s second-highest court delivered an unusual rebuke to the commission, ruling it was not transparent enough about the contracts it signed for Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/europe/eu-parliament-von-der-leyen-second-term-commission-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_middleeast_israel-west-bank-jerusalem-occupation-icj-opinion-intl", "text": "The United Nations\u2019 top court said Friday that Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal, in an unprecedented opinion that called on Israel to end its decades-long occupation of territories claimed by Palestinians for a future state. The advisory opinion, while non-binding, was the first time the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has expressed its view on the legality of Israel\u2019s presence in territories it captured in the 1967 war. An advisory opinion is not legally binding but carries moral authority and can shape international law,\u00a0according to the ICJ. Friday\u2019s opinion prompted condemnation from Israeli leaders and praise from Palestinian officials. In its sweeping judgment, the ICJ ran through a list of Israeli practices that it said violated international law, including confiscating land, building Israeli settlements in the territories, and depriving Palestinians of natural resources and the right to self-determination. The court called on Israel to\u00a0cease new settlement activity, evacuate settlers and make reparations for the damage caused. \u201cThe sustained abuse by Israel of its position as an occupying Power, through annexation and an assertion of permanent control over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, violates fundamental principles of international law and renders Israel\u2019s presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful,\u201d the opinion read. Judge Nawaf Salam, the president of the ICJ, which is based in The Hague in the Netherlands, said the court observed that \u201clarge-scale confiscation of land and the degradation of access to natural resources divests the local population of their basic means of subsistence thus inducing their departure.\u201d The court also found that Israel\u2019s declaration of Jerusalem as its capital helped to \u201centrench Israel\u2019s control of the occupied Palestinian territory\u201d and said that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are \u201cin violation of international law.\u201d During the 1967 war, Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights from neighboring Arab states. Soon after, it began establishing Jewish settlements in those territories. The Palestinians want the West Bank and Gaza for a future state, with East Jerusalem at its capital. Israel considers the entirety of Jerusalem as its \u201ceternal capital.\u201d In its opinion, the court concluded that all states and international organizations, including the United Nations, are under an obligation \u201cnot to recognize as legal the situation arising from the unlawful presence of the State of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\u201d The case predates the current Israel-Hamas war, and stems from a 2022 request for an advisory opinion by the UN General Assembly. The 15 judges on the court were asked to consider \u201cthe legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.\u201d It is also separate from the ICJ proceedings held in January over an accusation from South Africa that Israel was committing genocide in its war against Hamas following the October 7 attacks \u2013 a claim Israel has vehemently denied. \u2018False decision\u2019 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other politicians rejected the ICJ opinion. \u201cThe Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement. \u201cNo false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth, just as the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\u201d Foreign Minister Israel Katz also condemned the opinion, calling it \u201cfundamentally warped, one-sided, and wrong.\u201d Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, himself a settler, also spoke out against the court.\u00a0\u201cThe answer to The Hague \u2013 sovereignty now,\u201d Smotrich\u00a0said on X, a call for Israel to annex the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority (PA) welcomed the opinion, calling it \u201ca watershed moment for Palestine, for justice, and for international law.\u201d The opinion \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more timely or sorely needed,\u201d the PA said in a statement, adding that it \u201cis a vindication of their steadfastness and perseverance.\u201d The PA also urged all states and the UN not to recognize the legality of the settlements and to \u201cdo nothing to assist Israel in maintaining this illegal situation.\u201d Implications of the ICJ opinion While the ICJ has previously given advisory opinions about Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank, Friday\u2019s announcement is a step further, some experts said. The ICJ in 2004 delivered an advisory opinion on the Israeli separation barrier around the majority of the West Bank, urging Israel to remove it from occupied land. The nonbinding opinion had found that Israel was obligated to return confiscated land or make reparations for any destruction or damage to homes, businesses and farms caused by the barrier\u2019s construction. \u201cIf the 2004 opinion held that Israel had to dismantle the wall, or at least the parts of it that encroach onto the West Bank, (Friday\u2019s opinion) holds that Israel has to withdraw as rapidly as possible from the occupied territories,\u201d Eliav Lieblich, a professor of international law at Tel Aviv University, told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s a major difference \u2013 not the legality of the settlements per se, but the implications of the settlements and the entire practice around them,\u201d Lieblich said. While ICJ opinions are not binding, they are perceived as \u201cvery authoritative statements of international law as is,\u201d he said, adding that they may have an impact on international organizations taking this opinion to domestic courts, demanding for example that individual counties refrain from exporting weapons that may be used in the occupied territories.

{"id": "2024_07_19_asia_israel-invitation-to-hiroshima-japan-sparked-controversy-intl-hnk", "text": "Hiroshima, the Japanese city devastated by a US atomic bomb in 1945, is at the center of a growing controversy after local officials dismissed calls to disinvite Israel from its annual ceremony promoting world peace as war rages in Gaza. Every year on August 6, Hiroshima gathers foreign officials, along with locals, in a minute of silence at 8:15 a.m. to mark the exact moment the bomb dropped, killing tens of thousands of people and leading to the end of World War II. Some activists and atomic bomb survivors\u2019 groups say the ceremony is no place for Israel, which is pounding Gaza with strikes as it seeks to eradicate\u00a0Hamas in response to the Palestinian militant group\u2019s devastating attack on October 7 last year. They say the Hiroshima city government should exclude Israel from this year\u2019s ceremony, as it has Russia and Belarus for the past two years over Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. But Hiroshima authorities say they have no intention of excluding Israel. \u201cIt is not a double standard. Our policy is to invite all countries. However, Russia and Belarus are exceptions due to the invasion of Ukraine,\u201d a Hiroshima city government spokesperson told CNN. \u201cRussia and Belarus are not invited in order to ensure the ceremony goes smoothly.\u201d Authorities in Nagasaki, the\u00a0Japanese city hit by an atomic bomb just days after Hiroshima, told CNN they haven\u2019t decided whether to invite Israel to their peace ceremony on August 9. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza may \u201cprevent the smooth execution of the ceremony,\u201d they said, stressing the move was not a gesture of protest but a practical consideration. Calls for Israel\u2019s exclusion Of the two ceremonies, Hiroshima\u2019s is the largest with representatives from\u00a0115 countries and the European Union set to attend this year. Envoys from Russia and Belarus haven\u2019t attended since Hiroshima excluded them in 2022 following Moscow\u2019s invasion of\u00a0Ukraine in February that year. Russia used Belarus as one of the launch pads for its assault and later moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons there. This year\u2019s Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony takes place against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel\u2019s bombardment has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and displaced nearly the entire enclave\u2019s more than 2 million people, who now face severe shortages of food, shelter, water and medical supplies. \u201cWhy invite Israel if they are committing genocide-like crimes, just like Russia and Belarus?\u201d said Tetsuji Kumada, executive director of Hiroshima\u2019s Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organization, one of the groups opposing Israel\u2019s presence. \u201cIt is very disappointing that our request wasn\u2019t taken into account,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the organization wrote to the Hiroshima government in June to ask for Israel to be disinvited. Another group, Hiroshima-Palestine Vigil Community, launched an online petition in May, calling for Israel\u2019s representatives to be excluded, saying that \u201ccurrent global protests against Israel clearly outnumber those against Russia in both scale and frequency.\u201d The petition has since amassed more than 30,000 signatures. Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations from critics as well as rights groups and experts that it has broken international humanitarian law with the breadth of its response to Hamas\u2019 attacks. It argues its war is against Hamas, not Palestinians, although anger over the extent of the destruction and civilian deaths in Gaza has swelled globally. CNN has reached out to the Israeli embassy in Japan for comment. Japan has taken a strong stance in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, pledging to stand with Kyiv, offering billions of dollars in humanitarian aid and military vehicles and equipment for mine-clearing operations. It has also imposed sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, Tokyo has offered humanitarian aid to Gaza, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d for the critical situation in the strip and supports a two-state solution to the conflict. According to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, the Hiroshima government referred to the war in Gaza in its invitation to Israel, urging the country to cease its offensive. The invitation said it was \u201cdeeply regrettable that the lives and everyday existences of many people are being taken away,\u201d Kyodo reported. Palestinians not invited The bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and Nagasaki three days later led to Japan\u2019s unconditional surrender and brought an end to World War II. But it also killed tens of thousands of people, both instantly and in the months and years to come due to radiation sickness. Every year, diplomats in Japan are invited to Hiroshima to join the commemoration that highlights the importance of peace and cautions against the use of nuclear weapons. But while some advocacy\u00a0groups urged Hiroshima to shun Israel, others supported its presence. \u201cAs a city of international peace, Hiroshima city needs to invite all nations, regardless of whether they are at war or not,\u201d said Kunihiko Sakuma, president of Hiroshima Hidankyo, an atomic bomb survivors\u2019 advocacy group. However,\u00a0the Permanent General Mission of Palestine in Tokyo complained on social platform X that it had not been invited to the ceremony. \u201cThis decision is a double standard,\u201d it said. Its envoy was never invited to the ceremony, the office told CNN. Hiroshima authorities said they only send invitations to countries with embassies in Japan and have never invited Palestinian representatives to the ceremony. At a news conference last week, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa reiterated Japan\u2019s support for a two-state solution. \u201cWe continue to comprehensively consider the recognition of Palestinian statehood, taking into account how to advance the peace process,\u201d she said.

The World Food Programme said in a post on X Thursday: \u201cMany distribution points have had to shut down. Only a few bakeries remain operational. We urgently need increased deliveries of food and greater capacity to deliver hot meals.\u201d A spate of evacuation orders issued\u00a0 by the Israel Defense Forces in late June and earlier this month increased the number of people displaced in Gaza from 1.7 million to 1.9 million, according to a UN assessment. The WFP says it has\u00a0provided more than 600,000 people in Gaza with food assistance this month, and more than 500,000 people with food parcels and wheat flour. But the agency also reported having to further cut rations in central and southern Gaza to ensure broader coverage for people who have been newly displaced. \u201cWFP still needs to deliver more fuel to the bakeries and other services, so they can provide emergency support to displaced families,\u201d it said. \u201cBasic commodities are available in markets in southern and central Gaza \u2013 but are unaffordable for many people \u2013 the shortage of commercial goods means food is sold at astronomical prices.\u201d On Wednesday, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that the Israeli military had stopped all aid missions from going north of Wadi Gaza into central Gaza. \u201cThis means humanitarian workers were unable to reach any of the hundreds of thousands of people in need. It also made it impossible for them to collect supplies from the northern entry point of Erez West,\u201d it said. The Israeli agency in charge of coordinating the movement of aid convoys in Gaza, COGAT, told CNN it was unaware of any halt to the movement of convoys from the south of Gaza into northern areas through Wadi Gaza. Gaza\u2019s health sector remains under great stress. According to the World Health Organization, 15 of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals are partially functional, and 1,500 of the usual 3,500 hospital beds in Gaza are available \u2013 600 of them in field hospitals. Both the International Red Cross and the Gaza Health Ministry underlined the challenges to providing health care on Thursday. \u201cThe ambulance and emergency system is no longer able to respond to all calls and missions to transport the wounded and injured,\u201d the Health Ministry said because of a lack of ambulances, the arrest of paramedics by the IDF and a lack of gasoline. The Health Ministry said that primary health care was affected by shortages of about 60% of basic medications, as well as damage to many health centers, especially in Khan Younis in the south. It said infectious diseases continued to spread and had affected some 1.7 million people, and there was a shortage of blood units. One of the field hospitals under pressure is run by the International Committee for the Red Cross in Rafah, which is at capacity after \u201crepeated large-scale casualties,\u201d the ICRC Said Thursday, noting that a Saturday attack in Al-Mawasi resulted in children requiring treatment for shrapnel wounds. \u201cThe number of patients who had to be resuscitated after the large influx of injured on Saturday is inconceivable,\u201d said the ICRC\u2019s Dr. Pankaj Jhaldiyal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/middleeast/un-gaza-evacuation-displacement-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

Some parts of the country have seen more tornado reports than others, with clusters appearing in the Midwest and other places in regions of the country prone to storms, according to a CNN analysis that counts them within a 25-mile hexagonal grid across the contiguous United States. In addition to property damage caused each year by destructive winds, storms also are responsible for many deaths annually, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a federal agency that tracks severe weather events. Since 1991, nearly 70 people have been killed by them each year on average. That figure is inflated somewhat by 2011, when one of the costliest and deadliest tornado outbreaks ever recorded claimed the lives of at least 553 people, including more than 150 in one Missouri storm alone.", "source": "http://cnn.com/weather/us-tornado-tracker-maps-charts-dg/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_tech_google-wiz-acquisition", "text": "Google owner Alphabet is in advanced discussions to buy fast-growing cybersecurity startup Wiz for roughly $23 billion, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. A takeover of Wiz, which makes cybersecurity software for cloud computing, would represent a major bet by Google on cybersecurity, marking the tech giant\u2019s biggest-ever acquisition. Discussions between Google and Wiz began after the startup raised $1 billion from venture capital investors earlier this year, the source said. Terms of a potential deal have not been finalized and talks could still collapse, according to the source. News of the Google-Wiz talks was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Neither Google nor Wiz returned CNN\u2019s requests for comment. The deal would easily surpass Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola for $12.5 billion about a decade ago, the biggest takeover in company history. Google offloaded Motorola just two years later for a massive loss. A $23 billion price tag on Wiz is nearly double the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. In March 2022, Alphabet bought cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion as part of its efforts to help companies better address cyber threats and bolster its cloud computing business. Google Cloud is central to the company\u2019s efforts to diversity revenue beyond its core search advertising business. Although its cloud sales have grown, it has struggled to compete with similar services from Microsoft\u00a0and Amazon. Buying Wiz would be a \u201cshot across the bow\u201d at Microsoft and Amazon, showing that Google is making a \u201cmajor bet on the cyber security space to complement its flagship offering in the cloud,\u201d Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at\u00a0Wedbush, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Cloud security has become especially important in recent years as companies have spent heavily to move data to cloud platforms. Just last week, AT&T revealed that nearly all of its wireless customers\u2019 call and text records were exposed in a massive breach caused by an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform. The Google-Wiz deal talks come despite intense antitrust scrutiny under the Biden administration of tech giants. However, that antitrust scrutiny could be dialed back somewhat if Trump once again takes hold of the White House, Ives said, making the Federal Trade Commission \u201cmuch weaker\u201d and sparking an \u201caccelerated merger and acquisition environment to take place for Big Tech.\u201d If the acquisition gets finalized and closes, it would mark a massive exit for Wiz and its founders \u2014 Assaf Rappaport, Ami Luttwak, Yinon Costica and Roy Reznik. The four executives met years ago when they were drafted into Unit 8200, the cyber intelligence division of the Israel Defense Forces. Since starting up in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York City-based Wiz has enjoyed explosive growth. Today, the company says 40% of Fortune 100 companies are its clients. Notable customers include BMW, Slack and Salesforce, and it works with major cloud companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Google.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/tech/google-wiz-acquisition/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

A report by Laboratorio de Paz released Monday said that 48 of those detentions involved people who had provided some type of service to the campaign command of the opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, of the Democratic Unitary Platform. The arrests all took place between July 4 and 14 and most were in the state of T\u00e1chira, according to the report.

CNN has contacted Venezuela\u2019s Public Ministry and the National Electoral Council for comment. Critics of President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government have long\u00a0accused it\u00a0of rigging votes and silencing the opposition, with the 2018 election that returned Maduro to office described as illegitimate by an alliance of 14 Latin American nations, Canada and the United States. This time around, two opposition candidates \u2013 Maria Corina Machado and Corina Yoris \u2013 have been barred from running despite Maduro\u2019s pledge to the United States that he would hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief. Two days after Laboratorio\u2019s report came out, Machado said in a post on X that her security chief had been arrested on Wednesday. Machado said her security chief Milciades \u00c1vila was \u201ckidnapped by the Maduro regime and accused of gender violence against some women.\u201d The opposition leader said the women who accuse \u00c1vila of gender violence tried to \u201cattack\u201d her and opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia in a restaurant last Saturday. \u201cThere are dozens of witnesses and videos that demonstrate that this was a planned provocation to leave us without protection 11 days before July 28,\u201d Machado wrote.

The election is scheduled to take place on July 28. Ten candidates are in the running, including the incumbent Maduro, who aspires to re-election for six more years after 11 years in power. Maduro\u2019s main opponent is Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, who represents an alliance bringing together the main opposition parties and leaders in Venezuela.

{"id": "2024_07_16_middleeast_oman-mosque-shooting-intl-latam", "text": "The jihadist ISIS group has claimed responsibility for an attack on a Shiite-Muslim mosque in the Gulf Arab state of Oman that killed six people Monday evening. The Sunni-Muslim Islamist group said in a statement late on Tuesday that three of its \u201csuicide attackers\u201d fired on worshippers at the mosque and exchanged gunfire with Omani security forces until morning, Reuters reported. The group also published what it said was a video of the attack on the Telegram  messaging app. The incident has shocked a country that avoided the sectarian violence that gripped some Middle Eastern states, including some of Oman\u2019s oil-rich neighbors, after ISIS declared a state in Iraq and Syria a decade ago and sought to expand throughout the Arabian Peninsula. The group considers Shiites heretics. The Royal Oman Police said on Tuesday that nine people were killed in the shooting in the capital Muscat\u2019s Wadi al-Kabir district, including the three perpetrators and a policeman. More than two dozen people of various nationalities were injured, including four Omani first responders, the police said. It didn\u2019t identify a motive for the attack or reveal the identity of the attackers. The attack took place at the Imam Ali mosque, according to video obtained by Reuters and geolocated by CNN, during Ashura, the 10th day of the Islamic month of Muharram, which holds particular significance for Shiite Muslims. The oil-producing nation is one of the most stable in the Middle East and is becoming an emerging regional tourism destination as the government promotes the sector to diversify its economy away from hydrocarbons. Sectarian harmony Unlike the rest of the Sunni-ruled Gulf states, Oman follows the Ibadi sect of Islam but has a sizable Sunni population and a small but influential Shiite minority. Religious and political leaders often emphasize sectarian harmony and religious tolerance as key to the country\u2019s stability. About 57% of the country\u2019s population of five million are expatriates, many of whom are Hindu or Christian. Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday that four Pakistanis were among the dead. Another 30 Pakistanis were injured and currently receiving treatment in hospital, the ministry added. It condemned the incident as a \u201cdastardly terrorist attack.\u201d \u201cWe are heartened that the government of Oman has neutralized the attackers,\u201d the ministry said. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X Tuesday that he had been \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the incident. \u201cMy heart goes out to the families of the victims. I have instructed the Pakistan Embassy in Muscat to extend all possible assistance to the injured and visit the hospitals personally,\u201d he wrote. One Indian citizen was killed and another injured, India\u2019s embassy in Muscat announced in a post on X Tuesday. The US embassy in Muscat issued a security alert for US citizens, advising them to \u201cremain vigilant, monitor local news and heed directions of local authorities.\u201d It said visa appointments scheduled for Tuesday would be canceled as a safety precaution.

{"id": "2024_07_13_europe_paris-olympics-sex-education-pleasure-spt-intl", "text": "The City of Love has a message as it prepares for the Olympics: Performance is not always the priority. Rather, when it comes to sex, pleasure takes first place. As Paris starts welcoming athletes to the Olympic Village in the coming days, organizers of the 2024 Games are set to launch a comprehensive sexual health campaign that champions pleasure and consent as well as the traditional emphasis on safety. It is an important message, backed by research, that is rarely endorsed on a stage with a global spotlight as influential as the Olympics. Prioritizing pleasure in sexual health refers to the approach of celebrating the physical and mental benefits of sexual experiences as well as minimizing the risks. It aims to rewrite fear and shame narratives that cast sex as taboo, with sexual health organizations promoting the sex-positive method as fundamental for unlocking greater agency over sexual rights and well-being. A systematic review by the World Health Organization and advocacy group The Pleasure Project found that pleasure-inclusive sex education is a more effective sexual health intervention strategy than abstinence programs and risk-focused messaging. The findings show that it increases condom usage and enhances knowledge and self-esteem, which are crucial to promoting safer choices in the bedroom. The decision to focus on pleasure-inclusive messaging at the Olympics is especially significant at a time when sex education is increasingly under attack in many countries. In the United States alone, 2024 has seen a surge in restrictive state-level sex education proposals that aim to limit what can be taught in the classroom, such as by removing guidance around contraception or advocating for abstinence. History of Sex Ed at the Olympics Paris\u2019s focus on pleasure and consent is part of the Olympics\u2019 long-running history of promoting safe sex, with organizers of the 1988 Seoul Games first making headline-grabbing hand-outs of condoms to competitors to raise awareness of HIV and AIDS. Since then, the International Olympic Committee has encouraged host cities to roll out condom initiatives at all summer and winter games, from a record-breaking 450,000 condoms at the 2016 Rio Olympics - equivalent to 42 per athlete - to keeping up the tradition at the 2022 Beijing Olympics despite COVID-19 social distancing rules. This year, organizers in charge of first aid announced that over 200,000 male condoms, 20,000 female condoms, and 10,000 dental dams would be made available at the Paris Olympic Village, which will host around 14,500 athletes. They will also have numerous sexual health testing centers on site for athletes, in addition to the sexual health awareness messaging. While one athlete - a gold medallist - once suggested sex was \u201c\u200b\u200bpart of the Olympic spirit \u2026 Why do you think they give away so many condoms?\u201d the massive number of condoms distributed is not just a reflection of the competitors\u2019 extra-athletic activities. Instead, the initiatives are intended to be used as a springboard for sex education. Anne Philpott is the founder of The Pleasure Project, an international organization that has spent the past two decades advocating for pleasure-inclusive sex education. She applauds Paris\u2019 decision to pair its condom initiative with pleasure and consent messaging. \u201cSo far the public health world has not done a good job of promoting safe sex,\u201d Philpott said, explaining that promoting condoms \u201cpurely for avoiding negative consequences,\u201d is not effective. Rather, she says the most productive way to encourage safe sex is to flip the script from the beginning by focusing on why people have sex. \u201cPeople think pleasure is a bit frivolous or the icing on the cake. But we now know that if we had integrated pleasure considerations into sexual health interventions from the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, we would have saved considerably more lives,\u201d Philpott explained. Philpott told CNN that the need to shift the narrative in safe sex conversations is as urgent as ever. She says if there is a failure to do so, people could instead shape their opinions from the misinformation and harmful explicit content running rampant online. \u201cThere\u2019s been a big rise in choking being seen as a normal part of sexual activity when it\u2019s actually very dangerous,\u201d Philpott gave as an example, as she urged sex education curriculums to catch up with what people are able to access online. Turning sport into a sex ed classroom The need to learn about one\u2019s sexual desires, needs, and boundaries is a constantly evolving process, with the Olympics\u2019 spotlight on safe sex also highlighting the opportunity for wider sporting communities to become trusted spaces for such conversations. In the coastal town of Kilifi in Kenya, Deogratia Okoko sees the value of expanding sex education beyond the classroom, using soccer to teach young boys about issues such as consent and contraception. The scheme to which he contributes, known as \u201cMoving The Goalposts,\u201d works directly with community leaders, fathers, and young boys to provide resources on sexual health, sexual rights, gender, and positive masculinity. \u201cWe found that one of the places that they spend a lot of their time is the football pitch,\u201d Okoko said. \u201cWe began to design our sessions based on soccer drills to explain certain issues,\u201d Okoko said, adding: \u201cYou\u2019ll find that sometimes they get so engrossed in the debrief discussions that they forget that they were supposed to actually train and play.\u201d Okoko explained that the initiative also provides a safe space for boys to access condoms and HIV testing kits, with societal shame often creating barriers for boys to buy these products directly from the shops. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just let\u2019s play football, let\u2019s practice and go away \u2026 these spaces are now a community used by them to talk about issues that they\u2019d not normally talk about,\u201d Okoko said. \u201cOne of the things that really came clearly to me was how using this strategy helped in mental health,\u201d Okoko told CNN. \u201cThey feel like they can talk about anything, if there\u2019s a challenge that they\u2019re going through, they come to the pitch.\u201d Reflecting on the Paris organizers\u2019 decision to include pleasure and consent in their sexual health messaging, Okoko says it is \u201cimperative\u201d to have high-profile platforms set the example. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental. It\u2019s important. It\u2019s good if we, to the best of our abilities, find great ways of passing that message across,\u201d Okoko said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/13/europe/paris-olympics-sex-education-pleasure-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

If Monday\u2019s bid had been successful, the tiny West African country would have been the first in the world to relegalize FGM after criminalizing it. MP Amadou Camara, who chairs a joint health and gender committee that recommended that FGM should remain outlawed, told CNN that none of the clauses seeking the repeal of the ban in the Women\u2019s (Amendment) Bill 2024 was passed. Parliament Speaker Fabakary Jatta\u00a0ruled that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for the bill, which passed a second reading four months ago, to be read a third time and to pass without those clauses. \u201cI so rule that the bill is rejected, and the legislative process exhausted,\u201d Jatta said at plenary meeting Monday. FGM was prohibited in Gambia in 2015 by former president Yahya Jammeh who authorized the\u00a0imposition of fines and prison sentences\u00a0of up to three years for individuals who engaged in it. The law also punished perpetrators with life sentences in cases where the practice led to death. Pro-Islamic groups and lawmakers pushed back against the criminalization, saying that female circumcision was \u201cone of the virtues of Islam.\u201d Other prominent Gambians, such as opposition leader and former interior minister Mai Ahmad Fatty also defended the practice, arguing that: \u201cThere is no FGM in Gambia. We circumcise, not mutilate.\u201d Human rights organization Amnesty International earlier described efforts to revoke the FGM ban as a \u201cbackward move\u201d for the protection of human rights in the country. In Gambia, 73% of women aged between 15 and 49 years had experienced FGM as of 2020, according to the United Nations. More than 65% of those women were subjected to the practice \u201cbefore the age of five years,\u201d the UN said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Women\u2019s Day in March that he was \u201coutraged\u201d by moves by Gambia\u2019s parliament to legalize FGM, describing the practice as \u201chorrific.\u201d Despite the ban, FGM has still been performed on children in parts of the country. Last year, three women were convicted of performing the practice on eight female minors\u00a0and ordered to pay fines of around 15,000 Gambian Dalasi ($220) each or face a one-year jail sentence.

He grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, and moved to the US aged 18 on a scholarship. After studying structural engineering at Princeton, he got a Master\u2019s in architecture. After that, Jan worked in the US for nine years and had no intention of leaving until he received a job offer as a senior designer working on the Emirates Towers office and hotel complex. Now aged 61, he said that he never planned to stay in the UAE for so long, now having spent 28 years in Dubai. \u201cI got carried away with the excitement here,\u201d he said. As for the Ciel Tower \u2014 named for the French word for sky \u2014 Jan hopes that it will come to be seen as timeless, like the Empire State Building or the Chrysler Building in New York City. \u201cThe reason I like the fact that it\u2019s called Ciel is because I believe in our own lives the sky is the limit, and that\u2019s the case certainly in my own life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a chance to grow, to do things that I didn\u2019t think I would get a chance to do. So it\u2019s been amazing.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/ciel-tower-dubai-yahya-jan-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_12_europe_finland-law-block-migrants-russia-intl", "text": "Finland\u2019s parliament passed a law on Friday granting border guards the power to block asylum seekers crossing from Russia, after more than 1,300 people arrived in the country, forcing Helsinki to close its border. Finland has accused neighboring Russia of weaponizing migration by encouraging scores of migrants from countries such as Syria and Somalia to cross the border, an assertion the Kremlin denies. Helsinki believes Moscow is promoting the crossings in retaliation for Finland joining NATO, which backs Ukraine against Russia\u2019s invasion. The right-wing government of Prime Minister Petteri Orpo has said the bill is vital to stop future arrivals, despite the law being at odds with Finland\u2019s international human rights commitments. \u201cThis is a strong message to Russia, a strong message to our allies, that Finland takes care of its own security, we take care of the security of the EU border,\u201d Orpo told a press conference after the vote. More than 1,300 asylum seekers crossed over from Russia since last summer but there had been no new arrivals since March until Thursday. The Finnish Border Guard released a statement after the parliament vote saying one person had crossed the border illegally on Thursday and when caught by a border guard, applied for asylum. Finland shut its land borders with Russia late last year. Interior Minister Mari Rantanen told the press conference after the bill passed that no decision had been taken on when to re-open the border crossings with Russia. Finland\u2019s move is similar to steps taken in recent years in other European countries, including Poland and Lithuania, to make it more difficult for migrants to cross the border from Russia and Russia-ally Belarus. The Finnish bill was passed with 167 votes in favor, 31 against and one abstention. To pass, the proposal needed a two-thirds majority of given votes in the 200-seat parliament. Orpo urged migrants who were considering coming to Europe through Russia not to embark on the journey. \u201cDon\u2019t go with the smugglers,\u201d he told the news conference. \u201cFinland takes care of its borders. The access to the borders orchestrated by Russia will not lead to access to Finland or Europe.\u201d Moscow has denied such an intention.

The extraordinary move comes after months of speculation that Trong\u2019s health was weakening. The party did not clarify what treatment he is receiving. Lam, a former head of internal security, has been widely seen as a top candidate to replace Trong when his term ends in 2026.

Hundreds of cities in nearly every US state \u2013 including parts of Alaska and Hawaii \u2013 are on track for one of their 10-warmest summers on record. About 100 of these cities are enduring their hottest start to summer on record. The deadly heat has not been unexpected. Forecasters have been warning of a searing\u00a0summer for months due to the troubling combination of a budding La Ni\u00f1a and a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Last summer was the warmest on record globally and one of the warmest for several states. But so far, this summer has felt even worse for many in the US. Extreme heat has baked almost all of the\u00a0Lower 48 so far this summer, but the worst of it has concentrated in the East Coast states and West. Average daily temperatures \u2013 calculated by taking the average of each day\u2019s high and low \u2013 have soared several degrees above normal for hundreds of cities since June 1. These temperatures are a more complete indicator of how hot the season has been, as they factor in both hotter days and warmer nights. Summer nights in the US have been warming nearly twice as fast as summer days since records began in the late 1800s, according to data from NOAA. Warmer nights increase the danger of heat by compounding heat stress through a reduction in the amount of time the body has to cool down naturally. Las Vegas is experiencing its hottest summer on record and holds the top spot in the entire country. Many of the cities experiencing the most exceptional summer heat are in the West, notably in or near California\u2019s Central Valley. Searing heat there has been relentless since it started in early June. On the opposite coast, a historic mid-June heat wave has only been spelled by brief bouts of relief. Dozens of cities from New England to the Mid-Atlantic are experiencing their hottest start to the summer on record, including Washington, DC, which just smashed a high temperature record Tuesday when it hit 104 degrees. Some of the most abnormal heat in the region is focused in New England and New York state. The\u00a0South has also sweltered under more than its fair share of historic heat so far this summer.\u00a0Atlanta and Tampa, Florida, are both on pace to record their hottest summer on record.\u00a0For some locations in the region, it\u2019s the second consecutive year summer has had a blistering start. Last summer ended up quite warm for the Lower 48, but the worst heat was confined to the Gulf Coast. By mid-July last summer, the season was pacing as one of the warmest on record for cities nearest the coast, including cities like New Orleans, Houston and Brownsville, Texas. But in other parts of the country, last summer was downright cool compared to this year\u2019s extreme heat. Washington, DC, is currently on track to record its hottest summer on record, but it was only the 44th-warmest summer by this time last year. Sacramento, California, is experiencing its hottest start to summer on record. But this time last year California\u2019s capital city was experiencing is 62nd-warmest summer. Forecasts for the rest of the season aren\u2019t cool, either. Despite some upcoming brief periods of respite, much of the Lower 48 is expected to endure above-average temperatures through August and into September, according to the Climate Prediction Center.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/weather/summer-heat-temperatures-us-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_asia_japan-chikan-groping-trains-survey-intl-hnk", "text": "One in 10 young people in Japan \u2013 the vast majority women \u2013 have been groped on trains and in other public places, a government survey has found, highlighting an often unreported crime that has long plagued the country despite official efforts to fight it. \u201cChikan\u201d \u2014 touching or groping without consent in public places, typically on crowded trains \u2014 is a widespread problem in Japan, where extensive rail networks transport millions of passengers each day, often in packed carriages during hectic rush hours. In a nationwide poll of more than 36,000 people aged 16 to 29 by the Cabinet Office in February, 10.5% of respondents said they had been groped or experienced other indecent acts in public. Women accounted for nearly 90% of those who said they were assaulted, according to the survey released this month. About two-thirds of those respondents said the offense took place aboard a train, with a similar amount saying it occurred during the morning or evening rush hour. Many of those respondents also said they had been groped on multiple occasions, with one person saying they were assaulted \u201calmost daily\u201d while still in high school. \u201cFor some reason, I cry more now when I remember it than when it happened,\u201d they told the survey. Efforts to tackle chikan picked up at the turn of the century, when major cities like Tokyo began rolling out women-only carriages on trains. In recent years, more surveillance cameras have been installed on trains and in stations and transit police \u2013 both in uniform and plain clothes \u2013 have stepped up patrols. Wider efforts to combat the crime include the sale of \u201canti-groping\u201d stamps to mark assailants with invisible ink, and mobile apps that map groping incidents. Meanwhile, posters at stations aim to raise awareness of groping and urge people to report the crime. But some survey respondents urged authorities to do more. \u201cI would like the government to create a society that prevents crime, to offer mental health care for victims by professionals, and to carry out public relations activities to raise public awareness so that victims are not taken lightly,\u201d one respondent wrote. Japan arrested nearly 2,000 people nationwide on suspicion of chikan\u00a0in 2023, according to police statistics. But many offenses go unreported: 80% of survey respondents who said they were groped did not report the crimes to police or other officials \u2013 with many saying they did not register the gravity of what happened to them or did not think it was worth alerting the authorities. \u201cWe need to continue to educate people that molestation is a serious crime,\u201d a Japanese government spokesperson told CNN, adding that public groping should always be reported. \u201cPlease do not worry alone, but consult with us,\u201d the spokesperson said. Jeffrey Hall, a Japanese studies lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies in Chiba, said the survey results appear \u201csurprisingly low.\u201d \u201cYou talk to any Japanese women and they will tell you it\u2019s very common,\u201d he said. Many chikan survivors fear reporting the crime could create trouble for co-workers or school staff, he added. They may also be discouraged by the perception of a lengthy police process for a crime that is hard to prove and for which perpetrators often get away with light punishment, Hall said. \u201cOverall there is a sense of resignation and disappointment that authorities haven\u2019t been able to stop that from happening,\u201d he said.

{"id": "2024_07_12_india_india-godmen-crowd-crush-bhole-baba-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "The devotees rushed to collect soil from the ground the man had just walked on, thousands thronging to the front of a venue densely crammed with a quarter of a million people, under stifling heat. But one by one, many began falling onto the muddy field and into a sewer nearby, crushing each other as panicked screams pierced the air. They had arrived to receive spiritual enlightenment, but 121 people \u2013 mostly women \u2013 were killed by the crowd crush in northern India\u2019s Uttar Pradesh state last week. Those who survived were left scarred and traumatized. The man they had come to see was known to his disciples as Bhole Baba, a self-styled Hindu spiritual leader worshipped by many as a living god. And he is among dozens of spiritual gurus in the country who inspire devotion in millions of followers, have the ear of the Indian elite, and rake in colossal sums of money. While the world\u2019s most populous nation has long produced self-styled \u201cgodmen\u201d, the tradition has, over the last few decades, evolved into a multimillion-dollar industry, whose biggest stars control vast philanthropic and business empires. A large chunk of their money comes from their followers\u2019 donations. They are widely revered in a country where religion and faith dictate much of society \u2013 with some even winning endorsement from the highest echelons of society. But that industry occasionally finds itself mired in controversy, with several holy men either convicted or accused of a range of crimes \u2013 from financial fraud to murder and rape \u2013 alarming those who cast doubt on their divine personas. \u201cIt\u2019s a question we\u2019ve long asked,\u201d said Meera Nanda, author of \u201cThe God Market: How Globalization is Making India More Hindu.\u201d \u201cWhat brings literally millions of poor, desperate people to these godmen?\u201d A sense of belonging Subhash Lal was working as a security guard nearly 200 kilometers (124 miles) from Mughal Garhi village, where Bhole Baba was delivering his sermon, when the news flashed across his TV screen. Lal\u2019s mother, a devout follower of the guru, was among the crowd, and he was desperate for answers. Lal and his family rushed to the hospital that was treating the survivors, when his son learned of the devastating news. \u201cHe told me, Dad, your mother is no more,\u201d the 48-year-old said. \u201cMy mother believed in (Bhole Baba). I couldn\u2019t tell her anything. She would attend these functions\u2026 she believed in him. What could I do?\u201d People like Lal\u2019s mother \u2013 poor and on the lower rungs of India\u2019s hierarchical caste system \u2013 make up the bulk of Bhole Baba\u2019s following. They are predominantly Dalit women from India\u2019s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, where religion holds particular sway. And for them, a sense of devotion to these godmen is a way to be seen and heard within the Hindu religion. Despite being outlawed in 1950, the caste system, which categorizes Hindus at birth and once forced the so-called \u201cuntouchables\u201d or Dalits to the margins of society, is still omnipresent in the daily lives of millions across the nation. Policeman turned preacher Reportedly born Narayan Sakar to a low-caste family, Bhole Baba used to be a constable with the Uttar Pradesh Police before becoming a preacher and establishing an ashram \u2013 or place of worship \u2013 in the state. Sitting on an ornately decorated chair, he often delivers impassioned sermons exhorting his followers to maintain their devotion. \u201cIf, through the medium of truth, you remove old trash from within you, and today if you let truth into your heart, devotion for the god into your heart, humanity into your heart\u2026 then know that even if the world abuses you, you will not get affected by it at all,\u201d he can be heard saying in one of his speeches. The \u201crigidity of caste structure\u201d is an important reason for the proliferation of godmen, said K. Kalyani, an assistant professor of Sociology at Azim Premji University, Bangalore. \u201cThe low-caste community are particularly debarred within Hindu religion to have respectable position within religious institutions,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir presence in the sanctum sanctorum as priest or their proximity to deity is seen as an act of defilement due to practices of \u2018untouchability\u2019.\u201d In the absence of religious and spiritual gratification for low-caste Hindus, Kalyani said, an \u201calternative form of religiosity becomes inevitable.\u201d Sheetal Jatav, a survivor of last week\u2019s Bhole Baba event, said her community \u2013 the lower-caste Jatavs \u2013 \u201cbelieve in him immensely,\u201d hanging his pictures on their walls or even placing it inside small temples at home. Jatav said she was previously unable to get pregnant but conceived within two months of visiting Bole Baba\u2019s ashram. \u201cThere are many similar stories like this here,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cHe speaks of good things and wants all of us to do good deeds. We go there and feel peace.\u201d Miracle workers The gurus India has produced range from men who claim they can perform miracles, like the revered Sathya Sai Baba, to the yoga guru and founder of the widely popular Art of Living foundation, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. Claiming to possess mystical knowledge and the ability to cure illness and solve problems, godmen inspire remarkable fervor in their millions of followers. But with their rise has come a slew of criticism over the true intentions behind this perceived divinity, fueled in recent decades by their grandiose lifestyles and immense wealth. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, head of the spiritual organization Dera Sacha Sauda, is another self-styled spiritual guru revered by millions. His group has ashrams across 10 states and union territories in India and claims to have 60 million followers worldwide. He is also a convicted killer and rapist. In 2017 he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for raping two of his followers. Two years later, he received a life term for the murder of a journalist who exposed the sexual abuse of women within his group. Despite the severity of his crimes, Singh maintains a cult-like following. The rape conviction even sparked riots by his supporters that left 36 people dead and hundreds injured across northern India. Since then, Singh has been granted parole multiple times, once even walking out of prison to attend his own birthday party, raising allegations of impunity for these holy men. \u201cThey have deep connections with the political machine\u2026 and it\u2019s deeply problematic,\u201d Nanda, the author, said. The furor over Singh\u2019s case was reminiscent of violent skirmishes that broke out in 2013 after the arrest of guru Asaram Bapu for raping a 16-year-old girl. He was convicted five years later and given a life sentence for the crime. Famous followers Many godmen are also known for their philanthropy, praised for building schools for the impoverished and developing infrastructure in small villages \u2013 and they also attract millions of people to small towns across the country. Sathya Sai Baba\u2019s followers, for example, included the US actor Goldie Hawn and Hard Rock Cafe founder Isaac Tigrett. When the guru died in 2011, Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar openly wept at his funeral, which was also attended by India\u2019s prime minister at the time, Manmohan Singh. More often than not, the most devout of their followers come from the lower middle classes, but millions in donations also stream in from foreigners, Indians living abroad, and the richest of society. While Sathya Sai Baba\u2019s appeal was \u2013 in large part \u2013 due to a certain level of mystique, other godmen, including Singh, are more outspoken, carefully using the media to fuel their rise. \u201cThere is an entire media structure that supports and promotes them,\u201d said Kalyani, the sociologist. \u201cThere are dedicated channels like Astha or Sanskar TV which have dedicated time to show their preachings.\u201d As authorities investigate the organizers of last week\u2019s event for alleged negligence, Bhole Baba, who left the event in an armored vehicle, is not being pursued by authorities. Many of those affected by the tragedy are angry. \u201cThis is not a real (godman),\u201d said Surendra Singh, whose wife was a devout follower of the guru, and died in the tragic crowd crush. Speaking to India\u2019s largest news agency, ANI, Bhole Baba, appearing forlorn, said: \u201cThis incident has left me distraught.\u201d \u201cMischief makers and anti-social elements responsible for the stampede will not be spared.\u201d Referring to himself by his birth name, he added: \u201cMay the praise of Narayan Sakar Hari resound forever throughout the universe.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/india/india-godmen-crowd-crush-bhole-baba-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "style_dubai-designs-worlds-greenest-highway-spc", "text": "Not content with Dubai having the tallest building, the deepest pool or the highest hotel, urban design firm URB hopes to add one more superlative feather to the city\u2019s cap: the world\u2019s \u201cgreenest\u201d highway. URB has released conceptual designs for a 64-kilometer-long highway that would see Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road, one of the city\u2019s main traffic belts, transformed into a \u201cGreen Spine,\u201d complete with autonomous, solar-powered trams and smart traffic management. Baharash Bagherian, urban planner and founder of URB, believes the \u201cfirst-of-its-kind project\u201d would make the city\u2019s design more \u201chuman-centric.\u201d \u201cDubai is rapidly expanding, with its population expected to nearly double to 8 million by 2040,\u201d Bagherian told CNN in an email. \u201cThis growth necessitates creativity and innovation to address both current and future challenges.\u201d \u201cWe must view mobility as more than just the movement of people,\u201d he added. Smart tech and solar-power The autonomous solar-powered tram is just one aspect of the proposed highway\u2019s transport system: above the tram line, a network of green areas, parks and overpasses would increase connectivity and walkability of the city, which is currently tough to navigate on foot. The highway would also integrate smart technology, such as \u201cinternet of things\u201d (IoT) sensors, to manage traffic and optimize energy use. Bagherian\u2019s designs allow for 300-megawatt solar panels and a storage system to be embedded in the tracks, that would power the tram line, as well as generate clean energy for an estimated 130,000 homes. And the green spaces \u2014 including parks and community gardens \u2014 would provide space for one million trees, which would also help cool the city and improve air quality. \u2018A unique set of challenges\u2019 Creating the world\u2019s \u201cgreenest\u201d highway in a desert city isn\u2019t easy, though. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) already has one of the world\u2019s highest water consumption rates per capita, consuming around 550 liters per person, per day (compared to an average of 310 liters in the US, 150 liters in Hong Kong, and 144 liters in the European Union). Most of this isn\u2019t used as drinking water, but in agriculture and landscaping, and the country\u2019s green spaces use copious amounts of water. For example, Dubai Miracle Garden \u2014 a 72,000-square-meter park displaying 150 million live flowers \u2014\u00a0consumes 757,000 liters (200,000 US gallons) of water every day. \u201cDubai presents a unique set of challenges: its rapid growth, diverse population, urban sprawl, and extreme climate conditions,\u201d Bagherian said. To combat this, Bagherian\u2019s concept includes \u201cwater-sensitive landscape design\u201d that includes native flora and drought-resistant plants suited to the arid climate, and soil mixed with zeolite, an absorbent crystal that aids water retention. These \u201cpassive techniques\u201d are complemented with smart irrigation technology, he added, \u201cwhich use real-time data to adjust watering schedules based on soil moisture levels, weather forecasts, and plant needs.\u201d An urban utopia This isn\u2019t URB\u2019s first foray into utopian future city design. Its proposal for \u201cDubai Mangroves\u201d \u2014 which it claims will be \u201cworld\u2019s largest coastal regeneration project\u201d if it goes ahead \u2014 was revealed earlier this year, and last year, it also proposed a 93-kilometer indoor cycling \u201csuperhighway\u201d called The Loop that could help residents in the emirate go car-free. Like the Green Spine, none of these designs have been confirmed. But Bagherian says that turning these conceptual designs into a reality isn\u2019t as tough as it looks. \u201cWhen you break down the components of the project, you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s nothing new from a technological, structural, or material standpoint,\u201d he said, adding that the innovation lies in how these technologies are \u201ccreatively and seamlessly integrated to address multiple needs.\u201d The next step involves getting public sector entities onboard, to provide \u201cthe necessary support, regulatory framework, and infrastructure integration to bring this ambitious project to life,\u201d Bagherian said. He\u2019s optimistic that this will happen, as the project aligns with the government\u2019s 2040 Urban Master Plan, and creative urban planning is key to fulfilling those goals. \u201cDubai is uniquely positioned to make this project a reality,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/dubai-designs-worlds-greenest-highway-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Munich Olympics are infamous as the event in which 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage and murdered by the Palestinian terror group known as \u201cBlack September.\u201d The controversy centered around\u00a0the German sportswear company\u2019s choice of model Bella Hadid\u00a0to front the campaign. Hadid, who was born in 1996, is Palestinian-American and has been a prominent advocate for Palestinian relief efforts. Adidas then\u00a0seemingly deleted any social media posts featuring her after criticism from Jewish groups and Israel. Adidas\u2019 decision to remove Hadid from its social media feeds was then, in turn, criticized by pro-Palestinian voices for silencing people of Palestinian heritage, and for appearing to retaliate against Hadid on the basis of her heritage. CNN cannot independently verify Adidas\u2019 posts but screenshots of them have been widely circulated, including by the state of Israel\u2019s official X account, while a picture of Hadid remains on Adidas\u2019 website promoting the sneakers. Hadid\u2019s representatives have not yet responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Hadid hasn\u2019t publicly commented about the controversy on her social media accounts, though she recently posted a photo of herself \u2013 uncaptioned \u2013 standing in front of an Adidas billboard, wearing one of the sportswear manufacturer\u2019s tops. \u201cWe are conscious that connections have been made to tragic historical events \u2013 though these are completely unintentional \u2013 and we apologize for any upset or distress caused,\u201d a spokesperson for Adidas said in a statement sent to CNN on Friday. \u201cAs a result we are revising the remainder of the campaign. We believe in sport as a unifying force around the world and will continue our efforts to champion diversity and equality in everything we do,\u201d the company added. Hadid, whose father is Palestinian-American real-estate developer Mohamed Hadid, has frequently spoken out about violence against Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza. In October last year, Bella Hadid wrote in a statement posted to Instagram: \u201cMy heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood,\u201d referencing those killed by Israeli airstrikes and military operations in Gaza \u2013 now more than 38,000 people in total, according to the enclave\u2019s Ministry of Health. \u201cI mourn for the Israeli families that have been dealing with the pain and aftermath of October 7,\u201d she added, referencing the day when Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostage. For the American Jewish Committee, choosing a \u201cvocal anti-Israel model to recall this dark Olympics is either a massive oversight or intentionally inflammatory.\u201d \u201cNeither is acceptable,\u201d it added in a post on X. The group did not provide evidence or detail for its allegation that Hadid was \u201canti-Israel.\u201d Meanwhile, Jonathan Greenblatt \u2013 the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League \u2013 wrote in his own post on the platform that Hadid\u2019s involvement in the campaign is a \u201cserious misjudgement that dishonors the victims\u201d of the 1972 terrorist attack. However, journalist Mehdi Hasan took issue with this line of criticism against Adidas and Hadid. \u201cBella Hadid has absolutely nothing in common with the 1972 terrorists \u2013 other than the fact that she is Palestinian,\u201d Hasan posted on X. \u201cBlaming people for the crimes of others who share their race or ethnicity is pure racism & bigotry,\u201d he added. When contacted by CNN to respond to this critique, an AJC spokesperson said its \u201ccriticism of Adidas making Bella Hadid one of the faces of this campaign has nothing to do with her ethnicity but her history of anti-Israel and antisemitic comments,\u201d without providing evidence for these allegations.

A second round six-over 77 at Royal Troon in Scotland on Friday improved upon an opening 79, but left the 48-year-old well short of the projected cut line for the top-70 players at 14-over par overall. It ties the three-time Open champion\u2019s highest ever 36-hole score of his major career, according to golf statistician Justin Ray, shot at the US Open in 2015 \u2013 the only previous season he had missed three consecutive cuts at the sport\u2019s four flagship events. \u201cJust was fighting it pretty much all day,\u201d Woods, who finished 60th at the Masters in April before failing to make the weekend at both the PGA Championship and US Open, told reporters. \u201cI never really hit it close enough to make birdies and consequently made a lot of bogeys.\u201d Signing off with par, Woods was given a standing ovation as crowds swarmed behind the ropes to get a last glimpse of him at Royal Troon, yet the 15-time major winner insisted it would not be his final Open. Woods \u2013 who is automatically qualified for the tournament as a result of his victories in 2000, 2005 and 2006 \u2013 said he will \u201cdefinitely\u201d be returning for next year\u2019s 153rd edition of the major at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland, in what would be his 24th outing at the event. The 82-time PGA Tour winner had arrived at Royal Troon adamant that he will play as long as he feels he can still win, shunning former world No. 2 Colin Montgomerie\u2019s suggestion he should consider retiring. This season marks the first since his 2021 car crash that Woods has competed at all four majors. In February, he had expressed his desire to compete in one tournament a month but \u2013 despite \u201cphysically feeling a lot better\u201d than at the beginning of the year \u2013 has only competed in five official events in 2024. \u201cI loved it. I\u2019ve always loved playing major championships. I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the majors,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cObviously it tests you mentally, physically, emotionally, and I just wasn\u2019t as sharp as I needed to be. I was hoping that I would find it somehow, just never did. \u201cConsequently, my results and scores were pretty high,\u201d Woods, who shot just his sixth career major round of eight over or worse on Thursday, added. Playing partner and May\u2019s PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele, who followed up an opening two-under 69 with a 72, said Thursday he could empathize with Woods\u2019 fight for sharpness. \u201cHe\u2019s making it as hard on himself as possible, and I know he\u2019s hard on himself too,\u201d Schauffele told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s got to learn a little bit more about his body, what he can and can\u2019t do. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d like to prep more at home if his body would allow it \u2026 I know what goes into it and what needs to be done to play at a high level.

The reclusive tribe has been sighted coming out of the rainforest more frequently in recent weeks in search of food, apparently moving away from the growing presence of loggers, said local indigenous rights group FENAMAD. The Mashco Piro were photographed at the end of June on the banks of a river in the Madre de Dios region in southeast Peru near the border with Brazil, Survival International said as it released the photos. \u201cThese incredible images show that a large number of isolated Mashco Piro live alone a few kilometers from where the loggers are about to start their operations,\u201d said Survival International director Caroline Pearce. More than 50 Mashco Piro people appeared in recent days near a village of the Yine people called Monte Salvado. Another group of 17 appeared by the nearby village of Puerto Nuevo, said the NGO, which defends indigenous rights. The Mashco Piro, who inhabit an area located between two natural reserves in Madre de Dios, have seldom appeared as a rule and do not communicate much with the Yine or anyone else, according to Survival International. Several logging companies hold timber concessions inside the territory inhabited by the Mashco Piro. One company, Canales Tahuamanu, has built more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) of roads for its logging trucks to extract timber, according to Survival International. A Canales Tahuamanu representative in Lima did not respond to a request for comment. The company is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, according to which it has 53,000 hectares (131,000 acres) of forests in Madre de Dios to extract cedar and mahogany.

{"id": "2024_07_12_style_dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon", "text": "Pristine, crisp and all-white \u2014 tennis whites have been a tradition dating back centuries. The distinctive look has not only made the racquet sport stand out, it has also become a sartorial mainstay off the courts, too. And even though most of the major tournaments have done away with the hueless uniformity, Wimbledon, the very first of them, has remained strict in its policy (as have many private clubs around the world). The prestigious championship even clamped down on the rule a decade ago, prohibiting colorful accents that had become increasingly common \u2014\u00a0 the year after Roger Federer\u2019s now-infamous pair of orange-soled sneakers were banned after his first round in 2013. The rules once called for \u201cpredominantly white\u201d outfits, allowing some competitors to play with color combinations, such as Serena Williams\u2019 tribute to Wimbledon treat strawberries and cream in 2010. But the crackdown changed the wording to \u201calmost entirely white,\u201d per the organizers: no off-white, no panels of color, no varying colorways on sneakers. The only recent loosening of rules was in 2023, to allow women to wear dark-colored shorts on the court following criticisms that the rules weren\u2019t accommodating for menstruation leaks. But why did tennis whites become the standard? The reasons often cited are practical ones, from heat reflection to sweat-masking. But senior curator Kevin Jones of the ASU Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising (ASU FIDM) Museum in Los Angeles, who organized the recent traveling exhibition \u201cSporting Fashion: Outdoor Girls 1800 - 1960,\u201d said it really comes down to a long history of clubs enforcing social status, starting when lawn tennis skyrocketed in popularity in Victorian-era England as a leisure sport \u2014 and a rare one that allowed women, too. \u201cIt\u2019s completely elitist because white clothes are difficult to maintain,\u201d he said in a phone call with CNN. \u201cAnd the types of materials that these dresses were made of, which were cottons and linens, creased easily, so to keep them nice and freshly starched was also an aspect of that care.\u201d Challenging the rules Of course, tennis style has drastically changed in a century-and-a-half since it first became a recreational sensation for the upper class, hot off the heels of croquet (and utilizing the same neatly trimmed lawns). Early tennis attire was more akin to 19th-century leisurewear: women wore striped and patterned garments with long skirts, corseting and wide-brimmed hats; men donned wool pants, button-downs or sweaters. Because spectators and players have often adhered to similar styles, fashion and tennis have had a \u201cmutual exchange over time, where various tennis trends have seeped into wider culture as well,\u201d said sports journalist Ben Rothenberg, author of \u201cTennis: The Stylish Life\u201d as well as a recent biography on Naomi Osaka. That\u2019s been more than apparent in the past few months as Zendaya turned out a series of tennis-inspired high-fashion red-carpet looks matching the on- and off-court drama of the film \u201cChallengers,\u201d and recently faced Federer in an \u201cair tennis\u201d match for a campaign by the sportswear brand On. The close alignment with fashion has also led to the success of classic tennis-born labels such as Lacoste and Fred Perry, as well as radical new fashion innovations introduced on the court, like Elsa Schiaparelli dressing Spanish player Lil\u00ed de \u00c1lvarez in culottes, a split skirt, for Wimbledon in 1931, to onlookers\u2019 shock. Like with De \u00c1lvarez, dress codes in tennis have often changed after an initial scandal. The French player Suzanne Lenglen was one of the earliest and most memorable cases, when she did away with layered, long dresses and wore a more airy calf-length skirt and shorter sleeves at Wimbledon in 1919. A muse to the designer Jean Patou, Lenglen became tennis\u2019 first fashion icon with her signature headscarf and then-provocative shorter hems. At the US, French and Australian Open, players have challenged definitions of what tennis clothes can be thanks to looser rules (subject to referee opinion). None have done so more than the Williams sisters, with Serena wearing a denim mini, tutus and cape-like silhouettes and Venus\u2019s lacy black-and-red ensemble that drew comparisons to lingerie. More recently, Serena Williams\u2019 Nike kit became the topic of conversation at the 2018 French Open when she opted for a black compression catsuit that didn\u2019t feature the compulsory tennis skirt. Though she cited its circulation benefits following a severe blood-clot scare with the birth of her child, the French Open said it would bar the style in the future. However, the Women\u2019s Tennis Association formally allowed it, and Williams continued to wear versions of the bodysuit at the 2019 and 2021 Australian Opens, normalizing the agile and simplified cut for the tennis court. \u201cI love wearing skirts,\u201d she told CNN in April while reflecting on the controversy. \u201cBut I wanted to make sure that my blood was always circulating and I had been in a near-death experience.\u201d \u201cSo I think there should have been\u2026 understanding around that whole outfit,\u201d she added. Brand distinctions Most of the Grand Slam tournaments dropped the all-white rules decades ago, likely in a bid to attract more television viewers and advertisers in an age of increased visibility for the sport. \u201cColor is vital to draw the eye and especially for those sports companies to be able to advertise their logos and their colors,\u201d Jones explained. Sports and luxury brands advertise through fashion in multiple ways, from dressing star players in custom statement pieces to promoting merchandised designs on competitors. Wimbledon\u2019s restrictive rules have been \u201cfrustrating\u201d for brands trying to sell their tournament collections, Rothenberg said. When Fila introduced Bjorn Borg throwback shirts in 2001, replicating what the tennis star wore during his five-time-winning Wimbledon streak from 1976 to 1980, Wimbledon officials said they no longer adhered to the rules. The decision sent the sports brand \u201cscrambling\u201d to get new shirts to the players wearing them, Rothenberg explained. And, after Federer\u2019s orange-soled shoes were banned, Nike had to act fast to spin their brief appearance, advertising them as \u201cOne Match Wonders\u201d in a print ad. For players, the smallest infractions have proved controversial, and some players have outright refused to play along, as Andre Agassi did from 1988-90 when he boycotted Wimbledon entirely. In 2017, Jurij Rodionov was told to change blue underwear that was peeking out of his shirts, while Sabine Lisicki recently said that she and women were often required to switch out their skin-colored bras. But Rothenberg doesn\u2019t see more leniency happening anytime soon from Wimbledon\u2019s decision-makers. \u201cI think Wimbledon sees its anachronisms as a big part of its brand and its value,\u201d he explained. \u201cWimbledon has clung on to it as a way to be distinct and different \u2014 and I think it\u2019s largely been successful. It doesn\u2019t look like any other tournament.\u201d There have been criticisms levied against the major tournaments whenever women players seem to be disproportionately affected by their dress codes, and though Rothenberg agrees, he also points out that women\u2019s styles have been more creative. Men\u2019s tenniswear has deviated less from shorts and lightwear polos or shortsleeve athletic shirts since they were introduced. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of men\u2019s short length getting markedly shorter over the last 12 months though, especially players who really have hiked up their shorts a lot,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe someday there will be rules against that if they start showing too much cheek.\u201d Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled a source\u2019s surname and misstated the current name of the ASU FIDM Museum.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/12/style/dress-codes-tennis-whites-wimbledon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a 236-page report titled \u201c\u2018I Can\u2019t Erase All the Blood from My Mind\u2019: Palestinian Armed Groups\u2019 October 7 Assault on Israel,\u201d the rights watchdog said that the October 7 attack was \u201cdirected against a civilian population,\u201d and that \u201ckilling civilians and taking hostages were central aims of the planned attack, not an afterthought, a plan gone awry, or isolated acts.\u201d \u201cThe Hamas-led assault on October 7 was designed to kill civilians and take as many people as possible hostage,\u201d said Ida Sawyer, crisis and conflict director at HRW. The assault was led by Hamas\u2019 military wing \u2013 the Qassam Brigades \u2013 but included at least four other Palestinian armed groups, the report said. The report details several dozen cases of serious violations of international humanitarian law by Palestinian armed groups at most civilian attack sites on October 7, when militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. The rights group said it interviewed 144 people, including 94 Israeli and other nationals, who witnessed the October 7 assault, which targeted at least 19 kibbutzim (agricultural communes) and five moshavim (cooperative communities). The cities of Sderot and Ofakim, two music festivals, and a beach party were also targeted, HRW added. \u201cThe armed groups committed numerous violations of the laws of war that amount to war crimes,\u201d the report said. These include \u201cattacks targeting civilians and civilian objects, willful killing of people in custody, cruel and other inhumane treatment.\u201d Palestinian fighters committed summary killings and hostage-taking along with murder and wrongful imprisonment, HRW added. Sexual and gender-based violence The report also highlighted \u201ccrimes involving sexual and gender-based violence, hostage-taking, mutilation and despoiling bodies, use of human shields, and pillage and looting.\u201d Israel and the United Nations have also accused Hamas-led militants of committing sexual violence on October 7. In March, the UN special envoy on sexual violence in conflict, Pramila Patten, said her team found \u201creasonable grounds to believe that conflict related sexual violence, including rape and gang rape occurred\u201d that day. It was the UN\u2019s most definitive finding on allegations of sexual assault in the aftermath of the attack. Several first responders who attended the scenes of the October 7 attack told CNN in December that the attacks were overwhelmingly gruesome and that some female victims were found undressed. HRW said that Hamas responded to its questions, stating that its forces were instructed not to target civilians and to abide by international human rights and humanitarian law. \u201cIn many cases, Human Rights Watch investigations found evidence to the contrary,\u201d the watchdog said. Hamas rejected the findings of the report and called for it to be retracted, according to a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe reject the lies and blatant bias towards the occupation and the lack of professionalism and credibility in the Human Rights Watch report. We demand its withdrawal and an apology,\u201d the Palestinian group said. \u2018Atrocities do not justify atrocities\u2019 In response to the October 7 attack, Israel launched an air and ground offensive on Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 people in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. The war has displaced almost all of Gaza\u2019s population of 2 million, turned swathes of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis. Previous HRW reports have addressed several alleged serious violations by Israeli forces in Gaza since October 7. In its Wednesday report, HRW called on all parties involved in the conflict to abide by international humanitarian law. \u201cThe Palestinian armed groups in Gaza should immediately and unconditionally release civilians held hostage,\u201d the report said, adding that both parties \u201cshould surrender for prosecution anyone facing an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant.\u201d In May, the ICC said it was seeking arrest warrants for Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, among other Israeli and Hamas officials, on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks and the subsequent war in Gaza. \u00a0A case is also being heard by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over an accusation by South Africa that Israel is committing genocide in its war in Gaza. \u201cAtrocities do not justify atrocities,\u201d Sawyer said. \u201cTo stop the endless cycle of abuses in Israel and Palestine, it\u2019s critical to address root causes and hold violators of grave crimes to account.

Authorities said Collins Jumaisi Khalusha, 33, \u201clured, killed, and disposed of 42 female bodies,\u201d of which only nine have been recovered. He was arrested in Soweto, east of the capital Nairobi, at 3 a.m. local time on Monday, outside a club where he had gone to watch the Euro 2024 soccer final, Kenya\u2019s director of criminal investigations,\u00a0Mohamed Amin,\u00a0told journalists on Monday. \u201cOn interrogation, the suspect confessed to having lured, killed, and disposed of 42 female bodies at the dumping site, all murdered between 2022 and Thursday, 11 July, 2024,\u201d Amin said. Acting police inspector general, Douglas Kanja, added in a statement that the \u201cpost-mortem examination is happening today\u201d on the nine bodies recovered so far. In a news conference on Sunday before the suspect\u2019s arrest, Kanja said the bodies \u201cwere severely dismembered, in different states of decomposition, and left in sacks.\u201d \u201cWe are dealing with a serial killer, a psychopathic serial killer who has no respect for life,\u201d Amin said Monday. Khalusha \u201cled officers to his single room rented house,\u201d which is located about 100 meters (328 feet) from the crime scene, Amin said. A machete, 12 nylon sacks, a pair of industrial rubber gloves, a hard drive, and eight smart phones were among \u201ccrucial\u201d items police said they discovered in the rented house. Amin said that, according to the suspect\u2019s confession, his first victim was his wife, whom he \u201cstrangled to death before dismembering her body and disposing it at the site.\u201d \u201cFrom his interrogation, all his victims have been murdered in like manner,\u201d he said. Khalusha\u2019s arrest followed \u201cforensic analysis of a mobile phone belonging to one of the victims, Josphine Mulongo Owino, where mobile money transactions conducted on the day she went missing pointed to the suspect,\u201d according to Amin. The first six bodies were discovered on Friday by residents\u00a0of Kware, in Nairobi\u2019s Mukuru kwa Njenga neighborhood.\u00a0Kenyan Police\u00a0said the bodies were found in an \u201cabandoned quarry,\u201d currently \u201cfilled with water and used as a dumpsite.\u201d On Monday, police said the suspect lived a short walk from the dumpsite, raising questions about how he evaded detection for two years. The site is also close to a police station. A group of female leaders called for enhanced protections for\u00a0Kenyan women on Monday after increasing cases of femicide. \u201cThose women might have been killed today, but which woman is next in line?\u201d asked Kajiado lawmaker Leah Sankaire Sopiato at a press briefing. \u201cIt is so sad that someone who killed 42 people was still roaming out there.

{"id": "2024_07_17_style_rajesh-vora-punjab-architecture-snap", "text": "Looking down a street in Daulatpur, a rural village in Punjab, India with a mishmash of eclectic, colorful architecture, photographer Rajesh Vora felt he had struck lucky. In front of him, was a large facsimile of an Air-India plane on top of a pale green\u00a0building. Facing it from across the street, a replica of an army tank atop a yellow residence pointed its gun, the painted figure of a soldier rising from its hatch. Though the designs could have been plucked from an amusement park, they were actually elaborate rooftop water tanks of private homes. Vora\u2019s images of this phenomenon \u2014 a vernacular tradition of architectural icons that sprung up across the\u00a0across the northwestern state some five decades ago \u2014 became a multiyear project that the Mumbai-based photographer is\u00a0now exhibiting at Les Rencontres d\u2019Arles\u00a0in France this summer.\u00a0He visited 150 villages and photographed hundreds of these designs. The ostentatious d\u00e9cor is \u201ca brilliant idea combining form and function,\u201d Vora said in a phone call with CNN. The first time he noticed the water tanks while on assignment in the region in 2014, he was \u201camused, like anybody would be seeing this kind of sculpture,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut then I realized, as an architecture photographer, what amazed me was the integration of the sculptures on the houses, built by local artisans.\u201d Crowning the tops of these homes, the unusual status symbols are often commissioned by Indian emigrants\u00a0who return home during the year, or by their families who still live in the region. Some are functional water tanks while others sit on top more traditional plumbing designs. Each tell a specific story, he explained. \u201cIf somebody plays sports, they\u2019ll put up a football there, if they are a chef they will put a pressure cooker\u2026 if somebody likes a nice drink, they\u2019ll put a bottle of whiskey,\u201d he explained. Planes, tanks and cars became popular motifs, too. \u201cAll their personal aspirations are embodied in their houses.\u201d Last year, Vora published a book, \u201cEveryday Monuments\u201d that features images from some the villages he visited and brings together texts from architectural, scholarly and curatorial experts to explore the unique tradition. Through their research, they approximate that there are around 30 artisans in the region who work with homeowners and their families via word of mouth to create these lively sculptures. Diasporic icons Vora came across the buildings by chance, as he visited a gurdwara\u00a0\u2014 a Sikh temple \u2014 in the village of Talhan while working on a commissioned photo story about global migration. Known as Hawaijahaj, or \u201cAirplane,\u201d gurdwara, visitors bring offerings of model aircraft in hopes that they will be blessed with swift visa approval to leave India. He heard that many who were successful eventually returned to their villages to add planes to the exteriors of newly built homes, he explained. Over the course of six trips from 2014 to 2019, Vora began to better understand the full scope of the trend. It had begun sometime in the 1970s, as Punjabi diasporic communities flourished in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, among other countries.\u00a0As the popularity of custom-designed water tanks grew, local builders became specialized in their craft. The favored icons tend to shift in popularity over the years \u2014 when the country began manufacturing its popular Maruti van, for example, in the 1980s, it began appearing on homes, too. He also observed how architectural styles from different countries began to mix into the villages as owners brought back ideas from abroad to unique effect. But documenting the water tanks proved difficult when he first began. The remote areas of Punjab weren\u2019t yet mapped by Google, he explained, so he visited villages and hoped for the best. \u201cSome days are lucky \u2014 you might get three or four kinds of water tanks; others, you might not get anything,\u201d Vora said. Daulatpur Village, where multiple designs could be seen in one frame, was a rarity. Vora doesn\u2019t know how the tradition will grow or change as the region continues to see major shifts \u2014 especially as Indians from marginalized backgrounds gain more economic mobility and second- or third- generation immigrants amass wealth overseas. \u201cWill they come back to India? Will they build their own houses? Will they take care of these houses?\u201d We don\u2019t know,\u201d Vora said of younger generations. \u201cThese houses are perishable if you don\u2019t maintain them after 30 or 40 years\u2026 maybe they will disappear.\u201d The photographer hopes to continue to create an archive of Punjab\u2019s distinctive architectural legacy \u2014 and he\u2019ll keep looking out for a home that bears the icon of what he would choose if he were commissioning a design. \u201cIt would have to be a camera,\u201d he said with a laugh.

{"id": "2024_07_19_asia_bangladesh-job-quota-protests-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Huge protests across Bangladesh escalated into deadly violence this week with clashes\u00a0between students, pro-government supporters\u00a0and armed police fueling\u00a0widespread\u00a0anger over civil service job quotas opponents say are discriminatory. Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which has seen riot police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters and crowds of demonstrators armed with sticks filling the streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities. State broadcaster Bangladesh Television (BTV) was off air on Friday after student demonstrators allegedly set fire to its headquarters, according to local media, and protesters have called for a nationwide shutdown in a major challenge to the government of longstanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Mobile and internet services have been cut, schools and universities ordered to close, and security forces deployed to quell the unrest, with human rights groups accusing authorities of using unlawful force against protesters. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Why are students protesting? Many Bangladeshi students are demanding an end to the government\u2019s quota system, which reserves more than half of\u00a0civil service posts for certain groups. Some 30% of those highly sought-after jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, a seminal moment in the nation\u2019s history as it successfully won freedom from a much larger ruler. Many of the country\u2019s contemporary political elite are related to that generation \u2013 including Prime Minister Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975. The reserved roles are linked to\u00a0job security and higher pay, and protesters say the quota system is discriminatory and favors supporters of Hasina\u2019s ruling Awami League party. They are demanding recruitment based on merit. \u201cA government job is a really good opportunity,\u201d said Maruf Khan, 29, a Bangladeshi studying in Australia, who has joined rallies supporting the protests in Sydney. \u201cAbout 500,000 to 600,000 people are competing for 600 to 700 government jobs and on top of that it includes a 56% quota. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d Driving the anger is high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it has slowed in the post-pandemic era and, as the World Bank notes in its latest overview, inequality has \u201cwidened in urban areas.\u201d\u00a0In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education. In 2018, the quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal was unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case. Critics and protesters say the quota system creates a two-tier Bangladesh where a politically connected elite benefit by their birth. \u201cThe freedom fighters have sacrificed a lot for the nation \u2026 for that reason this quota was a logical thing in the past,\u201d said student protester Tahmeed Hossain. \u201cBut there have been at least two generations after that. Nowadays, the quota \u2026 has rather become a form of discrimination. It has become a cultural propaganda to create a stronghold in the country.\u201d Why did the protests escalate? The protests began at the prestigious Dhaka University on July 1 and later spread to other campuses and cities nationwide in almost daily street gatherings that included rail and road blockades. The demonstrations became violent on July 15 when members of the Bangladesh Chatra League \u2013 the\u00a0student wing of the ruling Awami League party \u2013 reportedly attacked student protesters inside the Dhaka University campus. Since then, clashes between security forces, protesters and government supporters have escalated, with Bangladesh deploying its paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion, which was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 after \u201cwidespread allegations of serious human rights abuses.\u201d The student protester Hossain told CNN he was wounded at a rally at Dhaka University on Wednesday when a projectile was thrown into the crowd. \u201cSomeone threw a small thing at us that blew up and I heard shots. I started running and realized that I had been hurt by some splinters in my hands. The police then attacked us with tear shell in the building,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my friends got hit by a (rubber) bullet in the leg. Some of my friends got their heads smashed and are currently under treatment in the hospital.\u201d Another protester in Dhaka, Hassan Abdullah, said Thursday: \u201cThere are tear (gas) shells just 50 meters away from me as I am talking to you. The police are constantly bursting sound grenades right now.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the accounts but the sounds of protest commotion, including multiple audible cracks, could be heard during the conversation with Abdullah. Reports of the number of people killed has varied widely, with the Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo saying 19 people were killed on Thursday alone and the Agence France-Press news agency reporting\u00a032 deaths, citing its own tally compiled from hospital data. Authorities have also moved to block online communications. Internet monitoring site Netblocks confirmed a \u201cnear-total national internet shutdown\u201d across Bangladesh on Thursday. \u201cThe new measure follows earlier efforts to throttle social media and restrict mobile data services,\u201d it said on X. What has the government said? The demonstrations are the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Hasina since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition party to protest what they said was a widespread crackdown on their ranks. Hasina has announced a judicial investigation into the killings and called on protesters to await the verdict of the Supreme Court. \u201cI especially urge everyone to wait patiently until the Supreme Court verdict comes. I believe our students will get justice from high court, they will not be disappointed,\u201d Hasina said in a news conference Thursday. But she has been accused of enflaming\u00a0protester anger by reportedly calling them \u201crazakar,\u201d\u00a0 an offensive term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 independence war. \u201cWe expected an apology from our prime minister for comparing us to traitors of 1952 and 1972, and a solid solution to quota reform,\u201d said protester Salman Farsi. \u201cWhat did the students do to deserve this tag?\u201d Student protesters CNN spoke to say their demonstrations have gone beyond frustration over the quota system and their anger is now directed at Hasina and her government, which human rights organizations have long warned are headed toward a one-party system. \u201cThis is a people\u2019s movement against the authoritarian government,\u201d Hossain said. \u201cThis is not just about quota protests anymore, this is much bigger than that, in simple quota protests the government wouldn\u2019t go around hurting and shooting students. This shows the current fascist and autocratic nature of the government, who has been upholding the power without any proper voting system.\u201d What has global reaction been? Bangladeshi students have held smaller protests elsewhere,\u00a0including in New York\u2019s Times Square, the Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney and the Danish capital Copenhagen. The US said it was \u201ccontinuing to monitor the reports of violence from the ongoing protests in and around Dhaka,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said in a briefing on Thursday. \u201cFreedom of expression and peaceful assembly are essential building blocks to any thriving democracy, and we condemn the recent acts of violence in Bangladesh.\u201d UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u00a0called for restraint on all sides and urged the government to investigate all acts of violence, according to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. \u201cThe secretary-general encourages the meaningful and constructive participation of youth to address the ongoing challenges in Bangladesh. Violence can never be the solution,\u201d Dujarric  said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/asia/bangladesh-job-quota-protests-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Eugenic Protection Law, in place from 1948 to 1996, allowed authorities to forcibly sterilize people with disabilities, including those with mental disorders, hereditary diseases or physical deformities and leprosy. It also allowed forced abortions if either parent had those conditions. At least 25,000 people were sterilized\u00a0under the law, Kishida told a meeting at his official residence of about 130 survivors, many now elderly and in wheelchairs, public broadcaster NHK reported Wednesday. \u201cI decided to meet with you today in order to personally express my remorse and apology for the tremendous physical and mental suffering that many people have endured based on the former Eugenic Protection Law,\u201d Kishida said. The law was unconstitutional and had violated individuals\u2019 human rights and dignity, the prime minister said, adding he had ordered authorities to prepare a new compensation plan for survivors, without sharing the details. Plaintiffs and their supporters have argued that a previous government compensation offer of 3.2 million yen (about $20,000) each was too low.\u00a0They won a significant victory\u00a0earlier this month, when Japan\u2019s Supreme Court ordered the government to pay 16.5 million yen (about $105,000) each in damages to plaintiffs of several lawsuits and 2.2 million yen ($14,000) to their spouses. One plaintiff, Kikuo Kojima, described being taken to the hospital when he was 19, where he said he was \u201cgiven the nickname \u2018Schizophrenic\u2019 and forced into eugenic surgery.\u201d \u201cI will never forget that,\u201d he said, according to NHK. Other plaintiffs said they were bedridden for years following their operations, faced a lifetime of discrimination, were unable to work due to the physical and mental toll, and wished their bodies could return to their \u201coriginal\u201d state, NHK reported. Eugenics law Japan experienced a brief baby boom after World War II, alarming authorities as they struggled to deal with severe nationwide food shortages and a war-ravaged economy, according to academics and Japanese medical associations. The government leapt to implement population control measures, including a national campaign to promote contraception \u2013 and the Eugenic Protection Law, which \u201cmade abortions and sterilizations available,\u201d and was described as \u201cgovernment policy in the population field\u201d in a 1972 report by the government-run Institute of Population Problems. The legislation aimed to \u201cprevent the increase of the inferior descendants from the eugenic point of view and to protect the life and health of the mother,\u201d according to a copy of the law \u2013 which listed \u201cremarkable abnormal sexual desire\u201d and \u201cremarkable clinical inclination\u201d among the conditions targeted. Besides an official apology, the plaintiffs have also demanded a compensation law that would benefit all survivors, even those who haven\u2019t filed lawsuits. They also urged authorities to quickly conclude ongoing related legal cases, stressing that most plaintiffs were\u00a0reaching the end of their lives, NHK reported. \u201cI heard the apology directly from the prime minister to the victims, but I think we could have heard it earlier,\u201d said Koji Niisato, an attorney for plaintiffs, according to NHK. \u201cToday, I hope that you will listen to the actual conditions of the victims and their real voices and do your utmost to achieve a full resolution for them.\u201d Some plaintiffs also said they were not fully satisfied with the government\u2019s apology and the Supreme Court ruling. \u201cIt has been really hard for a long time, and even after hearing the verdict, I cannot put my mind at ease,\u201d one plaintiff said, according to NHK.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/asia/japan-kishida-apology-forced-sterilization-eugenics-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_18_middleeast_israel-us-biden-knesset-vote-palestinian-state-intl", "text": "The Biden administration received another rebuff from Israel Wednesday night \u2013 this time from the country\u2019s parliament \u2013 over the United States\u2019 long-standing support for the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state. A two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been US policy for decades, but absent negotiations between the two sides, and a lack of sustained effort by the US to make it happen, means faith in such an outcome has dwindled. On Wednesday evening, the Israeli parliament made clear its position, voting by 68 to 9 to reject any creation of a Palestinian state. \u201cThe Knesset of Israel firmly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state west of the Jordan (river). The establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of the Land of Israel would pose an existential danger to the State of Israel and its citizens, perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilize the region,\u201d the declaration read. Among those who backed it was Benny Gantz, an opponent of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Gantz\u2019s vote serves as a blow to those in Washington who see him as someone more inclined to seek a negotiated peace with Palestinians if he ever became Israel\u2019s leader. Instead, the resolution was \u201ca signal to the international community that pressure to impose a Palestinian state on Israel is futile,\u201d leader of the right-wing opposition \u2018New Hope\u2019 party, Gideon Saar, said, according to the Haaretz newspaper. The Palestinian Authority foreign ministry condemned the Knesset vote, saying it was time \u201cthe international consensus on the two-state solution (was) translated into practical steps to resolve the conflict \u2026 before it is too late.\u201d The Biden administration, while standing strong in its support for Israel and Netanyahu throughout the war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, has tried to stick to its long-held line that a two-state solution is in the interests of both Israelis and Palestinians. Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the idea. A day after speaking with Biden in a phone conversation in January, the Israeli leader posted on X, \u201cI will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of Jordan. And this is contrary to (the creation of) a Palestinian state.\u201d The Knesset declaration \u2013 which follows a similar vote in February opposing international recognition of a Palestinian state \u2013 is not legally binding, but pollster and analyst Dahlia Scheindlin says its symbolic importance should not be dismissed. \u201cIt is Israel trying to create a fact on the ground \u2013 which does not exist \u2013 that Israel has the power to determine whether Palestinians exist, or exist as a state,\u201d she says, referring also to remarks from finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, last year that there\u2019s \u201cno such thing as a Palestinian people.\u201d \u201cWe need to stop accepting the Israeli rhetoric that there is such a thing as unilateral Palestinian statehood. What we have is multilateral recognition of Palestinian statehood and unilateral Israeli rejection,\u201d Scheindlin says. While international leaders have repeatedly condemned the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, which killed 1,200 people and saw 250 more taken hostage, some countries have also made significant foreign policy shifts in recent months to recognize a Palestinian state. Making such an announcement in May, in a co-ordinated move with Spain and Ireland, Norway\u2019s foreign minister framed the move in part as a response to Israeli intransigence on peace talks. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,\u201d Espen Barth Eide said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/middleeast/israel-us-biden-knesset-vote-palestinian-state-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

A rare flash flood emergency was issued for around 5,000 people in Yellville and surrounding areas of Marion County after 6 to 11 inches of rain fell in just four to five hours, according to the National Weather Service. The area typically receives just 3.5 to 4 inches of rain in the entire month of July.

At least 30 homes and a nursing facility in the county were evacuated as the dangerous floodwaters hit the area, Melissa Penn, Marion County Emergency Management Director, told CNN. Approximately 80 patients from the nursing home were transported to a temporary facility. At least one bridge in Marion County was washed out by flooding, according to the county\u2019s social media.

{"id": "2024_07_19_sport_churchill-downs-bob-baffert-suspension-lifted-spt", "text": "Churchill Downs lifted the suspension on Friday of thoroughbred trainer Bob Baffert after the Hall of Famer admitted to wrongdoing in the horse Medina Spirit\u2019s failed drug test in the 2021 Kentucky Derby. Medina Spirit tested positive for a banned substance after initially being declared the winner of the Triple Crown race. The horse crossed the finish line first, but a blood sample revealed betamethasone, an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid sometimes used to relieve joint pain, was in the horse, CNN previously reported. The substance is not allowed on race day under Kentucky equine protocols. Baffert was initially given a two-year ban by Churchill Downs in 2021. Last July, before the suspension was lifted, Churchill Downs Incorporated, the organizer of the horse race and owner of the famed racetrack, extended Baffert\u2019s suspension through the end of 2024. Baffert said at the time the drug was in a topical ointment used for a skin infection and Medina Spirit had not been injected with it. Baffert, who has trained six Derby winners, said in a post on X he is responsible for any substances found in his trained horses and has \u201cpaid a very steep price\u201d with Medina Spirit\u2019s disqualification and the three-year suspension. \u201cI understand and appreciate that Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission took steps to enforce the rules that they believed were necessary to protect the safety and integrity of horse racing and the reputation of the Kentucky Derby,\u201d Baffert said in the statement. \u201cMy family and I want to put this behind us and get back to doing what we love to do without any more distraction or negativity. I very much look forward to returning to Churchill Downs and getting back to the Winner\u2019s Circle,\u201d he said. Churchill Downs said it is \u201csatisfied\u201d Baffert took responsibility \u201cfor his actions, completed a substantial penalty and is committed to running in full compliance with the rules and regulations going forward.\u201d In a statement Friday, Churchill Downs Incorporated CEO Bill Carstanjen welcomed Baffert back to its flagship racetrack and any other track owned by the company, which has racetracks across several states\u00a0Louisiana, Kentucky and Virginia. \u201cAll parties agree that it is time to bring this chapter to a close and focus on the future,\u201d Carstanjen said in the statement. \u201cWe wish him and his connections good luck in their future competitive endeavors.\u201d Medina Spirit died in 2021 at the Santa Anita racetrack in Southern California after collapsing following a workout.

{"id": "2024_07_15_style_ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian", "text": "India\u2019s most anticipated wedding of the year came to an end on Sunday after a star-studded three-day celebration that even saw the country\u2019s prime minister arrive to bless the young couple. Billionaire heir Anant Ambani married his longtime girlfriend Radhika Merchant in Mumbai in a lavish ceremony attended by Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, two former British prime ministers, Indian sporting legends and some of Bollywood\u2019s most famous faces. The wedding was followed by a blessing ceremony on Saturday, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi bestowed the young couple and their families with well wishes. The weekend\u2019s festivities concluded Sunday with an extravagant reception, or \u201cMangal Utsav\u201d (festival of bliss), as attendees jetted out of Mumbai. No expense was spared by the family that owns India\u2019s largest private corporation, Reliance Industries. Founded by Anant\u2019s grandfather, the conglomerate is now run by his father Mukesh, who is worth over $122 billion, according to Forbes. The Ambani-owned 16,000-capacity Jio World Convention Centre, which hosted wedding events throughout the weekend, was transformed into a miniature version of the holy Indian city of Varanasi, featuring floral installations and extravagant sets embellished with gold and silver. The couple underwent multiple outfit changes across the three-day bash, appearing in a succession of intricate, custom-made pieces celebrating the country\u2019s heritage and culture. Merchant\u2019s bridal ensemble was designed by Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and featured ivory zardozi (an elaborate type of metal embroidery) on silk and a 5-meter (16.4-foot) veil. She completed the look with jewels that aunts and sister wore to their own weddings. She later changed into an opulent red and gold outfit for her \u201cvidai,\u201d the ceremony in which Indian brides symbolically bid farewell to their relatives before joining their groom\u2019s family. Ambani meanwhile arrived on the red carpet in a golden sherwani paired with sneakers. For the marriage ceremony, he wore a custom red sherwani by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, with a large green necklace draped around his neck. For Saturday\u2019s blessings ceremony, Merchant once again donned a custom piece by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla, who collaborated with contemporary artist and sculptor Jayasri Burman to create a one-of-a-kind piece embroidered with real gold. The garment celebrates the couple\u2019s union \u201cthrough deeply meaningful imagery,\u201d Merchant\u2019s stylist Rhea Kapoor wrote on Instagram. \u201cThe human figures representing the happy couple radiate a celestial aura that honors the divinity in their humanity. The fauna depicts Anant\u2019s fondness for animals, particularly elephants that are considered auspicious and beautiful.\u201d For the reception Sunday, guests interpreted the \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code by mixing classic Indian fashion with contemporary styles. Merchant wore a gold metallic corset from Dolce and Gabbana\u2019s Alta Moda couture line, along with a skirt and dupatta in the same shade by Indian designer Anamika Khanna. Months of planning It is not known precisely how much the Ambanis spent on the celebrations, which included months of pre-wedding parties, though industry estimates have placed the total firmly in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Insiders worked for months to bring the couple\u2019s vision to life, collaborating with the family to bring the intricate details \u2014 from the floral arrangements to the set designs \u2014 together. Renowned wedding designer Preston Bailey, who has worked with Serena Williams and LeBron James, was commissioned to create larger-than-life floral art installations for the weekend. Speaking to CNN via email ahead of Friday\u2019s ceremony, Bailey commended Ambani\u2019s mother Nita\u2019s attention to detail. It was \u201cnothing short of pure genius and she is really focused on bringing the vast creative talent of India to the world through these weddings,\u201d he said. The inspiration for Bailey\u2019s designs came from the couple\u2019s love for animals and Ambani\u2019s recently opened animal sanctuary, Vantara, in the western Indian city of Jamnagar. His sculptural creations included a giant display of hot air balloons and more than 60 floral animals, including giraffes, two huge toucans, monkeys perched on trees inside the venue and a giant horse made from red and pink flowers. \u201cI have been in business for over 40 years \u2026 (but) I have never seen anything as intricate as this wedding and I believe it will bring such positive feedback and awareness to the great creative culture of artists of India,\u201d said Bailey, who also worked on the weddings of Ambani\u2019s two older siblings, Akash and Isha. Top Indian couturier and the wedding\u2019s creative director, Manish Malhotra, earlier told CNN that \u201cmaintaining the essence of India\u201d had been his \u201cguiding principle.\u201d \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event, from the vibrant Sangeet (a traditional evening of music and dance that saw a performance from Justin Bieber) to the ceremonial wedding day and the grand reception, is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he said via email. Criticism and sustainability Details of the celebrations dominated local news headlines and set social media abuzz, but many within India \u2014 the world\u2019s most populous nation, with 1.4 billion people \u2014 criticized the opulence on show in a country with a glaring wealth gap and where millions live in poverty. \u201cShame on people celebrating income inequality in a country where we need wealth redistribution,\u201d tweeted comedian and social media critic, Shamita Yadav, who posts on social media as The Ranting Gola. \u201cWe are really a poor country,\u201d Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, Sushant Singh, told Indian news outlet The Wire. \u201cThis is something which is completely unacceptable. But the fact of the matter is half of India\u2019s big media is owned by Mr. Ambani, so it is unlikely that India\u2019s big media is going to say that this is horrible.\u201d Beyond the financial cost of the wedding and festivities is another, less visible cost: the one to the planet. An average Indian wedding of 300 people typically generates between 1.5 tons and 2 tons of waste, and around 30 to 40 tons of carbon emission \u2014 before taking guest travel into consideration \u2014 according to Ashwin Malwade, co-founder of Greenmyna, a Mumbai-based sustainable wedding consultancy. Sources of emissions include large-scale banquets and energy used by extravagant light displays. An event as huge in scale as the Ambani-Merchant celebration would emit far more carbon than even the largest and most lavish Indian wedding, he added. Then there\u2019s the travel, with several high-profile attendees pictured leaving Mumbai via Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport\u2019s private jet terminal. Malwade also pointed to the environmental footprint of the Ambanis\u2019 pre-wedding bash in Jamnagar, attended by public figures from around the world, including Mark Zuckerberg, Ivanka Trump, Bill Gates and Karlie Kloss; the four-day cruise arranged for guests in the Mediterranean; and the emissions required to fly in singers like Rihanna and Justin Bieber to perform at various events.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/style/ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_south-korea-convenience-stores-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "Imagine this: you need to pick up a package, top up your metro card, grab lunch and take out some cash. In most places, that would probably mean separate trips to the post office, the subway station, a restaurant and an ATM. But in South Korea, all that \u2013 and more \u2013 can be done at your nearest convenience store. And you probably won\u2019t have to travel far to find one. South Korea has become the global king of convenience stores, both online and off \u2013 with social media influencers and tourists joining locals in flocking to a rapidly growing number of stores across the country. By the end of last year, there were more than 55,200 convenience stores in the nation of 52 million, according to the Korea Convenience Store Industry Association \u2013 roughly one\u00a0for every 950 people. That\u2019s more than the total number of McDonald\u2019s branches worldwide\u00a0\u2013 and gives South Korea the highest density of stores per capita, overtaking Japan and Taiwan, both also famous for their abundant and versatile convenience stores. \u201cThe convenience store industry in South Korea stands out for its remarkable density and innovative strategies,\u201d said Chang Woo-cheol, a professor of tourism and the food service industry at Kwangwoon University in Seoul. \u201cThey have become an essential retail channel, with the second-largest share in offline retail sales in the country.\u201d It\u2019s a far cry from places like the United States, where convenience stores are usually attached to gas stations or strip malls and are rarely seen in residential areas, partly due to zoning laws. In large South Korean cities like Seoul, convenience stores are on every corner, sometimes with multiple outlets from competing companies dotting the same street. \u201cConvenience stores are open 24 hours a day and play an essential role in our busy lives,\u201d Chang added \u2013 calling the South Korean industry a \u201cglobal success story.\u201d One-stop shops There are a few things that set South Korean convenience stores apart. For starters, they are a one-stop shop offering everything from food and drinks to home goods and lifestyle services. At these stores, customers can charge their phones, pay utility bills, withdraw cash, make online orders and receive deliveries \u2013 and, at certain locations, even charge their electric scooters, exchange foreign currency and send international mail. \u201cConvenience stores in Korea are not only a place where people can (sit) around a table amongst the clutter of beer cans on a late summer night, but also provide essential services,\u201d said Deloitte Korea in a 2020 report, describing the country\u2019s stores as \u201cpampering their customers with extreme convenience.\u201d Then there\u2019s the food section \u2013 a wide variety ranging from instant miso soup to cup noodles in every flavor imaginable, snacks like kimbap and onigiri, and ready-to-eat meal kits. Combine that with in-store seating areas, microwaves and hot water dispensers, and these stores have become a go-to spot for office workers having a quick lunch, partygoers needing a late-night boost and students fueling up before grueling cram school classes. Demand has surged over the years as South Korea has urbanized, said Chang, the hospitality professor. More than 80% of the population now live in urban centers, with many residents leaving rural areas to settle down in fast-paced cities. Another factor is demographics. Fewer South Koreans are getting married or starting families, meaning there are more single-person households than ever \u2013 and often on tighter budgets, given the economic hardships facing many young adults. As of 2021, about 35% of all South Korean households were single residents, according to a McKinsey report released last March. And unlike couples or large families, who may prefer to cook at home and buy in bulk from grocery stores, single residents gravitate toward the cheap, easy option of convenience stores or ordering online. The Covid-19 pandemic contributed to this trend,\u00a0with people preferring to order online or to buy things quickly from stores close to home, the report added. Companies have capitalized on this high demand by strategically opening shops inside other existing business venues or entertainment spaces. For instance, Seoul has convenience stores in karaoke bars and the city\u2019s arts center, the Deloitte report said. All this has translated to huge profits. Between 2010 and 2021, Korean convenience store revenue leaped more than fourfold\u00a0from $5.8 billion to $24.7 billion, surpassing traditional supermarkets and department stores, according to McKinsey, citing London-based market research company Euromonitor. Social media phenomenon These convenience stores aren\u2019t just popular in real life \u2013 they\u2019re also gaining traction on social media, reflecting the global phenomenon many call the \u201cKorean wave.\u201d South Korean exports have swept the world in the past two decades, from K-pop and Korean TV dramas to beauty products, fashion and food. In the past year, the global obsession with Korean items has turned its attention to the country\u2019s convenience stores. A quick search on YouTube, TikTok or Instagram shows an endless supply of videos about Korean convenience stores. In these clips, influencers show off the in-store instant ramen stations, review\u00a0snacks and drinks, or follow online trends such as only eating convenience store foods for a whole day. These videos have proved to be a winning strategy for their creators. Jiny Maeng, an Australia-based content creator who was born in South Korea, began making videos on the topic after seeing similar clips going viral online. They are her most-viewed content, with her top three YouTube videos racking up a total of 76 million views \u2013 and an additional few million views each on TikTok and Instagram. \u201cKorea became a trend itself \u2026 on social media,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess that\u2019s also why (convenience stores) are so popular, because people idolize going to Korea now, it\u2019s just one of the dream locations people want to go to. So, seeing these videos kind of overtake online is a really cool experience for a Korean, actually.\u201d Part of what audiences enjoy is the sensory satisfaction of Maeng displaying convenience store products, she said \u2013 including the crinkling of packaging being torn open or the rattle of plastic \u201cice cups\u201d before they\u2019re filled with drinks. But they were also popular among her Australian and American viewers for the sheer novelty factor, she said. Buying, cooking and eating instant ramen noodles at a convenience store is \u201cmind-blowing\u201d for those used to a more spartan, Western-style store, she said. She pointed to businesses in Sydney, where she lives, as an example. Many cafes and other stores close by 3 p.m. \u2013 ludicrously early by Korean standards. And while Australia has 7-Eleven stores, like in the US, they are usually attached to gas stations and have \u201cvery limited\u201d processed food options like meat pies, sandwiches, donuts and slushies, she said. Chang, the professor, said these online videos have helped drive the popularity of convenience stores in Korea. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of both their distinctiveness and effective marketing through social media that has boosted their popularity,\u201d he said. Indeed, Korean convenience store companies have grown so successful they are even expanding overseas. Three of the largest brands \u2013 CU, GS25, and Emart24 \u2013 now have stores in parts of Southeast Asia including Vietnam and Malaysia, he said. He urged the industry to continue expanding by leveraging social media and \u201cthe influence of the Korean wave,\u201d adding: \u201cWe will have to put in more effort to survive in this (global) competition.\u201d There may be limits to the online strategy; the internet is now oversaturated with videos about Korean convenience stores, and audience interest is declining, said Maeng, whose most recent videos about the topic haven\u2019t raked in as many views as before. But when she next returns to South Korea, she will \u201cdefinitely\u201d still visit a convenience store and hit record, she said. \u201cThere (are) always ways to utilize the trend to make it your own,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a different way I can use convenience stores in my videos so it resonates with the viewer even more.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/south-korea-convenience-stores-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_africa_rwanda-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "Rwandans lined up on Monday to elect their next president, with early results putting incumbent Paul Kagame in the lead in a vote widely expected\u00a0to give him a fourth term and extend his near quarter century in charge of the East African country. The two men standing against him \u2013 Frank Habineza from the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana \u2013 said they were hoping to make some progress, but analysts and rights groups said Kagame\u2019s overwhelming victory was all but certain. Kagame, who got more than 93% of the vote at the last three elections, won praise from Western and regional leaders at the time for helping end\u00a0the 1994 genocide in\u00a0Rwanda. The US State Department and others have also lauded the development of the economy. Rwandans are also voting on Monday for members of the lower house of parliament and provisional results are expected by July 20. Polling stations were open until 3 p.m. (1300 GMT). The overall voter turnout was 98% of the 9 million registered voters, Oda Gasinzigwa, chair of the National Electoral Commission, said in a statement on the national broadcaster later on Monday evening. Of 78.94% of the votes counted at about 2017 GMT, Kagame was ahead with 99.15% of the votes, data from the commission showed. Campaign groups, including Human Rights Watch, have accused authorities of cracking down on journalists, the opposition and civil society groups before the vote. Kagame has dismissed such accusations and described himself as the stability candidate. His reelection could signal a measure of political stability for his corner of a fractured region, but also continued global scrutiny, given the accusations of abuses and of\u00a0supporting rebels\u00a0in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 a charge he has also denied. Earlier on Monday, at the Rwandexco polling center in the capital Kigali, Barimukije Pheneas said he would vote for the 66-year-old incumbent. \u201cWe voted smoothly without any crowding, and we are happy,\u201d Pheneas said. \u201cI voted for Paul Kagame because he has achieved a lot for us; he united us.\u201d Motorcycle taxi driver Karangwa Vedaste said the voting process was calm and peaceful, but declined to say who he had chosen. \u201cI voted for a leader I trust. The one I voted for is a secret in my heart. We will share it when he wins,\u201d Vedaste said. The electoral commission barred eight other candidates, including Kagame\u2019s most vocal critics, from running, citing a range of reasons including missing and incomplete registration documents. Democratic Green Party candidate Habineza, whose deputy was found dead and almost beheaded in the run-up to the 2010 vote, said there had been signs of progress. \u201cWe toured the entire country, and wherever we went, people welcomed us warmly. They gave us gifts and assured us they would vote for us,\u201d Habineza said after voting. \u201cWe have to maintain this momentum and not regress,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are confident, each of us is confident, it\u2019s half and half,\u201d independent presidential candidate Mpayimana told journalists after casting his vote. The US State Department says on its website\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0has made \u201cprogress in developing national and local government institutions, economic development, maintaining security (and) promoting reconciliation.\u201d It also says it backs\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0efforts to \u201cincrease democratic participation (and) enhance respect for civil and political rights.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/africa/rwanda-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}

The women were Israel Defense Forces (IDF) observers stationed at an Israeli military base at Nahal Oz, which was stormed by Hamas militant groups during their attack on Israel last year. The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said the families of the observers \u2013 Agam Berger, Daniella Gilboa, Liri Albag, Naama Levy and Karina Ariev \u2013 have decided to allow the publication of photos taken during their first days being held by the militant group. \u201cThe images reveal them bruised and wounded from the horrific abduction that the entire world witnessed,\u201d the forum said. In the pictures, Levy appears to have a badly bruised right eye. Another image shows four of the women sitting on bedding in a bare room; two of them, Gilboa and Ariev, have bandaged heads. \u201cThe courageous decision by the parents to reveal these photos aims to bring them closer to embracing their daughters,\u201d they said. Graphic video showing the capture of the group was previously released in May by their families. Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 250 captured and taken hostage in the enclave. Following the attack,\u00a0Israel\u00a0launched a war in Gaza that has killed\u00a0more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. \u201cThis reunion is just a deal away, a deal that would bring all 120 hostages home \u2013 the living for rehabilitation and the murdered and fallen for proper burial,\u201d the forum said in its Tuesday statement. \u201cWe demand that the Israeli government, and particularly its leader, look these girls in the eyes, try to imagine what they and all the hostages have endured for 284 days, and do everything possible to bring them home.\u201d Albert Ariev, the father of Karina Ariev, told a news conference that accompanied the release: \u201cMy little Karina, only 19 years old, is in Gaza. Today, you see footage of Karina and her friends in their first days of captivity. It\u2019s so vivid \u2013 Karina sitting on a mattress on the floor, with an exhausted and desperate look.\u201d \u201cSwelling in her hands indicates that Karina was bound for a long time. You see one frame, but in the video, you can see facial wounds likely caused by shrapnel when the terrorists invaded the shelter,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we are asking for is to have Karina back. There are also dead people there that need to be buried. The people demand that they all come back.\u201d Ariev urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: \u201cPlease don\u2019t go abroad before this deal goes ahead.\u201d Netanyahu is under intense pressure to secure the release of more than 100 hostages still believed to be held by Hamas. Earlier Tuesday, he met with the families of other observers who were killed at the base, close to the northern Gaza Strip, which was overrun in Hamas\u2019 attack last October, with 16 soldiers killed. The prime minister\u2019s office said the meeting lasted three hours. It said he had \u201clistened attentively to the stories about the lives and heroism of each of the young women, felt the families\u2019 pain, and heard their requests and demands for an investigation into the events and for the commemoration of their daughters.\u201d \u201cThe prime minister answered their questions and said that matters would be thoroughly checked and that the lessons would be learned at all levels, including in the intelligence, operations, military and diplomatic spheres.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/middleeast/israel-hamas-hostages-idf-images-released-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_asia_sue-mi-terry-us-south-korea-intl-hnk", "text": "A prominent North Korea expert and former CIA analyst has been indicted by a New York grand jury on charges of secretly working for the South Korean government in exchange for designer goods, Michelin star meals and $37,000 for a fund that she controlled. Sue Mi Terry, who was once a member of the US National Security Council, first acted as a foreign agent in June 2013 as she began meeting with an unnamed \u201chandler\u201d on \u201cmultiple occasions,\u201d according to the indictment, which was unsealed Tuesday. \u201cAt the direction of ROK (Republic of Korea) government officials, Terry advocated ROK policy positions, including in published articles and during\u00a0media appearances, disclosed nonpublic US government information to ROK intelligence officers, and facilitated access for ROK government officials to US government officials,\u201d the indictment alleges. In return, South Korean officials\u00a0allegedly\u00a0offered the former analyst around $37,000, claiming they could conceal the origin of the funds by depositing them into a designated \u201cgift\u201d account at the think tank where she worked, according to the indictment. Terry also\u00a0allegedly\u00a0received lavish goods \u2013 including a $3,450 Louis Vuitton handbag, a $2,845 Dolce & Gabbana coat and dinners at Michelin star restaurants \u2013 and she was paid to write opinion articles that advocated South Korean policy positions in American and Korean media outlets, the filing claims. Iva Zori\u0107, a spokesperson for the Council on Foreign Relations think tank that employed Terry, said the senior fellow was placed on administrative leave immediately after it learned of the indictment. \u201cWe take these allegations very seriously,\u201d Zori\u0107 told CNN. The indictment alleges Terry acted as a \u201cvaluable source\u201d of information for the South Korean government. In one instance, Terry had participated in an off-the-record North Korea policy briefing with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in June 2022. As soon as the meeting ended, she passed her handler \u201cdetailed handwritten notes\u201d that described the contents of the closed-door briefing, the indictment alleges. In a statement, a spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service said, \u201cthe intelligence authorities of South Korea and the United States are in close communication regarding the indictment related to the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\u201d Separately, a spokesperson for Seoul\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, \u201cit is not appropriate to comment on a matter pending in foreign judicial proceedings.\u201d US law obligates American citizens to register as foreign agents if they engage in\u00a0certain behaviors\u00a0for or on behalf of a foreign government.\u00a0The indictment alleges that Terry\u00a0was acting as a foreign agent\u00a0but\u00a0did not register as required, which is a crime. In a statement, Lee Wolosky, Terry\u2019s attorney, said the allegations against his client are \u201cunfounded,\u201d adding that Terry was a \u201charsh critic\u201d of the South Korean government during the period she was allegedly acting on its behalf. \u201cOnce the facts are made clear it will be evident the (US) government made a significant mistake,\u201d Wolosky said. Terry, born in Seoul and a naturalized US citizen, began working for the US government in 2001. She served as a high-profile analyst on East Asian issues for the CIA before pre-emptively resigning\u00a0in 2008 due to a conflict of interest regarding her relationship with South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, as recorded in an FBI interview in June 2023. She later\u00a0served\u00a0as the director for Japan, Korea, and Oceanic affairs for the National Security Council under both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. In June 2013, five years after leaving the CIA, Terry began operating as a foreign diplomat under the UN reporting to some of the highest-ranking officials serving South Korea, further deepening ties with them. No stranger to the media, Terry has been featured in multiple outlets, including appearances on CNN. She has authored reports for both American and South Korean news outlets. Terry had previously told Congress under oath that she had not acted as a foreign agent while testifying before a House hearing\u00a0regarding North Korea\u2019s escalation of nuclear activity. South Korea is a key US ally in the Asia-Pacific, though Terry\u2019s indictment is not the first case of alleged collusion to test the two countries\u2019 friendship. Internal Pentagon documents\u00a0leaked last year\u00a0described, in remarkable detail, private conversations between two senior South Korean national security officials, whom the US had\u00a0allegedly wiretapped.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/asia/sue-mi-terry-us-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_style_cloudboom-strike-spray-on-running-shoes", "text": "We\u2019ve seen spray-on hair, a spray-on dress and now \u2014 marathon-winning spray-on shoes. Swiss sportswear brand On is the latest company to embrace advanced \u201cspray-on\u201d materials with a \u201crevolutionary\u201d robot-made sneaker it believes can improve performance at this month\u2019s Olympics. The Cloudboom Strike LS is lace-free and weighs less than the latest iPhone. Designed to be more adaptable, dynamic and supportive than your average running sneakers, the $330 shoes already have a convincing track record: Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri, an Olympic silver medalist and the only woman to have won indoor, outdoor and cross-country world titles, triumphed at this year\u2019s Boston Marathon wearing a pair. She will don them again to compete in the Paris 2024 Games this summer. Zurich-based On credits its shoes\u2019 success to a combination of biomechanics, physiology and extreme lightness. (A men\u2019s US size 8.5 weighs just 170g per shoe, over 100g lighter than several popular running shoes of the same size.) \u201cMore than anything, we want (the athletes) to win,\u201d said senior director of innovation, Ilmarin Heitz, in a promotional video published Monday. \u201cThat is our gauge of success.\u201d With no heel-cap, laces or tongue, the translucent, sock-like sneaker looks like a running shoe that has shed its skin. Its inventor, Johannes Voelchert, came up with the idea as a student after seeing a Halloween-themed hot glue gun that shot decorative spider webs. \u201cI saw that there was a quick way of creating a textile onto a complex shape,\u201d Voelchert, now On\u2019s senior lead of innovation concept design, said in the brand\u2019s video. \u201cA shoe seemed to be the right object.\u201d Voelchert brought his idea to the Milan Design Fair, where he caught the Swiss sportswear brand\u2019s attention. According to On, the shoe\u2019s uppers (the material above the sole) are made from a type of thermoplastic and colored and branded in three minutes using just a robotic arm. The upper is sprayed in one go and can be attached to the carbon-fiber and foam rubber sole using heat, not glue. The company claims its technology reduces the carbon emissions of producing a shoe\u2019s upper by 75%, compared to its other sneaker models. The material, which it dubs LightSpray, has \u201cthe potential\u2026 to move us towards a more sustainable, circular future,\u201d said Marc Maurer, On\u2019s co-CEO, in a press release. Sprayed-to-measure The technology will be on display at a pop up in Paris later this month as people flock to the capital for the 2024 Olympic Games. And while it is not yet known if which athletes other than Obiri will wear them at the Games, a number of Olympians have recently raced in the Cloudboom Strike LS, including Australian middle-distance runner Olli Hoare. The brand told CNN via email that it hopes athletes going to Paris who have previously worn the shoes \u2014 such as Irish 1,500-meter runner Luke McCann \u2014 will \u201ccontinue to choose them this summer.\u201d On is not the first company to experiment with spray-on textiles. In October 2022, luxury French fashion house Coperni made headlines when it sprayed a custom-fit dress onto model Bella Hadid at Paris Fashion Week. The label partnered with Manel Torres, whose brand Fabrican has been producing \u201cclothes-in-a-can\u201d for over 20 years. Spray-on fibers have also been used in the beauty industry, with \u201chair in a can\u201d solutions used to conceal bald spots and thinning hair. Having initially been made available to the public in April, the Cloudboom Strike LS will again go on sale to consumers later this year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/style/cloudboom-strike-spray-on-running-shoes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_europe_trump-vp-jd-vance-europe-ukraine-intl", "text": "Many of America\u2019s closest allies were already dreading the prospect of Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House. Now that the former president has picked JD Vance as his running mate, they potentially have a lot more to worry about. By choosing Vance, Trump has sent a clear signal that, if elected, his America-first foreign policy will be back in force. Vance, a junior senator for Ohio, is a staunch critic of sending support to Ukraine as it tries to defend itself against Russia. Like Trump, he has repeatedly criticized NATO and its European members for not spending enough on defense. And he has made a number of comments that have raised eyebrows across the pond \u2013 including when he said the United Kingdom would become the \u201cfirst truly Islamist country that will get a nuclear weapon\u201d under the new Labour government. His nomination puts an end to the hopes by some of America\u2019s allies that Trump might soften his foreign policy stance if reelected. That hope was fueled by Trump himself. While he has often repeated his claim that he \u201cwould end the war\u201d in Ukraine in one day if reelected and said he would not send any more money to Kyiv, he stopped short of getting his allies in Congress to block the $61 billion aid package approved earlier this year. \u201cHe could have told members (of the Congress) not to vote for it and instead he tacitly allowed it\u00a0to go through,\u201d said Kristine Berzina, a geopolitics and security expert who leads the German Marshall Fund of the United States\u2019 Geostrategy North program. \u201cSo there was a sense in Washington that Trump has been in a fairly pro-Ukrainian moment, and that he should have the benefit of the doubt \u2013 perhaps his views on Europe and Ukraine have evolved, especially given the much higher defense spending in Europe now,\u201d she\u00a0told CNN in an interview. But with the selection of his running mate, Trump dashed these hopes. \u201cJD Vance does not appear to be interested in being a good ally to Europe,\u201d Berzina said. At the Munich Security Conference in February, Vance suggested Ukraine should negotiate with Russia because the US and other allies do not have the capacity to support it. Ukraine and NATO have dismissed that scenario, because it would most likely mean Kyiv would have to give up some of its pre-war territory. \u201cI think what\u2019s reasonable to accomplish is some negotiated peace. I think Russia has incentive to come to the table right now. I think Ukraine, Europe and the United States have incentives to come to the table,\u201d he said at the conference, adding that the fact that Putin \u201cis a bad guy does not mean we can\u2019t engage in basic diplomacy.\u201d On Wednesday, Russia welcomed Vance\u2019s stance on Ukraine. \u201cHe (Vance) stands for peace, for cessation of aid. We can only welcome this because, in fact, it is necessary to stop pumping Ukraine with weapons, and the war will end,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a press conference at the United Nations. Lavrov added that Russia \u201cwill be ready to work with any American leader elected by the American people\u201d as long as this leader \u201cis ready for an equitable, mutually respectful dialogue.\u201d In Munich, Vance notably skipped a key meeting between a bipartisan delegation of US senators and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d learn anything new there. He did attend a meeting with Zelensky in Washington in December but left early. Asked by CNN\u2019s Kaitlin Collins about Vance\u2019s assertion that the outcome of the war would not change even if Ukraine received US funding, Zelensky said Vance did \u201cnot understand what is going on here.\u201d \u201cTo understand it is to come to the frontline to see what\u2019s going on\u2026 without this support. And he will understand that millions of people will be killed,\u201d he added. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand it, of course, God bless you don\u2019t have the war on your territory.\u201d Pivot to China Vance has argued that the US should turn its focus away from Russia and toward\u00a0East Asia. Earlier this week, he said the war in Ukraine must be brought to a \u201crapid close\u201d so that America could focus on \u201cthe real issue, which is China.\u201d That\u2019s the \u201cbiggest threat to our country and we\u2019re completely distracted from it,\u201d Vance said in an interview with Fox News Monday. In an op-ed published in the New York Times in April, Vance also argued that US efforts to supply Ukraine with air defense systems could be detrimental to Taiwan\u2019s defense in the event of a Chinese invasion of the self-ruled island claimed by Beijing. \u201cThese weapons are not only needed by Ukraine. If China were to set its sights on Taiwan, the Patriot missile system would be critical to its defense,\u201d he wrote. The idea that East Asia, and China specifically, poses as big, if not a bigger, threat to the US than Russia is not unique to Vance. Trevor McCrisken, an US foreign policy expert and associate professor at the University of Warwick, said there is bipartisan agreement between Democrats and Republicans that China is the biggest threat internationally to US interests. \u201cBoth parties say you\u2019ve got to be strong, and you\u2019ve got to prevent China from fulfilling whatever ambitions it might have, economically, militarily, and so on. It\u2019s just that most Democrats and the more moderate Republicans believe that Russia is also a threat,\u201d he told CNN in an interview. In the eyes of most Western leaders, the threats from China and Russia go hand in hand. Just last week, NATO leaders called China a \u201cdecisive enabler\u201d of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine in the alliance\u2019s most forceful statement on Beijing\u2019s involvement in the conflict. \u201cTo have a rather simplistic view that if you back away from Ukraine that\u2019s going to help you with China, it might not be the case,\u201d McCrisken said, adding that Vance is likely trying to use his more anti-European stance for political reasons too. \u201cIt is a way of painting Europe as not standing up for itself when it should. Historically, the US has had to go in and bail out Europe so many times.\u201d Sam Greene, the director of the Democratic Resilience Program at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) and a professor of Russian politics at King\u2019s College London, said Vance\u2019s nomination should make it clear to America\u2019s allies that the shift toward the Trumpian kind of Republican foreign policy is likely more long-term. \u201cThe last time we had a Trump presidency, I think Europeans looked at this as potentially a four-year blip, and then breathed a sigh of relief when Biden was elected and thought that we\u2019d return to normal \u2026 and I think that there was some wishful thinking in that, and people have now begun to recognize that,\u201d he said. The effect of this shift, Greene said, is apparent even now \u2013 despite the White House being in Democratic hands. US President Joe Biden had an extremely hard time getting the latest Ukraine aid package through Congress, forcing Ukraine\u2019s European allies to start thinking about a plan B. The initial delay in Congress approving the package resulted in a Czech-led initiative to find and fund alternative sources of ammunition for Kyiv, among other efforts to look for assistance elsewhere. \u201cThe unreliability of American leadership in Europe has been a fact that Europeans have now had some time to get used to. Even if Biden is reelected, America will be difficult to rely on,\u201d Greene said. If Trump chose someone with a more traditional foreign policy stance to be a running mate \u2013 for example the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, America\u2019s allies could have hoped that post-Trump, the Republican party might pivot back to what Greene called \u201ctrans-Atlantic solidarity.\u201d \u201cBut if in fact, not only are we looking at another Trump administration, but we\u2019re looking at a future of the Republican Party that is dominated by people like JD Vance, then that is a much more sobering prospect for Europe,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/europe/trump-vp-jd-vance-europe-ukraine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/20/2024", "section": "world"}}
