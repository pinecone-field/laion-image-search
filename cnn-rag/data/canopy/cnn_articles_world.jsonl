The court sentenced Finnegan Lee Elder to 15 years and two months in prison and Gabriel Natale-Hjorth to 11 years and four months in prison \u2013 further reductions from the original life sentences both men were handed in 2021, after a jury convicted them of murder, according to Craig Peters, the US lawyer representing the Elder family. Elder and Natale-Hjorth were arrested in 2019 while on vacation in Rome for the murder of the Italian police officer Mario Cerciello Rega, who was stabbed 11 times with a knife in a botched drug deal, police said at the time. In 2022, Reuters reported that the appeals court had lowered Elder\u2019s sentence to 24 years, and Natale-Hjorth\u2019s sentence to 22 years. \u201cElder admitted killing Rega, but both he and Natale-Hjorth said they had acted in self-defense because they thought (Rega and another police officer) who were not in uniform were thugs out to get them after a botched attempt to buy drugs,\u201d the news agency reported at the time. Italy\u2019s highest Cassation Court ordered a new trial in 2023. \u201cThe decision rendered today has highlighted a legal qualification of the conduct on that tragic night that is certainly more in line with Finnegan\u2019s actual responsibilities,\u201d Renato Borzone and Roberto Capra, the Italian lawyers for the Americans, said in their statement. They added that the court had not yet given its reasoning for the verdict. However, they added that the court\u2019s recognition that, at the time of the incident, Elder could not have known Rega was a police officer, allows the case \u201cto be viewed quite differently.\u201d \u201cIt is regrettable that we have had to wait through five levels of jurisdiction to see recognized what the young American man has stated since his first interrogation,\u201d the joint statement said. Elder\u2019s father Ethan said in the statement that \u201cit should not be forgotten that this trial is connected to the tragedy of a person\u2019s death\u201d but he \u201cfelt it was right\u201d to bring out the \u201ctruth of the facts\u201d to help his son. \u201cFrom the very first moment, (Elder) stated that he did not understand that they were (policemen) and that he had reacted to a blocking attempt,\u201d Ethan said in the statement. \u201cBut he could not rest because no one believed him.\u201d \u201cI hope that while he will pay for his mistake, it will also open up hope for him in the future,\u201d the statement ends.

{"id": "2024_07_05_middleeast_idf-former-spokesman-blames-government-war-intl", "text": "A former spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces has sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s conduct of the war against Hamas, in the latest sign of growing tensions between the military and the government. Lt Col. Peter Lerner said that while speaking with the world\u2019s media on behalf of the military, he came to realize the \u201closs of international trust in Israel and the government\u2019s failure to maintain widespread support for the war against Hamas over time.\u201d\u00a0Lerner served in the IDF for more than 25 years \u2013 most recently as a spokesman during the war, before stepping down last month. Lerner was speaking in an extended interview with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. \u201cNetanyahu promised a complete victory over Hamas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the international arena he and his government led us to defeat.\u201d Lerner told Haaretz that in the early days of the conflict, following Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on October 7, \u201cThere was a clear understanding that Hamas is an evil and dangerous organization, and that Israel must act against it.\u201d That goodwill quickly eroded, he said, partly because of the inevitable suffering of Palestinian civilians as the IDF began the ground invasion of Gaza. But he also blamed the government, saying \u201cthere is no political strategy for the war, even after nine months in which we are fighting on two fronts.\u201d Lerner said that as he was increasingly asked about the goals of the operation, \u201cI quickly realized that I had no answers to these questions, not because they haven\u2019t been decided yet, but because they simply aren\u2019t going to be decided.\u201d He said he felt like \u201ca soldier who goes to guard without cartridges\u2026 I don\u2019t have the ammunition I need to deal with the interviewers\u2019 questions. I just had to say that I am speaking on behalf of the army, and that these questions are the responsibility of the government. But the government also had no answers, because it was politically inconvenient.\u201d Lerner was also critical of ministers who \u2013 he maintained \u2013 had reduced the legitimacy of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. \u201cHamas damaged almost all the power lines that connect Gaza to Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had the opportunity to come and say: Hamas is harming the citizens of Gaza, and we, Israel, will try to fix it, but only if he stops the shooting. Instead, the Minister of Energy at the time, Israel Katz, comes out with populist statements about the fact that he will cut them off from electricity and will not deliver fuel to them either.\u201d Lerner quoted a remark by Netanyahu in 2016 that the test in the field of propaganda is very simple: Were your hands tied when you wanted to defend yourself? He said the Prime Minister had failed that test \u201cmiserably. The US and the UK are cancelling arm s shipments, France forbids us to participate in a large arms exhibition. We delayed for months the entrance to Rafah. This issue requires a state inquiry commission, just like the failures of October 7.\u201d Lerner\u2019s remarks follow multiple accounts of tensions between Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s military leadership. Last week, Netanyahu rejected the idea of starting a ceasefire in Gaza while Hamas remains in power, after the New York Times published an article\u00a0citing six current and former security officials who said a truce would give Israeli troops time to prepare for a potential land war with Hezbollah. The officials, most of whom spoke anonymously to \u201cdiscuss sensitive security matters,\u201d also said a truce would be the most effective way to secure the release of the Israeli hostages. Former Israeli National Security Advisor Eyal Hulata, who according to the Times maintains regular communication with \u201csenior miliary officials,\u201d spoke on the record, saying, \u201cthe military is in full support of a hostage deal and a cease-fire\u2026 they believe that they can always go back and engage Hamas militarily in the future.\u201d In a statement, Netanyahu said, \u201cI do not know who these anonymous sources are, but I am here to make it unequivocally clear: This will not happen. The war will end once Israel achieves all of its objectives, including the destruction of Hamas and the release of all of our hostages.\u201d That report came days after Israel\u2019s\u00a0top military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Hamas could not be destroyed, and that anyone who claimed otherwise was \u201cthrowing sand in the eyes of the public\u201d \u2013 an implicit criticism of Netanyahu, who has repeatedly pledged to eliminate the group.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/middleeast/idf-former-spokesman-blames-government-war-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact", "text": "As Google has rushed to incorporate artificial intelligence into its core products \u2014 with sometimes less-than-stellar results \u2014 a problem has been brewing behind the scenes: the systems needed to power its AI tools have vastly increased the company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. AI systems need lots of computers to make them work. The data centers needed to run them, essentially warehouses full of powerful computing equipment, suck up tons of energy to process data and manage the heat all of those computers produce. The end result has been that Google\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have soared 48% since 2019, according to the tech giant\u2019s annual environment report. The tech giant blamed that growth mainly on \u201cincreased data center energy consumption and supply chain emissions.\u201d Now, Google is calling its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 \u201cextremely ambitious,\u201d and said the pledge is likely to be affected by \u201cthe uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, which is complex and difficult to predict.\u201d In other words: a sustainability push by the company \u2014 which once included the slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in its code of conduct \u2014 has gotten more complicated thanks to AI. Google, like other tech rivals, has gone all-in on investing in AI, which is widely seen as the next major tech revolution that\u2019s poised to change how we live, work and consume information. The company has integrated its Gemini generative AI technology into some of its core products, including Search and Google Assistant, and CEO Sundar Pichai has called Google an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d But AI comes with a major downside: the power-hungry data centers that Google and other Big Tech rivals are currently spending tens of billions of dollars each quarter to expand in order to fuel their AI ambitions. Illustrating just how much more demanding AI models are than traditional computing systems, the International Energy Agency estimates that a Google search query requires 0.3 watt-hours of electricity on average, while a ChatGPT request typically consumes about 2.9 watt-hours. An October\u00a0study\u00a0from Dutch researcher Alex de Vries estimated that the \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d suggests Google\u2019s AI systems could eventually consume as much electricity as the country of Ireland each year, assuming a full-scale adoption of AI in their current hardware and software. \u201cAs we further integrate AI into our products, reducing emissions may be challenging due to increasing energy demands from the greater intensity of AI compute, and the emissions associated with the expected increases in our technical infrastructure investment,\u201d Google said in its report, published Monday. It added that data center electricity consumption is currently growing faster than it can bring carbon-free electricity sources online. Google said it expects its total greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise before falling, as the company seeks to invest in clean energy sources, such as wind and geothermal energy, to power its data centers. The large amounts of water used as coolant needed to prevent data centers from overheating also presents a sustainability challenge. Google says it aims to replenish 120% of the freshwater it consumes in its offices and data centers by 2030; last year, it replenished just 18% of that water, although the amount was up sharply from 6% the year prior. Google is also among companies experimenting with ways to use AI to fight climate change. A 2019 Google DeepMind project, for example, trained an AI model on weather forecasts and historical wind turbine data to predict the availability of wind power, helping to increase the value of the renewable energy source for wind farmers. The company has also used AI to suggest more fuel-efficient routes to drivers using Google Maps. \u201cWe know that scaling AI and using it to accelerate climate action is just as crucial as addressing the environmental impact associated with it,\u201d Google said in the report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/google-ai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-environmental-impact/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_middleeast_pezeshkian-wins-irans-vote-intl-hnk", "text": "Reformist candidate Masoud Pezeshkian has won Iran\u2019s presidential election, the country\u2019s electoral authority said Saturday, defeating his hardline rival in a pivotal vote amid heightened tensions both domestically and internationally. Out of 30.5 million votes counted in Friday\u2019s runoff, Pezeshkian won 53.6%, edging out ultraconservative Saeed Jalili, who had 44.3% of the votes, state-run Press TV reported. Voter turnout was 49.8%, Press TV reported. Pezeshkian was elected in a second round of voting after securing the highest number of ballots in the first round, ahead of Jalili. The first round saw the lowest voter turnout for a presidential election since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979. In a victory speech in Tehran on Saturday, Pezeshkian thanked the Iranian people and vowed to serve as a \u201cvoice of the voiceless.\u201d \u201cI am the servant of the people of Iran. We will serve you, dear people of our country,\u201d Pezeshkian said at the burial site of Imam Khomeini, the leader of Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution and the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The 69-year-old trained heart surgeon and lawmaker acknowledged the challenges facing the country as he called for unity in what he described as a new chapter for Iran. \u201cLet\u2019s come together, let\u2019s stick together, let\u2019s get united and work together,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would be able to deal with every aspect and area of the government: economic, financial, military and social challenges.\u201d The country\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, thanked the candidates and congratulated the president-elect. Khamenei praised the country for quickly holding \u201cfree and transparent elections\u201d in the wake of President Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s death. A snap election was held after Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May in Iran\u2019s remote northwest, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other officials. Khamenei advised Pezeshkian to act \u201cin continuation of the path\u201d of Raisi. The Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member body tasked with overseeing elections and legislation, must certify the vote before Pezeshkian can take office. Pezeshkian will take the helm in a country that is facing increasing international isolation, internal discontent, a spiraling economy and the prospect of direct conflict with its archenemy Israel. The lawmaker was the only reformist candidate vying for the top elected seat in the country after dozens of other candidates were barred from running. He has favored dialogue with Iran\u2019s foes, particularly over its nuclear program, and sees that as a means to address the country\u2019s domestic issues. \u201cThe primary issue is the perspective: Do we want to solve our problems with the world or not? I believe we must get out of the deadlock to solve the country\u2019s problems,\u201d he said at a presidential debate ahead of the second round of voting. The leaders of Russia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Syria were among the first to congratulate Pezeshkian. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman said he was \u201ckeen to develop and deepen the relations that bring together our two countries and peoples, and serve our common interests,\u201d according to state-run Saudi Press Agency. Russian President Vladimir Putin said he hoped Pezeshkian\u2019s election would expand bilateral cooperation \u201cin all areas\u201d in the interest of \u201csimplifying regional security and stability,\u201d according to a statement from the Kremlin. The US State Department acknowledged Pezeshkian\u2019s victory, but said the elections \u201cwere not free or fair\u201d and would \u201cnot have a significant impact on our approach to Iran.\u201d \u201cWe have no expectation these elections will lead to fundamental change in Iran\u2019s direction or more respect for the human rights of its citizens,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said. While the Iranian president does enjoy some powers, the ultimate authority lies with the Supreme Leader, who has the final say on all matters of state. Who is Masoud Pezeshkian? A health minister under reformist president Mohammad Khatami, Pezeshkian is a trained heart surgeon and lawmaker. He gained prominence for his stance against the crackdown on the 2009 pro-democracy protests and violence perpetrated by the notorious morality police in 2022 in the wake of Mahsa Amini\u2019s death. Amini died in the custody of the morality police after being detained for not adhering to the Islamic Republic\u2019s strict dress code for women. Hundreds were killed and thousands arrested as the authorities sought to crush the protests, according to the United Nations. During the 2022 protests, Pezeshkian said in an interview with Iran\u2019s IRINN TV: \u201cIt is our fault. We want to implement religious faith through the use of force. This is scientifically impossible.\u201d \u201cI bear part of the blame, the distinguished religious scholars and the mosques bear part of the blame, and the (Iranian) broadcasting authority bears part of the blame,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody should step forward and be held accountable, rather than capture that girl, beat her up, and eventually deliver her body (to her family).\u201d He has presented himself as a candidate for all Iranians. \u201cAmong my supporters are both left and right, even those who do not pray,\u201d he said at a recent presidential debate. After losing his wife and one of his children in a 1994 car crash, he devoted much of his time to politics. Pezeshkian ran for president in the 2013 and 2021 elections, but failed to make headway. The 69-year-old hails from an ethnically mixed family \u2013 his father is Azeri and his mother is Kurdish. Persian isn\u2019t his mother tongue. That has burnished his image for Iran\u2019s minorities but left him open to xenophobic attacks from some opponents. Can he bring change to Iran? Experts say a more moderate face in the presidency could facilitate dialogue between Iran and Western states. Domestically, Pezeshkian may also introduce some social changes, which he emphasized during his electoral campaign, though experts caution that such moves are far from guaranteed. Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, said it\u2019s unlikely that Pezeshkian\u2019s election would immediately translate into policy changes. \u201cBut Pezeshkian has made it clear that he will try to work through and within the system in order to perhaps accommodate a less repressive environment.\u201d The reformist did not guarantee that he could make those changes, Vakil said, adding that this demonstrates the limits of presidential powers in Iran. \u201cBut it may add a bit more room for maneuver on social freedoms,\u201d she noted. Ra\u2019na Rajabi, an Iranian woman, she was happy that Pezeshkian was elected. \u201cHonestly speaking, I just hope the expensiveness decreases, and jobs are easily found for young people, and that\u2019s it, I do not have any other special feelings,\u201d she said, adding that she hoped \u201cgirls and people can easily walk in the street without being anxious about anyone picking on them.\u201d Other factors may be more difficult to change, particularly Iran\u2019s foreign policy. Pezeshkian assumes the presidency at a time when his country is embroiled in escalating tensions with Israel and its Western allies, triggered by the war in Gaza and the advancement of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Just three months ago, Iran and Israel exchanged fire for the first time as the Gaza conflict widened. Israel is now preparing for a potential second front against Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s primary regional proxy, in Lebanon. Rhetoric between Iran and Israel escalated last week as Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations said that should Israel \u201cembark on full-scale military aggression\u201d against Lebanon, then \u201can obliterating war will ensue.\u201d \u201cAll options, including the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table,\u201d it said on X. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded that \u201ca regime that threatens destruction deserves to be destroyed.\u201d Pezeshkian is not expected to change the current trajectory on Israel, experts said. He has also praised General Qasem Soleimani, the controversial head of the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, who was assassinated in a US strike in 2020. \u201cI consider him a source of national pride and a thorn in the eyes of our enemies,\u201d he said in a recent presidential debate. A friendlier face to the West But while Western states aren\u2019t expecting this election to change their relationship with Iran, Pezeshkian is certainly their preferred candidate, as his opponent would have only escalated those existing tensions, experts said. Former Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, a key ally of Pezeshkian and a reformist who oversaw a comparatively warm period of international relations nearly a decade ago, has been mooted as a potential candidate to reoccupy his old post under the new president. Zarif was Iran\u2019s top diplomat when the regime struck a deal with the US and world powers to limit Tehran\u2019s nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief (a deal that has since all but collapsed). While he is popular among Iranian youth, he has also faced criticism from hardliners at home for being too friendly to the West. \u201cWith Mr. Pezeshkian, the sanctions will likely be lifted, and that\u2019s very good for people,\u201d Hossein Imani, a Tehran resident, said. \u201cI have a positive feeling (about Pezeshkian) for now, with the condition that he fulfils the promises he has made.\u201d Ahead of the elections, however, Supreme Leader Khamenei condemned those seeking improved relations with the West. And Pezeshkian has publicly stated that he would defer to Khamenei on matters of foreign policy, so Zarif\u2019s appointment is far from assured.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/middleeast/pezeshkian-wins-irans-vote-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_middleeast_destruction-inside-rafa-gaza-israel-intl", "text": "Thick clouds of dirt and sand fill the air as our convoy of Humvees arrives in Rafah, the first time international reporters have been allowed in since the Israeli military launched its\u00a0ground\u00a0assault on this city two months ago. As the dust settles, the scale of destruction is startling. But it is also all-too familiar. This part of\u00a0Rafah,\u00a0Gaza\u2019s southernmost city which became the\u00a0last refuge for more than a million Palestinians\u00a0earlier in the war,\u00a0is\u00a0now unrecognizable. Israel has repeatedly described its ground operation in Rafah as \u201climited.\u201d But in this neighborhood in southern Rafah, the destruction looks almost identical to what I\u2019ve seen in northern Gaza, in central Gaza and in Khan Younis through the limited prism of trips into Gaza with the Israeli military. Some homes are\u00a0flattened and\u00a0other\u00a0buildings bombed out. \u201cThis is where the main destruction is because it was booby-trapped and because the tunnels were booby trapped,\u201d Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the IDF\u2019s top spokesman, tells me when I press him on how this represents a \u201climited\u201d operation. \u201cAnd\u00a0when you see destruction, it\u2019s because either the houses were booby trapped, either when we demolished a tunnel the houses\u00a0fell apart, or that Hamas fired from those houses and risked our forces and we had no other method but to make sure that our forces were safe,\u201d\u00a0Hagari added. Other parts of Rafah are not nearly as devastated, he says. But CNN cannot independently verify his claims: Israel has barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza independently and our only access is via embeds with the Israeli military. And this devastated section of Rafah is where they have brought us. The Israeli military has brought us here not to see the destruction, but to talk about why they launched an offensive here in the first place,\u00a0what they\u00a0say they\u2019ve uncovered\u00a0and what they\u2019ve accomplished. Before arriving into Rafah, we drive along Gaza-Egypt border:\u00a0through\u00a0what\u2019s known as the Philadelphi corridor.\u00a0The area\u00a0was seized by the\u00a0Israeli military, which\u00a0says it has uncovered dozens of tunnel shafts as well as rocket launchers used to fire rockets into Israel. Hagari showed us one tunnel shaft, which he said stretched about 90 feet\u00a0(28\u00a0meters)\u00a0underground. The Israeli military says Hamas has used the Philadelphi corridor to smuggle weapons in from Egypt and then deeper into the rest of the Gaza Strip. Hagari says some of the tunnels stretch toward Egypt, but he cannot yet definitively say whether those tunnels were functional and were used to smuggle weapons into Gaza. Egypt has denied that there are any tunnels stretching into its territory from Gaza. \u201cWe are researching those tunnels carefully and making sure which ones were functional and which are not functional anymore because maybe they were \u2013 from the Egyptian side \u2013 stopped,\u201d Hagari says. He won\u2019t say exactly how long Israeli forces will need to\u00a0occupy\u00a0this corridor, but says it could be weeks or months. Hagari also says Israeli forces killed more than 900 Hamas fighters in Rafah\u00a0and are close to defeating Hamas\u2019s Rafah brigade. But how many militants have melted away and are likely to regroup once Israeli forces leave this area is less clear \u2013 and absent a long-term strategy or an alternative to Hamas governance in Gaza, Hamas has already begun to do just that in other areas where Israeli forces had previously withdrawn. As for the Rafah ground operation, Hagari cannot say whether it will be the last\u00a0in Gaza. \u201cI won\u2019t say that because what you will see is when we\u2019ll have intelligence that maybe there are hostages in one of the points in Gaza, we will operate and do a raid. If we\u2019ll get intelligence in one of those areas that Hamas terrorists are preparing a terror attack against Israelis or our forces, we will do a raid and attack,\u201d Hagari says. \u201cThis is what you\u2019ll see.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/middleeast/destruction-inside-rafa-gaza-israel-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_bananas-artificial-hair-cheverux-organique-spc", "text": "During a visit to a local farm while working with development agency USAID, Ugandan entrepreneur Juliet Tumusiime realized that a huge amount of banana stems are left over from banana cultivation and simply discarded. Looking for a way to use the waste, she struck upon an innovative business idea. Almost a decade later, now aged 42, Tumusiime is the chief executive and co-founder of Cheveux Organique, which manufactures hair made from banana fibers as an alternative to synthetic extensions. Fashion trends among the younger population and growing purchasing power have boosted the market for hair extensions and wigs in the Africa and the Middle East, which could be worth $710 million by 2028, according to Research and Markets. Extensions are typically made from human hair, or synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, acrylic and PVC. Synthetics are popular in Uganda because they\u2019re much cheaper, but they\u2019re not biodegradable or easy to recycle. Some people complain that synthetic hair can irritate their scalp and a study of synthetic hair in Nigeria found the presence of potentially harmful heavy metals and chemicals. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to friends, colleagues, both men and women and asked them how they dispose of their hair when they take it out,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cA lot of the time it is just thrown in the trash. The level of awareness is really low - most people don\u2019t realize that they are wearing plastic on their head which can irritate the skin and cause pollution. \u201cOur mission is to transform the beauty industry by providing alternatives that benefit their health and the environment. We want to empower women to make informed decisions about what hair they use and what\u2019s best for them.\u201d Tumusiime says that, unlike synthetic hair, her product is biodegradable, durable and can be easily styled, treated and colored. It can also be rewashed with warm water and conditioned with detangling cream. When dry, the hypoallergenic hair can be oiled and can withstand dryers and heat up to 400 degrees, lasting weeks longer than synthetic alternatives, according to Tumusiime. Since it\u2019s made from discarded banana stems, she adds, it\u2019s also a way to help curb that waste. Uganda is Africa\u2019s largest producer and consumer of bananas, producing about 10 million metric tons of bananas per day. Ugandans consume almost one kilogram of the fruit per person, per day, with more than 75% of the population relying on bananas as a staple food, according to the World Economic Forum. Cheveux Organique works closely with local banana farmers, buying stems that would otherwise be discarded. The stems are split and the fibers extracted by machine. The extracted fibers are then dried and treated, before being combed out, resulting in the hair-like texture. The \u201chair\u201d is dyed into three shades: Cheveux Black, Cheveux Brown and Cheveux Blonde. Tumusiime says it has a natural sheen, is soft to the touch and can be used for braiding and styling. It\u2019s also suitable for warm and humid climates, she notes. The company isn\u2019t unique in creating plant-based hair. In the US, St.Louis-based Rebundle also sells hair extensions made from banana fibers, while Nourie Hair offers a hair alternative for braiding made from Ginseng root extract and rosemary. However, turning banana waste into a premium product does not come without challenges for Cheveux Organique. \u201cThe labor-intensive process, from picking the stems, transporting them to the facility, extracting the stems, treating them and the power needed to use this \u2013 it causes the product to become pricey,\u201d Tumusiime says. Cheveux Organique sells its plant-based hair in Uganda, and as fair afield as the US, France and the UK. It retails for $50 for 150 grams (5.3 ounces), which Tumusiime says is cheaper than a typical $185 for a similar amount of human hair. But synthetic hair can be bought for as little as $1 for a bundle. \u201cThis is something that we are hugely concerned about, and we are trying to find ways to mechanize the business and produce volumes of hair whilst continuing to break even,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cThe people paying these prices are getting a premium product at the end of it \u2013 and it\u2019s about the long-term benefits that this product brings.\u201d Tumusiime says her startup, which currently employs 25 permanent staff members and 100 part-time workers for waste gathering, is in the process of creating regional hubs, which will function as extraction centers, as well as an education point for young people. The hubs will train future generations on the positive impacts of waste management, as well as giving young people skillsets \u2013 such as extraction and machine operation \u2013 that will equip them for future careers. \u201cWe want to make sure that this brand is a household name,\u201d Tumusiime says. \u201cWe want to become leaders in this industry despite challenges. But I\u2019m passionate about what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not about to give up.

The ruling by a court in the Romanian capital of Bucharest means Tate, his brother Tristan and two further defendants may travel freely within the EU until their trial, according to CNN affiliate and Romanian outlet Antena 3. A spokesperson for the Tate brothers called the ruling a \u201csignificant victory and a major step forward\u201d in their ongoing case. \u201cWe embrace and applaud the decision of the court today, I consider it a reflection of the exemplary behaviour and assistance of my clients.

The list includes customarily hot Las Vegas, where temperatures are expected to be near 114 degrees Saturday and even hotter Sunday, when it could break the daily record of 116. Nearly 130 million people in both the West and East are under heat alerts across 18 states and the District of Columbia. \u201cThese conditions will be extremely dangerous and potentially deadly if not taken seriously,\u201d meteorologists with the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center said in a forecast discussion. \u201cThe multi-day nature of the heat and record warm overnight temperatures will cause heat stress to build in people without adequate cooling and hydration.\u201d The dangerous heat will expand into the Intermountain West and northern High Plains by next week, forecasters say. Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the\u00a0weather service. In\u00a0San\u00a0Jose, California, a homeless man\u00a0died Tuesday due to the extreme heat, Mayor Matt Mahan said.\u00a0The man was 69, according to the mayor\u2019s spokesperson, Tasha Dean, citing information from the\u00a0Santa Clara Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. The same day, a 10-year-old\u00a0died in Arizona\u00a0after experiencing a heat-related emergency while hiking with family in South Mountain Park and Preserve, the Phoenix Police Department said. Also in Arizona, a 69-year-old hiker from Austin, Texas, died last week after hiking at the Grand Canyon, according to the National Park Service. Heat was a contributing factor, officials said. Major to extreme heat risk, the highest 2 levels, are expected for much of California and the Southwest on Saturday and Sunday, meaning health impacts from heat become more likely in anyone without adequate hydration or cooling. Even in the Pacific Northwest, the heat is punishing Parts of Oregon will experience triple digits up to five days with poor overnight relief, the\u00a0National Weather Service in Portland\u00a0said Friday. A\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0was declared in Multnomah County, Oregon\u2019s most populous county, for this weekend\u00a0as temperatures were expected to climb. \u201cI\u2019m particularly worried about the thousands of people heading to music festivals and sporting events this weekend,\u201d Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Richard Bruno said in a news release. \u201cThey\u2019ll be spending a long time outside, may have little access to shade and water and may not recognize the risk.\u201d Bruno said the area has had few hot days so far this year, and residents\u2019 bodies have not yet acclimated to the heat. Other areas of the West were experiencing unusual heat. Palm Springs, California, reached 124 degrees Friday afternoon, exceeding the previous all-time record high for the date of 123 degrees set in 2021. An all-time record high of 105 set in 2012 was broken in Raleigh, North Carolina, where temperatures of 106 degrees were recorded Friday. Additional daily record highs set Friday included: \u2022 127 degrees: Death Valley, California\u2022 114 degrees: San Jacinto, California\u2022 109 degrees:\u00a0Medford, Oregon\u2022 109 degrees: Campo, California The weather service said more than 35 million people in the contiguous United States will see temperatures in excess of 100 degrees in the next seven days. Conditions ripe for wildfire spread The extreme heat \u2013 combined with gusty winds and low humidity \u2013 means any wildfires that start will spread quickly through already parched vegetation. Red flag warnings are in effect through Saturday night across the West, including in the area of the\u00a0Thompson Fire, which has consumed more than 3,700 acres in California\u2019s Butte County since it was reported Tuesday. The blaze, which was 71% contained by Saturday morning, has forced thousands of people to evacuate and prompted about 2,000 firefighters to battle the flames under the extreme heat and extremely dry conditions in the Oroville area. The wildfire has injured 11 firefighters, including eight who were affected by heat-related illnesses, according to Chris Peterson, a spokesperson for the\u00a0California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection\u00a0\u2013 also known as Cal Fire. Twenty-six structures have been destroyed by the blaze and more than 450 are under threat. In Central California, four firefighters have been injured battling the 908-acre French Fire about 55 miles north of Fresno, according to Cal Fire. The blaze is 25% contained. \u201cChallenges are immense. We\u2019re dealing with the increased temperatures, very steep and remote terrain,\u201d Cal Fire deputy director of communications Nick Schuler told CNN, adding \u201cthe ability for rapid growth from the amount of vegetation that\u2019s across the state is a challenge.\u201d The largest current fire in the state is on federal land, with the Basin Fire having consumed more than 14,000 acres. According to officials with Sierra National Forest, the fire is 46% contained and hasn\u2019t grown much in the past day. The state\u2019s been seeing an active fire season, with more than 150,000 acres burned so far in 2024 compared to 8,674 acres burned by this time last year, according to\u00a0Cal Fire. There are now nearly two dozen active wildfires of varying sizes burning across California, and the Thompson Fire is among the largest where\u00a0Cal Fire is the lead agency. California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0for the area of the Thompson Fire on Wednesday. The declaration cleared the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. It will feel like 110 in some areas of the South and mid-Atlantic As the West swelters, hazardous heat persists in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast and humidity will make it feel like up to 110 degrees at times.  Heat advisories are in place from the beaches of Alabama and Florida all the way to upstate New York. \u201cTake extra precautions when outside.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.

{"id": "2024_07_05_asia_japan-us-fighter-jets-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "The US military will send dozens of its newest fighter jets to Japan as part of a $10 billion upgrade of its forces in the country, the Defense Department announced Wednesday. In a news release, the Pentagon said the effort would be carried out \u201cover the next several years\u201d to \u201cenhance the US-Japan Alliance, bolster regional deterrence, and strengthen peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\u201d The modernization plan will see 48 fifth-generation F-35A fighters replace 36 F-16s at Misawa Air Base in northern Japan, and 36 brand-new F-15EX jets deploy to Kadena Air Base on the southern island of Okinawa, replacing 48 older F-15C/D models that have been pulled from the region in the past year, the Pentagon release said. At Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, just south of Hiroshima on the main island of Honshu, the number of deployed F-35B aircraft will be modified, the Pentagon said, without giving specific numbers. \u201cThe Department\u2019s plan to station the Joint Force\u2019s most advanced tactical aircraft in Japan demonstrates the ironclad U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan and both countries\u2019 shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region,\u201d the news release said. Japan said basing the new fighter aircraft in the country would enhance US capabilities there. \u201cIn the face of the most severe and complex security environment since the end of World War II, and amidst the increased military activities of neighboring countries, the United States is maintaining and strengthening the presence of U.S. forces in Japan to further enhance the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. alliance,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, the government\u2019s top spokesman, said at a regular briefing Thursday. Japan\u2019s alliance with the US has become increasingly important in a region that is seeing China, Russia and North Korea all pose threats that Tokyo seeks to counter. Japan has festering territorial disputes in the north with Russia and with China over islands in the East China Sea. Meanwhile, North Korea\u2019s growing missile program, which has seen Pyongyang send missiles over Japanese territory in recent years, draws condemnation from Tokyo with every projectile test. Japan also keeps a wary eye on the situation surrounding Taiwan, the self-ruled democratic island that the Chinese Communist Party has vowed to bring under Beijing\u2019s control, by force if necessary. As much as 90% of Japan\u2019s energy supplies come via sea lanes near Taiwan, according to Tokyo, which sees the status quo around the island as key to its security. Okinawa is only about 450 miles (725 kilometers) from Taiwan, and both the US and Japan maintain key air bases on the island. US air power in Japan The US Air Force calls the Kadena Air Base, home of the 18th Wing, its \u201cKeystone of the Pacific,\u201d and for more than four decades the older model F-15s based there were central to US deterrence in the region. But from 2022, as the twin-engine fighters neared the end of their service life, the US Air Force began pulling them from Kadena. While the service has rotated other assets through the air base since, to cover the absence of the older F-15s, the permanent presence of the F-15EXs will bring stability to the force structure. The F-15EX is a leap above the older models. Manufacturer Boeing says the jet has \u201cunparalleled weapons capacity,\u201d with an ability to carry 12 advanced medium-range, air-to-air missiles (AMRAAM) and\u00a0to fire them from a range \u201cfarther than any other fighter in the US Air Force arsenal.\u201d Although not a stealth fighter like the F-35, Boeing says the F-15EX has next-generation survivability. \u201cIt serves as a long-range standoff weapons system that is also capable of penetrating and surviving in highly contested environments,\u201d the company says on its website. Military aviation analyst Peter Layton said the F-15EXs would be a worry for China in the event of any conflict. The jet can be fitted with stealthy long-range cruise missiles with a range of more than 500 miles (800 kilometers) that could strike inside the Chinese mainland, he said. Newer missiles under development could double that distance, he added. \u201cThat will hold at risk even more Chinese mainland military bases and offer a very quick attack option,\u201d Layton said. The F-15EX is the Air Force\u2019s newest fighter jet, with the first operational plane delivered to the Oregon Air National Guard in early June. The F-35As that will be stationed at Misawa Air Base are the Air Force\u2019s newest stealth fighters. They\u2019ve long been designated as the replacement for F-16s in the USAF inventory. F-35s deliver \u201can enhanced capability to survive in the advanced threat environment in which it was designed to operate,\u201d an Air Force fact sheet says. Layton said the F-15EXs and F-35As complement each other well in a combat scenario. \u201cThe F-35 is an excellent low-observable sensor platform that could operate forward in stealth mode relaying data back to patrolling F-15EXs with their supersonic cruise and large air-to-air missile load outs,\u201d said Layton, a fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and former Royal Australian Air Force officer. The aircraft deployments add to other improvements Washington has been making to its force structure in Japan, where the US has more than 50,000 troops. Okinawa houses more than 25,000 US military personnel and more than two dozen military installations. Roughly 70% of the US military bases in Japan are on Okinawa. The US and Japan announced last year that a newly redesignated Marine unit with advanced intelligence, surveillance capabilities and the ability to fire anti-ship missiles would be based in Japan.

The seven-time world champion rolled back the years to take his first race win since the 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and a record-extending ninth victory at Silverstone, prompting delirious celebrations from the packed home crowd as a tearful Hamilton paraded around the track, holding the Union Jack aloft from his car. And it was his old rival, Max Verstappen, who Hamilton fought off to secure the win as the Red Bull driver chipped away at the Briton\u2019s lead in a dramatic finish, but was unable to overtake him. For Hamilton to win his last British Grand Prix with Mercedes \u2013 the team with whom he dominated the sport for so long \u2013 seemed like a \u201cfairytale,\u201d team principal Toto Wolff told broadcaster Sky Sports after the race. No other driver has won as many races at the same circuit as Hamilton has at Silverstone now, further cementing the 39-year-old\u2019s legacy at the track and as the sport\u2019s most successful ever driver. Hamilton himself seemed overwhelmed by emotion too, embracing his father at the finish and telling Sky Sports that he \u201ccan\u2019t stop crying.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been since 2021, just everyday getting up trying to fight, to train, to put my mind to the task and work as hard as I can with this amazing team,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my last race here at the British Grand Prix with this team, so I wanted to win this so much for them. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely been days between 2021 and here where I didn\u2019t feel like I was good enough or whether I was going to get back to where I am today but the important thing is I had great people around me continuing to support me,\u201d he added. Hopes were high among the home crowd for a British winner at the race since there was a British 1-2-3 starting on the grid at Silverstone for the first time since 1962. George Russell began on pole, ahead of his teammate Hamilton in second and McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris in third, and Russell held the lead for the first third of the race until Hamilton streaked past his teammate. But both Mercedes cars ran wide off the track across the run-off shortly afterwards, allowing Norris to overtake Russell and then to accelerate past Hamilton too. As the rain poured down at Silverstone, Norris seemed assured in the lead but Hamilton began slowly reeling him in while Russell was forced to retire from the race with a technical issue and Verstappen started chasing the leaders down. Once the rain cleared, the drivers pitted to change their tires again and Norris slightly misjudged his mark, adding an extra couple of seconds to his stop, and Hamilton capitalized to take the lead. There was still drama to come in the closing laps of the race as Verstappen overtook Norris to take second and began chasing down Hamilton but ultimately ran out of road.

The game was 0-0 after 90 minutes and, with no extra time in this tournament, it headed straight to the dreaded penalty kicks where Uruguay held its cool to beat Brazil 4-2 in the shootout. While there were no goals in the game, there was a total of 41 fouls in the fiercely contested matchup with four yellow cards and then a red card shown to Uruguay\u2019s Nahitan N\u00e1ndez. N\u00e1ndez was sent off as the game neared its conclusion following a foul on Rodrygo. The Uruguay player caught Brazil\u2019s tricky winger with a studs up tackle on the ankle and was dismissed following a VAR check. With 10 men, Uruguay held on to take the game the distance and penalties loomed. Uruguay instantly seized the initiative in the shootout as Federico Valverde dispatched La Celeste\u2019s first penalty \u2013 followed by \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o failing to net Brazil\u2019s first spot kick as it was saved by goalkeeper Sergio Rochet. Aston Villa\u2019s Douglas Luiz then hit the post with Brazil\u2019s third penalty kick and Uruguay was firmly in the driving seat and leading 3-1. Despite Brazil \u2018keeper Alisson Becker giving fans hope when he saved Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gim\u00e9nez\u2019s penalty, it was too little, too late as Uruguay\u2019s Manuel Ugarte calmly sent Alisson the wrong way to seal his team\u2019s spot in the final four. \u201cIt was a very tense match, against a very tough opponent, suffering in the last minutes a man down. But we showed character despite our youth,\u201d Uruguay\u2019s Rochet said postgame, per Reuters. \u201cTo finish with penalties and winning, I was able to save one \u2026 The truth is that it is a tremendous happiness that this group deserves, the country deserves it. We are very excited, so we are going for more.\u201d Brazil\u2019s talented 17-year-old Endrick started the game but was unable to help lead his team through to the next round. \u201cWe want to put Brazil at the top, we will continue working and preparing for the World Cup (qualifiers),\u201d Endrick said, per Reuters. \u201cWe know that this is a difficult moment, but we hope to have the support of all Brazilians.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/sport/brazil-copa-america-penalty-shootout-uruguay-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_tech_riaa-lawsuit-ai-copyright-infringement", "text": "A group of major record labels is suing two AI startups, alleging they wrongfully used popular artists\u2019 work to train their systems to produce copyrighted music without their consent. The Recording Industry Association of America \u2013 the trade group on behalf of labels including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings and Warner Records \u2013 filed two copyright infringement cases against AI companies Suno and Uncharted Labs, the developer behind Udio, for training their AI models with the labels\u2019 unlicensed sound recordings. Udio is the company behind \u201cBBL Drizzy,\u201d the AI-generated song that went viral last month during the Kendrick Lamar and Drake spat. Udio was founded last year by former Google DeepMind researchers to make it \u201ceasy for anyone to create emotionally resonant music in an instant,\u201d according to the company. In April, it raised $10 million in funding. Meanwhile, Suno raised $125 million in funding last month. The platform, which allows users to create songs with only a few prompts, relies on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for lyrics and title development. Udio and Suno did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier said in a statement that the lawsuits are \u201cnecessary to reinforce the most basic rules of the road for the responsible, ethical, and lawful development of generative AI systems and to bring Suno\u2019s and Udio\u2019s blatant infringement to an end.\u201d He added that the music community is already partnering and collaborating with \u201cresponsible developers to build sustainable AI tools\u201d that put artists and songwriters in charge, but unlicensed services can exploit an artist\u2019s work \u201cwithout consent or pay set back \u2026 .\u201d In April, more than 200 artists, including Billie Eilish, Kacey Musgraves, J Balvin, Ja Rule, Jon Bon Jovi, The Jonas Brothers, Katy Perry, Miranda Lambert and more, signed an open letter\u00a0organized by the non-profit Artist Rights Alliance calling on AI developers, technology companies, platforms and digital music services to \u201ccease the use of artificial intelligence to infringe upon and devalue the rights of human artists.\u201d The lawsuit against Udio states \u201cif developed with the permission and participation of copyright owners, generative AI tools will be able to assist humans in creating and producing new and innovative music.\u201d It added: \u201cBut if developed irresponsibly, without regard for fundamental copyright protections, those same tools threaten enduring and irreparable harm to recording artists, record labels, and the music industry, inevitably reducing the quality of new music available to consumers and diminishing our shared culture.\u201d Meanwhile, the lawsuit against Suno states the company has over 10,000,000 users generating music files using the platform, bringing in about 2,000,000 streams. \u201cThese digital music files have been released to the public\u2014some already finding their way onto the major streaming services\u2014and compete with the copyrighted sound recordings that enabled their creation; yet Suno sought no permission from and gives no credit or compensation to the human artists or other rightsholders whose works fueled their creation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional context and developments.

{"id": "2024_07_05_uk_labour-gaza-israel-vote-uk-election-gbr-intl", "text": "Despite Labour\u2019s landslide win in the UK general election, the party lost several seats after a strong showing from pro-Palestinian independent candidates, in a sign of anger towards Keir Starmer over Labour\u2019s position on Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. Five independent candidates who have been vocal in their support for Gaza won parliamentary seats, while a surge in votes for independents elsewhere denied Labour a victory in areas they were expected to win, leaving a small dent in its otherwise huge majority but raising questions about its foreign policy positions. In Leicester South, a seat in an industrial city in the English Midlands, Labour shadow cabinet member Jonathan Ashworth lost his seat by 979 votes to Shockat Adam, an independent candidate who made his support for Gaza a key part of his electoral pledge to voters. \u201cThis is for Gaza,\u201d Adam declared in his victory speech. Ashworth\u2019s defeat comes as a huge shock. At the last general election, when Labour slumped to its worst defeat since 1935 under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, Ashworth still won the seat with a huge majority, receiving 67% of the vote. In Islington North, Corbyn was reelected to the seat he has held since 1983 \u2013 but this time as an independent, rather than for Labour. Corbyn, who was Labour leader between 2015 and 2020, was expelled from the party after the UK\u2019s human rights watchdog found Labour to be responsible for \u201cunlawful\u201d acts of harassment and discrimination under his leadership, when complaints of antisemitism proliferated. Corbyn won 49.2% of the vote, while the Labour candidate came in second with 34.4%. Corbyn said the voters of Islington North were \u201clooking for a government that on the world stage will search for peace, not war, and not allow the terrible conditions to go on that are happening in Gaza at the present time.\u201d In Blackburn, Labour incumbent Kate Hollern \u2013 who won a majority of 18,304 at the 2019 general election \u2013 lost by just 132 votes to independent candidate Adnan Hussain. In Dewsbury and Batley, the independent Iqbal Mohamed also defeated Labour incumbent Heather Iqbal. And in Birmingham Perry Barr, independent Ayoub Khan defeated Labour incumbent Khalid Mahmood by 507 votes. Meanwhile, in Chingford and Woodford Green, a constituency in east London, the left-wing vote was split between Labour and Faiza Shaheen \u2013 a candidate who stood as an independent after being ousted by Labour during the campaign \u2013 allowing the Conservative incumbent Iain Duncan Smith to retain his seat by about 5,000 votes. \u201cOur vote was a combination of those appalled by how I was treated, those who took issue with having an imposed candidate who didn\u2019t know us, those who were never going to vote Labour after Starmer\u2019s stance on Gaza, and those that have never voted before,\u201d Shaheen wrote on X after the result. \u201cLabour split the vote the moment they deselected me.\u201d Anger over Labour\u2019s Gaza position Labour had feared that it could lose votes over Gaza since Starmer drew criticism in some quarters over comments made last year, shortly after Hamas launched its October 7 attack on Israel and Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza. Speaking to UK radio station LBC in October, Starmer \u2013 a former human rights lawyer \u2013 said Israel \u201chas the right\u201d to withhold power and water from Palestinian civilians in Gaza, but added: \u201cObviously, everything should be done within international law.\u201d The comment caused outrage among many left-wing and Muslim voters, leading to furious protests outside the constituency offices of several Labour Members of Parliament (MPs) and complaints of harassment. The anger was compounded after the party refused to back a Scottish National Party (SNP) motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Israel and Gaza. Labour did, however, pass its own similar motion shortly afterwards. Many of these seats where Labour appears to have lost votes over its position on Gaza have sizable Muslim populations. According to the 2021 census, the populations of Leicester, Birmingham, Ilford and Blackburn are all more than 20% Muslim. Labour lawmakers cling on Wes Streeting, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary set to play a leading role in Starmer\u2019s next government, clung onto his seat in Ilford North by just 528 votes, ahead of the independent candidate Leanne Mohamad in second. On a visit to the constituency before the election, CNN spoke to Mohamad while she was door-knocking in search of votes. She said, after Streeting abstained from a vote on a Gaza ceasefire, she decided to enter politics and abdicate from Labour. \u201cAs a Palestinian, that place is no longer for me\u2026 The Labour party does not represent us,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cMy family were expelled and forced out of Palestine in 1948. My grandparents never thought they\u2019d see something worse than that.\u201d \u201cAll they wanted was their politician to vote for a ceasefire. No to killing, no to more violence. No to more bombs, and they couldn\u2019t even bring themselves to do that,\u201d she said. Meanwhile Jess Phillips, also a prominent Labour figure, won her Birmingham Yardley seat by just 693 votes. Her closest opponent, Jody McIntyre, stood not as an independent but for the Workers Party of Britain, a fringe party that \u201cmakes no apology for our support for Palestine and the people of Gaza.\u201d As her victory speech was met with loud boos and chants of \u201cShame\u201d and \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d a visibly angry Phillips described the harassment she and her staff had faced during the campaign. \u201cThis election has been the worst election I have ever stood in. Today, a brilliant community activist who puts on events for every single part of our community, came out to campaign with me, and people filmed her on the street and then slashed her tires,\u201d Phillips said. Phillips broke party rank in November by voting for the SNP motion calling for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d in Gaza, but she has continued to face abuse \u2013 like many female candidates, she said. \u201cThe women in this election campaign have fared considerably worse than any of the men in our city with regard to the threat and aggression,\u201d Phillips later told ITV.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/labour-gaza-israel-vote-uk-election-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_07_europe_france-second-round-parliament-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "Voters are turning out in high numbers across France to vote in the second round of a snap election called by President Emmanuel Macron, who risks losing swaths of his centrist allies in parliament and being forced to see out the remaining three years of his presidential term in an awkward partnership with the far right. According to data published by the French Interior Ministry, 59.71% of French voters cast their vote by 5 p.m. Sunday (11 a.m. ET) - a level unseen since 1981. It marks a 20-point increase compared to the same time in 2022. After taking the lead in the first round of voting last Sunday, the far-right National Rally (RN) \u2013 led by the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella under the watchful eye of party doyenne Marine Le Pen \u2013 is closer to power than ever before. The RN, whose once-taboo brand of anti-immigrant politics has been given a fresh and more acceptable face by Bardella, won 33% of the popular vote in the first round. The newly-formed left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP), came second with 28%, while Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance trailed in a distant third with 21%. But the prospect of a far-right government \u2013 which would be France\u2019s first since the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II \u2013 has spurred Ensemble and the NFP into action. After a week of political bargaining, hundreds of candidates stood down in particular seats to try to deny the RN an absolute majority. Voting began at 8 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), as France began the process of electing the 577 members of its National Assembly, in which 289 seats are needed for a party to hold an absolute majority. In the outgoing parliament, Macron\u2019s alliance had only 250 seats, and so needed support from other parties to pass laws. Only those who win more than 12.5% of the votes of registered votes in the first round can stand in the second, meaning it is often fought between two candidates. But this time a record number of seats \u2013 more than 300 \u2013 produced a three-way run-off, in a measure of France\u2019s polarization. In an attempt not to split the anti-far right vote, more than 200 candidates from Macron\u2019s alliance and the NFP agreed to stand down in the second round. While RN\u2019s strong showing in the first round means it could more than triple the 88 seats it had in the outgoing parliament, it is not clear if it will be able to reach an absolute majority. Although it is customary for the president to appoint a prime minister from the largest party, Bardella has repeatedly said he will refuse to form a minority government. In that case, Macron might have to search for a prime minister on the hard left or, to form a technocratic government, somewhere else entirely. Whatever the result of Sunday\u2019s vote, France seems set to endure a period of political chaos, with Macron unable to call another parliamentary election for at least a year. The campaign has already been marred with violence. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Friday that 51 candidates and campaigners had been assaulted on the campaign trail, leading to some being hospitalized. The vote is being held three years earlier than necessary. France was not due to hold parliamentary elections until 2027, but Macron called the snap vote \u2013 the first time a French leader has done so since 1997 \u2013 after his party was trounced by the RN at last month\u2019s European Parliament elections. Although the European election results need have no bearing on domestic politics, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent to him by voters and wanted to clarify the situation. Some have argued that, with the possibility of the RN winning both the presidency and the parliament in 2027, Macron was keen to expose it to government beforehand, in the hope that it would lose its appeal once in office. If the RN refuses to form a minority government, Macron\u2019s gamble could backfire. An RN-led government would have huge implications for France and the rest of Europe. Its spending plans \u2013 which include cutting value-added tax on electricity, fuel and other energy products \u2013 have alarmed financial markets and could put France on a collision course with Brussels\u2019 restrictive spending laws. On the continental stage, an RN-led government would further Europe\u2019s rightward shift, at a time when the center is trying to remain united on issues like support for Ukraine, migration and climate change. Standing between the RN and an absolute majority is the NFP, comprising more radical figures like Jean-Luc Melenchon, a three-time presidential candidate and leader of the France Unbowed party, as well as moderate leaders like Place Publique\u2019s Raphael Gluckmann. While Macron\u2019s Ensemble allies said they will do everything in their power to stop the RN coming to power, it has refused to collaborate with or endorse candidates from France Unbowed. Gabriel Attal, Macron\u2019s protege and the outgoing prime minister, has vowed never to enter into alliance with Melenchon. Polls will close at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday, with the full results expected early Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/europe/france-second-round-parliament-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_uk_victoria-starmer-profile-gbr-scli-intl", "text": "The British public has elected a new government, and with that a new family will be moving into 10 Downing Street. Unlike some other countries, such as the United States, when a new British prime minister comes to power, the transition into both the new role and home happens almost immediately. That means, not only will Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, be settling into his home down the road from the Houses of Parliament, but so will his wife, Victoria, and their two teenage children. So, who is Victoria Starmer, and what do we know about the new occupants of 10 Downing Street? Starmer\u2019s wife, whom he usually refers to as Vic, kept a relatively low profile during the election campaign. Both lawyers by training, they married in 2007 \u2013 the year before Starmer became Director of Public Prosecutions. Their relationship grew out of an unlikely first meeting at work, as the Labour leader told Piers Morgan in 2021. Then a barrister, he was preparing for a court case and demanded to speak to the lawyer who had drawn up documents relating to the case. That was Victoria. He asked if they were accurate, and once the conversation was over, he heard her say, \u201cWho the bleep does he think he is?\u201d before hanging up on him. He told Morgan he pursued her for months after that, and they have been together ever since. \u201cVic is beautiful, she is grounded, we share values and we laugh together,\u201d Starmer said. Victoria, whose parents are Jewish, now works in occupational health in the NHS. \u201cHalf of the family are Jewish, they\u2019re either here or in Israel,\u201d he told The Guardian last month, adding that he and his wife are \u201cvery keen\u201d for their children to understand their heritage. Meanwhile, the prime minister has spoken about his children\u2019s concerns about the house move. \u201cDeep down they\u2019re worried that this (their lives) could change, which is why we will fiercely protect their privacy.\u201d So determined is Starmer, that he refers to them in interviews as \u201cmy boy\u201d and \u201cmy girl.\u201d \u201cFrom the very start we took the decision that we would keep them as protected as we possibly can, so we won\u2019t have any photo shoots with the children and we don\u2019t name them in public,\u201d he told British broadcaster ITV\u2019s \u201cThis Morning\u201d show. Starmer told The Guardian he is \u201cacutely aware\u201d how his job impacts his family, saying of his children, \u201cthese are formative years. We keep life as ordinary and unchanged as possible.\u201d Earlier this year, pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated outside the family\u2019s home in Kentish Town, north London, where they unfurled a banner saying \u201cStarmer stop the killing\u201d and left rows of children\u2019s shoes. The Starmers\u2019 main hopes, he told \u201cThis Morning,\u201d were for their children to be \u201chappy and confident.\u201d That might be helped by a new addition, he admitted, as a move to Downing Street is likely to see his children \u201cramp up\u2026 their campaign for a dog.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/victoria-starmer-profile-gbr-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_americas_argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam", "text": "It was an attack that sent shockwaves through a country long considered a pioneer in LGBTQ rights. In the early hours of May 6, four lesbian women were set on fire\u00a0in Argentina. Only one of them survived. It happened at a\u00a0boarding house\u00a0in the Barracas neighborhood of Buenos Aires, where Pamela Fabiana Cobas, Mercedes Roxana Figueroa, Andrea Amarante and Sof\u00eda Castro Riglo were sharing a room. Witnesses say a man\u00a0broke in\u00a0and threw an incendiary device that set the women on fire. Pamela died soon after. Her partner Roxana died days later of organ failure. Andrea died on May 12 in a hospital. Andrea\u2019s\u00a0partner Sof\u00eda was the sole survivor. She spent weeks recovering in hospital and is alive today only because Andrea threw herself on top of her to shield her from the flames, Sofia\u2019s attorney Gabriela Conder told CNN. \u201cHer partner saved her,\u201d Conder said. Local LGBTQ rights advocates condemned the attack as a hate crime and lesbicide, saying the women were targeted because of their sexual identity. Police have arrested a 62-year-old man who\u00a0lived in the building but, according to Conder, aren\u2019t currently treating the incident as a hate crime as they say the motive is still unclear. For Argentina\u2019s LGBTQ groups \u2013 many of whom are planning to commemorate the four women with a rally this weekend \u2013 the attack represents an extreme manifestation of what they consider a growing wave of hostility against them. Those they blame most for this rising intolerance are the people in power. Chief among them, they say, is the country\u2019s new far-right leader Javier Milei. \u201cThings changed with the new government of Javier Milei,\u201d said Maria Rachid, head of the Institute Against Discrimination of the Ombudsman\u2019s Office in Buenos Aires, and a board member and founder of the Argentine LGBT Federation (FALGBT). \u201cSince the beginning of the new government, there are national government officials expressing themselves in a discriminatory manner and those hate speeches before our communities from places with so much power, of course, what they do is generate \u2013 actually legitimize \u2013 and endorse these discriminatory positions that are then expressed with violence and discrimination in everyday life,\u201d Rachid said. Milei under fire When Milei ran for president\u00a0in 2023, he and his party\u00a0were accused of making offensive remarks against LGBTQ communities which were deemed hate speech by multiple groups, including Argentina\u2019s National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes. In a YouTube interview ahead of the November election, Milei insisted that he does\u00a0not oppose same-sex marriage, but in that same interview, he went on to compare homosexuality to having sex with animals. \u201cWhat do I care what your sexual preference is? If you want to be with an elephant, and you have the consent of that elephant, that\u2019s a problem between you and the elephant,\u201d he said, angering LGBTQ communities, who called the comments dehumanizing. In late October, then-congresswoman-elect Diana Mondino, who would later become Milei\u2019s foreign minister, told an interviewer that she supports marriage equality in theory, but at the same time,\u00a0compared it to having lice. \u201cAs a\u00a0liberal, I\u2019m in favor of each person\u2019s life project. It is much broader than marriage equality. Let me exaggerate: If you prefer not to bathe and be full of lice and it is your choice, that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t complain later if there is someone who doesn\u2019t like that you have lice,\u201d she said. After\u00a0taking office in December, Milei took steps that\u00a0critics say weakened protections for LGBTQ groups. He banned\u00a0the use of\u00a0gender-inclusive language\u00a0in government; replaced the\u00a0Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity\u00a0with a less powerful undersecretariat within the Ministry of Human Capital; and effectively closed the national anti-discrimination agency, saying the Ministry of Justice would\u00a0absorb its functions. Milei\u2019s administration argued that some of those moves were part of his plan to cut public spending in response to the country\u2019s economic hardships. But critics say his actions have normalized a culture of discrimination toward LGBTQ groups, and in the most extreme cases, have led to violent attacks such as the deadly May 6 arson. \u201cWhen hate speech is enabled by those in power, these sectors start to feel legitimized to attack,\u201d Esteban Paul\u00f3n, a former FALGBT president who was elected to Congress last year, told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cAnd obviously, behind the verbal attacks come physical attacks.\u201d \u201c(Attacks) always happened. That\u2019s the reality. But they increased more in this current government due to the hate speeches constantly maintained on television, including hate speeches that our president Javier Milei exerts,\u201d said Jesi Hern\u00e1ndez, a lesbian and communication member of Lesbianxs Autoconvocadxs por la masacre de Barracas (Self-convened Lesbians for the Barracas massacre). \u201cToday it was Pamela, Roxana, Andrea and Sof\u00eda. And tomorrow it can be me.\u201d CNN\u00a0has repeatedly reached out to the presidency for comment on these allegations but has not received a response. Rise in hate crimes In 2023, an annual report by the National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes recorded\u00a0133 crimes\u00a0in which the victims\u2019 sexual orientation, identity and/or gender expression were used as a pretext for the attacks. Those numbers rose from 2022 and 2021, when 129 and 120 crimes were recorded, respectively. Rachid points out that the observatory\u2019s numbers only represent attacks that have been officially recorded, and that the real figures are likely much higher. Hern\u00e1ndez, meanwhile, notes that daily life for many people has been impacted in ways not shown by statistics alone. Some now fear they could be targeted next. \u201cThe\u00a0truth is that now, sleeping peacefully in your bed is a privilege,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said, referencing the May 6 attack, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t know if you have a neighbor who will throw something at you or come in. Sleeping is now a privilege for us.\u201d Despite calls from LGBTQ activists, the arson is currently being investigated as an aggravated homicide rather than a hate crime, according to Conder, Sofia\u2019s attorney. Sofia is set to testify at the end of the month, Conder\u00a0said. CNN has reached out to the criminal court investigating the case but has not received a response. Shortly after the May 6 killings, the presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni condemned the attack but\u00a0dismissed\u00a0the notion that it was motivated by hatred toward the sexual orientation of the victims. \u201cI don\u2019t like to define it as an attack on a certain group,\u201d Adorni said at a press conference. \u201cThere are many women and men who are suffering violence and these are things that cannot continue to happen.\u201d Progressives condemned his remarks, insisting that the government should regard lesbicide as a hate crime. Adorni responded on social media with a picture of a Spanish dictionary that said\u00a0lesbicide\u00a0is not a registered word. Progress in Argentina Argentina was once a progressive pioneer in\u00a0Latin America. In 2010, it became the first country in the region to\u00a0legalize same-sex marriage. In 2021, it also became the first to allow nonbinary people to mark their gender as \u201cX\u201d on\u00a0national identity documents. LGBTQ activists fear these historic gains are now being undermined \u2013 and potentially threatened \u2013 by the current government.\u00a0But they also take comfort in surveys that suggest anti-LGBTQ views are the minority in Argentina. According to a public opinion survey conducted in May by the University of San Andr\u00e9s, some 72% of respondents said they are in favor of marriage equality, 70% said they support policies that protect transgender people from discrimination, 75% said they do not consider that transsexuality is a disease that should be treated medically, and 79% said that comprehensive sexuality education in schools is a positive thing. The recent attacks have galvanized activists to fight for new policies and actions that would further protect LGBTQ rights. Congressman Paul\u00f3n told CNN that lawmakers are working with rights groups on various laws that would, among other things, punish discriminatory acts, prevent harassment in schools, and ban efforts to try to \u201ccorrect\u201d people\u2019s sexual orientation, identity and gender. He also said that to reduce attacks on LGBTQ communities, their voices and demands should be amplified in more societal sectors. To that end, Hern\u00e1ndez encouraged LGBTQ groups to push back against hate speech, telling those communities: \u201cThey are not insane, they are not sick, they are not people with lice. Quite the opposite. I would tell them that they are a disruptive person, that they are breaking out of the molds of \u2018normality.\u2019 And that they are very brave \u2026 and that they are whatever they want to be, despite all this.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/americas/argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

Panama is home to the Dari\u00e9n Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, that has seen an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. News of the agreement comes after Panama\u2019s new President Jose Raul Mulino vowed on Monday that the Central American nation would no longer be a country of transit for migrants. \u201cI will not allow Panama to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,\u201d Mulino said at his swearing-in ceremony. \u201cPanama will no longer be a transit country for illegals,\u201d he said amid cheers from those present. \u201cThe numbers of illegal immigrants passing through the Dari\u00e9n are shocking,\u201d Mulino said, adding that he intends to \u201cappeal to international solidarity regarding the cause that generates the problem and will seek solutions with the countries involved, especially with the United States, which is the final destination of such immigrants.\u201d Mulino said that he\u2019s seen first-hand \u201cthe magnitude of the problem and the dimension of the humanitarian and environmental crisis\u201d that migration causes to the Dari\u00e9n Gap. \u201cThe Dari\u00e9n must continue to be a great green lung, not only for us but for the entire region.

{"id": "2024_07_04_asia_modi-putin-russia-india-visit-intl", "text": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Moscow next week for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine, a sign of the growing relationship between the two countries even as New Delhi maintains strong ties with the United States. Modi will be in Moscow on July 8 and 9 at the invitation of President Vladimir Putin, India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs announced, adding they would \u201cexchange views on contemporary regional and global issues of mutual interest.\u201d Modi\u2019s plans for the trip were first reported last month by Russian state media, citing Kremlin officials. India remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment \u2013 a vital link given India\u2019s ongoing tensions at its shared Himalayan border with China \u2013 and has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin\u2019s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces isolation from the West. Modi\u2019s visit is widely seen as the latest dent in efforts by Western leaders to cast Putin aside. India\u2019s ties with Russia date back decades to the Cold War and have remained strong despite repeated sanctions on Moscow from Western governments. New Delhi has repeatedly abstained from votes condemning Russia at the United Nations Security Council and has avoided public criticism of Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine. Confirmation of Modi\u2019s visit comes as Russia draws ever closer to China, potentially making New Delhi uncomfortable due to its longstanding Himalayan border dispute with Beijing that has simmered in recent years. On Wednesday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Putin hailed their two countries\u2019 deepening alignment at a regional security summit in Kazakhstan, with the Russian leader claiming relations between the two were going through \u201cthe best period in their history\u201d and should be considered a \u201cstabilizing\u201d force for the world. Modi, however, was notably absent from the annual leaders\u2019 meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a bloc of Eurasian countries spearheaded by China and Russia that is seen as a counterweight to Western institutions led by the US and its allies. Some analysts viewed Modi\u2019s decision to skip the event as a sign the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy does not view the bloc as an effective channel through which New Delhi can pursue its interests. Modi last met Putin on the sidelines of the 2022 SCO summit, where he told the Russian leader that today\u2019s era is \u201cnot of war.\u201d Yet his upcoming visit to Moscow is being viewed positively by the Kremlin \u2013 which has described Modi\u2019s relationship with Putin as \u201cvery trusting\u201d in nature \u2013 and comes as Russia aims to push back against Western efforts to isolate it on the world stage as punishment for its war in Ukraine. \u201cWe can expect that there will be an exchange of views on all issues that are on the agenda, and there are many of them,\u201d Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to Russia\u2019s state-run news agency TASS on Tuesday. Last month Putin also met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang, where the two autocrats vowed to strengthen ties and deepen their cooperation in a new partnership that was signed during the visit. Moscow this year has taken up the position as chair of the BRICS economic bloc, which includes Brazil, India, China and South Africa, providing Putin with an opportunity to push back against growing Western isolation and portray himself as a key player on a broad diplomatic stage. But Modi\u2019s visit is set against the backdrop of India\u2019s growing relations with the US, as both countries share concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi met with US President Joe Biden during a state visit to Washington in June last year, in a trip further cementing their defense, trade and technology partnership. The Indian leader also addressed Congress during that trip, an honor typically reserved for close US allies and partners, and attended a lavish state dinner. India is a member of the Quad security grouping with the US, Japan and Australia. Later that year, Putin did not attend the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in New Delhi, during which leaders delivered a consensus statement criticizing his invasion of Ukraine.

{"id": "2024_07_07_europe_new-popular-front-france-election-explainer-intl", "text": "A month ago, the New Popular Front (NFP) did not exist. Now, it looks set to win the most seats in the French parliament and could provide France with its next prime minister. The left-wing coalition chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. If Sunday\u2019s second-round projection is confirmed, the NFP will have done so again. But the hastily assembled coalition comprises disparate political parties that have not always played nice. And it has campaigned on a platform of high public spending that has spooked financial markets and could tip France into economic chaos. So, what is the NFP, what does it stand for, and who are its key players? Who are the NFP? The NFP is made up of several parties: the far-left France Unbowed party; the more moderate Socialist Party; the green Ecologist party; the French Communist Party; the center-left Place Publique, and other small parties. It formed just days after President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election, in the wake of his centrist party\u2019s embarrassing defeat to Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party in last month\u2019s European Parliament election. \u201cFollowing his side\u2019s defeat at the European elections, Emmanuel Macron has opted for a gamble at a time when the far right is at its most powerful, running the risk of seeing it come to power for the first time since Vichy,\u201d Socialist leader Olivier Faure said last month, referring to the French government that collaborated with Nazi occupiers during World War II. \u201cOnly a united left can stand in its way,\u201d he said. Who\u2019s in charge of the NFP? It\u2019s hard to say. Each party celebrated the results at their own headquarters and separate campaign events, rather than together. Going into the second round, it was not clear who the coalition would nominate to be its prime minister. Its most prominent \u2013 and divisive \u2013 figure is Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, a 72-year-old populist firebrand and longtime leader of the France Unbowed party. France Unbowed is projected to be the largest single party within the coalition, with as many as 80 seats. But figures in Macron\u2019s Ensemble party have repeatedly said they would refuse to work with France Unbowed, saying it is just as extreme \u2013 and therefore as unfit to govern \u2013 as the RN. Announcing his intention to resign Monday as prime minister, Gabriel Attal said, in an apparent swipe to France Unbowed: \u201cNo absolute majority can be led by the extremes. We owe it to the French spirit, so deeply attached to the Republic and its values.\u201d M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s three presidential campaigns have been beset by accusations of antisemitism. In a recent survey of French Jewish voters by Ifop, 57% said they would leave France if M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s party were to govern. A more acceptable face of the coalition could be the Socialist Faure, or Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, the moderate leader of Place Publique and a member of the European Parliament. What are the NFP\u2019s policies? On foreign policy, the NFP has pledged to \u201cimmediately recognize\u201d a Palestinian state, and will push for Israel and Hamas to cease fire in Gaza. The NFP campaigned on an expansive economic platform, promising to raise the minimum monthly wage to 1,600 euros (more than $1,700) and to cap the price of essential foods, electricity, fuel and gas. It also pledged to scrap Macron\u2019s pension reform, a deeply unpopular policy that raised the French retirement age \u2013 one of the lowest in the Western world \u2013 from 62 to 64. While these pledges have proved popular, they have been made at a time when France could be heading for a period of austerity. France is running one of the highest deficits in the Eurozone and now risks falling foul of the European Commission\u2019s new fiscal rules, which were suspended to help countries recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and energy crisis. Since Macron called the election, financial markets have taken fright \u2013 first at the prospect of an extremist government, then at the economic policies of the hard left and right, with the RN also promising an expansive fiscal program. Because the NFP is not projected to win enough seats to form an absolute majority, it will have to enter into another coalition \u2013 likely with Ensemble, which may try to dilute some of its more radical spending policies \u2013 in order to pass laws. This process is likely to be frustrating, as several parties \u2013 straddling huge ideological divides \u2013 try to find common ground.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/europe/new-popular-front-france-election-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

The drone attack took place in a settlement in the Podgorensky district, Voronezh governor Aleksandr Gusev said Sunday. Ukrainian sources said the warehouse was targeted because it was being used to supply ammunition to Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. \u201cSeveral UAVs were detected and destroyed by on-duty air defense forces over the territory of the Voronezh region last night. A fire broke out at a warehouse due to the fall of their wreckage. Detonation of explosive items began in the Podgorensky district,\u201d Gusev said. He did not identify the settlement where the attack took place, but said a state of emergency had been declared there. No one was injured in the attack, but two elderly women were taken to hospital for checks, he said. \u201cOperational services, military and officials are working on the site to eliminate the emergency,\u201d he said, adding arrangements have been made for the evacuation of residents from nearby villages as well. \u201cSo far, some 50 people from three settlements have been transported to temporary accommodation centers.

Instead of your Cinderellas, Elsas and Annas in their royal best, it\u2019s a fuzzy pink fox that\u2019s inspiring the princess-esque outfits of Disney-goers in their teens and 20s. LinaBell is the latest addition to a line of plush toys called \u201cDuffy and Friends,\u201d created by Disney for the Asian market. She has never made it onto the big screen, but she and her furry companions have resonated with fans in the region, becoming one of the company\u2019s best-selling franchises in the city\u2019s theme park. Young women in particular are drawing inspiration from the pastel-colored characters, creating coquettish looks. \u201cLinaBell is my favorite,\u201d said Liang Xiaoyu who was visiting from the Chinese city of Guangzhou. The 18-year-old was dressed in a pink-trimmed white frock, her hair in two loose ponytails, and was carrying a LinaBell backpack and keychain. Others spotted during a rainy June day channeled CookieAnn (a yellow dog who loves to bake), by wearing dog-ear headbands as well as ShellieMay and Duffy, the line\u2019s two bears. Dressing up is popular at Disney theme parks across the world \u2014 not just for kids, but for adults as well. Known as \u201cDisneybounding,\u201d the phenomenon sees visitors circumvent rules on wearing full Disney costumes (some masks, for instance, are banned\u00a0to avoid any confusion with the parks\u2019 own costumed employees) by using clothing and accessories that evoke their favorite characters. Qin Wuxiao, dressed from head to toe as Jessie the cowgirl doll from the \u201cToy Story\u201d franchise, was taking photos with her mother in front of the Castle of Magical Dreams. The 23-year-old student said it\u2019s become popular for young people to dress up like characters and post pictures of themselves on Chinese social media apps like Xiaohongshu. Charmy Chan and her friend Yanni Chung dressed for the day as Officer Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde from \u201cZootopia.\u201d The Hong Kong Baptist University students grew up watching Disney movies and now that they\u2019re in college they find themselves with more time to visit. \u201cWe usually come to the park once a month,\u201d said Chan, in front of the park\u2019s bakery on Main Street USA.  And at Hong Kong Disneyland, Disney characters aren\u2019t the sole fashion inspiration for dedicated fans. All around the park, there were guests like 27-year-old Li Mengru from China\u2019s Fujian province and 16-year-old Chen Xinyu from Guangdong province, dressed as Lolitas.  Not a Nabokovian Lolita, but women who dress in an unabashedly feminine style of clothing popularized in Japan in the mid-1990s. Think petticoats, dainty shoes and accessories. Li wore a light baby blue dress with statement bows and elaborate crystal nails, while Chen went with a more gothic look. Linda Lee, meanwhile, wore a bold striped black and white dress adorned with cherries and red ribbons. In the age of Instagram and TikTok, the park lends a perfect background for Disneybounders and cosplayers to immerse themselves in a fantasy world. There\u2019s the World of Frozen that opened in November last year, where influencers can be found taking photos in front of a snowflake fountain on the streets of Arendelle. Tomorrowland lends itself as a futuristic backdrop for Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d fans while Toy Story Land with its outsize wooden blocks, green army men and race cars make for some playful shots. A sweet escape Since the pandemic, the city \u2013 which imposed some of the world\u2019s strictest travel restrictions \u2013 has been looking to boost tourism numbers by launching a \u201cHello Hong Kong\u201d campaign, that included giving away free flights. Though most visitors to the park are local residents, the majority government-owned Hong Kong Disneyland Resort is one of the key attractions being promoted to tourists. The Hong Kong Tourism Board\u2019s exit survey of around 93,000 people in 2023 showed the park was the third most visited attraction in the city. The shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui and scenic spot The Peak were the two top spots respectively. Many of the non-local visitors to Hong Kong Disneyland live in mainland China or countries in Southeast Asia like the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore, with some coming from Japan and South Korea as well. Wandering into Adventureland from Grizzly Gulch, 34-year-old Kris Yang and 35-year-old Jimmy Redinger stopped to chat with CNN.\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s crazy about Disney,\u201d said Yang who is from mainland China of his partner, who is from the United States. The two primary school teachers were visiting from the northern Chinese province of Hebei. They wore shirts from \u201cZootopia\u201d and \u201cHercules\u201d and were decked out in Disney paraphernalia. \u201cIf you like my outfit today, you should have seen me yesterday,\u201d said Redinger who proudly identified himself as a \u201cDisney adult,\u201d a term that might come with some baggage in the United States, given some of the extremes fans have gone viral for. \u201cI was in a full Goofy movie get-up.\u201d \u201cI embrace the idea of a \u2018Disney adult\u2019,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s in the name. Adults who love Disney. Someone who really has that connection to the company and parks.\u201d In Asia, the penchant for child-like things as adults broadly carries less social stigma than in the West. China\u2019s \u201cmeng\u201d and Japan\u2019s \u201ckawaii\u201d cultures embrace cuteness. Many, like 37-year-old Mariko Otomo kitted out in Disney accessories, were there as a form of escape. \u201cUsually we work very hard. We go office and back, office and back,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we finally come to Disney we forget the daily stuff.\u201d \u201cEven just walking here, (I) have a good feeling,\u201d said Ankh Wong a 24-year-old saleswoman who has visited the park more than 20 times over the past six years. As soon as she got her first job, she bought a ticket to the park. \u201cIt\u2019s a place for happiness and I can put down my worries,\u201d said 16-year-old Deng Chundan. Tactics like themed staycations and special events, collaborations with brands like Le Creuset, Godiva and local jeweler Chow Tai Fook and cultivating successful franchises such as Duffy and Friends are part of the park\u2019s strategy to appeal to Gen Z and millennials. In recent years, the park has invested a reported $1.4 billion in expanding some of its attractions, which included a new \u201cFrozen\u201d themed section of the park. (\u201cFrozen,\u201d which came out in 2013, is likely one of the first Disney films Gen Z would have watched as children). Disney declined CNN\u2019s request for information on the ages of its annual visitors, but it\u2019s clear the Hong Kong park draws many grown-up fans. Redinger said nostalgia brings him back time and time again. \u201cAs the parks grow, we grow with the parks, reliving that time with our families (that) we had.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/style/hong-kong-disneyland-dress-up-disneybound-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_ukraine-russia-chasiv-yar-part-seized-intl", "text": "Russian troops have taken control of parts of a key hilltop town in eastern Ukraine, a strategic gain that could pose major problems for Ukrainian troops trying to defend the area from further advances. The relatively small town of Chasiv Yar has played an outsized role in the conflict and has been battered by months of intense fighting. Sitting on high ground, it is seen as a gateway to the parts of the Donetsk region that are still in Ukrainian hands. The town overlooks the lower-laying areas to the north, towards the bigger cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, and to the west towards Dnipropetrovsk\u00a0region. The Russian Defense Ministry said on Thursday that its troops have taken over the easternmost district of Chasiv Yar. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military said that Kyiv forces retreated from the district after their defensive positions were destroyed and it became clear that efforts to hold onto the neighborhood were becoming \u201cinexpedient\u201d because of the risk to the defending troops. \u201cOver the last day, 238 attacks from all types of weapons were recorded in the Chasiv Yar area,\u201d Nazar Voloshyn, the spokesperson for Ukraine\u2019s \u201cKhortytsia\u201d operational and strategic grouping, told a Ukrainian national television channel. At the same time, Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState said Russian forces were reportedly moving towards a strategically important road that connects Bakhmut, which has been in Russian hands for more than a year, with Konstantinivka and Pokrovsk. The road is a key supply line for the Ukrainian military. The withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from parts of Chasiv Yar is a troubling development for Kyiv as it focuses on stabilizing the frontlines following months of relentless Russian assaults. Moscow took advantage of the acute shortages of ammunition experienced by Kyiv due to delays in Western military aid in the first half of this year, trying to pierce Ukraine\u2019s defensive lines alongside the eastern frontline. It even launched a surprise cross-border offensive in northern Ukraine in order to force Kyiv to pull some troops away from the east. But the situation was starting to look better for Ukraine in recent weeks after Western weapons finally started arriving on the frontlines. A possible major Russian offensive towards Kharkiv, the second-largest Ukrainian city, was averted and the eastern front appeared more stable. Higher ground Ukraine has insisted that it is still firmly in control of the western parts of Chasiv Yar and that the withdrawal from the eastern part was a tactical decision. DeepState, the monitoring group, said the district \u201chas been completely wiped out\u201d and \u201cholding it in ruins\u201d would only increase losses. \u201cLeaving the neighborhood is a logical, albeit a difficult decision,\u201d it said. The town had a pre-war population of about 12,000, but has been mostly deserted for months. Vadym Filashkin, the head of Donetsk regional military administration, said in May that some 679 civilians were still in Chasiv Yar, refusing to evacuate their homes. \u201cCapturing Chasiv Yar would allow the Russians to bring in more (First Person View) drones, drone operators and artillery into the area, and it would give them an advantageous position to conduct ground strikes and drone strikes on Ukrainian troops,\u201d Konrad Muzyka, a defense analyst who has been tracking the conflict closely, told CNN in an interview. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made no secret of the fact that he wants his forces to control the whole of Donestk. The region was dissected in half when the war broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern parts of the region. While Russia took control of a other parts of Donetsk following the launch of its full-scale invasion in February 2022, it never managed to occupy the whole of the region. If Chasiv Yar was to fall to Russian hands, it could put bigger cities to the west at risk. \u201cChasiv Yar the largest settlement on the way to Kramatorsk, so if Russians were to capture it, then the Ukrainians would not necessarily have the chances to rely on urban settlements to decrease the tempo of Russian attacks,\u201d Muzyka said. Advancing through an urban environment is much more difficult compared to open terrain. Chasiv Yar itself has been the epicenter of the fight for months. Bakhmut, which sits about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of Chasiv Yar, fell to Russia at a huge cost to its troops in May 2023, after many months of intense fighting. By the time Moscow claimed control over the city, it was almost completely destroyed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/ukraine-russia-chasiv-yar-part-seized-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_05_europe_kara-murza-russia-prison-hospital-intl", "text": "Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian opposition politician serving a lengthy jail sentence for treason, has been transferred to a prison hospital, his wife Evgenia said Friday. Kara-Murza, 42, was moved from the maximum-security IK-6 penal colony in the Siberian city of Omsk to a prison hospital in another part of the region, she said in a series of posts on X. His lawyers have not been allowed to see him and have been given contradictory information by hospital staff, she added. After arriving at IK-6 from Moscow, Kara-Murza\u2019s lawyers were made to wait for five hours before being told they could not see him, she said. They were later told to come back the next day. When the lawyers returned Friday morning, they were informed he was still being examined by doctors and had not yet been fully processed. They were told later Friday that they still could not see Kara-Murza, and that the correctional facility would be closed over the weekend, she said. \u201cThe lawyers were never able to see Vladimir and make sure that everything was okay with him,\u201d she wrote, saying that Kara-Murza has been suffering from polyneuropathy, \u201ca disease caused by two severe poisonings.\u201d Kara-Murza has claimed he was twice poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok \u2013 in 2015 and in 2017 \u2013 which caused him to suffer multiple organ failure and fall into a coma. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in his illness, but Kara-Murza has long maintained there was \u201cno other possible reason\u201d for it than a politically motivated attack. In an interview with CNN shortly before his arrest in 2022, Kara-Murza criticized the Kremlin for its persecution of its political opponents and invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThese people have a literally decades-long track record of going after their political opponents. Poison has been a particularly favored method because it gives them \u2013 or at least it did until all of these media investigations came out \u2013 plausible deniability,\u201d Kara-Murza told CNN. \u201cThis regime that is in power in our country today, it\u2019s not just corrupt, it\u2019s not just kleptocratic, it\u2019s not just kleptocratic, it\u2019s not just authoritarian \u2013 it is a regime of murderers. And it is important to say it out loud,\u201d he said, adding it was \u201ctragic\u201d that it took the invasion of Ukraine for Western countries to \u201copen their eyes\u201d to the danger of Putin\u2019s regime. He was arrested shortly afterward and later sentenced to 25 years in prison, in a decision condemned as politically motivated and draconian by the international community. Asked by CNN why he had chosen to return to Russia after recovering from his poisoning \u2013 and knowing the risks faced by Kremlin critics \u2013 he said: \u201cI\u2019m a Russian politician. I have to be in Russia. It\u2019s my home country. I think the biggest gift we could give \u2013 those of us who are in opposition to Putin\u2019s regime \u2013 to the Kremlin, is to give up and run. I mean, that\u2019s all they want from us.\u201d Since the death of Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison in February, Kara-Murza has been the most prominent Russian opposition figure persecuted by the Kremlin. A joint investigation by CNN and the group Bellingcat implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in poisoning Navalny during a trip to Siberia in August 2020. The investigation found that the FSB toxins team of about six to 10 agents trailed Navalny for more than three years before poisoning him via his underpants.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/kara-murza-russia-prison-hospital-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Vatican said in a statement that the prelate had refused to \u201crecognize and submit\u201d to the authority of the pope, and had rejected \u201ccommunion\u201d with members of the Catholic Church and its authoritative teachings. In 2018, Vigan\u00f2 released a bombshell dossier calling on Francis to resign and\u00a0accusing the pope of knowing about allegations of abuse\u00a0of trainee priests carried out by the former cardinal of Washington, DC, Theodore McCarrick, and failing to act.\u00a0A Vatican inquiry later challenged Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account\u00a0and cleared Francis. As a Vatican diplomat, the archbishop was tasked with serving the pope, which makes his excommunication for schism highly unusual. The ruling means the archbishop cannot receive the sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church, such as communion. The Vatican explained Friday that Vigan\u00f2 was excommunicated following an \u201cextrajudicial penal process,\u201d although the archbishop has said he did not \u201crecognize the legitimacy\u201d of the process. Recently, the archbishop has said Francis\u2019 election to the papacy should be considered \u201cnull and void\u201d and has instead accused the pope of \u201cheresy and schism.\u201d He has accused the pontiff of supporting what he called the \u201cclimate fraud\u201d and has criticized him for backing Covid-19 vaccines and for promoting an\u00a0\u201cinclusive, immigrationist, eco-sustainable, and gay-friendly\u201d church. Vigan\u00f2 was also at the center of controversy for arranging a meeting between the pope and Kim Davis, a Kentucky clerk who refused to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples, during the pope\u2019s 2015 visit to the US. The Vatican later said the meeting \u201cshould not be considered a form of support of her position.\u201d Following Vigan\u00f2\u2019s 2018 call for the pope to resign, several bishops in the US issued statements of support for the archbishop, which were\u00a0criticized by some commentators. For some, the archbishop had been seen as an effective diplomat and official in years gone by. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Holy See\u2019s Secretary of State, said recently about the now-excommunicated archbishop.

{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_uk-election-europe-populist-surge-intl", "text": "The United Kingdom\u2019s decision to hand the center-left Labour Party a parliamentary majority comes at the same time Europe is broadly in the grip of what some call a right-wing populist surge. Last month\u2019s\u00a0European elections\u00a0saw a historic number of lawmakers from hard-right and far-right parties elected to the European Parliament. The results caused such chaos that French President Emmanuel Macron called a snap parliamentary election in his own country, the first round of which the far-right National Rally\u00a0won last week. A government composed of far-right figures was formed in the Netherlands this week. Italy is led by the most right-wing leader since the rule of fascist wartime leader Benito Mussolini. These electoral victories and the prospect of populist right-wingers in power is no longer a surprise in European countries. There are many reasons for this rise in populism, often unique to individual countries. But broadly speaking, a number of European countries are suffering from sluggish economies, high immigration and higher energy prices, due in part to the drive for carbon net zero. The European Union is often blamed for national woes by populist politicians and breathes oxygen into an increasingly Euroskeptic national discourse. So why is Britain, the only country where Euroskepticism led to a referendum on EU membership, bucking this trend? Despite the scale of the Labour victory, it is clear from the results that the British right is far from dead. The Conservative Party, despite its undeniably disappointing night,\u00a0has outperformed against\u00a0the\u00a0expectations of a number of opinion polls during the campaign, some of which predicted it would win fewer than 100 seats \u2013 which would have been a truly epic wipeout. Another party that exceeded polling expectations\u00a0is the populist right-wing Reform UK, led by long-term scourge of the Conservatives Nigel Farage, who is perhaps best known these days for his friendship with former US President Donald Trump. Before this, he was credited with making Brexit possible after decades of campaigning against the UK\u2019s membership of the EU. On his eighth attempt, Farage has now been elected as a member of parliament (MP). The Conservatives may have been reduced to only 121 seats and Reform may have only secured four, as of Friday morning, but the overall vote share for these two parties combined is larger than that of Labour \u2013 which has secured more than 400 seats. This will doubtless have a major impact on what happens next to the right of British politics. Ahead of the election, the existence of Reform and pressure from Farage on issues like tax and migration had already forced the Conservatives further to the right. Farage identified that irregular migration, particularly people crossing the English Channel in small boats from France, could become a major factor in an election campaign. His relentless campaigning on the issue forced the Conservatives to introduce the highly controversial Rwanda policy, which would see asylum seekers sent overseas for their claims to be processed. The Conservative Party now needs to find a new leader. The debate over who takes over from Sunak will focus largely on what values the party should embrace. Many Conservatives will believe that by leaning to the right they can steal Farage\u2019s votes. Many will believe that some kind of pact should be done with Farage. Others will want absolutely nothing to do with a man who has spent decades attempting to destroy the Conservative Party. Regardless, it is likely that Farage will play a starring role in the Conservative leadership campaign. Even if he isn\u2019t in the party himself, Farage thrives as an outsider. The majority of his political success to date has all come without him holding a UK parliamentary seat. Now he has not only won a seat himself, but will have a small band of colleagues ready to hurl grenades at Labour leader and new Prime Minister Keir Starmer. That said, it is probably quite a long time before there is any kind of coherently united right. It is possible that Farage\u2019s splitting of the right has actually helped Starmer on his way to such a huge victory. An odd quirk of British politics is that the percentage of votes a party gets doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to seats. Every seat is decided individually, the winner being the candidate with the most votes, which is often less than 50%. And with Reform performing well in many of the seats that Labour won, the hard-right will not only be impossible to ignore in this parliament, but it could easily see its influence grow further. Britain suffers from many of the same problems as other European countries. If Starmer falters as prime minister, there is every chance that the popular right could continue to capture the public\u2019s imagination, as it has elsewhere\u00a0in Europe.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/uk-election-europe-populist-surge-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

Denim is also a prominent feature in the closing ceremony ensembles. For this occasion, Ralph Lauren designed a racecar-style jacket with USA patch detailing, a a classic striped polo and crisp white jeans. \u201cI think this collection in its entirety does a really good job of combining classic American style with a little bit more of that contemporary feel,\u201d Paralympic swimmer Jamal Hill, a bronze medal-winner at the 2020 Tokyo Games, told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m wearing this to the all-white party,\u201d he noted, with a laugh, of the closing ceremony look in particular, adding, \u201cmy only regret is that when I come home, the season for all-white will be almost over.\u201d The athletes honored as Team USA\u2019s flag bearers at the opening and closing ceremonies will receive versions of these looks in different colorways to help them stand out in the crowds.

The report from the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) confirmed the authenticity of a June 30 video statement by 16 Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) leaders announcing they were dissolving the extremist network. In the statement, captured on video and shared online, the leaders confirmed their commitment to the Indonesian state and law, and said all material taught in JI-affiliated boarding schools would be in line with orthodox Islam. \u201cIt is too early to say what the consequences are, but the men who signed the statement have enough respect and credibility within the organisation to ensure widespread acceptance,\u201d said Sidney Jones, who authored IPAC\u2019s preliminary analysis. The Al-Qaeda-linked militant group is accused of orchestrating some of the deadliest attacks in Indonesia, including the 2002 bombing of Bali nightclubs that killed more than 200 people. Indonesia\u2019s National Counter Terrorism Agency (BNPT) declined to comment on the development, but said it planned to hold a press conference soon. The decision to disband the organization, said Jones, was likely driven by several factors, including the influence of intellectuals within JI who were less interested in violent jihad, and a cost-benefit analysis on the best way to protect the group\u2019s biggest assets \u2013 its schools. Intensive engagement with counter-terrorism officials also played a role, the report said. Despite the clout of the figures involved, IPAC noted the group has a history of splinters and it was possible one could emerge in the future, although probably not immediately. \u201cFor the moment, the likely result is the flourishing of JI-affiliated schools and the increasing involvement in public life of the men who signed the 30 June statement,\u201d said IPAC. \u201cWhat happens to the rest of the membership remains to be seen.\u201d Adhe Bhakti, a terrorism expert at the Jakarta-based Center for Radicalism and Deradicalization Studies, said he doubted the group\u2019s splinter factions would follow their seniors. He said these groups could become threats because they will feel they need \u201cto do something violently,\u201d although he did not believe this will happen in the near future. \u201cThe splinters have in fact become wild at this vulnerable point,\u201d Adhe said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/asia/jemaah-islamiyah-militant-group-disbanded-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

The snap vote, called by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, is being held months earlier than necessary and caught much of his party by surprise. The opposition Labour party suffered its worst defeat since 1935 in the last general election, but has since rebuilt itself under the leadership of Keir Starmer. Thursday\u2019s vote follows a six-week campaign in which all major parties have scoured the country in search of votes. Much of the debate has revolved around the economy, the cost of living, the state of Britain\u2019s public services, and tax and immigration. Largely absent from the debate, however, has been Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union, which it left in 2020 after a referendum four years earlier. Britain has had three Conservative prime ministers since the last general election in 2019, which Boris Johnson won by a landslide. But after much of the country and his party soured on Johnson, Conservative party members voted in 2022 to replace him with Liz Truss, who became the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs) then voted to replace her with Sunak. During the campaign, Nigel Farage \u2013 one of the most prominent champions of Brexit \u2013 announced his return to frontline politics to lead the nascent hard-right Reform UK party. Sunak, Starmer, Farage and the heads of all other major parties are expected to make appearances at their own local polling stations throughout the day. Around 46.5 million Brits are eligible to vote in the election. They are casting their ballots in 650 separate constituencies across the nations of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with 326 seats required for a party to form a majority government. News outlets are barred from reporting anything that could influence voters while polls are opened. An exit poll from British broadcasters will project the seat totals are soon as polls shut at 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET), and counting will take place throughout the night and into Friday morning.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/uk-general-election-polls-open-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_jordan-bardella-national-rally-france-profile-intl", "text": "Jordan Bardella\u2019s rise to the peak of French politics has been so swift he is still asked about his teenage years spent playing \u201cCall of Duty.\u201d Next week, at the age of just 28, he could become France\u2019s prime minister \u2013 and Europe\u2019s youngest for more than 200 years. He\u2019s the fresh face of an old party that has striven to make itself new. Handpicked as leader by National Rally (RN) doyenne Marine Le Pen in an effort to purge the far-right party of its racist and antisemitic roots, Bardella has taken it closer to the gates of power than ever before. On Sunday, the RN smashed President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist alliance in the first round of a snap parliamentary election. Whether the RN forms a government and Bardella becomes prime minister after the July 7 runoff is not clear. Despite the surge in support for the RN, France\u2019s left and centrist parties have called on their supporters to vote tactically to deny the far right an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. This week, more than 200 parliamentary candidates from Macron\u2019s alliance and the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) stepped down in a bid to avoid splitting the vote in the second round. But as Paris wraps a week of political bargaining, one thing is clear: France \u2013 and the rest of Europe \u2013 must reckon with the prospect of a far-right French government, headed by a popular but untested leader. So, who is Bardella, and what might his party do in power? The only child of Italian immigrants, Bardella was brought up in Seine-Saint-Denis, a working-class suburb of Paris. He joined the RN at 16, and later began a geography degree at the prestigious Sorbonne university, before dropping out to climb the party ranks. He did so briskly. After becoming party spokesperson, he became the RN\u2019s lead candidate for the 2019 European Parliament election at the age of just 23. In 2022, after Le Pen narrowly lost the presidential election to Macron, he succeeded her as party leader, leapfrogging the party\u2019s long standing vice-president and Le Pen\u2019s former partner, Louis Aliot. Freed from the day-to-day management of the party, but almost certain to run again for the presidency in 2027, Le Pen has been able to freshen the RN\u2019s image and untether it from its reputation. Le Pen began her yearslong effort to detoxify the RN by ousting her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen \u2013 a convicted Holocaust denier \u2013 from the party he founded, and later changing its name. The appointment and subsequent rise of Bardella may represent the completion of her mission to bring the party into the modern age. For many older voters, the prospect of a far-right government \u2013 reminiscent of the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II \u2013 remains terrifying. But among young people, not weighed down by this historical baggage, the party has proved hugely popular. While the RN\u2019s messaging has remained similar, the messenger has changed entirely. Suave, composed, unflappable, a child of the screen generation, Bardella has built up a huge TikTok following, where young voters can watch him tasting wine and doing shots. Even a video of him eating a bon-bon has been viewed 7.5 million times. In just two years, Bardella has helped to give the RN an acceptable \u2013 and potentially electable \u2013 face. Whereas Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance has sought to distance itself from the president\u2019s image, the RN\u2019s election manifesto is filled with splashy portraits of the prime minister-in-waiting. Fantasy promises? But campaigning and governing require different skills. If he becomes prime minister, Bardella will face the problem common to parties that make the leap from protest vote to credible governing force: How, after making extravagant promises as they rail against the mainstream, to avoid disappointing people once in office? Despite its freshened image, its decades-old philosophy remains the same: Immigrants threaten France\u2019s social fabric. The RN is committed to abolishing the birthright to citizenship for children of foreigners born on French soil, and to discriminate in favor of French citizens in welfare and public employment. But on other things in its 21-page manifesto, the RN is more vague. Detailing how it intends to \u201cpreserve French civilization,\u201d it says it will enact \u201cspecific legislation targeting Islamist ideologies,\u201d without elaborating, and that it will \u201cexperiment with the creation of a voluntary national heritage service.\u201d But already, the RN has begun to temper some of its more extreme nativist positions. After initially advocating to ban dual-citizenship, Bardella softened this stance, but maintained that \u201cthe most strategic positions\u201d within government will be reserved for French citizens. \u201cCan you imagine Franco-Russians working at the Ministry of the Armed Forces today?\u201d he said ahead of the first round. But the party has not yet provided a definition of \u201cstrategic positions.\u201d Could, for instance, the Spanish-born Mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo remain in post, or would she have to renounce her Spanish citizenship? Mocking the vagueness of the RN\u2019s pledges, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon \u2013 the far-left leader of the France Unbowed party, which belongs to the New Popular Front coalition \u2013 has asked: \u201cWhat does Mr. Bardella want? We don\u2019t know. He says nothing. He\u2019s a good-looking guy, but what\u2019s his program? Throwing immigrants into the sea.\u201d Critics have said Bardella\u2019s chronic absence from key votes while he was a member of the European Parliament, and his lack of grasp of policy details, make him unfit to govern. In a recent debate with Gabriel Attal, the outgoing French prime minister and Macron\u2019s protege, Bardella confessed, with a smirk, to not having read the text of a bill he had voted against. On the economy, the RN has pledged to slash value-added tax on electricity, fuel and other energy products from 20% to 5.5% and suspend it entirely for scores of basic necessities. While this may be appealing to voters, it has alarmed both Brussels and the financial markets. France is running one of the highest deficits in the eurozone and now risks falling foul of the European Commission\u2019s new fiscal rules, which had been suspended to help countries recover from the Covid-19 pandemic and energy crisis. French government spending could soon be brutally constrained by Brussels, despite the lavish promises of the RN. \u201cTightening will be necessary next year, to bring France into compliance with EU expectations and rules,\u201d Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe at political risk consultancy the Eurasia Group, told CNN. If the RN falls short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, Bardella might choose not to govern. In bullish speeches before the first-round vote, he ruled out leading a minority government, which would require the support of allied parties to pass laws. While France might escape a far-right government for now, it faces the growing prospect of Le Pen becoming president in 2027, and then calling parliamentary elections to see Bardella installed as prime minister. The Meloni model? Since 2022, formerly fringe nativist parties hoping to govern have found a model to follow. After the technocratic government led by Mario Draghi collapsed in Italy, triggering a snap election, Giorgia Meloni became Italian prime minister, becoming the country\u2019s most far-right leader since Benito Mussolini. Before she took office, Rome\u2019s allies thought a hard-right Italian government could compromise Western unity on support for Ukraine, pointing to Matteo Salvini, Meloni\u2019s deputy prime minister and a longtime admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin who used to don T-shirts emblazoned with his image. But Meloni\u2019s premiership has proven more moderate than many feared at the outset. While she has pursued hard-right policies domestically \u2013 seeking to limit abortion, surrogacy and even removing lesbian mothers\u2019 names from their children\u2019s birth certificates \u2013 she has largely toed a mainstream line on foreign policy issues. Might the RN adopt this bifurcated strategy? The RN is notoriously euroskeptic, but talk of a \u201cFrexit\u201d has cooled - perhaps because Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union proved an act of serious economic self-harm, and perhaps because hard-right leaders \u2013 like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban \u2013 have shown it is easier to weaken the bloc from the inside than from without. With that aim, the RN has promised to cut funding to the EU by up to 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion), partly to fund tax cuts at home. But, with EU budgets agreed on a seven-year basis and the current one running until 2027, the RN cannot legally renege on France\u2019s spending commitments. Bardella has also ruled out sending French troops to Ukraine \u2013 an idea floated by Macron \u2013 and said he would not allow Kyiv to use French military equipment to strike targets inside Russia. But a Bardella premiership could tip France into a constitutional crisis. While the National Assembly is responsible for passing domestic laws and the prime minister controls the budget, the president determines the country\u2019s foreign, Europe and defense policy. When the prime minister and president belong to different parties \u2013 in a rare arrangement known as \u201ccohabitation\u201d \u2013 things can grind to a halt. With Macron set to see out his term, which finishes in 2027, the line between domestic and foreign issues may become blurred. If Macron pursues a foreign policy that requires parliament to pass large spending bills, it is not clear whose preferences would prevail: his or Bardella\u2019s.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/europe/jordan-bardella-national-rally-france-profile-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_when-your-home-becomes-a-tourist-attraction", "text": "Have you ever looked at a beautiful little mews house in London and thought \u201cit must be so amazing to live there?\u201d If so, you\u2019re not the only one. But for the people who actually do live in those homes, social media photography has changed what it means to live in a picturesque place. Alice Johnston is a longtime resident of Notting Hill, the London neighborhood famous for pastel-painted row houses and for being the setting of the Julia Roberts/Hugh Grant movie of the same name. Johnston,\u00a0a journalist, has complicated feelings about her Instagram-beloved \u2018hood. She lives on Portobello Road, one of the capital\u2019s most famous streets, and has witnessed all kinds of crazy behavior committed in the pursuit of the perfect snapshot. Once, she and a friend were walking his French bulldog when a tourist asked if they could \u201cborrow\u201d the pup for a quick photo op. The friend and the dog consented, the Instagrammer posed with the Frenchie in front of a bright blue door and then handed over five pounds as a thank you. Private lives, public places In that story, everybody had a good time. But there can be a darker side to living inside what some people think is a movie set. \u201cI was once woken up at 6 a.m. on Easter Sunday by French teenagers taking pictures outside,\u201d Johnston says. She shares another anecdote: \u201cOne time I was changing after I got out of the shower and there was this elderly man taking a picture (of my windows) with an iPad.\u201d Although the shutters were closed at the time, she was understandably rattled by the experience. When private homes \u2013 and the people who live in them \u2013 become tourist attractions, clashes can occur. In more rural areas, people can put up fences or other barriers to access, but when these private homes are on public streets in some of the world\u2019s busiest cities, what\u2019s a resident to do? Different communities have taken different approaches. In Hong Kong, a group of five interconnected housing estates nicknamed \u201cthe Monster Building\u201d became a huge selfie spot after it was featured in several Hollywood films, including \u201cTransformers: Age of Extinction.\u201d The mega-building is in Quarry Bay, a relatively quiet neighborhood on the eastern side of Hong Kong island that most travelers skip over. Residents of the working-class community are not able to block the building off due to the fact that there are public businesses on the ground floors. Therefore, some have taken things into their own hands by posting signs asking visitors to be respectful. A sign in English and Chinese erected by building residents reads \u201cThis is a private estate Trespassers are strictly prohibited from all kinds of activities (including but not limited to photographing, gatherings, use of drones and yelling e.t.c.). We shall not take responsibility for property damage and/or personal injury caused by any accident.\u201d However, many visitors ignore the signs or simply think of them as suggestions, and a quick scan of Instagram shows plenty of recent images taken there. Johnston says that a pale-pink house near where she lives has become such a popular photo site that the residents have given up on trying to keep people away. Instead, they\u2019ve put up a donation box asking people to contribute money to charity in exchange for snapping a photo. When your home is a piece of history Chuck Henderson\u2019s grandmother, Della, was a lover of architecture \u2013 so much that she was able to commission a home in California built by the world-renowned American architect\u00a0Frank Lloyd Wright. The Mrs. Clinton Walker House in Carmel-by-the-Sea, nicknamed \u201cthe Cabin on the Rocks,\u201d was completed in 1951 and passed into the hands of Henderson and some of his relatives when Walker died. No one lives in it full time, but the different family members and their guests take turns staying there. Wright fans will come from all over the world to try and get glimpses of some of his masterpieces. While some, like the famous Fallingwater house in Pennsylvania, are year-round attractions, others remain private residences. Many people who own homes featured in architecture textbooks have to add the cost of security measures onto other expenses like utilities and homeowners insurance. \u201cWe put these security cameras in after we had some vandalism about six or seven years ago,\u201d Henderson says. The vandalism in question wasn\u2019t graffiti, though. He explains: \u201cWe have this big wooden remnant of a tree that is placed as the centerpiece of the garden by the original landscape designer. Someone cut a notch from it. It looked clean, like someone used a chainsaw or something. One of our doors \u2013 between the carport and the main house \u2013 has a bunch of nautical cork discs in a rope net and is the counterweight for the door. That has been absconded with a couple of times.\u201d Stlll, though, Henderson and his family have the last laugh on the cork disc thieves \u2013 those weren\u2019t designed by Wright and are of little, if any, value. \u201cWe have people go walking right by the \u2018private property, no trespassing\u2019 sign. We\u2019ve had people dancing in our carport. We get a few people wandering up as a surprise, and as long as they don\u2019t do anything wrong we don\u2019t try to call the police. We\u2019re on a beach surrounded by road and don\u2019t have a lawn, but we had a family of deer.\u201d Coming to a compromise When it comes to living in a much-photographed place, some people try to take the good with the bad. Johnston tries to be sympathetic to travelers coming to her hometown, recalling how she loved taking pictures of historic neighborhoods like the Marais in Paris and Alfama in Lisbon. In fact, she recently found photos of herself as a teenager hanging out at the Notting Hill Carnival, years before she moved to the capital herself. \u201cI love to travel, so I have to be pretty understanding when people travel to where I live, and i feel lucky that it\u2019s cool enough that people want to come where I live.\u201d Henderson and his relatives have come to some compromises in order to let design buffs explore the home while also maintaining their privacy. They occasionally rent it out for photo shoots, such as a campaign by\u00a0eyewear brand Oliver Peoples. In addition, they open the home to the public one day a year to benefit the local Carmel Heritage Society. In 2021, 657 people came bought tickets and toured the property. \u201cFor us it\u2019s a tremendous pleasure to be able to share the house and see so many people happy and excited about it,\u201d says Henderson. \u201cAnd it allows us to be able to tell people when it is open. It gives them an option (to visit) and we don\u2019t have to be the Grinch.\u201d Still, it\u2019s not clear if anyone in the family changed their minds about looking after such a high-profile residence. Henderson and his relatives sold the house in 2023.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/when-your-home-becomes-a-tourist-attraction/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

The change in Hamas\u2019 position was first reported by Reuters, and comes amid intensified efforts towards reaching an agreement.\u00a0The group has long demanded Israel agree to a permanent ceasefire before signing any deal, terms Israel sees as unacceptable. The apparent willingness to compromise raises the possibility a deal could be reached. Hamas would instead accept that talks on reaching a permanent ceasefire would take place throughout the first phase of any deal, which would last six weeks, the official told CNN. The Hamas official \u2013 who is a member of the negotiating team \u2013 confirmed to CNN that mediators would guarantee a temporary truce, the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli troops so long as indirect talks continued on implementing the second phase of the agreement. The Hamas official, who declined to be named, said Hamas accepted a proposal to begin talks on releasing Israeli men and soldiers held in Gaza no later than 16 days after the first phase of the agreement begins to be implemented. Israeli media previously reported that a draft Israeli plan laid out\u00a0terms for a similar agreement. The draft stipulates that \u201cno later than the 16th day, indirect negotiations will begin between the two parties to conclude the conditions for the implementation of phase 2 of this agreement. The negotiations should be completed before the end of the 5th week of the first phase.\u201d The Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) has not confirmed the authenticity of that draft. Indirect negotiations between an Israeli team and Hamas resumed in Qatar this week after Prime Minister Netanyahu authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations to try and broker a deal. Mossad director David Barea was in Qatar\u00a0to meet with the mediators and discuss the details of a potential new framework agreement for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Upon his return, the PMO issued a statement saying \u201cthere are still gaps\u201d between the parties. Efforts to reach a deal between Hamas and Israel have stalled for months. Netanyahu \u2013 who faces competing pressure from far-right cabinet ministers and family members of hostages to secure their release - has said Israel won\u2019t stop fighting until Hamas is destroyed. A three-phase Israeli proposal was unveiled by US President Joe Biden in May, setting conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.

{"id": "2024_07_06_middleeast_palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl", "text": "Nearly 2 million people have been displaced in Gaza \u2013 almost the entire population \u2013 after the Israeli military last week ordered a further 80,000 people to evacuate parts of Gaza City amid a renewed ground operation, latest UN figures show. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has stepped up assaults in several parts of the Strip, including the Shujaya neighborhood in the north, where it previously said it had dismantled Hamas. UNRWA, the main UN agency for Palestinian refugees, estimates that up to 1.9 million people in Gaza have been internally displaced \u2013 about 90% of the population of the Strip, estimated by the UN to be around 2.1 million people. The number of displaced people rose from 1.7 million since Israel launched its offensive on the southern city of Rafah in May. The fresh flurry of offensives raises questions about how and when Israel will wind down its war, which has been fought for nearly nine months with the aims of destroying Hamas\u2019 military and governing capacities and rescuing Israeli hostages. Israeli officials had said its incursion into Rafah \u2013 the southernmost point of Gaza to which Hamas was thought to have regrouped after Israel\u2019s destruction of the north \u2013 would be the final stage of its war, but the uptick in fighting in the north suggests Hamas retains an ongoing presence. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Saturday that 80,000 people have been displaced this week after the IDF issued evacuation orders in eastern areas of Gaza City. Renewed offensives In Shujaya, the IDF said Saturday that its combat teams had fought \u201carmed squads\u201d of Hamas militants over the past 24 hours, \u201cdestroying weapons and terrorist infrastructures above and below the ground.\u201d It said its soldiers ambushed a group of Hamas fighters and \u201celiminated all the terrorists without any casualties to our forces,\u201d and that an air strike had wiped out a terrorist squad with rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launchers. Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense told CNN on Saturday that Israeli bombing in the area has continued \u201cwithout stopping.\u201d \u201cThe situation in Shujaya has been the same for 10 days and our crews cannot enter to save lives there,\u201d it said. Meanwhile, operations have also continued in southern Rafah, where the bulk of Palestinian civilians had initially been displaced. The IDF said it had eliminated a number of \u201cterrorist cells\u201d and underground structures. The IDF did not provide a figure for the number of airstrikes in Gaza over the past 24 hours. The fighting is continuing to take a huge toll on civilians, many of whom have been displaced nine or 10 times already. One man displaced in Khan Younis told CNN about the hours needed to get hold of small amounts of clean water. \u201cLife in tents is very difficult. We live on sand. Clothes get dirty. Hands get dirty. The body needs to be cleaned. Dining utensils need to be cleaned,\u201d Zakaria Bakr, from the Al-Shati camp, told CNN Saturday. He said his children often have to fetch water for the family. \u201cThe children live a life that is not their own and they have never known this suffering before,\u201d he said. On Friday, UNRWA posted a video of people in makeshift tents on a beach in the central city of Nuseirat, saying they were \u201cbuilding sand walls to protect themselves from the incoming tide.\u201d \u201cThere are few safe spaces left for families to move to,\u201d it said. \u201cMany families rely on seawater for washing, cleaning and even drinking.\u201d Elsewhere in Nuseirat, three journalists were killed Saturday in a strike on an apartment building, the Hamas-run government media office told CNN. Since Friday, two other journalists have also been killed in other parts of the Strip, it said. CNN is asking the IDF for comment on the Nuseirat strike. Across the Strip, fuel shortages are threatening work at hospitals, and in distributing the trickle of aid passing into Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for administering the delivery of aid to Gaza, said Friday that the content of 1,150 aid trucks is waiting to be collected on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom crossing. Gaza\u2019s Minister of Health warned Saturday of \u201cthe continuing\u00a0fuel\u00a0crisis necessary to operate hospital generators, oxygen stations, and refrigerators for storing medicines in all health facilities.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/middleeast/palestinians-displaced-gaza-israel-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

Nearly 70 million people are under heat alerts Sunday, after over three dozen high-temperature records were either set or tied on Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. Highs in the upper 90s to 110s are expected up and down the West Coast and parts of the Great Basin. \u201cIn the West, intense widespread dangerous heat will continue through early next week,\u201d the weather service said. \u201cAll-time heat records may be possible in a few locations.\u201d By Wednesday, over 250 warm high and low temperature records could be set. And nearly 40 million people in the contiguous US are forecast to see temperatures over 100 degrees over the next seven days. A slew of daily temperature records were broken this Fourth of July weekend. On Saturday, Death Valley reached 128 degrees, breaking the daily record of 127 set on July 6, 2007. Las Vegas reached 115 degrees, tying with records in 2007 and 1989. Kingman, Arizona, reached 109 degrees, breaking the previous record of 108. On Sunday, temperatures in Las Vegas hit 120 degrees for the first time in recorded history, according to preliminary data from the weather service.\u00a0In more than 32,000 days of records, the temperature had never climbed above 117 degrees prior to Sunday. The city\u2019s heat is not just a record for its peak temperature, but also for its longevity. Las Vegas temperatures have exceeded 110 degrees each day since July 3 and are forecast to do so every day until at least next Sunday. That will mark a stretch of prolonged extreme heat longer than any ever experienced in the city, with 11 days or more above 110 degrees. In California, Daggett broke its daily temperature record, reaching 117 degrees. Bishop reached 108 degrees, setting another record for the state. Several record highs were also set in the Sacramento area, including in Redding, where it reached 119 degrees and beat the all-time high temperature record of 118, according to the weather service in Sacramento. Extremely dangerous heat is expected to persist in the West, with excessive heat watches, warnings and heat advisories in effect for much of the region. Heat warnings are active in California and Nevada due to the increased risk of heat-related illnesses there. \u201cIntense, widespread, and long duration heat building in the West will be extremely dangerous and potentially deadly if not taken seriously,\u201d the weather service said. An excessive heat warning is in effect until late Wednesday evening for Death Valley, California, where temperatures are expected to be between 122 to 129 degrees. Elsewhere in the state, Owens Valley could reach 111 degrees, and Barstow could reach 118. In Nevada, Las Vegas and Pahrump could also reach 118 degrees. \u201cHot temperatures overnight will mean little relief from the daytime heat, especially in Las Vegas and Death Valley, where low temperatures may not fall below 90 degrees for several days,\u201d the National Weather Service said. Death Valley \u2013 the driest national park in the US \u2013 could hit a sizzling 130 degrees by Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service in Las Vegas. For people without adequate cooling and hydration, the multi-day nature of the heat and record warm overnight temperatures could cause heat stress to build. Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the\u00a0weather service. Oregon and Washington have both also seen record heat and temperatures are expected to remain in the triple digits through early next week. \u201cLook for more records to fall in the coming days as temperatures in the inland valleys are likely to climb near or above 100 degrees each day through Tuesday, July 9,\u201d the weather service in Portland said. Meanwhile, heat and humidity in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast is forecast to gradually subside into next week, lingering longest along the Gulf Coast and into the Carolinas, the weather service said. Heat index values approaching 110 degrees on Saturday in the mid-Atlantic region will be lowered to near 100 degrees on Sunday. Heat advisories currently stretch from upstate New York down the East Coast to Alabama. In the West, the heat wave is expected to expand into the Great Basin and eventually the northern High Plains into next week. It\u2019s likely to remain into mid-July, according to the weather service. Wildfire threat is fueled by unrelenting heat Intense heat, paired with dry windy conditions, is bringing a critical risk of wildfires to parts of the upper Great Basin toward the Four Corners for the rest of the weekend. Portions of southern Idaho and southern Utah are particularly at risk. Sweltering heat on the West Coast could continue to fuel large wildfires in California. More than 3,000 wildfires across the state have burned over 150,000 acres so far in 2024, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.   Cal Fire spokesperson Nick Schuler says triple-digit temperatures and critical fire weather conditions have proven to be a challenge for\u00a0the more than 3,500\u00a0firefighters battling fires across the state. \u201cChallenges are immense. We\u2019re dealing with the increased temperatures, very steep and remote terrain,\u201d Schuler told CNN\u2019s Fredricka Whitfield, adding \u201cthe ability for rapid growth from the amount of vegetation that\u2019s across the state is a challenge.\u201d The Basin Fire, which is the largest active wildfire in the state, burned over 14,000 acres in Fresno County and was 60% contained Saturday evening, according to the Cal Fire. Another large wildfire, the Lake Fire, ignited Friday afternoon in Santa Barbara County and has already scorched over 13,200 acres. The Santa Barbara Sheriff\u2019s Office issued evacuation warnings in nearby areas and several roads were closed. The Thompson Fire, for which California Gov. Gavin Newsom had issued an emergency declaration, was 79% contained as of Saturday night. After starting Tuesday, it has burned through nearly 4,000 acres in Butte County. Two firefighters were injured, 26 structures were destroyed and eight were damaged by the fire, according to Cal Fire. \u201cDangerously hot and dry conditions were observed across the incident,\u201d according to Cal Fire. The French Fire in Mariposa County was 35% contained and had burned through over 900 acres after it started on the fourth of July. Due to the fire, evacuation orders and warnings were issued, four firefighters were injured and four structures were destroyed, according to Cal Fire. Meanwhile, the Mccain Fire in San Diego County had burned about 1,500 acres and was 95% contained. \u201cWe are happy to report that we are seeing an increase in the percentage of containment,\u201d Schuler said. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to lift some of the evacuation orders and warnings allowing people to start to cautiously make way back to their homes.\u201d But\u00a0crews still have to contend with\u00a0several\u00a0days\u00a0ahead\u00a0of\u00a0continued\u00a0heat, Schuler said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/weather/west-coast-heat-wave-california-nevada-oregon/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_middleeast_israel-netanyahu-talks-hamas-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has authorized his negotiators to enter into detailed negotiations to try and broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas, an Israeli official and a source familiar with the negotiations said. The decision signals that Israel and Hamas are entering a new phase of negotiations that could produce a final deal within a matter of weeks, if successful. Israel and Hamas on Thursday both appeared inclined to underplay the latest developments in written statements, with people involved in the talks expressing cautious optimism. For months, Israel and Hamas have engaged in mediated negotiations focused on trying to reach a framework agreement, intentionally leaving key details \u2014 such as the identity of Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for hostages \u2014 \u00a0aside as they worked to hammer out a framework. The breakthrough in the talks came earlier this week after the United States proposed new language for two key clauses (8 and 14) focused on the scope and sequencing of negotiations set to take place during the first phase of the agreement in order to unlock the second phase of the deal. Hamas broadly agreed with the new language, unlocking detailed negotiations following Netanyahu\u2019s approval. Mossad Director David Barnea, who has led Israel\u2019s negotiating team, is set to lead the negotiating delegation for the new round of detailed talks, an Israeli source familiar with the talks said. Talks are expected to be held in Doha, Qatar, starting as early as Friday, according to a senior Biden administration official. The Mossad director is expected to meet with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani for discussions aiming to bring the parties closer to a deal in Gaza, according to a source with knowledge of the talks. Those negotiations are expected to last two to three weeks, the Israeli source said, to resolve issues such as the identities of Palestinian prisoners to be released, the exact ratio of prisoners to hostages and the technical sequencing of the releases. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas\u2019 political bureau,\u00a0told CNN,\u00a0\u201cthere is nothing official about an effective agreement for ceasefire. The enemy\u2019s media are talking about sending a delegation to Egypt,\u00a0but there is nothing official or any details. Negotiations did not start yet.\u201d \u201cWe are also waiting for a positive response from the Israeli side, which will initiate negotiations into details of the deal,\u201d Naim added. \u201cWe have no information about any delegation visiting Cairo.\u201d Netanyahu spoke Thursday with US President Joe Biden to discuss the progress in the negotiations and the Israeli Cabinet was set to meet Thursday evening. The call focused on the details of the hostage and ceasefire deal, the senior Biden administration official said, adding that there seems to be a \u201cpretty significant opening\u201d for the hostage deal to be agreed upon by all the involved groups. When asked if the administration believes that Netanyahu is playing politics and could try to sabotage the deal, the official said that the deal is structured in a way that \u201cfully protects Israel\u2019s interests.\u201d The official added that Biden will have the opportunity to talk about the deal with other world leaders next week during the NATO summit, which will be held in Washington, DC.

Gunmen opened fire at multiple places of worship and a police traffic stop in two cities in the Muslim-majority republic on June 23, killing at least 15 police officers and at least four civilians, including an Orthodox priest, according to authorities. The niqab ban is to take place until \u201cthe identified threats are eliminated and a new theological conclusion is issued,\u201d deputy head of the Mufti of Dagestan Abdulla Salimov said in a video message Wednesday. Assistant to the Mufti of Dagestan Muhammad Muhammadov told the Russian news agency EA Regnum on Wednesday that \u201cthe ban applies in public places where security and personal identification are necessary,\u201d such as streets, public institutions, and other places where there are \u201clarge gatherings of people.\u201d \u201cThe Muftiyat\u2019s recommendation is aimed at preventing potential threats and maintaining public order. The duration of the ban depends on the development of the situation in the region,\u201d he said. The Coordination Center of Muslims of the North Caucasus issued a statement on Wednesday in which it called the wearing of the niqab, burqa and other outer garments that cover the face \u201charmful to Muslims, threatening discord in inter-religious and interethnic relations.\u201d Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the Investigative Committee of Russia, called on lawmakers to \u201curgently\u201d ban the wearing of niqabs in Russia on Saturday. Bastrykin blamed \u201cIslamist terrorists\u201d for the deadly shooting in Dagestan.

{"id": "2024_07_03_tech_elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices", "text": "Actress Judy Garland never recorded her voice to read an audiobook of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but you\u2019ll soon be able to hear her rendition of the children\u2019s novel that inspired the movie nonetheless. Earlier this week, AI company ElevenLabs said it is bringing digitally produced celebrity voice-overs of deceased actors, including Garland, James Dean and Burt Reynolds, to its newly launched Reader app. The company said the app takes articles, PDF, ePub, newsletters, e-books or any other text on your phone and turns it into voice-overs.  \u201cWe deeply respect their legacy and are honored to have their voices as part of our platform,\u201d said Dustin Blank, head of partnerships at ElevenLabs. \u201cAdding them to our growing list of narrators marks a major step forward in our mission of making content accessible in any language and voice.\u201d The company said it made deals with the estates of the actors whose voices are being used, but did not share details about compensation. The effort shows the potential of artificial intelligence for Hollywood but also sets a precedent for licensing and working with estates. It also comes at a time when the technology has grown by leaps and bounds, particularly in its ability to create images, text and sound, making it easy for anyone to create a version of someone\u2019s voice saying something they never did. That, in turn, has raised questions in creative industries such as journalism and film about how artificial intelligence can \u2014 or even should \u2014 be used. ElevenLabs previously made headlines earlier this year when its tool was reportedly used to create a fake robocall from President Joe Biden urging people not to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s presidential primary. Copyright questions and authenticity The partnership with the stars\u2019 estates comes two months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI came under fire after introducing a synthetic voice that was eerily similar to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s character in the film \u201cHer.\u201d Johansson said in a statement shared with CNN that she was \u201cshocked, angered and in disbelief\u201d that the company would use her likeliness likeness after she turned down a partnership opportunity with OpenAI. Although a person can\u2019t copyright their own voice, it\u2019s possible to copyright a recording, according to David Gunkel, a professor at the department of communications at Northern Illinois University who tracks AI in media and entertainment. The AI is trained on old recordings and those recordings are under copyright. \u201cElevenLabs\u2019 new partnerships are all well within the realm of what the law allows,\u201d he said. \u201cAn estate will get a considerable amount of money from licensing and agreements. It\u2019s not unlike a company negotiating a copyright deal to use a popular song by Queen in an ad. The record company also could in theory say no, no matter how much money they\u2019re offered.\u201d Bern Elliot, a vice president and analyst at market research firm Gartner, said AI models can now be trained on fewer audio recordings; very little is needed to capture tone, speech patterns and other elements, whether it\u2019s for a celebrity or an everyday person. \u201cThe bigger concern is determining what the owner of those recordings can or can\u2019t do to monetize the voice,\u201d he said. Media companies are also ramping up their use of AI for voiceovers. Last week, NBC announced it is bringing an AI-version version of famed sportscaster Al Michaels back to the Olympics this summer, in daily recaps on its Peacock streaming platform. An NBC spokesperson told CNN that Michaels is being compensated for his involvement. It\u2019s unclear, however, how AI versions of well-known voices will be received by mass audiences and if it will raise concerns around authenticity. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet the supposed market for these types of things but you can already see with audiobooks that ones read by recognizable voices and celebrities are a hot commodity,\u201d Gunkel said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to have a celebrity do all kinds of content and not voice it themselves, that could open up the market even wider.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/03/tech/elevenlabs-ai-celebrity-voices/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

However, we have counted 51 candidates, deputies, or campaigners who have been physically assaulted. I am not counting verbal aggressions here,\u201d Darmanin told CNN affiliate BFMTV. The attacks have ranged from the less severe to \u201cextremely serious,\u201d Darmanin said, adding that some candidates have been hospitalised for their injuries. Roughly thirty or so people have been taken in for questioning in relation to the attacks, Darmanin added. France has been grappling with high tensions in the run-up to this Sunday\u2019s elections. An additional 30,000 police have been laid on to ensure that neither the far-left nor the far-right succeed in \u201ccreating disorder,\u201d Darmanin said earlier this week. Politicians have\u00a0repeatedly warned that a far-right victory\u00a0could provoke huge protests in the streets, with French President Emmanuel Macron going so far as to say \u201ccivil war\u201d may break out if the extreme left or right wins by a large margin in Sunday\u2019s runoff vote. French government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot and her team came under attack while canvassing on Wednesday night. Meanwhile, National Rally (RN) politician Marie Dauchy, who is running in the southeastern constituency of Savoie, opted to suspend her campaign after she said was physically assaulted while campaigning at a market. In Cherbourg, a center-right candidate from The Republicans party, Nicolas Conquer, made a formal complaint after he claimed he was assaulted by left-wing campaigners on Monday. The terror threat in the country \u201cremains extremely strong,\u201d the interior minister warned on Friday, adding that several arrests had recently taken place in two separate places. Although the two incidents \u201ccould qualify as terrorist\u201d incidents, they need to be formally classified as such by the national anti-terrorist prosecutor, Darmanin added. RN, the party of far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen, led the first round of\u00a0France\u2019s\u00a0parliamentary elections last Sunday, taking it closer to the gates of power than ever before. After an unusually high turnout, the RN bloc clinched 33.15% of the vote, while the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition came second with 27.99% and Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance slumped to a dismal third with 20.76%, according to final results published by the Interior Ministry on Monday. While the RN appears on track to win the most seats in the National Assembly, it may fall short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, suggesting France may be heading for a hung parliament and more political uncertainty.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/french-elections-political-violence-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

CNN cannot independently verify the ministry\u2019s numbers. A displaced man at the school told CNN children were among the injured. \u201cThere was a swing here, swings were here, (children) were playing. What was their fault?\u201d he said as he held his little daughter. \u201cWe barely found this place in the school, but even the school is not safe.\u201d CNN video shows several injured children arriving at a nearby hospital following the attack. The Israeli military said in a statement on Saturday militants were operating in structures located in the school area. \u201cThis location served as a hideout and operational infrastructure from which attacks against IDF (Israel Defense Forces) troops operating in the Gaza Strip were directed and carried out,\u201d the statement added. CNN cannot independently verify the Israeli military\u2019s claim. UNRWA Communication Director Juliette Touma told CNN UNRWA does not have all the information yet, adding that half of UNRWA\u2019s facilities in Gaza have been hit since October 7. \u201cAt least 500 people sheltering in those (UNRWA) facilities have been killed, many were women and children,\u201d she added. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry said it \u201ccondemned in the strongest terms\u201d the attack on the UNRWA building, which it said \u201chouses thousands of displaced civilians.\u201d Jordan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the strike and what it called Israel\u2019s \u201cclear disregard for the rules of international law,\u201d saying that humanitarian facilities and shelters must be protected under international law. The news comes just as it appeared some progress was being made in long-stalled hostage release and truce negotiations. A senior Hamas official told CNN the militant group was ready to reconsider its insistence that Israel commit to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza before signing an agreement that would usher in a temporary truce and begin a process to release hostages. Meanwhile, the near-weekly demonstrations against the Israeli government continued on Saturday. Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv\u2019s Democracy Square to call for new elections and the release of hostages amid discontent with how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has handled issues including the war in Gaza. Israeli police said in a statement that two protesters were arrested at the Tel Aviv demonstration, citing violations of public order and unsafe behavior, including \u201clighting bonfires on the road.\u201d The police said they deployed in large forces to maintain security and order and dispersed the demonstration after protesters illegally gathered on Menachem Begin Road and tried to block it, despite initial approval for the protest. Protesters waved Israeli flags and held signs criticizing Netanyahu, while police used water cannons to disperse demonstrators blocking the traffic on the Ayalon Highway. \u201cAfter most of the protesters dispersed naturally and in light of the violations of order by a handful of protesters, the police had to declare an illegal demonstration,\u201d the police said. \u201cDuring the dispersal of the rioters, the police arrested two suspects.\u201d The Israeli police further warned that it \u201cwill act with zero tolerance towards those who disrupt the order and will not listen to the policemen\u2019s instructions.\u201d The chairman of Israel\u2019s National Unity and former war cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, was seen participating in a rally calling for the return of the hostages. The often-weekly demonstrations have yet to change the political landscape, and Netanyahu still controls a stable majority in parliament. Additional reporting by Hamdi Alkhshali and Ibrahim Dahman.

To win a working parliamentary majority of over 170 seats just four-and-a-half years after his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, led the party to its worst loss in a generation is nothing short of remarkable. Starmer was arguably elected on a mandate of change rather than on a personal endorsement. It is no secret that a large number of voters were not voting exactly for Starmer himself, but to get rid of a Conservative Party that had been in power for 14 years and led the country through some of its most chaotic days in peacetime. The change the country has voted for could be interpreted in many ways, as there is a lot wrong with the UK right now. Waiting lists for doctors\u2019 appointments are in the millions. The cost-of-living crisis that has plagued Europe left many in Britain having to make unthinkable decisions between heating their homes or eating. Immigration, particularly irregular migration, has become a major issue for voters on the right. There are many more examples but, bluntly, there has been a sense for some time that the UK simply doesn\u2019t function well as a country. If the Brexit vote of 2016 told the British political establishment anything, it\u2019s that large parts of the nation were fed up with the status quo. If nothing else, Starmer has to make the people of Britain feel that they are living better lives with his time in office. But he must do so with some challenges, despite the size of his majority. It is no secret that he doesn\u2019t have a huge amount of public money to spend. He has loosely pledged not to raise taxes. Convincing the public that the Labour Party could be trusted with public finances was a big part of his electoral campaign. This combination of limited public money and a promise to balance the books runs into another of the key challenges facing Starmer: those in his own party who believe he should be radical. Of course, Labour members and activists are pleased to see the back of the Conservative Party after 14 long years in power. But some, especially on the left of the party, don\u2019t want to see a thumping majority squandered on moderate policy that returns right-wingers to power in five years. Their concerns may not be completely unfounded. While the story of this election is Starmer\u2019s landslide, the anti-Conservative vote split in a few different directions. Most notably, the hard-right Reform UK, led by friend of Donald Trump Nigel Farage, secured 14% of the national vote. Reform took a lot of votes from the Conservatives through vicious attacks on its record in government. It\u2019s extremely likely that with Starmer now in power, Farage and his acolytes will turn their attention to tearing chunks out of the Labour Party. If Starmer decides to stick to his moderate guns, it isn\u2019t hard to see how Reform starts labeling this Labour government as virtually the same as the Conservatives, using populist rhetoric that clearly appeals to many in Britain. On the other hand, Starmer cannot afford to spook the center-ground majority that just put him in Downing Street, having believed and trusted his message that he would be stable and responsible. Delivering meaningful change while trying to stand still is not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination. It is likely that Starmer will soon have to make some difficult decisions that will deviate in some way from his pledges made while running for office. This is normal, and most governments have to make some compromises while in power. But it will upset some of his own base. Fortunately for Starmer, he has quite a lot of political capital to spend. What he must now decide is who he spends it on.

Robert Woodland was found guilty of attempted trafficking of large amounts of illegal drugs as part of an organized group, the Ostankino District Court of Moscow said. Woodland\u2019s lawyers told reporters after the verdict was delivered that they would appeal the ruling as Woodland\u2019s guilt had not been proven, the Associated Press (AP) reported. Woodland has been suffering from unspecified mental health issues, his lawyer Stanislav Kshevitsky told AP without providing any details. He added that the court didn\u2019t take those issues into account. CNN is reaching out to his lawyers for comment. Moscow\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office\u00a0said that on January 3, Woodland was caught trying to hide a \u201clarge batch\u201d of mephedrone after he had transported the synthetic stimulant to an apartment in Moscow. Prosecutors said he had used the apartment to bag the drugs in 49 smaller packages for further illegal sale. Woodland is a US citizen of Russian origin who was adopted by US scientists and he returned to Russia 27 years later. He was born on December 7, 1991, and his real name is Roman Romanov. He comes from the Perm Krai region, far from Moscow and just West of the Ural mountains. The pro-Kremlin tabloid Komosomolskaya Pravda reported in 2020 that Woodland was two years old when he was brought to the US.

Two baroque thrones for the bride and groom. But perhaps the most memorable detail of all: The newlyweds dressed in matching purple Antonio Berardi outfits for their reception. This was, of course, the holy union of Victoria and David Beckham. The British power couple got hitched in 1999, fusing the worlds of fashion and football forever.

The painting depicts Jesus, Mary and Joseph resting on their way to Egypt after learning that Herod, King of Judea, wanted to kill the young Christ. Titian, whose real name was Tiziano Vecellio, made the work in the first decade of the 16th century, at the beginning of his career. Measuring just 18.25 inches by 24.75 inches (46.2 centimeters x 62.9 centimeters), the painting is tiny compared with some of the massive works for which Titian became known later in his life. The oil-on-canvas work has a remarkable history. After changing hands among various European aristocrats, the painting was looted by Napoleonic troops during the French occupation of Vienna in 1809 and taken to Paris. It was returned to Vienna in 1815 and again moved through private collections before ending up with John Alexander Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath, in Wiltshire, England.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_eat-until-youre-bankrupt-japan-osaka", "text": "Let\u2019s be honest. Osaka hasn\u2019t got Tokyo\u2019s mind-bending urban sprawl, where every turn opens up a world of adventure. Likewise, it lacks the historic temples, tree-covered hills and ancient history of Kyoto. What it does have, though, are two of the biggest draws any visitor to Japan could ask for. The best food anywhere in the country. And the people, who are funky, fun and playful. This is a place to come and eat, enjoy the odd local brew and take in a city where day-to-day pleasures come to the fore unlike anywhere else. Food is practically a religion in Osaka, which is now anticipating the global spotlight as it gears up to host Expo 2025. It is known as the kitchen of Japan, and, for foodies, any tour of its myriad culinary delights must start in Dotonbori. The streets along either side of the Dotonbori Canal, between the D\u014dtonboribashi Bridge and Nipponbashi Bridge, in the city\u2019s Namba district, are the place to spend a gut-busting afternoon. You\u2019ll know you\u2019re in the right place when you see restaurants adorned with huge, moving mechanical crabs and octopus models looming above, demanding you come inside and eat. Octopus is, unquestionably, the main ingredient here, the essential part of Osaka\u2019s great gift to Japan: takoyaki. Dough balls filled with diced octopus, fried until blisteringly hot, they can be picked up for on-the-go snacking wherever you turn. However, as Tokyo-based CNN producer Junko Ogura says, these are not for eating in one go. \u201cIt\u2019s really hot,\u201d she says. \u201cJust be careful. Not the whole thing!\u201d Of course, few tourists can resist this approach, even if it does leave them with a scorched mouth. Takoyaki is, however, just the start. As Junko explains, Osakans even have a saying for their food-based obsessions. \u201cKuidaore.\u201d It basically means: \u201cEat in Osaka like you\u2019re going to go bankrupt.\u201d That goes for easing succulent crab meat from its shell with chopsticks and dining on ultra-fresh sushi, with chefs working their magic and handing you the result to wolf down immediately. On Sennichimae Doguyasuji \u2013 aka \u201ckitchen shopping street\u201d \u2013 you can pick up the finest Japanese knives and cooking equipment, so you can continue to craft your own dishes back home. \u2018You look healthy, I love you\u2019 There is, though, one dish that you\u2019ll need to set aside a chunk of change for. Something so succulent and delicious that it has become renowned the world over. Kobe beef. Readily available in Dotonbori and across Osaka, this delicacy\u2019s reputation precedes it. This is meat reared to the most exacting standards, with prices to match. A kilo of Kobe grade 11 sirloin can go for $300 or more. Boarding a Shinkansen bullet train from the heart of Osaka, you can be in Kobe in just half an hour. The cows are raised just outside the city under strict conditions. Those who\u2019ve been in Japan for less than seven days cannot come into contact with them. In fact, to speak with a farmer involved in their care requires CNN\u2019s Junko to call them via Zoom. When asked how the cattle are treated compared with other cows, the farmer is effusive in his explanation. \u201cHe [touches] them as much as possible, talks to them and says, \u2018you look cute, you look healthy, I love you,\u2019\u201d says Junko, translating the farmer\u2019s words. If that seems out there, you can add in the well-worn fact that farmers massage and pet their cows. The farmer himself says that after three years of care, he is sad to see his charges head off to be slaughtered, but is happy in the knowledge that they provide happiness to those who eat them. Succulent, and with a melt-in-the-mouth texture, Kobe beef is arguably the best on Earth, a cornerstone of any foodie outing in Osaka. Let\u2019s all go to the ball game After all that food, a spot of exercise tends to be the order of the day. Like so many parts of Japan, Osaka is obsessed with baseball. The game has been a fixture in this part of the world since it was first introduced in 1872. Today, baseball is played by all ages, from kids in little league right through to octogenarians enjoying a pick-up game on a summer afternoon. It\u2019s as much about watching as it is playing, however. The local team is the Hanshin Tigers, one of the most storied baseball franchises in Japan. The club began life in 1936 and briefly played as the Osaka Tigers, before reverting to Hanshin, the city 20 minutes west, where it plays at Koshien Stadium. Long seen as an underdog, the Tigers won the Japan Series in 2023, breaking a 38-year hoodoo called \u201cThe Curse of the Colonel,\u201d believed to have been caused by overly excited fans throwing a statue of KFC legend Colonel Sanders into the Dotonbori Canal when they last won the title 1985. Hardcore fans attend every game, including Takada, a local man who spells out his priorities while sitting in the bleachers waiting for a rain-delayed game to get going. \u201cHanshin Tigers number one,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cHanshin Tigers. Then family. Then work or career.\u201d Takada says he wept when the Tigers won the pennant in 2023, hugging friends and crying so much that tears came out of his nose. Even today\u2019s game being called off can\u2019t dampen his spirits. A long soak If a love of nonstop action seems to be behind Osakans\u2019 fun and playful attitude, respite is at hand in the city\u2019s many marvelous onsens. These natural springs are part of a classic culture and require an etiquette all of their own. Tattoos must be covered, owing to body art being viewed historically in Japan as something that only adorned yakuza gangsters. Participants must be naked and are separated into men\u2019s and women\u2019s baths, ready for a wash and long soak at the end of a busy day at work. In the onsen, it\u2019s all about \u201cnaked friendship,\u201d a place where everybody is equal, much like the sauna cultures of Finland and Estonia. The beautiful countryside surrounding Osaka is full of them, but city center baths are easy to find too, making them an ideal spot to take time out and even meet a few local people \u2013 albeit without any clothes on. Osaka is, after all, a city of flavors and friendship. A place where you can eat royally and spend time doing so with people who are obsessed with the best food and making sure everyone receives the finest hospitality. It\u2019s on show in restaurants, ballparks and onsens, too. Somewhere you need to go all out and make peace with the fact you might go \u201cKuidaore.\u201d Tokyo and Kyoto may be the cities known for having it all in Japan. But it\u2019s important to always make time for Osaka.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/eat-until-youre-bankrupt-japan-osaka/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_uk-tourism-drop-visitor-numbers-election", "text": "It\u2019s hardly a great tourism slogan. \u201cBritain is grinding to a halt\u201d was the verdict of the UK\u2019s Labour Party on the country they hoped to govern, as they were setting out their case for election in June. On July 4, they won by a landslide, promising change. As residents wonder what to expect day-to-day, those abroad might wonder what it means for their travel plans. Because one industry that could do with a change is tourism. Since time immemorial, visitors have flocked to the UK. Its heritage and cultural sites have traditionally made it one of the jewels in Europe\u2019s crown. Yet while visitor numbers are up across the board on the continent \u2013 nearly all EU member states saw numbers rise in 2023 year-on-year \u2013 the UK has not yet caught up with pre-pandemic numbers. Nearly 41 million overseas residents visited the UK in 2019. In 2023, 37.68 million entered \u2013 a drop of 7.3%. Compare that with Italy, which set a new record for arrivals numbers in 2023. Only Luxembourg saw a drop of 0.1% fewer tourists. What\u2019s more, international visitors applying for a tourist visa were down by 19% on pre-pandemic numbers. The slow recovery coincides with tourism-allied hiccups. Regular strikes have been hampering transport. \u201cRail cancelations are at record levels,\u201d according to the new government in its pre-election manifesto. The UK has a glorious coastline, but in recent years many beaches are increasingly polluted by sewage. Tax-free shopping for tourists has been axed, and EU visitors now need a passport to visit, which most don\u2019t have. And in 2024, the rhetoric around safety in the capital has been ramped up. In February, then prime minister Rishi Sunak suggested the country was descending into \u201cmob rule.\u201d He also flagged a 20% rise in knife crime in London in May. His comments were political, made while campaigning for local elections. Yet few listening from abroad would have noted the context. So what\u2019s gone wrong for the UK \u2013 and can the incoming government turn it around? Labour\u2019s pre-election manifesto, in which the party outlined its plans for the country, pretty much ignored the tourism industry. But it didn\u2019t mince its words when describing the problems. \u201cBritain is grinding to a halt,\u201d it said. \u201cRail cancelations are at record levels\u2026 Conservative chaos has seen major projects abandoned, decades-long delays\u2026 and our infrastructure crumbling.\u201d The party has promised to \u201cmodernize\u201d UK transport infrastructure, \u201crebuilding Britain.\u201d The railways will be brought under public ownership. Those traveling by car will be pleased to know that Labour also pledged to repair potholes. However none of this will be quick. Labour\u2019s infrastructure overhaul is based on a 10-year plan. Shifting priorities Is the UK really doing that badly or have travel trends shifted, post-pandemic? For Tom Jenkins, CEO of the European Tourism Organisation, it\u2019s the latter. \u201cI think the UK is doing perfectly well but we\u2019ll see more people going to [continental] Europe,\u201d he says of 2024, adding that there\u2019s \u201callegedly a slight plateau of American demand for the UK.\u201d Patricia Yates, CEO of VisitBritain, disagrees, saying that American visitors have \u201cdriven our recovery since the pandemic.\u201d Kayla Zeigner, owner of travel agency Destination Europe, says she is booking ever-more trips to the UK. But for Marcy Zyonse, owner of Live The Dream Travel, a luxury vacations company, the UK has been hit by changing post-pandemic travel trends. \u201cThe appetite for epic, culturally immersive travel has been so strong in the past couple of years,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were starved for that. In the US, we didn\u2019t go beyond the Caribbean for a couple of years, so people are looking to do that Greece or Italy trip. We\u2019ve missed out on two or three years of travel, and I think the UK is too low down on the list.\u201d English-speakers want a more exotic experience, she says \u2013 starting with a foreign language. After all, the UK is known for history, culture and the royals \u2013 all of which will be around next year. It\u2019s easier to prioritize that for a much-needed Mediterranean break. And that heritage has also meant the outgoing government has let the tourism industry slide, says Yates. \u201cThere\u2019s a view that we have enormous strength in our culture and heritage, and people will just come,\u201d she says. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the case. Like every export industry, we have to pitch \u2013 to tell people why they should come now. The balance of being a history and heritage destination is that it was there 10 years ago and will be there in 10 years.\u201d There\u2019s also a hangover from the pandemic, when UK travel rules were particularly chaotic, say experts. Destinations that opened early got visitors raving about their first post-lockdown trips \u2013 which had a knock-on effect. \u201cCurrent hotspots are destinations that opened early in 2021 to American tourists, which created a huge surge in demand,\u201d says Zeigler. Zyonse agrees. \u201cYou guys in the UK were behind, and people lost confidence. People booking in 2021 for 2022 didn\u2019t book the UK, and the effect snowballed. Social media has driven people to those places [that opened up earlier].\u201d Making Britain \u2018great\u2019 again So what\u2019s to be done? For Yates, the new government could use tourism as an economy-booster \u2013 to the tune of 7% growth every year, she says, according to VisitBritain\u2019s projections. \u201cThe strength of tourism is that you can dial up quickly \u2013 we don\u2019t need to build lots of infrastructure,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a case of promoting the right places at the right time to the right customers.\u201d Promotion is tricky in itself. The outgoing Conservative government was infamous for its \u201causterity\u201d cuts to public spending. In evidence to parliament in March 2024, VisitBritain revealed that its marketing budget was around \u201c\u00a318 million ($23 million) annually, compared to over 80 euros million ($85.5 million) for Ireland.\u201d Back in November 2021, Yates told CNN that VisitBritain didn\u2019t know what its budget would be from March 2022. Today, she explains, it has a \u00a319.8 million core budget, and gets around the same amount from another government campaign. That\u2019s still around half of Ireland\u2019s budget \u2013 so private-sector funding is used to boost it. \u201cWe know that for every \u00a31 invested we get \u00a315 spent by tourists \u2013 a slice goes to the treasury, and money goes directly from international visitors into the economy. It\u2019s a win-win,\u201d she says. But she\u2019s keen for the new government to help take things further. \u201cTourism delivers over three million jobs, around 10% of the economy,\u201d she says. \u201cTo have a real growth plan, we have to make a statement about Britain overseas that will drive visitors and investment.\u201d Welcoming visitors Not many tourists will have cared about political instability \u2013 as Zeigler says, \u201cAmericans are dealing with our own political chaos.\u201d But Yates says that what does cut through is \u201cthe message of welcome.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hugely important as a driver for international visitors,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes Britain has done that well, like during the London Olympics. Sometimes we don\u2019t score as well. We need to look at how we position Britain as a welcoming destination, and how we look at borders and visas.\u201d In the 2023 Anholt-Ipsos Nation Brands Index, which ranks 60 nations on a range of attributes, the UK received its lowest ever rating for \u201cWelcome.\u201d Its rankings for \u201cCulture\u201d and \u201cPeople\u201d also dropped, though overall it rose two places to fourth position. A visa for a Chinese visitor to the UK lasts a year, but costs the same about as a 10-year visa to the US, she says. Marcus Lee, CEO of China Travel Online says that visa efficiency is one of the top three drivers for Chinese tourists. Visitors from the Gulf states have increased since the UK introduced a speedy \u201celectronic travel authorization\u201d scheme to fast-track their applications, says Yates. The scheme was due to expand to Europe and US markets \u2013 it will now be up to the Labour government to do so. Meanwhile the self-styled \u201chostile environment\u201d towards immigration of the last government hasn\u2019t helped either. \u201cFor tourism, we want an efficient and effective border, but we do want people to come,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to think about language.\u201d She says that people who visit the UK on vacation are 18% more likely to invest in the country \u2013 and investment is something the new government will be looking for. Brexit side effects As a result of Brexit, in 2021 the UK government abolished tax-free shopping for non-EU citizens. It means the UK is now the only European country not offering tax-free shopping to visitors from outside the continent. Data from London retail promoter New West End Company in February showed that although visitor numbers in 2023 to the area were just 4% below 2019 levels, spending was down 19%. Visitors from the Gulf states \u2013 some of the wealthiest tourists to grace the UK \u2013 were up 20% on 2019 figures, yet they only spent 10% more. The pattern was repeated with tourists from across the globe. US tourists were up 8% but spent 14% less. In Italy and Spain, however, US spending was up by 143% and 179% respectively. \u201cThe impact of losing tax-free shopping is clear to see,\u201d says Dee Corsi, chief executive of the NWEC. \u201cWhile the UK strives to return to pre-pandemic levels of travel and spend, continental Europe\u2019s recovery continues at pace. \u201cWhilst the likes of Italy and France are actively leveraging tax-free shopping as a driver of growth, British businesses continue to trade at a disadvantage. With domestic spend remaining squeezed, a continued decline of tourist spending will have a knock-on effect on employment rates, inward investment, and supply chains across the nation.\u201d She calls bringing back tax-free shopping a \u201crare, golden opportunity for the government to\u2026 inject a shot of growth back into the economy, with a tried-and-tested scheme and a captive audience.\u201d \u201cWe would urge the new government to grasp this opportunity with both hands,\u201d she adds. Meanwhile, EU citizens now need a passport to visit the UK, where pre-Brexit they could cross the border with their ID cards. In 2021, Jenkins told CNN that three-quarters of Europeans don\u2019t have passports. Then there are clouds on the horizon regarding getting in and out. When the new ETIAS scheme launches, every traveler entering the Schengen area for the first time will need their biometric data captured. \u201cIt\u2019ll be time consuming initally,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence that really bad entry systems deter people.\u201d \u2019Bridgerton\u2019 to the rescue? So what can be done? For Zyonse, VisitBritain should spend that marketing budget on attracting influencers and travel advisors to lesser-known destinations. A self-declared lover of the UK, who calls London \u201ca better version of New York,\u201d she says that the post-pandemic drive for more \u201cepic\u201d adventures calls for a different approach. Timelapse videos of an elevator going up London\u2019s Shard skyscraper, or something more wild in the Lake District, could attract social media likes, she says. She also thinks that the \u201cmajority\u201d of US family trips are driven by children\u2019s choices. She just went to Greece to give her daughter a \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d experience, and says that the UK \u201cneeds to get young girls posting on social media wearing a crown, or having afternoon tea, or doing something \u2018Bridgerton\u2019-related.\u201d She\u2019ll approve of VisitBritain\u2019s next big campaign, then. Launching at the end of 2024, \u201cStarring Great Britain\u201d will revolve around filming locations, says Yates, who adds that her team also wants to promote cheaper, out-of-season travel. For Yates, the new government offers a chance to grow the industry. But she warns that the UK needs to revamp its international reputation, wishing for it \u201cto be seen internationally as a welcoming, culturally diverse, vibrant country that people want to visit, send their kids to school and invest in.\u201d With the new government promising change from day one, it might not be long until she sees her dreams coming true.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/uk-tourism-drop-visitor-numbers-election/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_asia_mother-nature-cambodia-climate-youth-activists-intl-hnk", "text": "They are young and passionate about protecting Cambodia\u2019s rich and ecologically fragile environment. Their peaceful green campaigns have been championed by climate activist Greta Thunberg and in 2015, they successfully fought against a plan for a hydroelectric dam they claim would have damaged a pristine rainforest valley. But this week, the Southeast Asian nation sentenced 10 activists from the group Mother Nature Cambodia to up to six years in prison each on charges of conspiring against the state. The government says the group encourages social unrest, but to their supporters, the ruling is just the latest in a pattern of attacks on climate activists in the wider region. \u201cWe demand that our friends in Mother Nature Cambodia, and all political prisoners, be released immediately,\u201d said Fridays for Future, the youth-led global climate strike movement founded by Thunberg, in a statement. Exiled opposition leader Mu Sochua said the group had tried to highlight environmental issues that \u201cthreaten Cambodia\u2019s fragile environment\u201d and claimed, \u201cthey would be heroes in any free country.\u201d \u201cTheir convictions only show how Cambodian courts are simply being used as weapons (by the state) to halt any kind of public discussion,\u201d Mu Sochua told CNN. \u201cThe sentences are a disaster for environmentalism in Cambodia and for people everywhere, who care about the future of our planet.\u201d Cambodia, a kingdom of nearly 17 million people that is rich in natural resources, faces pressing threats to its environment, including deforestation from illegal logging and agricultural expansion, water pollution affecting inland and coastal areas, and a surge in plastic waste. The country maintains about 46% forest cover and is home to 2,300 plant species and 14 endangered animals, according to the United States Agency for International Development. \u201cDeforestation and wildlife crimes continue to threaten Cambodia\u2019s forests and biodiversity,\u201d USAID says on its website. Critics and environmental groups say those threats have heightened under the nearly four-decade-long rule of strongman Hun Sen \u2013 who has quashed dissent and jailed opponents in recent years, forcing many to flee overseas. Though his eldest son, Hun Manet, succeeded him as prime minister last year, Hun Sen is still widely seen as the ruling party\u2019s center of power. \u201cLike what we are seeing with dictators in other countries, Cambodia is becoming more repressed,\u201d said Alejandro Gonzalez-Davidson, a Spaniard who co-founded Mother Nature Cambodia over a decade ago, alongside local Cambodian activists. Climate activism in the country is at a \u201crougher, grassroots level,\u201d he added, with the conversation centering more on \u201cextremely rich and powerful tycoons and corrupt government officials trying to exploit and privatize,\u201d the environment. \u201cThis is Cambodia now \u2013 logging, poaching, mineral extraction, turning lakes into land and destroying rivers, as well as exporting massive amounts of sands. There are systems in place where (officials) exploit the environment for profit and our group has been doing as much as we can to stop these unethical projects and protect the environment \u2013 and that is why we are a threat in the regime\u2019s eyes.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Cambodian government for comment on the court ruling and allegations in this story. Outside the court ahead of Tuesday\u2019s ruling, a government spokesperson denied that the charges against the activists were politically motivated. \u201cThe government has never taken action against those who criticize. We only take action against those who commit crimes,\u201d spokesperson Pen Bona told Reuters. Award-winning campaigners Founded in 2012, Mother Nature Cambodia has campaigned against environmental destruction and exposed alleged corruption in state management of precious mineral resources, and their savvy use of social media has resonated with young Cambodians. In 2023, the group was awarded the Right Livelihood Award, often called the \u201calternative Nobel Prize.\u201d \u201cMother Nature Cambodia is a group of fearless young activists fighting for environmental rights and democracy in the face of repression by the Cambodian regime,\u201d the jury said in a speech at the time, describing them as \u201ca powerful voice for environmental preservation and democracy in Cambodia.\u201d Several activists were unable to receive the award in person as Cambodian courts denied their requests to travel to Sweden to collect the prize. \u201cThey have successfully helped local communities stop environmental violations,\u201d Right Livelihood\u2019s executive director Ole von Uexkuell said last year. \u201cThrough innovative and often humorous protests, their activism defends nature and livelihoods while upholding communities\u2019 voices against corrupt and damaging products.\u201d The group has strongly leveraged social media, saying it helps get their message across to young supporters. They have more than 450,000 followers on Facebook, the most widely used social platform in the country. But it\u2019s on TikTok that their videos really make an impression on young Cambodian users like Run Bunry, a high-school student from the capital Phnom Penh and his friends. \u201cThey are positive and lighthearted and also teach us a lot about the environment,\u201d he said. One video, highlighting an investigation into the alleged illegal export of rare silica sand, showed three members buried up to their heads in sand and was shared more than 1,000 times. Another viral video taken along a beach in the coastal city Sihanoukville showed the extent of alleged illegal construction by hotels and casinos on the shore. \u201cFollower numbers have grown especially in the last five years and a lot of our old content regularly resurfaces on TikTok and goes viral,\u201d said founding member Gonzalez-Davidson, who was expelled from Cambodia in 2015 after the group\u2019s successful campaign to stop a Chinese-funded hydropower dam from being built over the Areng Valley, an area of pristine rainforest in southwest Cambodia. Members of the group say they have faced increasing threats, harassment and criminal charges for years. Under scorching heat on Tuesday, members of the group \u2013 dressed in white and accompanied by a crowd of supporters \u2013 staged a mock funeral procession in the streets leading to the Phnom Penh Municipal Court. But peaceful scenes descended into chaos after the sentencing was announced. Video footage showed activists Mother Nature Cambodia activists Ly Chandaravuth, Long Kunthea, Thun Ratha, Phuon Keoraksmey and Yim Leanghy surrounded by dozens of armed police officers and dragged away into waiting cars, bound for prisons across the country. Rights activist Pilorge Naly of NGO the Cambodian League for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights was at the scene and told CNN the arrests were immediate and violent. Journalists and supporters were also pushed and shoved by security officers, she said. Arrest warrants have been issued for five other members of the group, including Gonzalez-Davidson, who was sentenced to eight years in prison Tuesday on the conspiracy charge and insulting Cambodia\u2019s king. \u201cThe increasing use by Cambodian authorities of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 and other articles of Cambodia\u2019s criminal code to penalise the exercise of human rights is deeply worrying,\u201d United Nations Human Rights spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said in a statement following the ruling. Gonzalez-Davidson, however, said the ruling would backfire against the authorities and inspire a new cohort of environmental campaigners. \u201cThis week, a new generation of Cambodian activists was born \u2013 one that did not exist back in 2012,\u201d he said. \u201cMany young Cambodians are very engaged in the next steps and public campaigning must continue. There have been (arrests and jailings) before and each time, we come out stronger. \u201cThey won\u2019t break our spirits. We are not going to be shut down.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/asia/mother-nature-cambodia-climate-youth-activists-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_europe_fears-election-violence-france-intl", "text": "Concerns are growing about political violence ahead of high-stakes parliamentary elections in France after a series of lawmakers were attacked on the campaign trail this week. French government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot and her team came under attack while canvassing on Wednesday night, the latest in a string of violent incidents involving French lawmakers contesting Sunday\u2019s parliamentary elections. Her team isn\u2019t the only one. National Rally politician Marie Dauchy, who is running in the southeastern constituency of Savoie, opted to suspend her campaign after she said was physically assaulted while campaigning at a market. In Cherbourg, a center-right candidate from The Republicans party, Nicolas Conquer, made a formal complaint after he claimed he was assaulted by left-wing campaigners on Monday. Politicians have repeatedly warned that a far-right victory could provoke huge protests in the streets with President Emmanuel Macron going so far as to say \u201ccivil war\u201d may break out if the extreme left or right wins by a large margin in Sunday\u2019s runoff vote. Thevenot, a candidate for reelection from Macron\u2019s Renaissance party, was in her constituency in the Parisian suburbs with members of her team when the group came under attack after attempting to stop a group of youths from defacing posters. Providing an account of the incident to French newspaper Le Parisien, the minister said that although she was not harmed in the attack, her deputy and a member of her campaign team were taken to\u00a0a\u00a0hospital after sustaining injuries. Four people have been taken in for questioning regarding the incident, Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin told French television station France 2 on Thursday morning. Thevenot has vowed to continue campaigning, saying in a post on X on Thursday that \u201cviolence is never the answer.\u201d Politicians from across the political divide came out quickly to condemn the attack and send a strong warning regarding election-related violence. Jordan Bardella, the leader of the far-right National Rally (RN) party, sent his \u201ccomplete support\u201d to Thevenot following the attack, calling for \u201ccalm and appeasement.\u201d \u201cFor several weeks now, we have seen a multiplication of violence in the streets linked to the electoral campaign,\u201d Bardella told CNN\u2019s French affiliate BFMTV on Wednesday evening. Acknowledging that violence has been linked to both the far-right and far-left camps, Bardella vowed, if appointed, to be a prime minister who \u201cre-establishes order\u201d in France. Incumbent Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who is fighting to retain his seat, also denounced the attack on Wednesday, saying \u201cviolence and intimidation have no place\u201d in France\u2019s democracy. An additional 30,000 police officers and gendarmes will be deployed across France on Sunday night in the event of public disorder, Darmanin said Thursday. Darmanin said the beefed-up policing would ensure that neither the far right or far left \u201cprofit from the results\u201d and succeed in inciting violence. RN, the party of far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen, led the first round of\u00a0France\u2019s\u00a0parliamentary elections on Sunday, taking it closer to the gates of power than ever before. After an unusually high turnout, the RN bloc clinched 33.15% of the vote, while the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition came second with 27.99% and Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance slumped to a dismal third with 20.76%, according to final results published by the Interior Ministry on Monday. While the RN appears on track to win the most seats in the National Assembly, it may fall short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, suggesting France may be heading for a hung parliament and more political uncertainty. Correction: A previous version of this story gave the wrong location for where the candidate made the complaint.

{"id": "2024_07_05_europe_popes-chief-of-staff-london-property-trial-intl-latam", "text": "One of Pope Francis\u2019 closest aides has undergone an intense cross-examination as he gave evidence in a case that marks the first time the Vatican has stood trial in an English court. Archbishop Edgar Pe\u00f1a Parra, who holds the role of \u201csostituto\u201d (\u201csubstitute\u201d), the equivalent of a papal chief of staff, took the witness stand in a dispute over the Holy See\u2019s disastrous investment in a London property, the center of the Vatican\u2019s\u00a0\u201ctrial of the century\u201d. The archbishop\u2019s appearance in court is rare given the Vatican and its senior officials have largely avoided legal actions in foreign courts \u2013 often concerning sexual abuse cases \u2013 under the protection of sovereign immunity. But the London legal action is believed to be the first time the Vatican has stood trial in a foreign jurisdiction, while Archbishop Pe\u00f1a Parra is one of the highest-ranking Vatican officials to give evidence in such a case. The 64-year-old Venezuelan archbishop wore a black clerical suit during his evidence and began by swearing an oath on \u201calmighty God\u201d that he would tell the truth. Although he was occasionally assisted by an interpreter, he answered questions in English. Over more than a day and a half of cross-examination, the archbishop insisted several times that he is a \u201cpriest, and not a specialist in banking\u201d as he explained that the Vatican had been the victim of extortion in the property deal. The case against the Holy See has been bought by Raffaele Mincione, an Italian-British financier who was among those convicted by a Vatican court last December of embezzlement and self-laundering for his part in the London property deal. Mincione has denied all the charges against him and is appealing his convictions. That trial marked the first time a cardinal was convicted and sentenced by a Vatican court for financial crimes and is considered an important moment\u00a0in Pope Francis\u2019 long battle to clean up the Vatican\u2019s finances. But Mincione is now seeking a ruling in the London courts that he acted in\u00a0\u201cgood faith\u201d throughout his dealings with the Vatican, which concerned\u00a0investments in a\u00a0vast property in southwest London\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood,\u00a0originally\u00a0built as a car showroom for the Harrods department store. The Holy See says it spent around $400 million on the deal over several years but ended up with losses of $150 million after eventually selling the asset. In 2014, the Vatican invested $200 million for a 45% stake in the Chelsea property through a fund run by Mincione, whose companies had purchased the building for around $165 million (\u00a3129.5 million) at the end of 2012. Although there was a plan to turn the property into apartments, the Vatican says the property\u2019s value was inflated by Mincione and that it was losing money on its investment. Archbishop Pe\u00f1a Parra, who was not in post at the time of the original investment, sought to exit the deal by buying the building outright and, in the process, the Holy See paid \u00a340 million to Mincione. The Vatican says this was a \u201cfraudulent overpayment.\u201d Helping to broker the exit deal in 2018 from Mincione\u2019s fund was another financier, Gianluigi Torzi, who was also convicted at the Vatican trial last December. He was found to have structured a deal which left him in control of the building and the Vatican purchasing an\u00a0\u201cempty box\u201d. Torzi was then accused of extorting around $16 million from the Vatican as Pe\u00f1a Parra and his office sought to finally gain control of the Chelsea building. The property was eventually sold by the Holy See in 2022 for around $229 million. Under cross-examination the archbishop was questioned repeatedly about the Torzi payments and was accused by Mincione\u2019s barrister of dishonesty because the payments to Torzi involved a false invoice. The archbishop admitted to sending a false invoice but said Torzi had \u201ctrapped\u201d the Vatican and would \u201clie and lie.\u201d Pe\u00f1a Parra told the judge repeatedly that he had been trying to extricate the Holy See from a bad deal and gain control of the building. The archbishop, who became the Vatican number three in October 2018, said he only became aware of Torzi\u2019s schemes later and that some of his staff were \u201csuperficial and na\u00efve.\u201d He insisted that now \u201cI would give Torzi nothing, and I would put him in jail several times.\u201d Mincione\u2019s lawyers have accused the Vatican of an \u201cincoherent and confused allegation of conspiracy\u201d against their client, while the Holy See insist that Mincione did not act in good faith. Mincione was also cross examined during the trial, with lawyers accusing him of producing \u201cgrossly misleading\u201d figures about the Chelsea property\u2019s value. The heart of the dispute concerns the value of the Chelsea property. The Vatican\u2019s legal team said the stated value of \u00a3275 million ($350 million) for the London property in 2018 was a \u201cfraudulent representation\u201d of its market worth, while Mincione\u2019s lawyers denied this, saying it was an \u201caudited valuation.\u201d In his witness statement, Pe\u00f1a Parra said he was told of \u201cconcerns\u201d that the value of the building was less than the Vatican had \u201coriginally thought.\u201d The trial is expected to conclude later this month with a judgment likely to be released later in the year. The archbishop is due to conclude giving evidence on Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/popes-chief-of-staff-london-property-trial-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_06_weather_hurricane-beryl-south-texas-coast-weekend-sunday-monday", "text": "Tropical Storm Beryl is expected to strengthen into a hurricane again before it reaches the South Texas coast on Monday, bringing damaging winds, life-threatening storm surge and dangerous flooding beginning late Sunday. It\u2019s expected to mark the first US landfall storm of the 2024 Atlantic season. Here\u2019s the latest: \u2022 Beryl to hit Texas as a hurricane: Beryl is forecast to make landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas, as a Category 1 hurricane Monday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center. Currently a tropical storm, Beryl is in the Gulf of Mexico about 245 miles southeast of Corpus Christi, fanning maximum winds of 60 mph as of 5 a.m. ET Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. The state is likely to start seeing the effects of Beryl starting Sunday and several counties have already announced evacuation orders. \u2022\u00a0Hurricane and storm surge alerts: Hurricane warnings are in effect for the Texas coast from Baffin Bay to Sargent, while the stretches south of Baffin Bay to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, and north of Sargent to San Luis Pass, are under hurricane watches. A tropical storm warning is also in place for the area north of Sargent to High Island, and the Mexican coast from Barra el Mezquital to the Rio Grande. Storm surge warnings are in effect from the north entrance of the Padre Island National Seashore to High Island, including Corpus Christi Bay, Matagorda Bay and Galveston Bay. The Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande River northward to North Entrance of the Padre Island National Seashore, as well as San Luis Pass to Sabine Pass are under storm surge watch. \u2022\u00a0Dangerous storm surge along US Gulf Coast: Tropical storm conditions will begin to be felt along the western Gulf Coast on Sunday, with hurricane conditions expected later in the day. Storm surge up to 6 feet is forecast for parts of the Texas coast late Sunday night into Monday as rising waters push inland from the shoreline. Rip currents will also cause life-threatening beach conditions through Monday across much of the Gulf Coast. \u2022\u00a0Flooding and damaging winds expected: Heavy rainfall of 5 to 10 inches, with localized amounts of 15 inches, is forecast across the Texas Gulf Coast and East Texas late Sunday through the middle of next week, the National Hurricane Center said. It\u2019s expected to produce flash and urban flooding. Hurricane-force winds will hit the lower and middle Texas coast Sunday night and Monday. A few tornadoes could also occur along the Texas Coast Sunday afternoon and evening. \u201cPreparations should be rushed to completion before tropical storm conditions begin late today,\u201d the hurricane center said Sunday morning. \u2022 At least nine dead due to Beryl: Beryl became the earliest Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic on record earlier this week. The storm killed at least nine people in the Caribbean, including two in Jamaica, three in Venezuela, three in Grenada and one person in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. After hammering several Caribbean islands, the storm unloaded strong winds, torrential rainfall and dangerous storm surge over much of Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. \u2022 Beryl worsened by climate change: The\u00a0abnormally warm ocean waters\u00a0fueling Beryl\u2019s intensification show this hurricane season will be far from normal. Beryl\u2019s blow to Jamaica was worsened by climate change,\u00a0a new rapid attribution analysis from ClimaMeter found. Modern storms like Beryl tracking close to Jamaica are capable of unloading 30% more rain and 10% stronger winds compared to the similar storms from 1979 to 2001 because of human-caused climate change, the study found. \u2022 How to help those affected: Jamaican residents are assessing the damage after Beryl pounded the Caribbean island with destructive winds and storm surge. The storm killed two people in the country and left hundreds of thousands of homes without power. Beryl was the strongest storm to impact the country in more than 15 years. Beryl also caused major damage\u00a0across the region, including in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados and Grenada. Several charities are\u00a0actively distributing aid\u00a0throughout the region. Contribute to relief efforts here. Texas officials ask coastal residents to be prepared to leave Texas officials are urging residents to prepare before Beryl\u2019s expected hit to coastal areas later this weekend. \u201cEveryone along the coast should be paying attention to this storm,\u201d Texas\u00a0Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said during a briefing on Friday. \u201cWe pray and we hope for nothing more than a rain event, but even a rain event may be very heavy,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cWe prepare at the state for the worst-case scenario.\u201d Already, several counties have asked residents to evacuate due to the potentially dangerous conditions Beryl could bring. Gov. Greg Abbott has also issued severe weather disaster declarations for 40 counties, as the state contends with \u201cheavy rainfall, flooding conditions, and strong tropical wind.\u201d Matagorda County issued a voluntary evacuation order ahead of Beryl\u2019s arrival, the county\u2019s Emergency Operation Center said on social media. The order calls for people to voluntarily evacuate coastal areas in the county, including Sargent, Matagorda and Palacios. Aransas County issued an evacuation order for residents of \u201clow-lying areas and flood-prone areas and persons with special needs requirements\u201d at 6 p.m. local time. There are no emergency shelter facilities in the county, according to the county\u2019s Facebook announcement, and \u201cmedical and emergency services will likely be affected by the effects of the predicted landfall of Hurricane Beryl.\u201d A mandatory evacuation was ordered Saturday afternoon for all residents of Refugio County, County Judge Jhiela Poynter announced in a\u00a0Facebook post. The county has a population of more than 6,600 people. Poynter said that they know how quickly things can escalate, given that they are still rebuilding infrastructure from when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas in 2017. \u201cI would rather be cautious and let Tropical Storm Beryl come crawling in with a little bit of rain and a little bit of wind to an empty\u00a0Refugio\u00a0County than the alternative if it were to strengthen more than the predictions, which we know has happened with several storms in the past,\u201d Poynter said. During the storm, the county\u2019s local hospital will be rerouting emergency patients, city water will eventually be turned off and city ambulances and fire trucks will no longer be able to mobilize, Poynter said. City officials will provide bus transportation to an out-of-town emergency shelter for residents who are unable to evacuate on their own, Poynter said. The City of Port Aransas, on Mustang Island,\u00a0issued\u00a0a mandatory visitor evacuation by noon Sunday, which does not include residents and property owners, according to the city. In Kleberg\u00a0County, Judge Rudy Madrid issued a \u201cVoluntary Evacuation for Baffin Bay, Loyola Beach and all low lying areas,\u201d according to a social media post from the city of Kingsville. Nueces\u00a0County\u00a0Judge Connie Scott asked citizens on the coast in low-lying areas or who need assistance to evacuate due to the possibility of the storm making landfall in the\u00a0area\u00a0as a hurricane, the county posted on social media. The National Weather Service in Corpus Christi is warning residents, \u201cnow would be the time to prepare\u201d for Beryl as its track forecast is trending farther north along the Texas coast. \u201cResidents should really be aware that the earliest \u2026 arrival of the tropical storm force winds is predicted for Sunday afternoon,\u201d Mayor Paulette Guajardo said on Friday. The mayor declared a local state of disaster Saturday afternoon, taking effect immediately. Guajardo asked those visiting the city for the Fourth of July weekend to \u201cplease consider returning at an earlier time if it\u2019s what you feel you need to do.\u201d In Houston, the weather service is likewise asking people to stay vigilant. \u201cAt this time, the main impacts for SE TX will remain increased rainfall (Mon/Tues) and the potential for tropical storm force winds (34kts) as early as Sun morning. Stay tuned and stay informed,\u201d the weather service\u00a0posted on X. The city of Rockport issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents in low-lying areas and local officials are in touch with the state to place their residents on the registry for evacuations if necessary, police spokesperson Lee Brown told CNN on Saturday. While no local hurricane shelter had been established in the area, charter buses will be ready to evacuate residents at the Aransas County Airport on Saturday evening, Brown said. Rockport, 30 miles northeast of Corpus Christi, suffered major damage\u00a0from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Voluntary evacuations have been announced for some low-lying areas in Port Lavaca, northeast of Rockport. City spokesperson Tania French said about 1,000 people, mostly in beach areas, may be affected.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/weather/hurricane-beryl-south-texas-coast-weekend-sunday-monday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_weather_west-coast-california-oregon-heat-wave", "text": "An extremely dangerous, unusually long heat wave is intensifying and spreading up the West Coast \u2013 and there will be no relief for days. California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada and Arizona are bracing for potential wildfires, opening cooling centers and warning residents to stay indoors and keep hydrated as the unrelenting heat wave delivers sweltering temperatures well into the 100s and 110s \u2013 with highs in the 120s possible in the Desert Southwest. And it\u2019s only getting hotter. Death Valley, California, could top 125 degrees by Sunday or Monday, setting a new daily record for those dates. Las Vegas, Nevada, could also exceed its all-time high temperature of 117 degrees Sunday or Monday. \u201cConfidence is increasing that this potentially historic heatwave will last several days,\u201d the National Weather Service in Portland warned, adding the risk of heat-related illness will increase significantly. Extreme heat\u00a0is one of the leading weather-related killers in the United States, leaving hundreds of people dead each year, according to the\u00a0National Weather Service. In\u00a0San\u00a0Jose, California, a homeless man\u00a0died Tuesday due to the extreme heat, Mayor Matt Mahan said.\u00a0The man was 69, according to the mayor\u2019s spokesperson, Tasha Dean, citing information from the\u00a0Santa Clara Medical Examiner\u2019s Office. The same day, a 10-year-old died in Arizona after experiencing a heat-related emergency while hiking with family in South Mountain Park and Preserve, the Phoenix Police Department said. \u201cThis is a DANGEROUS situation, especially for sensitive populations,\u201d the National Weather Service in Los Angeles said, reminding residents to drink plenty of water, stay in the shade, wear light, loose fitting clothes and never leave anyone in a car. Saturday will likely be the hottest day in this prolonged heat wave. High temperatures in the 110s are becoming common across California, outside coastal areas and higher elevations, the National Weather Service said. \u201cThis level of heat throughout parts of the Mojave Desert and Sacramento/San Joaquin valleys of California could pose a risk to anyone if proper heat safety is not followed,\u201d the weather service said. Nationwide, nearly 140 million people remain under heat alerts \u2013 mostly in Western states, where the heat wave is expected to last through the middle of next week. More than 70 million people will be under heat alerts in parts of 10 western states on Saturday. Parts of Oregon will experience triple digits Friday, and the heat could last up to five days with poor overnight relief, the National Weather Service in Portland said. A state of emergency was declared in Multnomah County, Oregon\u2019s most populous county, for this weekend\u00a0as temperatures were expected to climb. \u201cI\u2019m particularly worried about the thousands of people heading to music festivals and sporting events this weekend,\u201d Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Richard Bruno said in a news release. \u201cThey\u2019ll be spending a long time outside, may have little access to shade and water and may not recognize the risk.\u201d Bruno said the area has had few hot days so far this year, and residents\u2019 bodies have not yet acclimated to the heat. A previous heat wave that scorched Oregon in 2021 left dozens of people dead. Power equipment buckled in the heat, triggering rolling blackouts for tens of thousands as temperatures soared above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. While this heat wave isn\u2019t expected to be as intense as the 2021 scorcher,\u00a0forecasters are concerned about its long duration, said Meteorologist Noah Alviz of the National Weather Service in Portland.\u00a0\u201cGetting into the upper 90s or even triple digits of 100 to 105 for four to five days \u2013 that is very unusual for this location,\u201d Alviz told CNN. \u201cThe triple-digit heat will expand northward into the Pacific Northwest and parts of the central Great Basin, with widespread highs rising into the 90s and low 100s,\u201d the National Weather Service said. \u201cThe duration of this heat is also concerning as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week.\u201d Intense heat is expected to persist for much of the West Coast into the weekend. Major to extreme heat risk, the highest two levels, are expected for much of California and the Southwest on Saturday and Sunday, meaning health effects of heat become more likely in anyone without adequate hydration or cooling. Over a dozen high-temperature records were either broken or tied on Thursday, including multiple California cities. Palmdale reached 110 degrees, and Madera hit 109 degrees. The extremely dangerous and potentially deadly heat baking parts of the US also set a few all-time record high temperatures in some locations Friday. Palm Springs, California, reached 124 degrees Friday afternoon, exceeding the previous all-time record high for the date of 123 degrees set in 2021. An all-time record high of 105 set in 2012 was also broken in Raleigh, North Carolina, where temperatures of 106 degrees were recorded Friday. Additional daily record highs set on Friday included: \u2022 114 degrees: San Jacinto, California\u2022 109 degrees:\u00a0Medford, Oregon\u2022 109 degrees: Campo, California Dozens of additional temperature records are expected to be tied or broken each of the next few days. The dangerous heat will expand into the Intermountain West and northern High Plains by next week. The stage is set for wildfire spread The extreme heat \u2013 combined with gusty winds and low humidity \u2013 means any wildfires that start will spread quickly through already parched vegetation. Red flag warnings are in effect across the West, including in the area of the Thompson Fire, which has consumed more than 3,700 acres in California\u2019s Butte County since it was reported Tuesday. The blaze, which was 55% contained by Friday afternoon local time, has forced thousands of people to evacuate and prompted more than 2,000 firefighters to battle the flames under the extreme heat in the Oroville area. The wildfire has injured 11 firefighters, including eight who were affected by heat-related illnesses, according to Chris Peterson, a spokesperson for the\u00a0California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection \u2013 also known as Cal Fire. Twenty-six structures have been destroyed by the blaze and more than 4,000 are under threat. The state\u2019s been seeing an active fire season, with more than 145,000 acres burned so far in 2024 compared to 7,812 acres burned by this time last year, according to\u00a0Cal Fire. There are now nearly two dozen active wildfires of varying sizes burning across California, and the Thompson Fire is among the largest, according to\u00a0Cal Fire. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing fires on the coast in San Diego, to the foothills in Butte,\u201d Cal Fire Deputy Director Nick Schuler told CNN Wednesday. \u201cOur\u00a0firefighters are battling fires across California and often times on the line for more than 24 hours. It\u2019s difficult conditions that they face.\u201d A wildfire in California\u2019s Mariposa County, the French Fire, injured three firefighters and destroyed four structures, according to Cal Fire. It also triggered evacuation orders Thursday night. The fire has burned more than 900 acres just northwest of the small community of Mariposa, outside Yosemite National Park, and is 20% contained as of Friday evening. More than 800 structures are under threat. \u201cFirefighters continue to gain containment and cool hot spots throughout the fire,\u201d CAL Fire said in an update on its incident page Friday. \u201cUtility crews are working diligently to repair and replace damaged infrastructure.\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a\u00a0state of emergency\u00a0for the area of the Thompson Fire on Wednesday. The declaration cleared the path for additional resources, including the possibility of mobilizing the California National Guard to assist. And in central Washington state, fireworks sparked an active wildfire called the Balsam Root Fire early Friday morning, according to Wenatchee Valley Fire Department Chief Brian Brett. The fire is burning in Wenatchee, about 150 miles east of Seattle. The fire is currently around 250 acres and is 30% contained, Brett told CNN. A Level 3 Evacuation Alert is in effect for approximately 150 homes. Residents under this advisory are being told to leave immediately. The department had previously reminded residents \u201cprivate fireworks are banned in most of Chelan and Douglas Counties.\u201d Fireworks started an estimated 31,302 fires in 2022, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Southeast to see sizzling temperatures, too As the West swelters, oppressive heat and humidity will begin to shift eastward to the mid-Atlantic and Southeast for the end of the week. \u201cWarm overnight conditions in the upper 70s and low 80s will offer little relief, leading to a dangerous situation for those without access to adequate cooling,\u201d the National Weather Service said. New heat alerts are now posted in southeast Texas, extreme southern Florida and parts of the Southeast northward to the mid-Atlantic, where high temperatures will range between 95-105 degrees. Cities including Houston, Miami, Atlanta, Raleigh and Washington, DC, will be feeling the heat. The heat index values \u2013 how air feels to the human body \u2013 will range between 100 and 115 degrees in those areas. \u201cA cold front entering the southern Plains is anticipated to offer cooler and below average temperatures to Oklahoma, much of northern/western Texas, and the Mid-South by Friday,\u201d the weather service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/weather/west-coast-california-oregon-heat-wave/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_07_europe_france-election-second-round-result-intl", "text": "A left-wing alliance has won the most seats in the French parliament after tactical voting in Sunday\u2019s second round election thwarted Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party, but France will be left in political limbo after no party came close to winning an absolute majority. In a surprise result, the New Popular Front (NFP) \u2013 a cluster of several parties ranging from the far-left France Unbowed party to the more moderate Socialists and the Ecologists \u2013 won 182 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest group but short of the 289 required for an absolute majority, according to the French Interior Ministry. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance, which had slumped to a dismal third in the first round of voting last Sunday, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. Despite leading after the first round of votes, Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party and its allies won 143 seats. The RN\u2019s strong showing in the first round stirred fears that France could be on the cusp of electing its first far-right government since the collaborationist Vichy regime of World War II. But Sunday\u2019s results come as a huge upset and show French voters\u2019 overwhelming desire to keep the far right from gaining power \u2013 even at the cost of a hung parliament. After the first round, an unprecedented number of seats \u2013 over 300 \u2013 went to a three-way runoff between Ensemble, the NFP and the RN. By Tuesday, more than 200 centrist and left-wing candidates withdrew from the second round, in a bid to avoid splitting the vote. Cheers rang out on the streets of Paris as the projection was published. Speaking to a crowd of his ecstatic supporters near Stalingrad square, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the firebrand leader of France Unbowed, said the results came as a \u201chuge relief for the overwhelming majority of people in our country.\u201d \u201cOur people have clearly rejected the worst-case scenario,\u201d M\u00e9lenchon said. \u201cA magnificent surge of civic mobilization has taken hold!\u201d Gabriel Attal, Macron\u2019s protege, announced he would resign as prime minister Monday morning. He seemed to take a swipe at Macron\u2019s decision to call the snap vote, saying he \u201cdidn\u2019t choose\u201d for France\u2019s parliament to be dissolved. Elsewhere in Paris, the buoyant atmosphere at a RN campaign event in Bois de Vincennes took a nosedive an hour before the polls closed. After the projection was announced, Jordan Bardella, the party\u2019s 28-year-old leader, said France had been thrown into \u201cuncertainty and instability.\u201d Handpicked as leader by Marine Le Pen in an effort to purge the party of its racist and antisemitic roots, Bardella had taken the party closer to the gates of power than ever before. Visibly disappointed by the results, he slammed the NFP as an \u201calliance of dishonor.\u201d \u201cAs from tomorrow, our deputies will take up their places to make sure we counter the migration policies and other policies of the far left. We will not enter into any kind of coalition or compromise, we will be the side of the French people,\u201d he said. A hastily assembled coalition In a brief statement, the Elysee said Macron is awaiting the full results of all 577 constituencies \u201cbefore taking the necessary decisions.\u201d \u201cIn his role as guarantor of our institutions, the president will ensure that the sovereign choice of the French people is respected,\u201d it said. After parliamentary elections, the French president appoints a prime minister from the party that won the most seats. Ordinarily, this means a candidate from the president\u2019s own party. However, Sunday\u2019s results mean Macron faces the prospect of having to appoint a figure from the left-wing coalition, in a rare arrangement known as a \u201ccohabitation.\u201d Speaking to supporters near Stalingrad square, M\u00e9lenchon said Macron \u201chas the duty to call the New Popular Front to govern.\u201d But it is not clear from which party within the coalition that Macron will appoint a prime minister. France Unbowed won 74 seats, making it the largest single party within the NFP, ahead of the Socialists with 59. But Macron and his allies had repeatedly stressed that they would refuse to enter into coalition with M\u00e9lenchon. Speaking after last Sunday\u2019s first round, outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal \u2013 Macron\u2019s protege, said France Unbowed was preventing the formation of a \u201ccredible alternative\u201d to the far right. The NFP formed less than a month ago, after Macron called the snap vote following his party\u2019s disastrous loss to the RN in last month\u2019s European Parliament election. The capacious \u2013 and potentially fractious \u2013 coalition chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. Sunday\u2019s results mean the NFP has managed to do this again. It campaigned on a platform to raise the minimum monthly wage to 1,600 euros (more than $1,700), to cap the price of essential foods, electricity, fuel and gas, and to scrap Macron\u2019s deeply unpopular pension reform, which raised the French retirement age \u2013 already one of the lowest in the Western world \u2013 from 62 to 64. A mess of Macron\u2019s making? Sunday\u2019s vote represents a victory for the French \u201ccordon sanitaire,\u201d the principle that mainstream parties must unite to block the far right from taking office. But the RN\u2019s success should not be underestimated. In the 2017 elections, when Macron swept to power, the RN won just eight seats. In 2022, it surged to 89 seats. In Sunday\u2019s vote, it won 125 \u2013 making it the largest individual party in parliament. While the risk of a far-right government has been avoided for now, these elections have plunged France into political uncertainty. Macron called the election three years earlier than necessary, just minutes after his party was trounced by the far right in the EU election. Although EU election results need have no bearing on domestic politics, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent to him by voters and wanted to clarify the situation. But Sunday\u2019s results may further muddy the French political picture. Unable to call a new election for at least another year, and with three years left on his presidential term, Macron looks set to preside over an unruly parliament, as problems mount at home and abroad. \u00c9douard Philippe, France\u2019s former prime minister and an ally of Macron, said Macron\u2019s gamble had further complicated the situation. \u201cThe truth is that none of the political blocs in the assembly has a majority on its own to govern. The dissolution of the assembly, which was intended as a clarification, has instead led to great vagueness,\u201d he said Sunday evening. \u201cThe central political forces therefore have a responsibility to stay. They must, without compromise, promote the creation of an agreement that will stabilize the political situation.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/europe/france-election-second-round-result-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}

Orban was the first EU leader to visit Moscow since April 2022 and his trip was made even more controversial by the fact that Hungary has just taken over the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union. Putin and Orban said they discussed ways to end the conflict in Ukraine.  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Putin said Russia was \u201calways open for discussion\u201d for a political and diplomatic solution to the conflict but stressed that he stands by the terms it has already outlined. Those terms would be unacceptable for Ukraine and its western allies. Ukraine has made it clear that any peace deal must include the return of Ukraine\u2019s pre-2014 territory. Orban\u2019s press secretary Zoltan Kovacs said the prime minister\u2019s visit to Moscow was of \u201cspecial significance,\u201d being the first since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

He has been campaigning for\u00a0a ceasefire as opposed to military support for Ukraine. \u201cThe talks with President Putin at the Kremlin focused on the Ukraine settlement and bilateral relations, emphasizing Hungary\u2019s unique position to communicate with both warring sides,\u201d Kovacs said in a post on X following the meeting on Friday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen criticized Orban\u2019s decision to visit Moscow, saying \u201cappeasement will not stop\u201d Putin. \u201cOnly unity and determination will pave the path to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine,\u201d she added.

The items repatriated from New York\u2019s\u00a0Metropolitan Museum of Art arrived Wednesday and were displayed to journalists and VIPs on Thursday at the National Museum in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. They \u201cwere made between the 9th and 14th centuries in the Angkorian period and reflect the Hindu and Buddhist religious systems prevailing at that time,\u201d the museum said in a statement. A statement from Cambodia\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts said the \u201chistoric homecoming of national treasures\u201d followed several years of negotiations between Cambodia\u2019s art restitution team, United States federal prosecutors in New York, investigators from the US Department of Homeland Security and the Metropolitan Museum. The culture minister added that the return of the artifacts was very important to the Cambodian people for recalling the heritage of their ancestors through good times and bad. \u201cThe pieces were staying a long, long time abroad, but today they returned to Cambodia, like a blessing for our people for peace, stability in our country now,\u201d said Sackona, adding that to Cambodians, the returned artworks carry with them the souls of their ancestors. Bringing back the souls of ancestors also includes bringing history, admiration and knowledge, she explained, noting that Cambodia hopes to soon receive another 50 artifacts from the US. Cambodia claims that other items illegally trafficked from the country are still at the Metropolitan Museum, as well as at other museums and in the hands of private collectors. \u201cThese returns contribute to the reconciliation and healing of the Cambodian people, who endured decades of civil war and suffered tremendously from the tragedy of the Khmer Rouge regime,\u201d Sackona said. \u201cThey also demonstrate the truly positive partnership we have developed with the United States.\u201d For the art world, their return is the fruit of a reckoning in recent years over art and archaeological treasures taken from their homelands. These include not only ancient Asian artworks, but also pieces lost or stolen during turmoil in other places, such as Syria, Iraq and Nazi-occupied Europe. The pieces returned to Cambodia from the Met were looted during a long period of civil war and instability in Cambodia, which was ruled by the brutal communist\u00a0Khmer Rouge regime\u00a0in the 1970s. They were bought and trafficked by well-known art dealer Douglas Latchford, who was indicted in 2019 for allegedly orchestrating a multiyear scheme to sell looted Cambodian antiquities on the international art market. Latchford, who died the following year, had denied any involvement in smuggling. Cambodia\u2019s Culture Ministry highlighted two works among those returned that are expected to be restored by reuniting them with other parts already in their possession. The repatriation includes the \u201cextraordinary\u201d stone sculpture from the 10th century of the female goddess Uma from the ancient royal capital of Koh Ker, it said, adding that the sculpture\u2019s foot had already been retrieved from its original site. \u201cAt last, the Uma can be reunified to achieve its full magnificence as one complete statue,\u201d it said. \u201cMoreover, a significant returned artifact is a 10th century bronze head of the deity Avalokiteshvara, which the Ministry highly anticipates finally being reunited with its matching torso, currently on display at the National Museum of Cambodia.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/style/cambodia-statue-repatriation-met-museum/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_07_05_uk_nigel-farage-reform-party-win-gbr-intl", "text": "Nigel Farage,\u00a0a driving force behind Britain\u2019s Brexit movement and a confidant of former US President Donald Trump, has been elected to parliament for the first time, as his upstart right-wing Reform UK party looks to shake up the country\u2019s politics. Farage becomes a member of Britain\u2019s parliament on his\u00a0eighth attempt after winning with 46.2% of the vote\u00a0in the heavily pro-Brexit Clacton, a seaside town on England\u2019s southeastern coast where Reform UK had polled well. With most of the votes now counted, results indicate Reform UK has won at least five seats in the House of Commons, a comparatively strong showing in Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system where smaller parties often struggle to translate their national support into parliamentary seats. Farage\u2019s Reform UK party attacked the Conservative Party on its failure to bring down rates of legal and illegal migration. That message appears to have won over a considerable number of socially conservative voters, with Reform UK candidates splitting the right-wing vote and contributing to the Conservatives\u2019 losses. Farage, an outspoken and polarizing figure, has long been known for using alarmist and confrontational language when discussing immigration. Since announcing his candidacy, Farage has warned supporters of an \u201cinvasion\u201d of asylum seekers, and last month he sparked outrage from political opponents after saying the West \u201cprovoked\u201d\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The veteran Euroskeptic, played a leading role in bringing about Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, and has remained a divisive and disruptive figure in the country\u2019s politics since. Farage is perhaps best-known outside of the UK for his friendship with former US President Donald Trump, recently campaigning alongside him. But he has never been elected to parliament, losing seven elections since 1994 before this victory.\u00a0He won Clacton on a massive swing towards Reform UK, picking up 21,225 votes to the Conservatives\u2019 12,820. Friday\u2019s results now give Reform UK a small but significant base from which to oppose Labour leader and soon-to-be new UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a crucial parliamentary platform. \u201cIt\u2019s not just disappointment with the Conservative Party. There is a massive gap on the center right of British politics and my job is to fill it. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Farage said after winning the seat. He pledged to \u201cchallenge the general election properly in 2029,\u201d and promised to turn his rhetoric toward the Labour Party as it enters government. In many seats around the UK, Reform came second to Labour. Farage said the \u201cLabour government will be in trouble very, very quickly and we will now be targeting Labour votes. We\u2019re coming for Labour \u2013 be in no doubt about that.\u201d His presence during the election campaign upended the Conservative Party\u2019s efforts to win back socially conservative, pro-Brexit voters. His win comes at the same time Europe is broadly in the grip of what some call a right-wing populist surge. Last month\u2019s\u00a0European elections\u00a0saw a historic number of lawmakers from hard-right and far-right parties elected to the European Parliament. In snap French elections, far-right National Rally\u00a0won the first round last week. Speaking to CNN Thursday night, Politico deputy UK editor Rosa Prince said the result showed a \u201cvery widespread disaffection with the Conservative Party\u201d and that Reform UK\u2019s far-right policies \u201creally chime with some parts of the electorate.\u201d \u201cThe big question is going to be whether the Conservative Party tries to draw him in to them and maybe even join forces, or whether they push him away,\u201d Prince said. \u201cBecause what you could have is a total realignment of the right\u2026 I think Nigel Farage is certainly going to be causing trouble in the Houses of Parliament.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/nigel-farage-reform-party-win-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/08/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice.
