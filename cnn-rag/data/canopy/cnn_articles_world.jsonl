Israel\u2019s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, said the year 2024 has been \u201cdefined as a year of combat\u201d by Israel\u2019s war cabinet. \u201cWe are now in the fifth month of 2024, which means we expect another seven months of fighting to deepen our achievements and achieve our goal of destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Islamic Jihad,\u201d Hanegbi said. The comments came as Israeli tanks \u2013 seen Tuesday in central Rafah for the first time since the operation began earlier this month \u2013 continued to probe the southern Gaza city on Wednesday, despite mounting global pressure to stop the offensive. The Israeli government had previously signaled that entering Rafah would be the final stage of its war against Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 people hostage. In response, Israel launched a devastating offensive in Gaza which has killed more than 36,000 people, according to Palestinian officials. Despite the prospect earlier this month of striking a ceasefire-for-hostages deal with Hamas, the more extreme wing of Israel\u2019s war cabinet had urged that the Rafah offensive go ahead, arguing that destroying the group was more urgent and of greater importance than returning the hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza. But Hanegbi\u2019s comments suggest that the Rafah operation may not mark the end of hostilities, raising questions about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plans to wind down Israel\u2019s campaign and his plans for the post-war governance of Gaza. While Netanyahu has portrayed Rafah as Hamas\u2019 \u201clast bastion\u201d his forces have been operating in northern areas the military previously said it dismantled the militants\u2019 command structure. In a radio interview on the Israeli station Reshet Bet, Hanegbi said \u201cit was honestly stated in the first days of presenting the plans to the cabinet that the war would be long.\u201d \u201cYou need to have patience and know how to stand strong. This resilience is what has allowed this nation to survive for 75 years, and even for 3,000 years before that. Just don\u2019t use a stopwatch on ourselves or set ultimatums,\u201d he said. Israel is pressing ahead with its military offensive in the face of growing global outrage, after an Israeli airstrike on Sunday killed at least 45 people and injured 200 others in Rafah at a camp for displaced people, which Israel had designated as a safe zone. Video from the Tal al-Sultan camp showed scenes of horror: charred bodies being pulled from the rubble, a man holding the headless body of a child, fire raging from tents in the background. A CNN analysis of video from the scene suggests that munitions made in the United States were used in the strike. But US President Joe Biden is not altering his policy towards Israel, suggesting the strike on Rafah had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support, despite him telling CNN earlier this month he would not allow certain US weapons to be used in a major offensive in Rafah. The strike came days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its offensive in Rafah, or any actions \u201cwhich may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d The ICJ said the humanitarian situation in Rafah can now be described as \u201cdisastrous\u201d and could worsen still if Israel\u2019s operation in the city continues.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-seven-months-end-year-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_middleeast_aid-gaza-down-two-thirds-israel-intl", "text": "The amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza has dropped by 67% since Israel launched a military offensive in the southern city of Rafah earlier this month, the United Nations has warned. \u201cThe amount of food and other aid entering Gaza, already insufficient to meet the soaring needs, has further shrunk since May 7,\u201d the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Wednesday. A daily average of 58 aid trucks reached Gaza between May 7 and Tuesday, down from an average of 176 aid trucks between April 1 and May 6, OCHA said, a drop of 67%. About 500 trucks per day crossed into Gaza before hostilities between Israel and Hamas began in October, according to figures from the UN, which has long urged that deliveries return to this level. The drop in aid deliveries came after Israel began its assault on Rafah in its attempt to destroy Hamas, which was believed to have regrouped in the south of Gaza after Israel\u2019s destruction of much of the north. Since Israel seized control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing on May 7, aid has been blocked, with supplies piling up in Egypt and the Strip teetering close to famine. A top Israeli security official this week warned that the war in Gaza could spill into next year, apparently dashing the possibility that the Rafah campaign could bring the offensive to an end. In its ruling last week, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said the humanitarian situation in Gaza could now be described as \u201cdisastrous\u201d and ordered Israel to keep the Rafah crossing open for \u201cunhindered provision at scale\u201d of aid. Israel and Egypt have blamed each other for the blockage. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called on Egypt to reopen the crossing; his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry accused Katz of \u201cdistorting the facts,\u201d saying that Israel\u2019s offensive near the crossing \u2013 and the danger it poses to relief workers \u2013 was the reason Egypt is unable to bring aid into Gaza. Rafah had previously been the central artery for aid to flow into Gaza \u2013 and, in November, for some injured Palestinians and foreign nationals to enter Egypt. With Rafah now the epicenter of hostilities, aid has continued to trickle in from two other crossings: Kerem Shalom in the south and Erez in the north. Kerem Shalom was reopened last week after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and US President Joe Biden agreed to send aid to the UN via the crossing on a temporary basis. \u201cThis will help save lives,\u201d Biden said, while efforts continue to reopen the Rafah crossing. More than 370 aid trucks arrived at the crossing from Egypt on Monday, Israeli officials said. But UNRWA, the main United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, said it had picked up only 30 trucks for distribution on the Gazan side of the crossing. \u201cWhile the Kerem Shalom crossing remains open in principle, it is extremely difficult for aid organizations to access from the Gaza side due to the hostilities,\u201d OCHA said Tuesday. Some Israelis have in recent months staged protests at the crossing, demanding that no aid enter Gaza until Hamas release all of the hostages. In the north, some aid has been able to enter via the Erez crossing. From May 1 to May 20, the World Food Program transferred 500 trucks, carrying 7,000 metric tons of aid, through the crossing. But only the western side of the crossing is open, with Erez East still closed. Meanwhile, the temporary US-built pier to transport aid into Gaza, which cost $320 million and only began operating on May 17, broke apart Tuesday. It will be removed from the Gaza coast and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod for repairs, which will take more than a week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/middleeast/aid-gaza-down-two-thirds-israel-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

They arrive two days after a strike on a Rafah camp killed dozens of displaced Palestinians on Sunday and as the international community urges Israel to stop its assault on the city. Israeli strikes over the past two days in Rafah have forced more displaced people to flee. Two further attacks in Rafah killed at least 29\u00a0Palestinians on Tuesday,\u00a0according to authorities in Gaza. The first hit a displacement camp just 150 meters from the site of Sunday\u2019s strike. The second hit\u00a0a displacement camp\u00a0in the southern coastal town of Al-Mawasi, an area designated by Israel as a \u201csafe zone\u201d where it had earlier ordered thousands of people to evacuate to. Israel has denied striking a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi. Staunch ally the United States said President Joe Biden is not altering his policy toward Israel, suggesting the strikes had not yet crossed\u00a0a red line\u00a0that would force changes in American support. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby asserted on Tuesday there were no indications yet that Israel had waged a military campaign that would prompt Biden to withhold aid or weapons. Biden had said in a CNN interview earlier this month\u00a0that he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. His administration has warned against a large-scale ground invasion in Rafah unless the well-being of civilians can be guaranteed. Some 1.3 million Palestinians were sheltering in Rafah before Israel began its operation there, having fled from other parts of Gaza since the conflict began seven months ago. Around 1 million have fled the city since, according to UN figures. Israel\u2019s advance deeper into Rafah comes despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordering it to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its military operation there. The UN and some of Israel\u2019s European allies have called on it to abide by the ICJ\u2019s order, saying it is binding. In Khan Younis, north of\u00a0Rafah, people attempting to evacuate told CNN they do not know where else to go as they try to head north toward Deir El-Balah in central Gaza. Video shows mattresses, wooden panels, chairs, and various other belongings piled on top of vehicles and donkey carts. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now, whether in\u00a0Rafah, Khan Younis or Gaza in general, is the disastrous displacement of people. There is no shelter, no life, no future,\u201d said Ansar Mahdi, a Palestinian who said she has now been displaced four times. Walking on crutches, Mohamed Jarbou, said: \u201cThe elderly have been humiliated. Children humiliated. What\u2019s wrong? They are all civilians.\u201d Tanks in Rafah Alaa Abu Ibrahim, a Rafah resident, told CNN that Israeli tanks were seen at the Al Awda roundabout in the center of the city. Another resident, Salma AlKadoomi, said she saw armored vehicles in the downtown area. \u201cThese vehicles advanced in the middle of the night,\u201d AlKadoomi told CNN. Asked about reports of tanks advancing in the city, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told a media briefing on Tuesday that the military is operating in Rafah in a \u201ctargeted\u201d and \u201cprecise\u201d way. \u201cThere are still Hamas battalions in Rafah. A couple of days ago launchers from Rafah fired (rockets) to Tel Aviv. Millions of people went into bomb shelters,\u201d he said. Israel began a limited ground operation in Rafah on May 7, crossing the Philadelphi Corridor \u2013 a 14-kilometer (about 8.7-mile) buffer zone on the Egypt-Gaza border \u2013 and seizing the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt. Egypt has strongly opposed the operation at its border. On Monday, an Egyptian security worker was killed on the border with Gaza in a shooting that involved Egyptian and Israeli soldiers. Egypt\u2019s state-affiliated Al-Qahera News outlet said \u201cPalestinian resistance\u201d fighters were also involved. Displacement camps hit again: Palestinian officials Palestinian officials said Tuesday\u2019s fresh Israeli strikes had killed 29 people \u2013 at least eight at the Tal al-Sultan camp and 21 at a camp\u00a0in Al-Mawasi, though the IDF has denied striking a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi. CNN has followed up, asking if the IDF has struck elsewhere in Al-Mawasi, such as the UN warehouse that is in the vicinity of the camp, but has not received a reply. The first strike hit three tents at Tal al-Sultan at around 3 a.m. local time, according to residents and a CNN stringer in Rafah. At least eight people were\u00a0killed and transferred to a field hospital in Tal al-Sultan, according to the Emergency Committee of the Rafah Governorate. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the strike at Tal al-Sultan. The camp hit on Tuesday is approximately 150 meters from another displacement\u00a0camp where an Israeli strike and ensuing fire on Sunday killed at least 45 people. Video from CNN\u2019s stringer in Tal al-Sultan shows displaced people dismantling their makeshift living arrangements, gathering their belongings and evacuating the area on trucks and donkey carts. Al-Mawasi, north of Rafah, is supposedly a \u201csafe zone.\u201d In early May, the Israeli military ordered people in eastern Rafah to \u201cimmediately head to the expanded humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi,\u201d as it stepped up its operations in the area. The Al-Mawasi camp was already crowded with displaced people before civilians in Rafah were ordered to move there. The UN has said it is not \u201cquite suitable\u201d for habitation. Videos obtained by CNN show several dead bodies lying on sand covered in bloodied blankets with dozens of people shrieking and gathering around them. Children are seen crying next to the bodies of women whose faces are covered in blood. Israeli investigation Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday said the civilian casualties caused by Sunday\u2019s strike on the camp in Rafah were \u201ca tragic error.\u201d Israel launched an investigation into the event, and on Tuesday the IDF claimed the deadly fire at the camp could not have been caused solely by the weaponry used by Israel. \u201cOur munitions alone could not have ignited a fire of this size. Our investigation seeks to determine what may have caused such a large fire to ignite,\u201d Hagari said. \u201cWe are looking into all possibilities, including the option that weapons stored in a compound next to our target, which we did not know of, may have ignited as a result of this strike.\u201d He showed aerial footage of a strike on a structure in which he said senior Hamas commanders were meeting and\u00a0said that the military used two munitions with 17-kilogram (37 lbs) warheads.\u00a0\u201cThis is the smallest munitions that our jets could use.\u201d \u201cWe are working to verify the cause of the fire, it is still too early to be determined,\u201d Hagari said.\u00a0\u201cEven when we do find the cause of the fire that erupted it won\u2019t make this situation any less tragic.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/israeli-tanks-advance-central-rafah-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

Snapped while taking a stroll in New York City, the model, writer and actor was seen wearing a graphic T-shirt printed with Stormy Daniels face (Daniels is the adult film star and director who was allegedly paid $130,000 by Trump to keep quiet about an affair ahead of the 2016 election). The\u00a0$95 shirt\u00a0was designed by cartoonist Robert Crumb\u00a0and,\u00a0according to the brand Platform, directly supports the New York based domestic violence and sexual assault organization, \u201cSafe Horizon,\u201d\u00a0by donating a\u00a0portion of its sales. Fashion has long been an important vehicle for political expression, particularly for those in the spotlight. In 1984, British designer Katherine Hammett\u00a0became an early proponent of politically charged T-shirts, when she arrived to meet then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in a top that read \u201c58% don\u2019t want Pershing\u201d \u2014 a phrase lifted from an\u00a0opinion poll on the undemocratic proliferation of American nuclear missiles across Europe. Hammett later told the Guardian in 2018 she hid the top tightly under her jacket, only exposing the words when she was in front of a wall of cameras. Thatcher bent down to read her shirt and \u201clet out a squawk,\u201d Hammett said. Today, statements can range from the enigmatic to the undeniable. Ratajkowski herself is no stranger to the art of sartorial support, wearing a\u00a0conspicuous\u00a0Rage Against the Machine\u00a0T-shirt\u00a0in 2020\u00a0featuring a young Bernie Sanders.

Similarly, at the\u00a0Cannes Film Festival\u00a0earlier this month, many online questioned whether Cate Blanchett\u2019s Haider Ackermann dress was a tacit show of solidarity with Palestine amid the war in Gaza. The silk satin haute couture gown was half black and half blush-toned pink, with a striking emerald green lining only visible when she tossed her frock open. In an image captured by an elevated photographer, the pastel pink in Blanchett\u2019s gown appeared\u00a0almost\u00a0white \u2014 a combination of colors, especially considering the red carpet of the Promenade de la Croisette, was enough for some to\u00a0perceive\u00a0as a nod to the\u00a0de\u00a0facto\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0flag. Neither Blanchett nor Ackermann (who made the dress in January 2023,\u00a0some\u00a09 months before the October 7 attacks) issued an official statement on the dress. But in the digital age,\u00a0explicit displays of support are sometimes at risk of being censored.

{"id": "travel_airbus-beluga-gets-own-airline", "text": "The Airbus Beluga, one of the world\u2019s strangest airplanes, now has its own airline. The odd-looking, oversized cargo plane \u2014 a favorite among planespotters around the world \u2014 has been in service for close to two decades. It mainly transports aircraft parts between Airbus\u2019 manufacturing facilities spread throughout Europe. Now, a new version of the Beluga is replacing the original fleet, which has gone on to power a standalone freight airline called Airbus Beluga Transport. \u201cThere are very few options on the market for oversize items,\u201d says Beno\u00eet Lemonnier, head of Airbus Beluga Transport. \u201cMost often there\u2019s a need to partially dismantle a payload to make it fit in an aircraft \u2014 whereas in the Beluga, it will just fit.\u201d The original fleet The very first Beluga was originally known as the Airbus Super Transporter. But after its nickname \u2014 derived from the resemblance to the white Arctic whale \u2014 gained popularity, Airbus decided to rename the aircraft Beluga ST, retaining the original name in the acronym. It first flew in 1994 and entered service in 1995, followed over the years by four more examples, the last of which was rolled out in late 2000. \u201cThe Beluga was developed to transport large sections of Airbus aircraft from its factories in France, Germany, the UK, Spain and Turkey to the final assembly lines located in Toulouse and Hamburg,\u201d explains Lemonnier. \u201cIt is a very special design, because it\u2019s actually a transformation of an A300-600 that had its entire head removed and then equipped with special fuselage shells, a bigger door and dedicated flight equipment.\u201d Before the Beluga, Airbus was using a fleet of Super Guppies, modified versions of 1950s Boeing Stratocruiser passenger planes that had previously been in service with NASA to ferry spacecraft parts. Now, history is repeating itself as the original Beluga is being replaced by a more spacious and advanced model, the Beluga XL. Longer and bigger than the ST, the Beluga XL is capable of carrying both wings, rather than just one, of the Airbus A350, the company\u2019s latest long-haul aircraft that rivals the Boeing 787 and 777. \u201cThe XL is based on a much more modern platform, the A330,\u201d Lemonnier adds. \u201cSince 2018, six XLs have been built, and the latest one will be delivered very soon to the internal Airbus airline. The Beluga XL can fully substitute the Beluga ST on the internal Airbus network, so the STs can become available for alternative service.\u201d Old but not out The original Beluga STs might be approaching two decades of service, but according to Lemonnier, there\u2019s still a lot of life left in them: \u201cDepending on how often they fly, they may remain in service for 20 more years, easily.\u201d One of them will keep working for Airbus and ferry aircraft parts, while the remaining four will be exclusively in the fleet of the new cargo airline. It\u2019s not the first time that the Belugas are used outside Airbus, however. \u201cWe had some chartered flights between 2000 and 2010, when there was some capacity left and the Beluga were used to transport helicopters and satellites,\u201d he says. Then, in 2022, the company completed a dozen test missions in preparation for the airline launch. \u201cThe difference now is that we are fully standalone, so we can be flexible for our customers and accept date changes, for example, meaning we can stay in one area to wait for a payload \u2014 something that would probably be impossible for the Airbus internal airline to do,\u201d Lemonnier says. Because the Beluga ST\u2019s cargo hold is 50% higher and 10% wider than regular cargo aircraft \u2014 like the Boeing 747-8F \u2014\u00a0it is generally used to transport voluminous items such as satellites, helicopters, aircraft engines, flight simulators, sailing boats and army vehicles. Flying on the Beluga can be a little different than on regular aircraft, Lemonnier notes.  \u201cIt can have a sensitive behavior in the wind due to its big head, and that\u2019s why it requires specific training for pilots,\u201d he says. \u201cBut otherwise it flies very much like an A300-600 \u2014 the cockpit is totally unchanged.\u201d One limitation is the range of 3,000 kilometers (1,600 nautical miles), which means that trips from Europe to the United States require up to two refueling stops, generally in the Azores and Canada. Another is the maximum cargo weight of 40 metric tons; because the Beluga is designed for volume, rivals like the Antonov AN-124 can carry three times as much weight, and the former largest airplane in the world \u2014 the AN-225, destroyed in 2022 \u2014 had capacity for a whopping 250 tons. A niche market The intended operation for the Airbus Beluga Transport is quite different to standard commercial freighter operations, according to Gary Crichlow, an aviation analyst at consultancy firm AviationValues. \u201cTransporting helicopters, satellites and other large assets brings certain operational complexities that transporting packages for Amazon would not normally have to deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, the maximum altitude at which a helicopter\u2019s structure is certificated sets the maximum altitude at which the transport flight can operate.\u201d Crichlow also notes that while the Beluga ST\u2019s capacity of 40 metric tons pales in comparison to Antonov aircraft, there are five Beluga STs, and Airbus advertises them as featuring one of the most voluminous cargo holds of any civil or military aircraft flying today. \u201cClearly Airbus is not aiming to be Amazon Prime,\u201d he says, \u201cbut having amortized each Beluga\u2019s \u20ac183 million ($199 million) cost over the past 20 years, this would appear to be a relatively low-risk opportunity to earn revenue from a niche of the freighter market.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/airbus-beluga-gets-own-airline/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_asia_north-korea-trash-balloons-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea has adopted a new strategy to contend with its southern neighbor: sending floating bags of trash containing \u201cfilth\u201d across the border, carried by massive balloons. The South Korean military began noticing \u201clarge amounts of balloons\u201d arriving from the North starting Tuesday night, detecting more than 150 as of Wednesday morning, according to the country\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). Photos released by the JCS show plastic bags carried by two giant balloons, with some broken packages spilling scraps of plastic, sheets of paper, and what appears to be dirt onto roads and sidewalks. The balloons so far contain \u201cfilth and garbage\u201d and are being analyzed by government agencies, said the JCS, adding that the military was cooperating with the United Nations Command. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s actions clearly violate international law and seriously threaten the safety of our citizens,\u201d it added. \u201cAll responsibility arising from the North Korean balloons lies entirely with North Korea, and we sternly warn North Korea to immediately stop its inhumane and low-level actions.\u201d Local governments also sent messages to residents in the northern Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces to warn of the \u201cunidentified objects,\u201d and advised against outdoor activities. The packages risk damaging residential areas, airports and highways, said the JCS. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s younger sister Kim Yo Jong \u2013 who is also a senior official in the reclusive regime \u2013 referred to the activities as \u201cfreedom of expression.\u201d In a statement published by state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Wednesday, Kim said that North Korea had dispersed toilet paper and other waste materials in bags attached to the\u00a0balloons along the Korean border and central areas. Kim compared North Korea\u2019s actions to South Korea\u2019s years-long practice of sending\u00a0balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets towards her nation. \u201cWe\u2019ve done some of the things they always do, but I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re making a big deal like they\u2019ve been hit by a shower of fire,\u201d Kim said. The move, according to North Korean state media KCNA, was to retaliate against South Korean activists who often send materials to the North \u2013 including propaganda leaflets, food, medicine, radios and USB sticks containing South Korean news and television dramas, all prohibited in the isolated totalitarian dictatorship. Campaigners in the South, including defectors from North Korea, have long sent these materials through balloons, drones, and bottles floating down the cross-border river \u2013 even after South Korea\u2019s parliament banned such actions in 2020. \u201cScattering leaflets by use of balloons is a dangerous provocation that can be utilized for a specific military purpose,\u201d said Kim Kang Il, North Korea\u2019s Vice Minister of National Defense, KCNA reported on Sunday. He accused South Korea of using \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d by scattering \u201cvarious dirty things\u201d near border areas, declaring that the North would take \u201ctit for tat action.\u201d \u201cMounds of wastepaper and filth will soon be scattered over the border areas and the interior of (South Korea) and it will directly experience how much effort is required to remove them,\u201d Kim said, according to KCNA. \u201cWhen our national sovereignty, security and interests are violated, we will take action immediately.\u201d Kim also decried joint US-South Korea military drills, which have increased in recent years as tensions have risen in the Korean peninsula. The 2020 law that prohibited sending leaflets also\u00a0restricted\u00a0loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts, which the South\u2019s military once championed as part of psychological warfare against the North until it withdrew the equipment following a 2018 summit between the two Koreas. But even after parliament passed the ban, activists told Reuters they planned to continue \u2013 including the defector Park Sang-hak, who had been sending materials back to his homeland for 15 years, vowing to continue in an effort to give North Koreans a rare glimpse of the outside world. Earlier this month, Park\u2019s organization Fighters for a Free North Korea said in a statement it had sent 20 balloons toward North Korea, containing 300,000 leaflets that condemned Kim Jong Un and 2,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and music videos. \u201cIn order to appeal and urge the North Korean people to rise up and put an end to Kim Jong Un \u2026 the group is sending the leaflets to the compatriots in North Korea,\u201d the organization said in a statement. For decades, North Korea has been almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group has released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers sentenced to hard labor for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including parts of its pop culture, to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years and diplomatic talks fell apart \u2013 prompting strict rules to snap back into place in the North.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

Victoria Premier Jacinta Allan announced Wednesday that state MP Tim Richardson would serve as the inaugural Parliamentary Secretary for Men\u2019s Behavior Change \u2013 the first position of its kind in the country. Richardson said he would focus on the influence the internet and social media have on male attitudes towards women, and on building respectful relationships. It would not be \u201ceasy work, but it is important,\u201d he added. \u201cWe must make Victoria a safer place for women and children and work to end the tragedy of deaths of Victorian women at the hands of men,\u201d Richardson wrote on X. Gender-based violence is plaguing Australia \u2013 31 women have been killed across the country so far this year, according to the Counting Dead Women project. Last year, 64 women were murdered, the group said. Last weekend, a woman and her daughter were shot dead in Perth, Western Australia, by a man who was allegedly trying to find his ex-partner and daughter. In a statement, the man\u2019s daughter said that,\u00a0\u201cwhen my father couldn\u2019t find us he murdered her best friend and her best friend\u2019s daughter.\u201d The country was rattled by multiple violent incidents in April, including when five women were killed by a man armed with a knife at a shopping center in the suburb of Bondi in Sydney. Police said CCTV footage showed it was \u201cobvious\u201d the man targeted women. In another violent incident, a 28-year-old mother was allegedly murdered by her partner, who was already facing charges of raping and stalking her but had been released on bail. Tarang Chawla, who founded the non-profit Not One More Niki after his sister Nikita Chawla was murdered by her partner in 2015, told CNN he hopes the new parliamentary position will make a \u201ctangible difference\u201d to addressing male violence in Australia. \u201cThis role gives me some semblance of hope that the focus is shifting away from this being a women\u2019s problem to solve and instead is a men\u2019s issue that we can take leadership for,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it also requires the Parliamentary Secretary to consult and collaborate on solutions with those working on the ground, with men, to understand their attitudes, the drivers of their actions and work to change their behaviors,\u201d he told CNN. However, not all Australians had a positive reaction to the news. Jane Hume of the opposition Liberal Party, who represents Victoria in the national Senate, questioned the efficacy of the appointment. \u201cIt does sound to me like a little bit of window dressing around a really important issue that involves genuine cultural change,\u201d she told Sky News. Within hours of announcing the position, Richardson took to X, writing:\u00a0 \u201cSome pretty hectic reactions here to an important role and Australian first. It will be about modelling positive role models for boys and men and ensuring we break away from gendered based stereotypes and building respectful relationships. As boys and men we need to lead this.\u201d While the new Parliamentary Secretary for Men\u2019s Behavior Change now exists at a state level, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also announced in May a rapid review into the prevention of domestic violence after calling the problem a \u201cnational crisis.\u201d \u201cWe recognize that governments need to act, but we also recognize that this is an issue for the whole of society.

{"id": "2024_05_30_europe_iceland-volcano-eruption-grindavik-intl-hnk", "text": "A volcano in southwestern Iceland erupted Wednesday for the fifth time since December, spewing massive lava flows that threatened to cut off the town of Grindav\u00edk and prompting the evacuation of the world-famous Blue Lagoon. The eruption began around 1 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) Wednesday following an earthquake at the Sundhn\u00faks crater, Iceland\u2019s public broadcaster RUV reported. Iceland\u2019s Meteorological Office had earlier warned that a volcanic eruption was likely following \u201cintense seismic activity\u201d at the crater and a build-up of magma in its underground reservoir. Dramatic video and images from the scene showed fountains of red-hot lava shooting into the air along a 3.4-kilometer (two-mile) fissure near Mount Hagafell on the Reykjanes Peninsula. Lava flows initially cut off two out of three roads leading to the fishing town of Grindav\u00edk and were steadily moving along a defensive barrier built to save the town and key infrastructure from being destroyed, Iceland\u2019s Meteorological Office said. But the situation had improved by Thursday, the mayor of Grindav\u00edk said. The town remains without electricity, but both hot and cold water are running in the town with no apparent damage to the piping system, RUV reported. \u201cI like the situation quite well compared to how it looked at the beginning of the eruption yesterday,\u201d Mayor Fannar J\u00f3nasson said. Initial monitoring by the Met Office warned the start of the eruption was \u201cmore vigorous\u201d than previous times, but the lava activity had \u201csignificantly decreased overnight,\u201d it said. Just hours before, V\u00ed\u00f0ir Reynisson, from Iceland\u2019s Civil Defense, had told RUV that \u201clava is flowing outside the defense walls at Grindav\u00edk in several places, and lava is also starting to flow outside the walls at Svartsengi.\u201d He warned that Grindav\u00edk was at risk of becoming completely cut off, though he added that the defense barriers were holding. \u201cThe houses in the west and farthest part of the town would have gone under the lava if it weren\u2019t for the defensive walls, but they are still standing and defending,\u201d Reynisson reportedly said. Grindav\u00edk, a town of about 3,000 people,\u00a0was mostly evacuated before a previous eruption in December. Residents and responders who remain in the town have been urged to leave while they still can, though police told RUV that three residents are refusing to evacuate. Electricity to Grindav\u00edk was cut on Wednesday as a protective measure as lava flows closed in on high-voltage lines and hot and cold pipes in the ground, Kristinn Har\u00f0arsonar, production manager at energy company HS Orka, told RUV. \u201cMost of the high-voltage lines are gone, the pylons are badly damaged and some are on fire,\u201d the Civil Defense\u2019s Reynisson later said. Benedikt \u00d3feigsson, from the Met Office, told RUV that the beginning of this eruption was more powerful than previously due to more accumulated magma in the chamber. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more lava flow than we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cThis is reflected in today\u2019s massive lava flows.\u201d Iceland\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a post on X that there was no disruption to international or domestic flights. But for the third time in just over two months, the country\u2019s famous geothermal spa and tourist hotspot the Blue Lagoon was evacuated, according to its operations manager. Just under an hour\u2019s drive from Iceland\u2019s capital and largest city Reykjavik, the Blue Lagoon is one of the country\u2019s most popular tourist attractions. The site is part of southwest Iceland\u2019s Reykjanes Peninsula \u2014 a thick finger of land pointing west into the North Atlantic Ocean from Reykjavik. Iceland is one of the most active volcanic areas on the planet. Rather than having a central volcano, the Reykjanes Peninsula is dominated by a rift valley, with lava fields and cones. The environment agency\u2019s air quality meters are \u201cgreen\u201d across\u00a0Iceland, indicating there is currently no air pollution from the eruption, the monitoring website\u00a0shows. However,\u00a0Iceland\u2019s national police warned a westerly wind could carry gas pollution from the eruption eastward on Thursday into Friday, which might affect areas in South\u00a0Iceland. \u201cAccording to the\u00a0Icelandic Met Office, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the amount of gas emissions from the eruption site,\u201d the police said in a\u00a0statement. While the gas pollution forecasted in Reykjav\u00edk on Wednesday never materialized, police encouraged residents to monitor real-time air pollution levels online.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/europe/iceland-volcano-eruption-grindavik-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_middleeast_gaza-us-munitions-rafah-strike-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "Munitions made in the United States were used in the deadly Israeli strike\u00a0on\u00a0a displacement camp in Rafah on Sunday, a CNN analysis of video from the scene and a review by explosive weapons experts has found. At least 45 people were killed and more than 200 others injured after a fire broke out following the Israeli military\u2019s strike\u00a0on the outskirts of Gaza\u2019s southernmost city, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian medics. Footage obtained by CNN showed swathes of the camp in Rafah in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. Israel\u2019s escalating assault in Rafah \u2013 where some 1.3 million Palestinians were taking shelter before Israel began its operation there \u2013 has drawn swift international condemnation, with United Nations agencies, aid groups and multiple governments calling on Israel to immediately halt its offensive. Israeli tanks were seen advancing further into Rafah on Tuesday for the first time in Israel\u2019s seven-month war against Hamas, signaling a new phase Israel pressing on with its controversial and destructive offensive. However, US President Joe Biden is not altering his policy towards Israel, suggesting the deadly Rafah strike had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support,  despite him saying in a CNN interview earlier this month\u00a0he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. CNN geolocated videos showing tents in flames in the aftermath of the strike\u00a0on\u00a0the camp for internally displaced people known as \u201cKuwait Peace Camp 1.\u201d In video shared on social media, which CNN geolocated to the same scene by matching details including the camp\u2019s entrance sign and the tiles on the ground, the tail of a US-made GBU-39 small diameter bomb (SDB) is visible, according to four explosive weapons experts who reviewed the video for CNN. The GBU-39, which is manufactured by Boeing, is a high-precision munition\u00a0\u201cdesigned to attack strategically important point targets,\u201d and result in low collateral damage,\u00a0explosive weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith told CNN Tuesday. However, \u201cusing any munition, even of this size, will always incur risks in a densely populated area,\u201d\u00a0said Cobb-Smith, who is also a\u00a0former British Army artillery officer. Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member who also identified the fragment as being from a GBU-39,\u00a0explained to\u00a0CNN how he drew his conclusion. \u201cThe warhead portion [of the munition] is distinct, and the guidance and wing section is extremely unique compared to other munitions. Guidance and wing sections of munitions are often the remnants left over even after a munition detonates.\u00a0I saw the tail actuation section and instantly knew it was one of the SDB/GBU-39 variants.\u201d Ball also concluded that while there is a variant of the GBU-39 known as the Focused Lethality Munition (FLM) which has a larger explosive payload but is designed to cause even less collateral damage, this was not the variant used in this case. \u201cThe FLM has a carbon fiber composite warhead body and is filled with tungsten ground into a powder. Photos of FLM testing have shown objects in the test coated in tungsten dust, which is not present [in video from the scene],\u201d he told CNN. Serial numbers on the remnants of the munitions also matched those for a manufacturer of GBU-39 parts based in California \u2013 pointing to more evidence the bombs were made in the US. Two\u00a0additional\u00a0explosive weapons experts \u2013\u00a0Richard Weir, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch, and Chris Lincoln-Jones, a former British Army artillery officer and weapons and targeting expert \u2013 identified the fragment as being part of a US-manufactured GBU-39 when reviewing the video for CNN, though they were unable to comment on the variant used. Asked for comment on the munitions used in the Rafah strike at Tuesday\u2019s briefing, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters: \u201cI do not know what type of munition was used in that airstrike. I\u2019d have to refer you to the Israelis to speak to that.\u201d CNN has also reached out to the US National Security Council. Main weapons supplier The US has long been the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), and that support has continued despite the growing political pressure on the Biden administration over the Gaza offensive. Last month, Biden signed a foreign aid bill that included\u00a0$26 billion for the Israel-Hamas conflict\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including $15 billion in Israeli military aid, $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza and $2.4 billion for regional US military operations. CNN\u2019s identification of the munition is consistent with a claim made by IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari in a briefing about the tragedy on Tuesday. Hagari told reporters the strike \u2013 which he said\u00a0targeted senior Hamas commanders \u2013 used two munitions with small warheads containing 17 kilos of explosives, adding these bombs were \u201cthe smallest munitions that our jets could use.\u201d The traditional GBU-39 warhead has an explosive payload of 17 kilos. Hagari said the deadly fire which occurred following the strike was not caused solely by weapons used by the Israeli military. \u201cOur munitions alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\u201d Hagari said, adding the IDF was investigating \u201cwhat may have caused such a large fire to ignite.\u201d He added that Israel is looking into whether the strike was \u201cunintentionally set off possible stored weapons in a nearby compound.\u201d Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the deadly airstrike in Rafah was a \u201ctragic error,\u201d but said Israel has vowed to press on with its operation despite international outrage and a US warning not to proceed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/gaza-us-munitions-rafah-strike-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_asia_thailand-indicts-thaksin-shinawatra-lese-majeste-intl-hnk", "text": "Thailand\u2019s former Prime Minister\u00a0Thaksin Shinawatra has been indicted on lese majeste charges, authorities said Wednesday, the latest\u00a0twist in a decades-long political saga in the Southeast Asian kingdom. The case, filed by police, alleged Thaksin violated Thailand\u2019s notoriously harsh royal insult law during an interview he gave in 2015 to the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo. \u201cThe attorney general has decided to indict Thaksin on all charges,\u201d spokesperson Prayuth Bejraguna,\u00a0told reporters Wednesday. Thaksin will need to appear before the Office of the Attorney General on June 18, after which he will be taken to court. He could not appear at Wednesday\u2019s hearing due to a Covid-19 infection, the spokesperson said. Thaksin has denied the charges, according to the spokesperson, and has repeatedly pledged loyalty to the monarchy. Thaksin, who served as prime minister from 2001 until he was ousted in a military coup in 2006, made a dramatic return to Thailand last August after 15 years in self-imposed exile and\u00a0was taken into custody. Some experts believe Thaksin may have struck a deal with the country\u2019s powerful conservative and royalist establishment for his return \u2013 given his court convictions and the charges against him. Thaksin has denied the claim. He was sentenced to eight years in prison for conflict of interest, abuse of power and corruption during his time in power, though his sentence was later reduced to one year. In February, the 74-year-old was released from detention after being granted parole, having served just six months in a police hospital. Thailand\u00a0has some of the world\u2019s strictest royal defamation laws, and\u00a0criticizing the king, queen, or heir apparent can lead to a maximum 15-year prison sentence for each offense. Sentences for those convicted under Section 112 of Thailand\u2019s Criminal Code,\u00a0or lese majeste law, can be decades long, and hundreds of people have been\u00a0prosecuted in recent years. Earlier this month, the death of a young Thai activist in pre-trial detention for lese majeste charges shocked many in the country and sparked renewed calls for justice reform. Thaksin, a former owner of Manchester City Football Club, is the head of a famed political dynasty that has dominated Thai politics for the past two decades, boasting two former prime ministers. Even today, Pheu Thai \u2014 the latest party of the powerful Shinawatra clan \u2014 is in government after entering into a ruling coalition with its former military rivals following the May 2023 election. Thaksin\u2019s daughter Paetongtarn is leader of the party. Return from exile Thaksin\u2019s return to Thailand reintroduced a towering and divisive figure to\u00a0Thailand\u00a0at a tense political time. Since his release from detention, Thaksin has traveled the country making a series of public appearances, including to his hometown of Chiang Mai where his support base is concentrated. Throughout his time in power, Thaksin was hugely popular with Thailand\u2019s rural and working class but his policies were loathed by rich elites and conservatives who accused him of being a dangerous and corrupt populist. During his physical absence from the country, he retained an outsized influence on Thai politics and has remained at the center of the country\u2019s tumultuous and often violent political landscape. Thaksin has denied that he remains behind the scenes pulling the strings and insisted he returned to Thailand because he wants to enjoy his retirement and spend time with his family. Some analysts suggest Thaksin sees himself as an \u201celder statesman\u201d figure and that his old adversaries in the establishment still consider him a threat. \u201cThe charge is politically driven, there\u2019s no other way to put it,\u201d said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University. \u201cThey see him as a threat. He didn\u2019t serve a day in jail which caused consternation because it was a double standard, and he wields influence over the Pheu Thai party in government.\u201d Thailand\u2019s Constitutional Court last week accepted a petition seeking to remove Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office over his appointment of a Cabinet member, a lawyer and close Thaksin aide who had served jail time. Pichit Chuenban was jailed for six months in 2008 for contempt of court after trying to bribe Supreme Court officials in a land case involving Thaksin. Thitinan said the two cases are connected, and the lese majeste charge was a \u201cway to keep Thaksin in line.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an indictment and a reminder to Thaksin of who has real power in Thailand,\u201d he said. Calls for reform For years,\u00a0human rights organizations\u00a0and free speech campaigners have said lese majeste has been used as a\u00a0political tool\u00a0to silence critics of the Thai government. And rights groups say the right to freedom of expression in Thailand has come under increased attack since nationwide 2020 youth-led protests that saw millions of young people take to the streets calling for constitutional and democratic reforms \u2013 for the first time, openly criticizing the monarchy and publicly questioning its power and wealth. Those protests came four years after King Maha Vajiralongkorn succeeded his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej who had reigned for seven decades. Despite the change from a military-backed government to civilian leadership last year, surveillance and intimidation against activists and students continues, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. The legal advocacy group said that since the start of those protests in July 2020 and up until March 2024, at least 1,954 people have been prosecuted or charged for their participation in political assemblies and for speaking out, with 286 of those cases involving children. A push to reform the lese majeste laws gained significant traction ahead of the 2023 general election, which saw the progressive Move Forward Party win the most votes.

With just hours before the electoral campaigns officially conclude on Wednesday, a string of violent acts against candidates and their staff have been reported across the country, from Jalisco in the west to Chiapas in the south. In Morelos, a state in south-central Mexico, the attorney-general reported that Ricardo Arizmendi Reynoso, a substitute opposition candidate for the municipal presidency of the city of Cuautla, was assassinated in a shooting on Tuesday. In Jalisco state on the same day, Gilberto Palomar, the ruling Morena party\u2019s candidate for the mayorship of the town Encarnacio de Diaz, was hospitalized after an attack by armed individuals on the party\u2019s local offices. In the central State of Mexico, the truck of a mayoral candidate for Chalco, Eduardo D\u00edaz, was shot, according to a local representative of the Green Ecologist Party. Meanwhile, in Puebla, central Mexico, Juan Sandoval, a Citizen Movement candidate in the municipality of Tehuac\u00e1n, was attacked outside his campaign office but was unharmed, his  team reported. As of Wednesday, no arrests have been reported. Several organizations have reported that the run-up to this election has been the most violent in the country\u2019s recent history. However, figures from independent groups and firms differ from those of the Mexican government. The research group Data C\u00edvica has reported 31 homicides, Consultora Integralia has reported 34, and consulting firm DataInt registered 38 in a report published on May 21. The Secretary of Security and Citizen Protection, Rosa Icela Rodr\u00edguez, acknowledged on Tuesday the deaths of 22 candidates during the 2023-2024 electoral process, of which eight victims were candidates accredited by the National Electoral Institute (INE) or before local electoral bodies, according to the official. The Mexican government had previously reported on April 2 that there had been at least 15 candidate deaths since the electoral process began on October 1. On Wednesday, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador claimed that the electoral violence is the result of a link between past governments and criminal groups. \u201cWhat we are suffering in the case of electoral political violence still has to do with that \u2013 links that were established between the authorities and crime,\u201d the Mexican president said in his morning press conference. International electoral observers, accredited by INE to witness Sunday\u2019s general elections, have expressed concern about the violence plaguing the country ahead of the polls. \u201cCertainly, this is more of a call to investigate the facts and take measures so that these issues do not tarnish the elections and do not cause damage to Mexican democracy,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza Salinas, head of the Electoral Observation Mission of the Organization of American States, said Wednesday. Mexico will hold its general election on June 2, when nearly 100 million people will be called to vote. There are 20,375 positions on the ballot, of which 19,746 are local and 629 are federal, including the presidency.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/americas/mexico-electoral-violence-spikes-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_africa_south-africa-election-results-intl", "text": "South Africa\u2019s ruling African National Congress party is set to fall short of a majority\u00a0for the first time in 30 years after national elections this week, marking the biggest political shift in the country since the end of apartheid. With results in from 90% of voting districts as of 5.10 pm ET, support for the ANC was at 41.04%. The official opposition party, the centrist Democratic Alliance (DA), had 21.72% of the vote. Behind them were two ANC splinter parties: the newly formed uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK), led by Zuma, had 13.69% of the votes, and the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) had 9.46%, data from the country\u2019s electoral commission showed. Fed-up voters\u00a0dealt the party of Nelson Mandela a seismic blow at the polls after\u00a0years of corruption scandals and economic mismanagement.\u00a0\u00a0As a result,\u00a0the ANC will be forced to form a coalition to govern\u00a0the world\u2019s most unequal country. Cyril Ramaphosa, the president of South Africa and the ANC \u2013 and once Mandela\u2019s favorite to succeed him as leader \u2013 promised a \u201cnew dawn\u201d when he took over in 2018 from disgraced former president Jacob Zuma. But many feel those promises never\u00a0materialized\u00a0and the\u00a0election\u00a0results reflect\u00a0a population deeply frustrated with the country\u2019s direction. South Africans could now face weeks of political uncertainty, as the ANC seeks to strike a coalition deal with former rivals. The\u00a0rebuke to the ANC\u00a0was hardly unexpected,\u00a0mirroring widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling party.\u00a0But the scale of the losses surprised some. \u201cWhat we have seen is voters are unhappy with the ANC\u2019s recent history. In particular\u00a0what happened in the Zuma years and what followed on from that,\u201d analyst and former ANC MP Melanie Verwoerd told CNN. There has been \u201ca general arrogance and loss of connection with the general voter from the ANC side,\u201d Verwoerd said, adding that parties like MK and the EFF have capitalized on\u00a0that discontent. Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to\u00a0resign as leader in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court.\u00a0The Constitutional Court barred the\u00a082-year-old\u00a0\u00a0from running for parliament\u00a0in May, but\u00a0his face remained on the MK party ballot. ANC in uncharted territory Substantial bargaining will likely begin once the final results are declared.\u00a0Political parties will have two weeks to form a coalition government before a new parliament must convene to elect the nation\u2019s president.\u00a0If they fail, new elections will need to be held. \u201cI have no sympathy for Mr. Ramaphosa and his party,\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen told CNN during an interview at the election\u2019s National Results Center. \u201cIt is their spinelessness to deal with the prospect of Mr. Zuma and his sins of omission and commission that has led to him being a political force now that has come and wiped them out in places like KwaZulu-Natal and other parts of the country.\u201d The populous coastal eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, where the major city of Durban is located, has traditionally been a stronghold of the conservative Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). Zuma has faced\u00a0hundreds of corruption, fraud and racketeering charges\u00a0over the years. He has always denied all of them and became known as the \u201cTeflon President\u201d because few politicians could have survived the scandals he has faced and weathered. Analysts CNN spoke to, including Verwoerd,\u00a0believe the most likely coalition is between the ANC and DA. But others are more sceptical of that outcome.\u00a0They all agree that the country is in uncharted territory. Steenhuisen told CNN he wants to be part of a governing coalition and he believes a coalition \u201ccan work.\u201d Before\u00a0the election, the DA had already formed a\u00a0bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. What he labels a \u201cdoomsday coalition\u201d is one of the other options on the table: a deal between the ANC-EFF\u00a0or\u00a0even\u00a0the\u00a0MK. But with such disdain inside those breakaway parties for\u00a0Ramaphosa, it would be quite some negotiation. The EFF is led by\u00a0former ANC youth leader Julius Malema. It espouses the expropriation of land without compensation and sweeping state nationalism.\u00a0The MK party\u2019s manifesto\u00a0holds\u00a0broadly\u00a0similar ideas and demands\u00a0an overhaul of the country\u2019s constitution\u00a0to restore more powers to traditional leaders. Not since the dawn of democracy in 1994 has South Africa\u2019s political landscape been so unclear. But\u00a0some analysts believe \u2013 despite the uncertainty \u2013\u00a0that\u00a0the results of this election could be a win for democracy. \u201cIt\u00a0is probably a maturity in the democracy, we needed change and it is never good to have such a one-party dominance in a country,\u201d Verwoerd said. \u201cIt might be a little bit more unstable as we go into the future. But for\u00a0democracy\u2019s\u00a0sake, it is most probably a good thing.\u201d She said that the ANC\u2019s prospects dropped dramatically under the previous president. \u201cOnce the Jacob Zuma years happened, it became pretty inevitable that there was going to be a slide,\u201d she added. A country going backwards The ANC swept to power in 1994 on a\u00a0pledge\u00a0to \u201cbuild a better life for all,\u201d winning almost 63% of the vote in the country\u2019s first democratic election. Fast forward three decades and rampant corruption, soaring joblessness, crippling\u00a0power cuts,\u00a0and feeble economic growth are severely impacting South Africans. The economy has gone backward over the past decade, evidenced by a sharp fall in living standards. According to the\u00a0World Bank, gross domestic product per capita has fallen from a peak in 2011, leaving the average South African 23% poorer. South Africa has the highest rate of unemployment in the world, according to\u00a0the\u00a0World Bank. \u00a0Inequality is also the world\u2019s worst. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the\u00a0failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Any coalition government will\u00a0be a bitter pill to swallow for the ANC and Ramaphosa,\u00a0who could soon be fighting for his political life. Leading analysts believe that the ANC was depending on its legacy too much. \u201cThe ANC was campaigning on three decades of its existence. But nobody was looking at the current president,\u201d said TK Pooe, a senior lecturer at Wits School of Governance in Johannesburg. He believes Ramaphosa is \u201cunder pressure\u201d. \u201cHistorically, it is an embarrassment for him. He always styles himself as the next Nelson Mandela,\u201d Pooe told CNN. But \u201clast recollection, Nelson Mandela never lost an election.\u201d Pooe said, with this election, voters have told the ANC three things: \u201cjobs, jobs, jobs.\u201d Whether a coalition government can deliver for the people is deeply uncertain, but one thing is clear:\u00a0South Africa and the ANC \u2013 Mandela\u2019s former liberation movement that triumphed over apartheid \u2013 will never be the same.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/africa/south-africa-election-results-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_style_stegosaurus-fossil-auction-scli-intl-scn", "text": "A Stegosaurus skeleton described as the \u201cmost complete and best preserved\u201d of its kind ever discovered is expected to fetch up to $6 million at auction this summer \u2013 but not everyone is happy about it\ufeff. The \u201cexceptional\u201d and \u201cvirtually complete\u201d dinosaur fossil, which is 11 feet tall and 20 feet long, will be sold as part of Sotheby\u2019s annual Geek Week. Paleontologists have questioned the sale of such specimens to private bidders, arguing that these finds should be preserved in museums or other public spaces. Nevertheless, that will not stop the auction of the 150-million-year-old fossil from going ahead in New York on July 17. Apex, as it has been nicknamed, is the \u201cfinest Stegosaurus specimen to come to market,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said in a press release Wednesday. It is expected to fetch between $4 million and $6 million, making it one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils ever offered up for sale, the auction house added. Characterized by its distinctive shape, the Stegosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur with a tiny head and bony plates marching down its back, ending in a spiked tail. A commercial paleontologist named Jason Cooper unearthed Apex on his private land in Colorado, and Sotheby\u2019s said it was involved in the process from the outset. The auction house collaborated closely with Cooper to \u201cdocument the entire process, from discovery and excavation to restoration, preparation, and mounting, ensuring that the documentation and sale of the specimen is handled with the highest standards and transparency.\u201d This collaboration, it said, \u201ccontinues Sotheby\u2019s legacy of pioneering Natural History auctions.\u201d Some, however, see it differently. Steve Brusatte, a professor\u00a0of paleontology and evolution at Scotland\u2019s University of Edinburgh, described the specimen as \u201can important dinosaur fossil,\u201d particularly as there are \u201cfar fewer good (Stegosaurus) skeletons than other famous dinosaurs like T. rex and Triceratops.\u201d This, according to Brusatte, is part of the reason it should not end up in private hands. \u201cIf what the auction house is saying is true, and what I\u2019m seeing in these photos is genuine, then this skeleton really does belong in a museum, where it can be conserved, studied by scientists, and put on display to inspire people from all walks of life,\u201d he said in an email to CNN Thursday. \u201cIt is a great shame when a fossil like this, which could educate and rouse the curiosity of so many people, just disappears into the mansion of an oligarch.\u201d \u201cApex\u201d was discovered in the Morrison Formation in Moffat County, Colorado - and very aptly close to the town of Dinosaur \u2013 in May 2022. It took more than a year to fully excavate the specimen, which was found to have evidence of arthritis, suggesting it lived to an advanced age, with no signs of combat or predation-related injuries. The highest bidder will receive a copy of the dinosaur\u2019s scan data, plus a full license to use any 3D data however they choose. This, according to Sotheby\u2019s, \u201cwill allow primary information about the dinosaur to remain with the specimen and promote collaboration in future research and education.\u201d Brusatte argued, however, that research and education would be best served if the fossil was owned by an institution with an expertise in dinosaurs. \u201cThe uber-wealthy will always be able to outbid museums when a dinosaur is sold on the open market, so my hope is that if there is somebody with the means to buy a fossil like this, and this fossil captures their fancy, that they donate it to a museum,\u201d said Brusatte. \u201cWhat a legacy that would be \u2014 to have your dinosaur on public display, to have your name up in lights as the donor who saved the dinosaur for science, as kids and families stroll by and gawk at this awesome creature from prehistory.\u201d London\u2019s Natural History Museum is home to \u201cSophie,\u201d a comparable fossil - though \u201cApex\u201d is at least 30% bigger, according to Sotheby\u2019s. Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby\u2019s global head of science and popular culture, described Apex as \u201csimply one of the best fossils of its kind ever unearthed.\u201d Visitors to Sotheby\u2019s New York galleries will be able to see Apex as part of a free exhibition of some of the items on sale during Geek Week. Sotheby\u2019s \u201clegacy of pioneering Natural History auctions,\u201d as it refers to it, includes the 2022 sale of an ancient skeleton of a Gorgosaurus, which sold for just over $6 million. It also sold the first standalone T Rex skull with \u201cMaximus\u201d in December 2022. Stan, the world\u2019s most complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton, set a new world record in 2020 when it sold for $31.8 million at Christie\u2019s. At the time of sale, paleontologists feared the fossil was lost to science, but in March the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism revealed plans for Stan to be a star attraction at a new museum of natural history, expected to open in 2025 in Abu Dhabi, as CNN previously reported.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/style/stegosaurus-fossil-auction-scli-intl-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

The move, which was quickly called out on social media, has been labeled by some as an attempt at censorship. \u201cAs the Palestinian people are already suffering great trauma and loss due to the vengeful regime of Netanyahu it is most unfortunate that a reputable publication like VF attempts to eliminate support that I or anyone chooses to offer,\u201d Pearce told CNN in an emailed statement. \u201cPersonally I think it is a disgrace.\u201d Pearce was featured in Vanity Fair France last week as part of a series of actor portraits at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, which wrapped its 11-day stint on May 25 and where Pearce was supporting his new film \u201cThe Shrouds.\u201d Featured alongside stars like Sebastian Stan and\u00a0Bella Hadid, Pearce sported a black Yves Saint Laurent suit in his portrait, smiling straight at the camera. But social media sleuths detected an issue. A small Palestinian flag pin, which Pearce had been wearing on his lapel throughout Cannes, was missing from the photograph, though a different photo, featuring the pin, was posted to the magazine\u2019s Instagram the same day the article published. A white, red, black and green bracelet \u2014 the colors of the Palestinian flag \u2014 was still visible on his wrist. The sleuthing went viral on sites like X and TikTok, prompting the magazine to replace the un-edited photo and issue a correction to the article.

Carlo Acutis \u2013 whose computing skill helped him spread the message of the Catholic Church and earned him the nickname \u201cGod\u2019s Influencer\u201d - died from leukemia in 2006 aged 15. A second miracle attributed to Acutis has been recognized by Pope Francis, paving the way for him to be made a saint. Candidates normally need to have two miracles attributed to them before they can be canonized. Speaking to CNN, his mother, Antonia Salzano, said that the news of the approval of the second miracle was a \u201cgreat joy\u201d, and that Carlo is a \u201csign of hope\u201d who shows that holiness is possible today. \u201cAs I did: you too can become holy\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cNevertheless, [with] all the media the technologies it seems sometimes that holiness is something that belongs to the past. Instead, holiness is also something nowadays in this modern time.\u201d She said her son was bought a PlayStation when he was eight, but limited himself to one hour a week of gaming as he was wary that it could become addictive and that he knew the \u201cdangers of the internet\u201d. Along with his computing and gaming, Carlo played the saxophone, enjoyed soccer, loved animals and would make short, humorous films of his dogs. Ms Salzano said her son used his computer skills \u201cnot to do things for earning money or to become famous but to spread the Gospel [the message of Jesus Christ], to help people,\u201d and was \u201cfull of joy.\u201d While he had similar interests to other kids, the soon-to-be-saint was unafraid to stand out from the crowd. His mother said that the age of nine the youngster spent time helping the homeless in Milan and giving his pocket money to those sleeping on the streets. She explained that he insisted on only having one pair of shoes, so he could save money to help the poor. He was also unafraid to stand up for the victims of bullying and resist peer pressure. According to Nicola Gori, author of\u00a0\u2018Carlo Acutis: The First Millennial Saint\u2019\u00a0and the postulator (guide) of his sainthood cause, Acutis once defended a girl from India who was targeted for wearing a sari, and he was known at school for his \u201ccheerfulness, energy, generosity.\u201d He was devoted to Saint Francis, the saint renowned for poverty, humility and care for creation, and the pope\u2019s namesake. Paolo Rodari, an Italian journalist who wrote a book about Acutis with Ms Salzano, told CNN that Acutis was a \u201cnormal guy\u201d who served others including the \u201cmany needy people who slept on the streets of Milan. To them he gave everything.\u201d Acutis became ill in early 2006 and was later diagnosed with Leukemia: he died on October 12. At his funeral two days later, a large crowd gathered with many of them immigrants to Italy and those belonging to a variety of religions. Devotion to Carlo quickly began to spread across the world, and his story was taken up by several Catholic youth groups.

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

As she came to, she heard the rumble of cascading water and remembered where she was: lying in a sleeping bag, inside a tent pitched by Iguazu Falls \u2013 at the precipice of a sixteen-week camping trip across South America. \u201cI guess it\u2019s all real,\u201d Meryl thought. The night before, Meryl had sat up all night with Tim Rivett, one of the drivers on the trip. All the other travelers had gone to bed. But Meryl and Tim had talked all evening, into the early hours, gradually shuffling closer and closer to one another. \u201cWe\u2019re on the campsite, there are beautiful waterfalls all around. And we\u2019re sitting in front of the truck. We\u2019ve just been talking all night,\u201d Meryl tells CNN Travel today. It was around 2 a.m. when Tim looked at Meryl and said: \u201cDo you want to get married at the end of this trip?\u2019\u201d Without missing a beat, Meryl replied: \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d She and Tim laughed, neither quite believing what they\u2019d just agreed to. But then Tim turned serious. \u201cNo really,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me tomorrow.\u201d Now it was tomorrow. Meryl still couldn\u2019t quite believe the conversation had actually happened. But she felt just as sure as she had at 2 a.m.: she wanted to marry Tim Rivett. And she felt absolutely certain she would. So Meryl wriggled out of her sleeping bag, pulled on a jacket, peered out of her tent door and glanced around the campsite. A handful of people were walking about, grabbing breakfast, pulling on hiking boots. Meryl spotted Tim among them, and headed his way. \u201cI just said to him: \u2018Yeah, okay, I\u2019ll do it,\u2019\u201d says Meryl. In response, Tim just grinned. That was that. It was settled. And while it had only been five days, Meryl felt certain Tim was \u201cthe right person.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d dated other people, and I just never clicked with them,\u201d she says today. \u201cBut we instantly clicked.\u201d An adventure in South America When Meryl and Tim crossed paths in September 1981, Meryl was 29. She\u2019d graduated college in Florida in the mid-seventies and spent the last several years prioritizing travel. Meryl had a pattern \u2013 she\u2019d work for a bit in the US, save every cent, and then head off on adventures. One year she bought an Eurail pass and backpacked around Europe. Another time she spent months on a double-decker bus heading from London to Kathmandu. She\u2019d also traveled solo to Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia. While in Australia, Meryl befriended a woman from Queensland: Karen. The two stayed in touch, and then, in 1981, Karen convinced Meryl to join her on a camping adventure in South America. Meryl agreed. She decided South America would be her final big adventure \u2013 she\u2019d round off her twenties in style, and then settle down properly into corporate America. \u201cI\u2019ll do one more trip before I find a real job,\u2019\u201d Meryl recalls thinking. Meryl and Karen booked the trip with UK-based company Encounter Overland, which operated from the mid-1960s to the early 2000s and ran overland adventure expeditions for travelers, usually in ex-army trucks. Meryl and Karen met the rest of the group in Rio de Janeiro. There were 20 travelers in total, including Meryl and Karen, as well as two drivers who operated the truck and ran the show. Meryl had noticed on her previous travels that generally \u201call the drivers were pretty decent looking.\u201d Plus, it was the kind of job that attracted natural leaders who tended to \u201call have personality.\u201d These two, Meryl felt, were no different. But one of the guys, in particular, stood out to her: \u201cHe had long hair and a beard. And he was sitting in a chair. I thought he was kind of cute.\u201d The driver introduced himself as Tim Rivett, 27, from England. Tim was an art school graduate who\u2019d worked for Encounter Overland for a few years. He\u2019d driven travelers across Asia \u2013 often through Nepal and around India \u2013 but the 1981 trip marked his first time working in South America. Tim loved his job. He was in charge of route planning, maintaining the vehicle, finding the camping spots and ensuring the travelers had a great time. It was hard work but always exciting. Tim noticed Meryl right away too. \u201cI remember commenting to my co-driver and saying, \u2018Yeah, I like that girl,\u2019\u201d Tim tells CNN Travel today. But there wasn\u2019t much time for talking that first day. So the travelers stuffed their backpacks and tents into the truck, and the group set off on the first leg of the trip. \u201cThe first couple of days of a trip like that are pretty hectic,\u201d says Tim. \u201cWe had to train the group in the routines of setting up camp every night, and getting them organized and working as a team.\u201d But even during those busy few days, Tim and Meryl gravitated towards one another. \u201cWhenever things settled down in the evening, Meryl and I just used to hang out and chit chat,\u201d says Tim. \u201cWe just found ourselves getting on well \u2013 really well \u2013 together.\u201d Each night, the two would chat for hours \u2013 about everything and anything. \u201cWe talked a lot about our previous travels and experiences as well as a shared interest in art,\u201d recalls Tim. \u201cMeryl had been at Florida State studying photography and I had a degree in fine art.\u201d The two also discussed their respective home countries. Meryl knew England \u2013 but not the small town in the countryside where Tim hailed from. And when she talked about growing up in Miami, she and Tim were struck by their vastly different childhood experiences. By the time the group got to Iguazu Falls, on the border between Brazil and Argentina, Meryl already felt she was falling for Tim. It was happening both \u201cgradually\u201d and \u201cquickly.\u201d She\u2019d known him only five days, but it felt longer. Tim felt the same way. \u201cI was struck by the ease with which we were able to talk to each other,\u201d he says. That\u2019s how Meryl and Tim ended up sitting together at Iguazu Falls in the early hours of the morning, agreeing to get married. Tim said he surprised himself when the words came out of his mouth. \u201cIt really was a life-changing thing for me to say that,\u201d he says today. He hadn\u2019t been aspiring to marriage, and wasn\u2019t even sure what marriage meant to him. He just felt certain he wanted to be with Meryl. Meryl felt that assuredness too. That\u2019s why she said \u201cyes\u201d right away. Later, when she climbed back into her tent, Meryl\u2019s friend Karen stirred. Meryl told her what had happened. \u201cYou will not believe this,\u201d she said. Karen was gobsmacked. As for Tim, he confided in his co-driver, Mike. But otherwise, Meryl and Tim kept the news quiet. But as the truck made its way across South America, the two continued to spend every moment they could together, staying up late, chatting and disclosing stories about their lives and goals. Adventures and escapades As they fell in love with one another, Meryl and Tim also fell in love with the landscapes of South America. It was special to experience new countries and new places together, and Tim was grateful it was his first time driving this route. \u201cWe liked the wildlife in Patagonia, crossing the Andes, the beauty of Colombia and the Ecuadorian rainforest,\u201d he recalls. Not everything went to plan. When Tim drove the truck across the Argentinian border, the group was unexpectedly arrested and taken to a detention center on the Paran\u00e1 River, where they were held for two days. \u201cIt was all because of the tensions between England and Argentina at that time,\u201d says Tim, adding he was driving \u201csomething that looks like an army truck with a big Union Jack on the front.\u201d It was 1981, mere months before the Falklands War. \u201cEventually, after about a week of negotiation in Buenos Aires, they let us proceed, and we were able to drive all the way down to Tierra del Fuego.\u201d When the tour party reached Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia, Tim and Meryl purchased an emerald engagement ring. At that point, \u201cthe cat was let out of the bag\u201d as Tim puts it \u2013 everyone on the trip knew of Meryl and Tim\u2019s intention to marry. As the tour party reached Chile and everyone went their own way, the fellow travelers wished Tim and Meryl the best for their life together. A new chapter together A day or two after the conversation at Iguazu Falls, Meryl had written to her parents to share the news that she was engaged. \u201cAt that time, of course, there\u2019s no way to call anybody \u2013 we\u2019re in the middle of nowhere,\u201d says Meryl. But unbeknownst to Meryl, this letter never made it to the US. She eventually got hold of her parents via a payphone in Chile. \u201cI\u2019m coming home, and then I\u2019m going to get married,\u201d Meryl told them. Meryl\u2019s parents were surprised, but excited for her. Meryl told them how she and Tim had fallen in love over the course of the trip, explaining they were intending their upcoming wedding to be small, low-key \u2013 just a handful of guests. Coincidentally, Meryl\u2019s sister Lisa was also engaged, with a wedding organized for early 1982. Meryl\u2019s mother had taken the lead with that planning, and so she told Meryl she\u2019d handle this wedding, too. \u201cMeryl\u2019s mother just sort of ran with the thing, and doubled up,\u201d recalls Tim. \u201cShe double booked everybody \u2013 same florist, same hotel, same band, same officiant, just repeated everything a couple of months after Lisa got married.\u201d This meant Meryl and Tim\u2019s wedding day in April 1982 \u201cturned out to be a really pretty big wedding in a pretty fancy hotel on Miami Beach,\u201d as Tim recalls. Meryl and Tim didn\u2019t mind that the celebration was more elaborate than they\u2019d envisioned \u2013 it was a wonderful day, and fantastic to celebrate with all their loved ones. Tim\u2019s best man, Paul, was a friend he\u2019d made on the South America camping trip, who\u2019d been there when Tim was falling for Meryl. And Tim\u2019s parents were also there, enjoying getting to know their new American family. As for Meryl \u2013 who took Tim\u2019s name that day, becoming Meryl Rivett \u2013 she recalls an overwhelmingly feeling of excitement on her wedding day. She felt ready for her and Tim to transition from enjoying vacation romance \u201cto real life.\u201d Initially, Meryl and Tim weren\u2019t sure whether they\u2019d live in the US or the UK, but a stint in England post-wedding made up their minds. \u201cI just went nuts with the rain and the gloom,\u201d says Meryl, laughing. \u201cI said, \u2018I can\u2019t live here.\u2019\u201d As for Tim, he was happy to move to the US \u2013 his years of traveling meant he could get accustomed to anywhere pretty quickly. Meryl and Tim had known each other less than a year when they got married, but they didn\u2019t encounter any difficulties as they adapted to life together and put down roots in Florida. Meryl puts this down to the fact they were both pretty mature. They were still young, but not super young \u2013 and they\u2019d both traveled a lot, had lots of different experiences. And, she adds, they were just compatible. The ease they\u2019d felt those first few days in South America never left, only cemented as the years rolled on. \u201cIt was really easy to work things out,\u201d she says. \u201cWe never seemed to have any kind of issues.\u201d The couple settled into new jobs and routines, but still made time for travel \u2013 from annual trips back to the UK to see Tim\u2019s family to adventures in Central America and Australia. Four decades together In April 2024, Meryl and Tim celebrated their 42nd wedding anniversary. Their four decades together have been defined by \u201cbeing with each other, sharing goals and open dialogue,\u201d as Tim puts it. They still spend their evenings talking for hours, often about their many shared interests \u2013 Tim and Meryl share a passion for getting outdoors, and love going hiking, boating and cycling. They\u2019re also are enthusiastic amateur photographers. And they\u2019re big dog-lovers. Meryl and Tim remain good friends with Meryl\u2019s Aussie friend Karen, who they\u2019ve visited in Australia and met up with in the US. And Tim went to the wedding of his Encounter Overland co-driver Mike, who \u2013 coincidentally \u2013 also married one of his passengers. Four decades on, Meryl and Tim still enjoy telling the tale of how they met. \u201cI like to share the story,\u201d says Meryl, \u201cI think it\u2019s so different.\u201d People always love hearing it too, adds Tim \u2013 especially when they learn Tim and Meryl got engaged after only five days. \u201cIt just sounds like a movie script or something \u2013 they just almost don\u2019t believe it,\u201d Tim says. \u201cIt\u2019s only from talking to us more that they realize that it all just did happen like that.\u201d Looking back, the couple struggle to remember exactly what was going through their heads when they decided to get married so quickly. But they\u2019ve never once regretted their decision. Tim and Meryl still feel just as certain in their choices all these years later. \u201cI think sometimes people wait too long to make a decision,\u201d says Meryl. \u201cYou hear the stories about people who\u2019ve been engaged for so many years. They\u2019ve been dating for so many years. Why did you wait years?\u201d Five days is the other end of the spectrum, admits Meryl, laughing. But looking back, she thinks it was truly \u201clove at first sight.\u201d And while Meryl and Tim aren\u2019t sure, exactly, what marriage meant to them in the early 1980s, today they feel certain. It is, says Tim, simply \u201cthe comfort of having a lifelong companion.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/proposal-five-days-south-america-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_tech_ai-iphone", "text": "Imagine asking Apple\u2019s Siri to show you an old photo taken from a child\u2019s second birthday, or summarizing lengthy emails and writing drafts. Then consider Siri learning your schedule, preferences, even your personality, so it can better communicate with you throughout the day. Generative AI, artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions and prompts, could potentially breathe new life into Apple\u2019s iPhone lineup at a time when competitors are threatening to leave the company behind in the race to shape what could be a world-changing technology. The company is widely expected to partner with ChatGPT maker OpenAI ahead of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where it will likely show off its first batch of AI tools coming to the iOS software. Although artificial intelligence has powered some of the iPhone\u2019s experiences for years, such as Live Text and improved autocorrect, generative AI could unlock new levels of interaction and personalization. All this during a time when the company is under pressure to catch up to rivals such as Google and Samsung, which are already using the technology in its smartphones. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call in early May, noting there would be news announced in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d Apple is not always first to adopt to emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect them for years before including them in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology. The debut of an AI iPhone could also entice consumers to upgrade at a time when they\u2019ve been holding onto older models longer. Apple reported first-quarter revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% year over year, as the tech giant continues to struggle with growth challenges, particularly in China, amid an uncertain economic environment. Now all eyes shift to Apple for its take on generative AI. Here\u2019s how that could play out on the iPhone: A much smarter assissant Although it\u2019s unclear what exactly an iPhone in the generative AI world would look like, experts largely believe the biggest entrypoint is through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record. Integration with OpenAI\u2019s latest ChatGPT-4o model could catapult Siri years forward, essentially turning the feature into an iPhone chatbot. This would enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and even personality, and respond accordingly. Looking at how competitors have already introduced generative tools, the iPhone will also likely assist users with other tasks, such as offering to summarize and draft emails, or starting an online purchase return process. Samsung\u2019s \u201ccircle to search\u201d feature, which allows users to quickly search for information on a device\u2019s screen with a finger gesture, has received a lot of attention and is featured in marketing campaigns. Multimodal features \u2013 which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time \u2014 like analysis of video footage and in-call spam detection could also form part of the tools, according to Paul Schell, industry analyst at tech intelligence firm ABI Research. \u201cSomething similar would likely be included in an Apple offering, given its relative simplicity and appeal that goes beyond simple image search,\u201d Schell said. \u201cBut verbal interactions with a bot like Siri will be much more natural and fluent, and its capabilities will go far beyond the previous, narrow domains, like news and weather updates.\u201d An AI iPhone could also adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues. \u201cGenerative AI will allow the next generations of iPhones to become a sixth sense, empowering us to scan and interact with the world around us,\u201d said Thomas Husson, an analyst with market research firm Forrester. Generative AI will also likely change Apple\u2019s whole ecosystem by embedding it through its own apps, such as Apple Maps, iMovie and iPhoto, and release tools for developers for brands to develop new experiences through their own apps. Expediting AI Behind the scenes, Apple reportedly has been working on its on-device generative AI capabilities and acquiring companies for awhile, such as Canadian startup DarwinAI. It also has a machine learning research division dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence.  But after the launch of ChatGPT ignited an AI arms race in late 2022, followed by companies such as Google, Microsoft and Meta heavily pouring resources into developing related tools, Apple has remained relatively quiet about its visions for an AI-powered future. Nabila Popal, a senior research director at market research firm IDC, said the pressure to be part of the conversation likely moved up the company\u2019s timeline. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported Apple was closing in on a deal with OpenAI to use its ChatGPT technology on iPhones, after holding similar talks with Google. \u201cApple normally takes their time and doesn\u2019t let the Android race rush [impact its moves], be it with foldables or 5G or even augmented and virtual reality,\u201d Popal said. \u201cAnd Apple then comes out and does it better than anyone else.\u201d \u201cHowever this time, with AI, it is different,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Apple is being forced to show its hand early.\u201d She said consumers are considering AI capabilities of greater importance than any other feature when choosing their premium device, especially in China, where Apple is losing its marketshare. \u201cIt\u2019s not just because of the resurgence of Huawei but also because of \u2018lack of AI\u2019 in their devices,\u201d she said. \u201cChinese consumers want more from their premium phones.\u201d During its most recent iPad event, Apple reminded onlookers that it\u2019s been using artificial intelligence in its products for years, including a neural processing engine to support its A11 bionic chip. But now it needs to show it\u2019s going all in on artificial intelligence to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industry. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a question about whether or not Apple will announce something around generative AI, but Apple has to if they want to achieve growth in this highly competitive and innovative smartphone market, especially in China. \u2026 AI is one train Apple can\u2019t afford to miss.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/tech/ai-iphone/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_tech_south-korea-samsung-union-strike-pay-negotiations-hnk-intl", "text": "A labor union representing tens of thousands of workers at Samsung Electronics in South Korea has called a one-day strike next week, in what would be the first such walkout at the smartphone and chipmaking giant. The Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) said on Wednesday during a press conference streamed on its official Youtube channel that its 28,000 members \u2014 just under a quarter of the company\u2019s total workforce in the country \u2014 would strike on June 7, following failed negotiations over pay and bonus arrangements. \u201cWe can no longer afford to see a company that has no will to negotiate,\u201d union representatives said, adding \u201cwe will fight for workers\u2019 rights and interests.\u201d Son Woomok, a union leader, told CNN that many NSEU members worked for Samsung\u2019s flagship semiconductor unit. \u201cWe are demanding transparent and fair performance bonuses and wage increases,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere has never been a proper wage negotiation. It has always been carried out by announcing the (outcome) at the labor-management council, which does not include our union, and the company telling us to accept it,\u201d he added. In a statement to CNN, a Samsung spokesperson said: \u201cThe company remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union, and is making every sincere effort to come to an agreement.\u201d The world\u2019s biggest memory chipmaker has had a rough few years. A historic shortage\u00a0of computer chips during the Covid pandemic was followed by falling demand last year as consumer appetite for electronics remained weak because of global economic uncertainty. In January, Samsung reported an operating profit of just 6.567 trillion won ($4.8 billion) for 2023, its weakest annual performance since 2009, according to the Wall Street Journal. Samsung also lost its crown as the top smartphone maker globally. But things are looking up for the company because of  the AI boom. It is optimistic about a resurgence in demand for mobile devices this year, particularly with the rollout of new products, such as AI-powered smartphones. Last month, Samsung reported a more than 10-fold rise in first-quarter operating profit amid forecasts of high demand for AI and high-end chips, an area in which it competes with Intel (INTC) and Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. The vast majority of the world\u2019s advanced microchips are made in just two places: Taiwan and South Korea. Taiwan\u2019s industry is larger and more dominant, something South Korea is keen to challenge.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/tech/south-korea-samsung-union-strike-pay-negotiations-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-american-sentencing-tuesday", "text": "American Tyler Wenrich was sentenced to three weeks in jail and fined Tuesday after he pleaded guilty earlier this month to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. The Virginia resident was fined $9,000, Kimo Tynes, the director of communications for the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, said in a statement. Since he had already served three weeks in jail, the court recognized it as time served, so his prison sentence is complete, the release said. The 31-year-old American faced as much as a 12-year prison sentence. But the Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case and said, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Wenrich returned to Virginia on Thursday, arriving at the Richmond International Airport, CNN affiliate WWBT reported. Another American charged with possession of ammunition, Ryan Tyler Watson, pleaded guilty Tuesday, according to Tynes. Watson\u2019s sentencing is scheduled for June 21. Watson and Wenrich are among five Americans arrested in Turks and Caicos in recent months, all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. Bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden,\u201d according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from its government. In the Turks and Caicos, possession of firearms or ammunition carries a minimum 12-year sentence, though the law allows reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d  Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Misick said. Meanwhile, the United States has\u00a0more guns than people. On Friday, American Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty and received a 52-week sentence\u00a0suspended for one year\u00a0and a $6,700 fine, his representatives said. He returned to the United States after paying the fine. In addition to Hagerich and Wenrich, one other American \u2013 Michael Lee Evans \u2013 pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the territory\u2019s government. Evans was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, attorney Oliver Smith told CNN. The rest remain in Turks and Caicos. A fifth American, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, with the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. The mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms or ammunition is in place to protect those on the islands, and judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences, Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick said Thursday. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date.

With results in from 22% of polling stations at 4 p.m. local time, support for the ANC stood at 43.5%. The official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), had 24.7% of the vote, while the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) \u2013 a splinter party of the ANC \u2013 had 8.9%, data from the country\u2019s electoral commission showed. The respected research group CSIR modeled the ANC winning less than 45% of the national poll as of mid-morning on Thursday. Officials of the Independent Electoral Commission have stressed that the official tally could take several days and some larger voting wards could take more time to be tallied. In past elections, results from rural areas \u2013 where the ANC has major strongholds \u2013 have come in later, boosting results for the party. Once all the votes are counted, if the ANC remains below 50% it will be forced to enter a coalition with one or more parties. Depending on how low its support dips, it may need to form a deal with one of the larger opposition parties such as the DA or EFF to remain in power. Another ANC splinter party, the uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK), led by former President Jacob Zuma appears to be on course to do well in KwaZulu-Natal, the eastern coastal province where Durban is located. At 10am local time, it had 42.3% of the votes there compared to 20.1% for the ANC. Zuma \u2013 a fierce critic of current ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa \u2013 was forced to\u00a0resign as leader in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court. The 82-year-old was\u00a0barred from running for parliament\u00a0last week after the country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled that five years must have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. However, his face remained on the ballot. South Africa\u2019s electoral commission has seven days to declare the final results by law. However, they are usually announced sooner than that. This year, the commission has set Sunday, June 2, as the final results day. If the ANC does lose its majority, it will have 14 days once the final results are declared to form a new government before a new parliament must convene to elect the nation\u2019s president.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/africa/early-results-released-in-south-africas-election-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Philippine president was asked by a member of the audience whether a \u201cred line\u201d would be crossed if Chinese Coast Guard ships, which have frequently deployed water cannons against Philippine vessels in recent months, ended up killing a Filipino sailor. \u201cIf a Filipino citizen is killed by a willful act, that is, I think, very, very close to what we define as an act of war and therefore we will respond accordingly,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd our treaty partners, I believe, also hold that same standard,\u201d he added. China has increasingly pushed its territorial claims in the South China Sea, and China Coast Guard ships, reinforced by maritime militia boats, have been involved in a series of fraught clashes over the last year that has seen Philippine ships damaged and Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. With confrontations increasingly souring the Beijing-Manila relationship, Marcos has sought out closer ties with the United States, with which the Philippines maintains a mutual defense treaty. As part of that relationship, the US has gained increased rights to use Philippine military bases and the two allies have expanded bilateral military exercises. US officials consistently say the mutual defense pact is \u201ciron-clad\u201d and Philippine naval, coast guard and civilian vessels are covered by it. That raises the prospect that should one of the many maritime clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the South China Sea turn deadly, it could pile pressure on Washington to support its ally \u2013 and even drag the US military into a conflict. \u201cWe already have suffered injury. But thank God we have not yet gotten to the point where any of our participants, civilian or otherwise have been killed,\u201d Marcos said, referring to increasingly fraught clashes with China\u2019s coast guard ships. \u201cBut once we get to that point (a fatality)\u2026 we would certainly have crossed the Rubicon. Is that a red line? Almost certainly it is going to be a red line,\u201d he said. Key global waterway China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea \u2013 one of the world\u2019s busiest waterways. But portions of it are also claimed by governments in Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan as well as the Philippines. In 2016, in a case brought by the Philippines, an international tribunal in the Hague ruled that China\u2019s claim to historic rights to the bulk of the sea had no legal basis. But Beijing has rejected the tribunal\u2019s ruling and continued its military buildup, with many features lying hundreds of miles away from China\u2019s mainland. It also maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels \u2013 which has frequently stoked tensions with its neighbors. Marcos addressed the dispute multiple times in his speech. \u201cIllegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions continue to violate our sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction,\u201d he said, adding that the Philippines would defend it\u2019s sovereignty to \u201cthe last square millimeter.\u201d \u201cThe life-giving waters of the West Philippine Sea flow in the blood of every Filipino. We cannot allow anyone to detach it from the totality of the maritime domain that renders our nation whole,\u201d he added. In the past week, Marcos has been raising concerns over a new Chinese policy that give its coast guard new powers of detention in Chinese-claimed areas of the South China Sea, including areas that lie within the Philippines Exclusive Economic Zone. Meanwhile, the Philippine Navy said it is prepared to protect the rights of Filipinos and would be increasing patrols in the South China Sea, including the areas of contested sovereignty, according to the PNA. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said earlier this week that the new regulations are \u201cin line with common international practices.\u201d \u201cAs long as there is no illegal behavior by any individual or entity, there is no need to worry,\u201d spokesperson Mao Ning said. \u201cWhat I want to emphasize is that it is not China but the Philippines that has frequently escalated the situation in the South China Sea,\u201d Ning added. In his speech Marcos also warned that growing rivalry between the United States and China was impacting the entire Asia-Pacific region. \u201cThe strategic competition between China and the United States is permeating the evolving regional landscape. This rivalry is constraining the strategic choices of regional states. This contest is exacerbating flashpoints, it has created new security dilemmas,\u201d Marcos told delegates. \u201cThe continued stability of this region requires China and the United States to manage that rivalry in a responsible manner,\u201d he added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/asia/shangrila-dialogue-philippines-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

MSF reported that one of its colleagues, a watchman at the organization\u2019s pharmacy, was killed when shelling hit his house near the city\u2019s main market while he was off duty. \u201cWe urge the warring parties to do more to protect civilians, who\u2014like our valued colleague\u2014are among those losing their lives,\u201d the group stated. Many MSF staff members have lost family members or homes during the shelling. Since the fighting began more than two weeks ago, the group said it has treated 979 people. The violence in North Darfur has intensified as the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF) encircle El Fasher. The fighting also affects thousands of displaced people who have fled to El Fasher from the other four Darfur states now controlled by the RSF. According to UNICEF, at least 500,000 people sheltering in the city have been displaced by violence elsewhere in Sudan. Food, medicine, and other vital supplies are scarce, and food assistance deliveries in Darfur are limited. The World Food Program reports that 1.7 million people in the region are experiencing emergency levels of hunger. A report from the Yale School of Public Health\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab on May 15 confirmed \u201csignificant conflict-related damage in the eastern and southeastern neighborhoods of El Fasher city between 10 \u2013 14 May.\u201d The report is consistent with accounts that the RSF and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) \u201chave engaged in expanded and repeated ground fighting and bombardment in\u201d the city, the Yale report added. Civil war in Sudan between the SAF and RSF broke out in April 2023.

{"id": "2024_05_29_weather_texas-dallas-houston-storm-power-outages", "text": "Hundreds of thousands of Texans are without power and many could be in the dark for several days after fierce and deadly storms tore through the state Tuesday and over the holiday weekend, leaving people to pick up the pieces of devastated homes and businesses amid uncomfortably hot weather. More than 280,000 utility customers in Texas were without power as of Wednesday evening, including more than 150,000 in Dallas County alone, according to PowerOutage.us. Both Houston and Dallas were slammed with hurricane-force winds Tuesday as violent storms flooded roads, upended trees and power lines and reduces some buildings to shells of their former selves. The winds collapsed an under-construction home in Magnolia, Texas, killing a 16-year-old working inside of it, according to the Montgomery County Sheriff\u2019s Office. At least eight people have been killed in the state since Saturday as severe weather pummeled the region over Memorial Day weekend. The violent weather is just the latest in an unrelenting series of severe storms that has battered Texas in recent weeks, leaving residents with little time to recover from one storm before the next arrives at their doorstep. Summerlike heat will ease across Texas this week following a sweltering heat wave, but those left without power or a reliable way to cool down could still face the risk of dangerous heat stroke or heat exhaustion. Temperatures across eastern Texas on Wednesday will hover around the mid-80s to low 90s, according to the National Weather Service. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins warned people to prepare to be without power for days as an area utility company reported extensive damage to its infrastructure. The utility, Oncor, shared photos of mangled electricity poles, twisted power lines and massive toppled trees. Widespread outages also hampered primary runoff elections on Tuesday in Dallas County, as more than a third of polling locations were in the dark, according to Jenkins. \u201cCheck on your friends, family, and neighbors, especially anyone elderly,\u201d Dallas County officials advised. \u201cDon\u2019t move debris yet as there could be hidden downed power lines that could still be energized.\u201d Esmeralda Martinez, who lives in the Dallas suburb of Carrollton, is among those now sifting through homes that were reduced to piles of soggy debris and jagged wooden beams, CNN affiliate WFAA reports. She and her family sheltered in a hallway as the storm tore off the roof, damaging every room in her home and soaking their belongings. Across the street, Javon Holloway and his grandmother are grateful their home was spared from more serious damage. The neighbors are thankful no one was harmed. \u201cDon\u2019t take your house for granted. I\u2019ll say that much. Be thankful for what you got,\u201d Holloway told WFAA. Storms continued moving across north and central Texas on Tuesday night and are expected to last through Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service in Fort Worth said. After a brief reprieve, another round of powerful storms will rumble back into the same area Thursday evening, bringing a threat of large hail, damaging winds and localized flooding to the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Houston faces damage d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu Houston-area residents are facing an all-too-familar feeling as they survey the fresh layer of damage left by Tuesday\u2019s storms \u2013 just two weeks after a derecho and a tornado bulldozed through the city, killing multiple people and knocking out power for nearly 1 million homes and businesses. Though 99% of those outages had been restored as of last week, more than 300,000 homes and businesses in the Houston area lost power in Tuesday\u2019s storms, according to the regional utility CenterPoint Energy. A majority of its customers had power restored by Wednesday morning. The latest severe weather also thwarted some of the city\u2019s ongoing recovery after the mid-May storm covered streets with trees and debris, shattered skyscraper windows and damaged buildings. That damage had not yet been fully repaired when Tuesday\u2019s storms tore through, rescattering piles of debris that crews had been collecting off the streets and sending another shower of broken window glass onto Downtown Houston, according to CNN affiliates KTRK and KHOU.

On Tuesday, 93 congressmen voted in favor of banning bullfighting \u2013 with only two against it \u2013 sending the bill to President Gustavo Petro for final approval. Petro, the country\u2019s first leftist president, celebrated the victory on X, writing: \u201cCongratulations to those who managed that death will no longer be a show.\u201d Once signed into law, there will\u00a0be a three-year transition period to help families depending on the sport to find new sources of income.

{"id": "2024_05_30_americas_haiti-david-natalie-lloyd-bodies-returned-intl", "text": "The first US commercial flight to Haitian capital Port-au-Prince in months made a bleak roundtrip on Thursday morning, returning with the bodies of a young American couple who were killed by a gang last week. The remains of Davy and Natalie Lloyd were accompanied in an American Airlines jet by US Ambassador to Haiti Dennis Hankins and US security agents, according to a source with knowledge of the operation. After flying from Haiti to Miami, they will be sent onward to their families. \u201cThis morning, the remains of Davy and Natalie Lloyd safely took off on a flight back to the United States \u2014 there will be a series of layovers, and they will safely reach Neosho, Missouri tomorrow afternoon,\u201d read a statement posted by their families on the X account of Natalie\u2019s father, Missouri State Rep. Ben Baker, requesting privacy during the transfer. \u201cWe are praising the Lord for his hand of protection over this nightmare. Funeral services will be early next week, with more details to come tomorrow,\u201d the statement also said. Their return follows a week of extraordinary negotiation between the US government and Haitian authorities, local organizations and even gang leaders, sources say \u2013 all in a city crippled by the criminal groups that have shut off the import of vital humanitarian supplies, destroyed medical facilities and blocked key roads. A State Department spokesperson told CNN that it had been working \u201caround the clock\u201d to assist in arranging the return, and on Thursday afternoon confirmed that both bodies had arrived in the United States. This month\u2019s reopening of Toussaint Louverture International Airport \u2013 a former target for coordinated gang attacks \u2013 marks an important step in connecting Haiti\u2019s capital city to the rest of the world, after months of violence in the gang-ravaged Caribbean nation. Local carrier Sunrise resumed flights earlier in May. But the progress has been overshadowed by last week\u2019s killing of three missionaries \u2013 the Lloyds and Haitian mission director Jude Montis \u2013 in a high-profile incident that attracted the close attention of US officials and the White House. The three were attacked in the early evening at the Missions in Haiti church and orphanage compound in Port-au-Prince\u2019s Lizon neighborhood, in what began as an armed robbery by one gang that left their compound rampaged and their supplies and aid stolen. A second gang later arrived on the scene and came under fire, precipitating a deadly retribution against mission staff, according to Davy Lloyd\u2019s father and Missions in Haiti founder David Lloyd, who was on the phone with his son that evening. Montis and the Lloyds barricaded themselves inside their residence on the compound, but it was not enough, Lloyd told CNN. Missions in Haiti\u00a0announced their deaths that night. US officials mobilize to recover bodies In the frantic hours following the attack, staffers from the office of Missouri US Rep. Eric Burlison, Missouri US\u00a0Sen. Josh Hawley\u00a0and the US National Security Council reached out to the State Department and US Embassy in Haiti. \u201cAs soon as I found out about the situation, we immediately reached out to the State Department to try and get assistance. Unfortunately, aid was not able to get there in time to prevent the tragedy,\u201d Burlison said in a statement to CNN. \u201cSince their murder we\u2019ve been working closely with Sen. Hawley\u2019s office, State Department, and airlines to bring them home to their families,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to thank everyone who is helping in these efforts.\u201d Natalie Lloyd\u2019s mother, Naomi Baker, is a staffer in Burlison\u2019s office and her father, Ben Baker, is a state representative in Missouri. After the shock of the deaths, it became clear early on Friday morning that Davy and Natalie\u2019s bodies needed to be recovered urgently \u2013 an operation that would be carefully orchestrated by the US government, according to multiple sources. There was no time to spare. \u201cThe bodies could have been either desecrated or kidnapped,\u201d one person involved in the operation told CNN. \u201cSo we pulled them out of a crime scene.\u201d The family of Davy Lloyd contacted private ambulance service HERO Client Rescue to retrieve the bodies on Friday morning, according to a HERO staffer who requested anonymity due to concerns for their safety. The rescue group agreed to coordinate the mission and kept the US embassy updated on it, the staffer also said. But attempts to reach the site were blocked in the road by armed gang members, according to a source with knowledge of the situation, who told CNN that there was an extraordinary intervention by US officials in Haiti, who quickly acted to broker negotiations between multiple gangs in the area to clear access to the bodies. On a phone call with multiple gang leaders, Vitel\u2019homme Innocent \u2013 a gang leader whose armed group Kraze Bary\u00e9 was not involved in the attacks but controls an area around the US embassy \u2013 asserted a claim to the bodies of the two Americans. \u201cFollowing the call, I did everything possible to communicate with the people in control of the area, to get access to retrieve their bodies,\u201d Innocent told CNN. He added, \u201cIt was a sad story when I learned that a Haitian and two Americans who came to serve the population died in a terrible situation.\u201d Innocent himself is the subject of a $2 million bounty for alleged kidnappings of American citizens, which he disputes, saying he hopes to defend himself one day. Emergency vehicles were soon allowed to continue onward to the charred site where they found the three bodies. The remains of Davy, 23, and Natalie Lloyd,\u00a021, were ultimately transferred to a local hospital morgue for safekeeping, according to HERO. Sources involved in the operation told CNN that inspection of the bodies revealed signs of blunt force trauma and severe burns on Davy, but no apparent bullet wounds. To remove human remains from a crime scene is a significant breach of protocol, even in a city plagued by lawlessness. However, Haitian officials agreed to inspect the remains after they were relocated, a source told CNN. Haiti\u2019s National Police did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment for this story, but in a statement last week, police spokesperson Gary Desrosiers told CNN that authorities would work with international law enforcement to investigate and prosecute the killings. Farewell to the bodies Missions in Haiti director Jude Montis, 45, was laid to rest in Port-au-Prince this week.\u00a0Local press showed large crowds gathered outside the church where his funeral services were held, and a mournful band in the procession could later be seen following his hearse down the street. But the bodies of the Lloyds have been waiting to travel back to Missouri until now. Natalie\u2019s father Ben Baker described the continuing hurdles to bring back his daughter and son-in-law on his Facebook page, in a message signed by Baker\u2019s spokesperson Cassidy Anderson. \u201cCurrently, we are working to retrieve the bodies of Natalie and Davy. We have to obtain a waiver that will allow their bodies to be transported without being fully embalmed due to the lack of facilities that provide that service in Haiti. After that, we have to find an airline that will be willing to do the transport. Prayers that this will all go smoothly,\u201d it read. The last remaining hospital in Port-au-Prince with the resources to perform the embalming would be the General Hospital near Champ de Mars, sources told CNN \u2013 but urban warfare between gangs and police have turned the iconic downtown park area into a volatile no-man\u2019s land. Waiting for news of the bodies\u2019 safe return has strained the nerves of family and supporters  with Hawley over the weekend releasing a public letter demanding that the Biden administration assure their security. \u201cNatalie and Davy\u2019s bodies will need to be transported to the final point of departure, and until that time, there are major risks. The situation on the ground in Port-au-Prince remains anarchic,\u201d he warned. But Thursday morning, the bodies of Davy and Natalie Lloyd finally began their long journey home. This is a developing story and has been updated. Correction: This article has been updated to clarify that American Airlines conducted the first US commercial flight to Port-au-Prince since violence erupted earlier this year.

{"id": "2024_05_30_asia_japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk", "text": "Wearing a toy whale hat, whale tie and a whale motif shirt, Hideki Tokoro spends much of his days thinking about the world\u2019s largest mammals. But he doesn\u2019t want to protect them. He wants to hunt them. To do that his company Kyodo Senpaku has built and launched a brand-new whaling $48 million \u201cmothership\u201d \u2013 the Kangei Maru. \u201cWe are proud of catching whales and are very proud of this ship which will allow us to begin offshore mothership-style whaling this year,\u201d Tokoro told reporters as he escorted them around the 370-foot, 9,300-ton vessel that set sail last Saturday for an eight-month tour of the country\u2019s northern waters. The new ship replaces the Nisshin Maru, the infamous whaling factory vessel dubbed by activists as a \u201cfloating slaughterhouse\u201d that was decommissioned in 2020 after more than 30 years of service, during which it frequently clashed with anti-whaling activists. The Kangei Maru is bigger and faster than its predecessor, the company says, and is equipped with state-of-the-art drones able to travel a reported 100 kilometers (62 miles) to allow crews of smaller boats to quickly locate and kill whales. But activists say the ship\u2019s high-powered features, including a cruising range of 13,000 kilometers (more than 8,000 miles) and its ability to sail for up to 60 days, suggests that Japan is setting its sights on whales far beyond its northern waters. \u201cJapan has never given up on its whaling ambitions,\u201d veteran anti-whaling activist Paul Watson told CNN. \u201cThe only purpose of a vessel like that is so it can travel long distances to the Southern Ocean to hunt whales, (and) what the whalers are doing right now is really just a test run. They are testing out the new ship in their waters.\u201d \u2018We need to cull whales\u2019 The Kangei Maru boasts a slipway large enough to haul 85-foot whales from the sea that leads to an indoor flensing deck the size\u00a0of two basketball courts. There, workers will strip away the blubber before cutting up the whale flesh on enormous cutting boards, before vacuum-packing and storing the meat in 40 industrial freezers, ready for sale. \u201cWhales are at the top of the food chain. They compete with humans by eating marine creatures that should be feeding other fish,\u201d Tokoro said on the tour. \u201cWe need to cull whales to keep the balance of the ecosystem \u2013 it\u2019s our job and mission to protect oceans for the future.\u201d He also told CNN that most of the ship\u2019s catch would be killed \u201calmost instantly\u201d by cannons at sea. \u201cWe aim for perfection, but some of them may suffer. In such cases, we will use a rifle to finish the job.\u201d Besides objecting to the slaughter one of the ocean\u2019s most majestic creatures, marine conservation groups and scientists have highlighted the important role which whales play in helping to tackle the climate crisis through sequestering and storing planet-heating carbon emissions. \u201cWhales are not just consumers in ocean eco-systems \u2013 they recycle a ton of nutrients into the environment which helps stimulate plant-life growth,\u201d\u00a0said marine ecologist Ari Friedlaender, also rejecting pro-whaling arguments that commercial hunts could be \u201csustainable.\u201d \u201cHumans have a very long history of killing whales and have not done a good job of being able to sustainably harvest animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to sustainably harvest a wild animal like that.\u201d Why is Japan so determined to keep whaling? Commercial whaling was banned in 1986 under a moratorium by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) after whale populations were almost driven to extinction by humans. Japan is one of three countries \u2013 along with Norway and Iceland \u2013 that continues to hunt whales, and officials argue that the industry is an important part of its culture and history \u2013 and also provides food security. Iceland, which has fiercely defended commercial whaling, said it would end whaling in 2024, citing falling demand for whale meat as well as \u201chigh operation costs and little proof of any economic advantage.\u201d Commercial whaling continues in Norway, which experts say has quietly become the world\u2019s leading whaling nation \u2013 killing more whales than Japan and Iceland combined. For decades, Japan has justified whaling under the guise of \u201cscientific research.\u201d In 2018, it tried one last time to persuade the IWC to allow it to resume commercial whaling \u2013 and failed. So, it withdrew from the body and resumed commercial whaling months later, in defiance of international criticism. \u201cJapan is no longer party to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and can argue that it is no longer bound by provisions and constraints,\u201d Donald Rothwell, an international law professor at the Australian National University (ANU), told CNN. \u201cWithin its waters, it\u00a0has the absolute authority to control the management of living resources \u2013 and that includes whales.\u201d Under Japanese law, three species of whale are permitted to be hunted in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones \u2013 endangered sei whales and threatened minke whales and Bryde\u2019s whales, with endangered fin whales set to be added to kill lists. \u201cWhales are important food resources and should be sustainably utilized based on scientific evidence,\u201d said government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi this month, as he announced a proposal to hunt fin whales, the second-largest species of whales after blue whales. The World Cetacean Alliance (WCA) marine conservation group said that whale watching in Japan was \u201ca far more successful industry\u201d than harvesting whale meat. \u201cCommercial whaling in the 21st century is unjustifiable,\u201d it said. \u00a0\u201cThe whaling industry in Japan recognizes that it is a challenge to increase whale meat consumption and there is currently no market,\u201d WCA said. \u201cSo why keep slaughtering these wonderful and intelligent animals?\u201d Tokoro ruled out whale watching. \u201cWe will not switch to whale watching but eating whale meat while watching whales might be quite a nice touch,\u201d he told CNN. Demand for whale meat in Japan Over the years, Kyodo Senpaku has launched aggressive public relation campaigns to promote whale meat and win over new generations of young diners. Tokoro says he eats whale meat every day. \u201cWhale meat is not only delicious, it\u2019s good for you,\u201d Tokoro told reporters during the tour of his ship, as he talked\u00a0up the purported \u201chealth benefits\u201d of eating whale, claiming that the meat could cure hair loss and cancer. \u201cI can definitely say whale meat and rice is a really good (combination) for Japanese people. There is no doubt about that, much better than beef and bun.\u201d Last year Tokoro, again wearing his whale hat, launched controversial whale meat vending machines, offering whale sashimi, whale steak and whale bacon. The company has also sponsored influencers from countries such as Russia, Thailand and South Korea \u2013 hosting them at a local izakaya in Osaka, where they sampled dishes like whale sashimi and skewers and encouraging them to take the message back to their followers that whale meat was delicious and acceptable. Japan may have a long and storied history of whaling dating back to the Edo period in the 1600s, but experts say whale meat consumption only really peaked after World War II \u2013 when food sources, especially protein, were scarce. Today, whale meat is now\u00a0considered more of a \u201cluxury\u201d dish, said Nobuhiro Kishigami, a professor at the National Museum of Ethnology, one of the country\u2019s largest research institutes. \u201cThe fact is that there is little interest in whaling and whale meat among Japanese people as a whole,\u201d Kishigami told CNN. \u201cMost young people, especially the majority that live in cities, do not know or care much about whaling and its history and remain indifferent.\u201d The same goes for dolphin meat, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just a sign of the times. But if we were asked to stop eating blue fin tuna, there would be a huge uproar. We would react very badly to that.\u201d Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry estimates that between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of whale meat are consumed annually in the country, compared to average annual totals of more than 230,000 tons during the 1960s. \u201cThere is still certainly a market (for whale meat in Japan) but market size and production volume have shrunk dramatically,\u201d economics professor Mitsuhiro Kishimoto from the Shimonoseki City University told CNN, noting that several major whaling companies had since withdrawn from the trade. \u201cThe demand for whale blubber disappeared after the discovery of oil and petroleum products, so many countries stopped whaling and with international regulations, the number of caught whales decreased and as a result, whale meat production decreased while beef, pork and chicken became more popular,\u201d he said. Scientists have also expressed\u00a0concern about the risks of consuming whale meat, with studies pointing to high levels of mercury found in whale and dolphin meat, which could prove dangerous to consumers \u2013 especially pregnant women and young children. Could Japanese whalers return to the Southern Ocean? Located in deep waters surrounding the entire continent of Antarctica, the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary hosts dozens of whale species including humpbacks, blue whales and fin whales. It was established by the IWC in 1994 to protect whale species after centuries of hunting, but until 2019 Japan took regular trips to the region to hunt for self-stated \u201cscientific research\u201d purposes. Japanese whalers killed 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean in 2018/2019, according to the IWC, before abandoning the region after it left the international body. Takaaki Sakamoto, director of the Whaling Affairs Office in Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency, told CNN that Japan sent ships to the Antarctic last year to collect numbers and skin surface samples, but those expeditions did not involve killing whales. He said they planned to return this year to do the same. Tokoro told CNN that the Kangei Maru is not planning on killing whales beyond Japanese waters because it doesn\u2019t make economic sense. \u201cCommercial whaling is not profitable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take 50 days to get to the Antarctic and back and we are not confident we can make a profit by paying the wages of employees and fuel for 50 days. However, I will go only when the government orders me to go \u2026 Until then, I will not go commercial whaling at all.\u201d But\u00a0activists aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cGiven the ship\u2019s long-range capabilities and drones, and recent announcements from Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry that it is keen to start hunting fin whales, we believe there is a high likelihood that Japanese whalers will return to the Southern Ocean,\u201d said James Anderson, activist and founder of the Whale Defense Agency (WDA). \u201cThe Southern Ocean is a critical habitat for many whale species that provides a safe haven for breeding and feeding \u2026 protecting it is more important than ever due to the increasing threats posed by climate change and illegal whaling.\u201d Rothwell, from ANU, said that if Japan looks to kill whales beyond its territorial waters, it can expect an international response. \u201cIt would immediately trigger global interest and action about the conservation and protection of whales, especially in waters sanctioned by the IWC as a whale sanctuary,\u201d Rothwell said. Watson, the veteran anti-whaling activist, told CNN he\u2019s prepared to mount a physical response \u2013 with a former Japanese fisheries patrol vessel he\u2019s acquired in anticipation of Japanese whalers returning to the Antarctic by the end of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary for a reason \u2013 you don\u2019t kill whales there,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe want to be able to track them down and intercept them like we\u2019ve done before \u2013 and we are more than prepared to do it again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/asia/japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_europe_russia-sexual-violence-occupied-ukraine-intl-cmd", "text": "Within an hour of being arrested by Russian security forces, Roman Shapovalenko was threatened with rape. On August 25, 2022, the day after Ukraine\u2019s Independence Day, he said three armed, masked officers from Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) stormed his home in the southern Ukrainian port city of Kherson, which was occupied by Russian forces at the time. They turned his house inside out searching for incriminating evidence. A message in Shapovalenko\u2019s phone that called Russian soldiers \u201corcs\u201d \u2014 a derisive reference to the evil forces in J. R. R. Tolkien\u2019s Middle-earth books and a popular Ukrainian slur for the Russian army \u2014 was enough for them. He said he was tied up, blindfolded and stuffed into an unmarked car. For days after, Shapovalenko said he was repeatedly electrocuted in his genital area, threatened with being raped with a glass bottle, and was even made to believe he could be sterilized. \u201cThey seemed to have a fetish for genitalia. Sometimes the door would open, and they would say: \u2018We\u2019re going to take out our batons and we\u2019re going to rape everyone here,\u2019\u201d the 39-year-old farm manager told CNN. Describing the graphic detail of his experience matter-of-factly, Shapovalenko sometimes paused to laugh nervously. He said his sense of humor is helping with what he knows will be a long recovery. The Russians, he said, hated it. \u201cI made a little joke, and they didn\u2019t like it. I got punched for that.\u201d Shapovalenko\u2019s experience of sexual violence at the hands of Russian forces is common among Ukrainians \u2013 including civilians and soldiers \u2013 who have been detained since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country more than two years ago. Human rights monitors have long reported on the rampant use of sexual violence by Russian police and security forces against prisoners and detainees in Russia. Now it seems Russia is exporting the practice to occupied Ukraine. Few men have spoken publicly about their ordeal, but Ukrainian prosecutors and rights groups say male victims make up a growing proportion of cases. The crimes often go unreported because of the stigma and shame associated with them. The latest United Nations Security Council annual report into conflict-related sexual violence said that 85 cases had been documented in Ukraine in 2023 \u2013 affecting 52 men, 31 women, one girl and one boy. A separate report from UN rights officials who interviewed 60 male Ukrainian prisoners of war following their release found that 39 were victims of sexual violence while in Russian detention. CNN interviewed four male survivors, two in person and two by phone, and obtained testimonies from two more, who were held by Russian units across five Ukrainian regions that have been occupied or annexed by Moscow: Kherson, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv and Crimea. All described being subjected to forced nudity, genital electrocution \u2013 most often with wires from the Soviet-era military field telephone TA-57, known as \u201cTapik\u201d \u2013 and threats of rape. Their accounts tallied with cases documented by regional prosecutors in Kyiv, Kherson and Kharkiv and were corroborated by witnesses held in the same detention facilities in Kharkiv and Kherson. Taken together, their stories capture what prosecutors describe as Russia\u2019s systematic and continuing use of sexual violence in occupied areas as part of its efforts to force the Ukrainian people into submission. \u201cWe see it over and over again in different regions under occupation. They use the same method of committing sexual violence, the same method of humiliation, the same method of how they explain it to their victims,\u201d said Anna Sosonska, a Ukrainian prosecutor and the acting chief of the conflict-related sexual violence division in Ukraine\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor General. Speaking to CNN from her office in Kyiv, Sosonska said that a significant number of documented crimes of sexual violence by Russian troops, including forced nudity, genital mutilation, rape and forced exposure to sexual violence against others, were being carried out against men. \u201cEspecially by using electric current on genitals \u2013 that is the top of the list,\u201d she said. \u2018They all laughed\u2019 Roman Chernenko said he spent seven months in a \u201cpunishment cell\u201d in a prison in the occupied city of Olenivka, in the eastern Donetsk region, after he was captured by Russian troops in Mariupol area. The 29-year-old intelligence officer with the Ukrainian military \u2013 who goes by the call sign \u201cOmen\u201d \u2013 described being tortured as often as three times a day, every day, for four months. \u201cTapik is a military phone with two wires. One is connected to your balls, the other to your finger, and they just keep turning the current up,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThey just keep twisting it until the person tells them what they need.\u201d He said he believes officers from Russia\u2019s GRU, the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) and the FSB, Russia\u2019s main intelligence agency, all took part in the torture. Chernenko was released as part of a prisoner exchange in January 2024 and is still recovering from the ordeal. Speaking to CNN a few weeks after his release, on the day he proposed to his girlfriend, he said it was his thoughts of her and his mother that gave him strength to survive captivity. \u201cThey laughed when they tortured me \u2026 they told me that my mother was being f**ked by Chechens. They took me to be shot twice, they threatened me with rape,\u201d he said. CNN asked Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense, Interior Ministry, FSB, National Guard (Rosgvardia) and the military intelligence agency, known as the GRU, for comment on allegations of sexual violence at specific detention facilities, but has not received any response. Rape and sexual violence are explicitly prohibited by the Geneva Conventions \u2013 the set of international laws that regulate the conduct of armed conflict \u2013 and can constitute a war crime. Mock execution is considered a form of torture under international law. Under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), committing rape and sexual violence in a systematic or widespread way is considered a crime against humanity. According to Ukrainian prosecutors investigating conflict-based sexual violence and abuse, all available evidence indicates that it is a deliberate tactic, part of Russia\u2019s modus operandi in Ukraine. \u201cIt\u2019s in every region that was under occupation. Everywhere that Russian troops were located, we\u2019re seeing cases of sexual violence and gender-based violence. The bottom line is that it looks like it is Russian policy,\u201d Sosonska said. As of early May, Ukraine has officially recorded 293 cases of sexual violence, although Sosonska said that it is impossible to estimate the real number of crimes that are being committed, particularly in occupied territories which remain inaccessible to its investigators and prosecutors. Some 37,000 Ukrainian citizens are unaccounted for, according to the Ukrainian ombudsman\u2019s office, with thousands believed to be held in Russian detention and at risk of torture and sexual violence. But the real scale of sexual violence committed during the war may never come to light. Only a fraction of victims tend to come forward and, according to the UN, this is especially true for men, some of whom may not initially realize that what happened to them was a sexual violence crime. Some male victims of sexual violence may describe what happened to them instead as \u201ctorture.\u201d The distinction, Sosonska explained, is important for any future court cases and war tribunals. Her office is also trying to educate the public about the fact that men can be victims of sexual violence \u2013 something Sosonska said may still not be fully understood. Anna Mykytenko, who heads the Ukraine team at Global Rights Compliance (GRC), an international legal non-profit, said that Ukrainian witnesses and survivors of sexual violence have testified that Russian troops told them it was a \u201cpunishment.\u201d \u201cIn several villages in the south we heard witnesses and survivors say that the Russian servicemen came in, occupied the village, and then looked specifically for the wives of Ukrainian soldiers, or their mothers or sisters,\u201d Mykytenko told CNN. GRC acts as the co-lead of the Atrocity Crimes Advisory Group, an initiative launched by the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom to provide Ukraine with assistance in the investigation and prosecution of atrocity crimes. Mykytenko said that while most cases of conflict-related sexual crimes that were reported and investigated earlier in the war concerned female victims, many of the cases recently recorded have been against male victims, especially against men held in captivity. \u201cSexual crimes are fairly common in detention centers and it\u2019s very common for prisoners of war or civilians to be threatened with rape or with the sexual abuse of different types, this is something that\u2019s almost normal for the Russian and Russia-related armed forces,\u201d she said. \u2018A systematic approach\u2019 The Ukrainian ombudsman\u2019s office told CNN it believes that the Russian armed forces and Ministry of Defense, as well as the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service, are the Russian government bodies officially responsible for what happens inside detention facilities. However, it is Rosgvardia \u2013 a paramilitary police force deployed to keep order in occupied regions of Ukraine \u2013 and the FSB that appear to be driving the campaign of torture and sexual violence against the Ukrainian people, according to the ombudsman and Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence service. Since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, the FSB has opened several regional offices in occupied Ukraine to recruit agents and gather intelligence. According to an official organizational chart published on its website, the FSB has directorates in the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics, in Crimea and in the occupied portions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Several survivors in these locations told CNN that the Russians who submitted them to sexual violence either identified themselves or were referred to by others as FSB officers. Meanwhile, members of Rosgvardia, part of the Russian security apparatus that reports directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin, are working alongside the Russian military to detain activists, quash protests and spread terror among the civilian population in occupied areas. The SBU, Ukraine\u2019s security service, has managed to track down several Rosgvardia and FSB officials who it said were either the direct perpetrators or the enablers of sexual violence against people held in detention. The SBU and the Ukrainian regional prosecutor\u2019s office in Kherson have identified Aleksandr Naumenko, the deputy head of Rosgvardia in Russia\u2019s Rostov region, as a suspect in more than a dozen cases. Ukrainian authorities said last May he was responsible for overseeing a detention facility in Kherson during the occupation and that he personally ordered sexual torture of several victims who were electrocuted in their genital areas. The notice of suspicion against Naumenko, a legal document seen by CNN, alleges that his subordinates and other members of Russian armed forces acted directly on his orders when they sexually abused at least 17 victims. Two other Rosgvardia officers \u2013 Oleksandr Chilengirov and Yehor Bondarenkov \u2013 have also been\u00a0accused of torture, including electrocuting at least 24 victims in their genitals at a different detention facility in Kherson. Dmitry Laikov, an officer with the FSB\u2019s Department for the Defense of Constitutional Order and Fight against Terrorism, is accused of overseeing genital electrocution of a detained Ukrainian citizen in a police station in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka. All four men have been indicted and their cases are currently being heard in court, according to Kherson prosecutors. Their whereabouts are unknown. Ukrainian officials say that it is difficult, but not impossible, to track down individual perpetrators of sexual violence crimes. As of early May, Ukrainian prosecutors had issued official notices of suspicion against 42 Russian officers, filed 19 indictments against 28 individuals and sentenced five people. All of the trials took place in absentia, according to the prosecutors\u2019 office. Sosonska told CNN a handful of cases are added to her file each month, and that investigations are progressing. However, none of the alleged perpetrators are in Ukrainian custody. Oleksii Butenko, a prosecutor in the Kherson regional prosecutor\u2019s office, said he has no doubt that sexual violence was part of Russia\u2019s strategy to subjugate the Ukrainian people in Kherson and to \u201cdestroy the Ukrainian national identity.\u201d \u201cWe can speak of a systematic approach \u2013 17 men were identified as having been sexually abused inside a single torture chamber,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe can say that the leadership, not only the perpetrators but also the management, is responsible \u2013 they gave permission or orders to commit these crimes.\u201d \u2018They were having fun\u2019 Andrii, a Kherson resident who was held in one of the Russian detention facilities, still remembers the screams of his fellow detainees more than a year and half after he was released. \u201cWe were kept in the basement of an office building. It was a small room with no furniture, we slept on cardboard and used a bucket to go to the toilet,\u201d Andrii said. Speaking to CNN in Kyiv, Andrii was clutching his hands nervously, looking away when describing what happened during his time in detention. He asked for his name to be changed and that no identifiable information about him be published. \u201cI was the last one to be taken in for interrogation, so I could hear them all being tortured in the next room. I couldn\u2019t hear the conversations, only the screams and the moans. It was impossible to sleep because of these screams,\u201d he said, recalling one particularly horrifying incident. \u201cI don\u2019t know who this man was and what happened to him \u2026 he was taken out into the corridor, where he was raped with a baton so that everyone could hear and see him.\u201d According to Andrii, the threats of rape and genital electrocution were the norm among the Russian forces. \u201cThey enjoyed it. They were having fun,\u201d he said. Ukrainian prosecutors have recorded incidents of Russian officials raping or attempting to rape victims using objects including batons, a pipe, a bottle, a handle of a shovel, a stick and a pen. Sosonska said her office is determined to bring to justice not just the direct perpetrators, but also those who were in charge \u2013 whether they ordered them or failed to prevent them. Her office is focused on prosecuting individuals, but it is also collecting evidence that will be shared with international courts, including the ICC, which prosecutes individuals over grave offenses such as genocide and war crimes, and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which hears cases brought up against states. The ICC has already issued an arrest warrant for Putin and Russia\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, over an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. The Kremlin has denied the allegations and called the ICC\u2019s actions \u201coutrageous.\u201d Sosonska said she believes that, just like the child deportations, sexual violence is part of what she called \u201cRussia\u2019s genocidal campaign\u201d against Ukraine. \u2018It is happening now\u2019 Oleksii Sivak knew the Russians were coming for him after his neighbor Shapovalenko, the farm manager, was taken. The 39-year-old sailor from Kherson had helped him put up Ukrainian flags around their neighborhood on Ukrainian Independence Day. Both men were civilian volunteers. Shapovalenko had been distributing supplies, helping people evacuate and sharing information about the location of Russian troops with Ukrainian military acquaintances, while Sivak ran a soup kitchen, organizing assistance, distributing leaflets and putting up posters and flags. \u201cWe already knew about these torture rooms; we knew that people do not return from there. I went to deliver soup, warned the people I was helping, cut off all contacts and came home to wait for them,\u201d he said. Hiding or trying to go on the run was not an option, he added, saying he was aware Russian forces were targeting the relatives of people they were interested in. He said eight men came to arrest him \u2013 four in military uniforms and four wearing civilian clothes, all with their faces covered. They took him to a local police station and then handed him over to what they said was the FSB. He recalled being beaten and tortured with an electric current from the same kind of field telephone described as being used in other detention facilities. \u201cThey called it \u2018the lie detector\u2019 and they were obviously having fun when spinning the dynamo, asking me \u2018do you want to call Zelensky?\u2019\u201d he told CNN in an interview in Kyiv. \u201cFirst, they put the clamps on my ears and while they were shocking me, they were also beating me with a stick, kicking me, and hitting me with their hands \u2026 then they moved these wires from my ears to my genitals. They said, \u2018we\u2019re going to sterilize you now\u2019 and things like that, while they were electrocuting my genitals.\u201d Sivak believes he has a pretty good idea why the Russian troops chose to torture him in the way they did and threatened him with rape. \u201cThey wanted to humiliate me. It\u2019s obvious. What do you do to cause a man the most pain? You hurt his wife or his genitals,\u201d he said. Of the dozens of men he was held with, Sivak said roughly half were subjected to sexual violence. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole system. Four people (tortured me) but they were just the hatchet men. Yes, they have no brains, yes, they are animals, but even if they are imprisoned, what about their bosses? Someone was managing them; someone was giving them orders.\u201d Sivak said he and several other survivors have formed an informal support group and are trying to raise awareness of the fact that men can be victims of sexual violence. Sivak has attended meetings with government officials and conferences where he shared his experiences. Ukraine is prepared for a lengthy process to bring perpetrators to justice \u2013 while protecting the victims. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, Sosonska\u2019s prosecutors, as well as other civil servants and local government officials, have received specialized training on victim-oriented approaches, learning how to recognize conflict-related sexual violence, run investigations and communicate with victims. Some of the training programs have been provided by the UN in a direct response to the large number of sexual crimes occurring during the occupation. Others are run in cooperation with local non-governmental organizations and victim support groups. The UN has also co-sponsored a psychological helpline specifically aimed at male survivors. It can take years or even longer for courts to rule and victims to speak out. Some survivors of sexual violence committed by the Bosnian Serb army during the Bosnian war in the early 1990s are only now coming forward. \u201cSome survivors might be willing to testify within a few months, for some, it may never happen, they may never be ready,\u201d Sosonska said. As for Shapovalenko, he said he wanted everyone to know what happened to him \u2013 and what is still happening to others. \u201cI want to tell everyone, tell the international community, that it is not like they came, occupied us, stood there with machine guns and left. No, it wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the most terrible thing is not what I am telling you now. The most terrible thing is that it is happening now in the occupied territories.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/europe/russia-sexual-violence-occupied-ukraine-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_sport_caleb-williams-chicago-bears-hard-knocks-spt-intl", "text": "There is already significant hype surrounding the Chicago Bears and No. 1 overall pick Caleb Williams, and the spotlight will be turned up even further in the preseason when the team features on HBO\u2019s Hard Knocks series for the first time. The documentary series first ran in 2001 and provides fans with an \u201cunprecedented\u201d inside look into the day-to-day lives of players, coaches and staff, both on and off the field. The Bears have been selected for the training camp edition of the series, with much of the focus expected to be on how the squad\u2019s high-profile rookies and other new additions settle in at training camp. Chicago was one of 10 teams to have never been featured in the show, but the arrival of Williams has brought an air of expectation to the Windy City and made the team must-see TV \u2013 even before the season kicks off. Per the NFL, the series will premiere on Tuesday, August 6 at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and will stream on Max. New episodes will run each Tuesday through September 3. \u201c\u2018Hard Knocks: Training Camp with the Chicago Bears\u2019 will provide our passionate fans across the world the ability to experience this unique and critical time in the history of our franchise,\u201d said Bears President & CEO Kevin Warren in a Thursday statement. The franchise is seeking to turn its fortunes around, having only finished the regular season with a winning record once in the last 11 campaigns. Chicago ended last year at 7-10, but owned the Carolina Panthers\u2019 pick due to a previous trade. The Panthers finished a league-worst 2-15, giving the Bears the first overall selection in the 2024 draft. After moving on from 2021 first-rounder Justin Fields, Chicago used their coveted pick on Williams, with fans hoping that he will develop into the franchise\u2019s first truly elite quarterback. The University of Southern California product enters the league with incredibly high expectations and was regarded as the consensus No. 1 selection in the months leading up to the draft. Head coach Matt Eberflus opted to not wait until the preseason to name Williams as the team\u2019s starting QB, announcing it in May shortly after the draft. The young signal-caller\u2019s arrival is not the only intriguing storyline that will be highlighted in the series. The Bears made several other splashy moves in the offseason, such as drafting wide receiver Rome Odunze with the ninth overall pick, who could form a fearsome rookie tandem with Williams in the passing game. The Bears also added former Philadelphia Eagles running back D\u2019Andre Swift and traded for veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen, who had spent the first 11 seasons of his NFL career with the Los Angeles (formerly San Diego) Chargers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/sport/caleb-williams-chicago-bears-hard-knocks-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_new-atlantic-port-of-dakhla-africa-trade-spc-intl", "text": "Dakhla, a small city in the disputed territory of Western Sahara, which is mostly controlled by Morocco, is located on a long spit of sand between the Atlantic Ocean and a saltwater lagoon. Its consistent wind makes it a hotspot for kitesurfing enthusiasts, but a new port, currently halfway through construction, could turn the area into a gateway for trade. The $1.2 billion megaproject is expected to complete in 2028. Spanning 1,650 hectares, the complex will include a trade port with an oil terminal, a fishing port and a shipyard. There will be a bridge linking the port to the land and a 7-kilometer road that connects the port with a national highway that runs along the coast as far north as Tangier and as far south as the border with Mauritania. \u201cWe\u2019re constructing an ecosystem,\u201d Nisrine Iouzzi, the director of construction for the Dakhla Atlantic Port, tells CNN. Once operational, she expects the port to handle 35 million tons of goods a year. This will not only boost Morocco\u2019s economy, she says, but it could help the country become a maritime hub for worldwide trade, connecting regions such as West Africa, the Middle East, Europe, North America, the Canary Islands and even South America. \u201cThe geographic location is key (to) the success of the port,\u201d she says, adding that the project has attracted significant foreign investment, including from the United Arab Emirates. Gateway to Africa The project is part of Morocco\u2019s national port strategy, which aims to modernize and strengthen port infrastructure by 2030, in order to enhance its role in global supply chains. Seaports such as Casablanca, Tanger-Med and Agadir have already been or are being upgraded, but because of its location, the Dakhla port is seen as particularly significant in opening up\u00a0other parts of the African continent for the world to trade with. \u201cWe strongly believe that with this infrastructure \u2013 port infrastructure, road infrastructure, renewable energy \u2013 we will be very attractive for investors that aim to get to one of the fastest growing markets, which is the West African market,\u201d says Mounir Houari, general manager of Dakhla\u2019s Regional Investment Center. With the implementation of Africa\u2019s continental free trade agreement, which aims to create a single market for goods and services, the port could encourage the processing of raw materials within the continent. \u201cLess than 5% of African natural resources are processed in Africa because there is no industrial infrastructure and exporting infrastructure,\u201d says Houari. The Dakhla port \u201cwill encourage many Africans to start processing natural resources in Africa, allowing African countries to create more jobs to improve their skills and know-how and strengthen their own industries.\u201d The Sahel region, especially landlocked countries such as Mali, Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso, are expected to benefit.

{"id": "2024_05_31_style_helicopter-photographer-donn-delson", "text": "\u201cThis is not daredevil stuff,\u201d says 75-year-old fine art photographer Donn Delson as we sit in a helicopter with no door, almost 2,000 feet above London. At this height, the winds are numbing even in May, yet Delson, on the outermost seat, dangles his legs out as a diminutive Big Ben and Tower Bridge pass by beneath us. \u201cOn a good day I\u2019ll go out on the (skid),\u201d he says rather nonchalantly, referring to the two nail-bitingly thin helicopter landing bars beneath us. \u201cBut harnessed up, of course, and only when we\u2019re hovering.\u201d While many may turn green at the thought of hanging out of a door-less helicopter, this is the desired set up for Delson \u2014 who refuses to put his camera lens anywhere near a window. \u201cIt\u2019s really the only way I want to shoot,\u201d he said, back on the ground the following day, of his penchant for working at height. \u201cI do everything on a large scale, because I want people to get the feeling I have when I\u2019m up there.\u201d The feeling, as it appeared sitting next to Delson in that same sky-high \u2018copter, is one of complete calmness. Mid-flight, he grumbles at the fierce winds and asks the pilot to slow the aircraft down to a hover. Suddenly we\u2019re suspended \u2014 wobbling in the air somewhere above the river Thames (a designated heli-lane intended to spare the rest of the city in the event of a crash) as Delson reaches under his headset to remove the black cap worn backwards on his head. \u201cMuch better,\u201d he says, and gives the signal to fly on. Delson, who is based in Los Angeles, began his career as an aerial photographer almost a decade ago. He\u2019s since spent over 300 hours in a helicopter, capturing everything from the ephemeral cherry blossoms of Japan to rugged mountain trails hidden in the Red Sea \u2014 sometimes from as high as 12,000 feet. His preference to charter private helicopters, which costs him between $800 and $2,500 per hour, is made possible by the fact that this is his 9th career. \u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate to have been an entrepreneur most of my life, and be successful in my business activities,\u201d Delson told CNN. After selling his last company BandMerch \u2014 one of the largest entertainment merchandise businesses in the world with Rihanna, Outkast and Billy Joel as his clientele \u2014 Delson was able to retire, briefly, before a chance holiday excursion set him on a new path. \u201cWe were on a trip to New Zealand, and my wife and I had the opportunity to go up in a helicopter to see a glacier,\u201d he said. The pilot, noticing a hefty camera strapped around Delson, offered to open the door in order to let him shoot out unencumbered. \u201cMy wife said no. I said, \u2018Sounds fabulous.\u2019\u201d There\u2019s an uncanniness to looking down at the world from above. The usual markers of your street-level experience have vanished, as has everyone else in the world. It\u2019s quiet and still. If there wasn\u2019t the looming anxiety of a potential helicopter malfunction, it might even be peaceful. Delson\u2019s work leans into this strange, disembodied feeling by capturing scenes that trick the eye. A parking lot filled with cargo containers that look like musical bars on a xylophone; or the Red Sea\u2019s sprawling canyons and gullies that could be the branches of an ancient tree. \u201cThe French term trompe l\u2019oeil was used by painters whose paintings were so lifelike you\u2019d think it\u2019s a picture. I want to make audiences rethink assumptions about what they\u2019re seeing.\u201d There\u2019s no guarantee Delson will get one of these illusionary shots, however. In Japan, the photographer spent between 20 and 25 hours in the air over the course of a week \u2014 in Israel, he flew for a combined 36 hours. But sometimes he won\u2019t take a single picture. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk,\u201d Delson said. \u201cI have no idea when I go up whether or not I\u2019m going to find anything.\u201d Even if he returns empty-handed, Delson believes there is more to be gained from the experience than simply making new work. \u201cI\u2019m definitely different than before I started flying,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve always considered myself to be a fairly spiritual person, but the perspective that one gets when you have the opportunity to do these things is transformative.\u201d Journeying back to the office at ground level, London seems a lot smaller. Just a few hours before, the capital was an intimidating, sprawling metropolis home to almost 9 million people. Now it feels almost bijou. The London Eye, what I considered to be the vertiginous pinnacle of the city at 10 years old, now feels laughably miniature; nothing more than a hamster wheel.\u00a0 Even Canary Wharf struggles to seem as imposing once you\u2019ve seen 50-storey landmark One Canada Square from 1,200 feet, shrunken to the size of a Lego brick. \u201cThe world from above, it\u2019s just so different from the world we know,\u201d said Delson. For any newcomers or tourists, struggling with the numerous skyscrapers, boroughs, tube lines or zone demarcations \u2014 try stepping into a helicopter. The result is a city that feels much more manageable.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/style/helicopter-photographer-donn-delson/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_26_europe_germany-afd-elections-analysis-intl", "text": "A right-wing German lawmaker made comments seen as so explosively outside the mainstream of acceptable political discourse, that his party was disowned by other far-right leaders, breaking a major coalition in the European Parliament. Maximilian Krah, of the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party, told an Italian newspaper that he didn\u2019t view all members of a notorious Nazi paramilitary group automatically as criminals. He claimed that some in the SS, whose primary role was guarding concentration camps during World War II, were in fact just farmers. \u201cBefore I declare someone a criminal, I want to know what he did. Among the 900,000 SS men there were also many farmers: there was certainly a high percentage of criminals, but not all of them were. I will never say that anyone who wore an SS uniform was automatically a criminal,\u201d Krah told La Repubblica last weekend. The AfD have since banned the 47-year-old Krah, their leading candidate in next month\u2019s European elections, from making public appearances. Experts say his remarks have also caused reverberations across Europe\u2019s far-right, shining a light on how the continent\u2019s far-right parties view themselves and their associations. After Krah\u2019s interview was published on Saturday, his party suspended him on Wednesday, and said that he had taken \u201dfull responsibility\u201d for his actions and agreed to step down from its federal executive board with immediate effect. In a scathing statement, the AfD accused Krah of having caused \u201cmassive damage to the party in the current election campaign, for which the candidate had provided the pretext.\u201d It is not immediately clear if Krah remains the AfD\u2019s official lead candidate for the upcoming European election. Lorenz Blumenthaler, a political analyst at the Amadeu Antonio Foundation in Berlin \u2013 which runs educational projects and researches right-wing extremism, racism and antisemitism \u2013 told CNN that the AfD only takes action like this in certain circumstances. \u201cThe only time when there exists this red line is when they feel like it\u2019s hurting their voting result. And that\u2019s the only time when they will act or whether they fear that it will basically change the way German security forces perceive them as the AfD.\u201d Blumenthaler added that reprimanding Krah this close to a major election is a pretty drastic step politically. It \u201cdelegitimizes you as a political party and hurts you much more than just running with a lazy dog (or deadweight candidate),\u201d he told CNN. Kicked out of a far-right coalition On Thursday, a far-right coalition of parties in the European Parliament expelled the AfD from the group. The Identity and Democracy (ID) bloc said in a statement, they had decided to exclude the AfD, \u201cwith immediate effect,\u201d adding that \u201cthe ID Group no longer wants to be associated with the incidents involving Maximilian Krah, head of the AfD list for the European elections.\u201d In Paris, the leaders of French right-wing party National Rally (RN) \u2013 the successor to the Front National led by Marine Le Pen, and part of the ID alliance \u2013 also dissociated themselves from the AfD. RN President Jordan Bardella said in a French TV debate on Tuesday that the AfD had \u201ccrossed red lines.\u201d \u201cWe will have new allies after the European elections and will no longer be in the same group as the AfD,\u201d Bardella added. Joe D\u00fcker, a researcher at the extremism monitoring think tank the Center for Monitoring, Analysis and Strategy (CeMAS), told CNN that European far-right parties, and RN in particular, have been trying to present themselves as more moderate. \u201cFar-right populists are always trying to appeal to a broad voter base and they are always trying to give themselves an image that seems cleaner than they actually are. We know that Le Pen\u2019s party has been trying to clean up their image in the past couple of years. She broke with her father, the founder of that party, because of that.\u201d Blumenthaler described this image cleansing as the \u201cmost absurd dynamic that we have, a new far-right self-consciousness all over Europe.\u201d That sense of self-awareness doesn\u2019t seem to extend to the AfD, though. There have been a series of incidents where AfD\u00a0members have expressed far-right ideologies openly in Germany. Recently scandals have also seen members accused of spying for China and accepting bribes from Russia. Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, a regional leader for AfD in the eastern state of Thuringia, was fined \u20ac13,000 ($14,000) by a German court earlier in May for using banned Nazi slogans, according to CNN affiliate N-TV. H\u00f6cke, a former history teacher, intends to run as the lead candidate for the AfD in the upcoming state elections in September, and is currently the clear favorite to win. According to Blumenthaler, these incidents don\u2019t appear to hurt the party, especially in Germany. \u201cAfter basically crashing the (far-right) European coalition, that really hurts the AfD on a European level, but I don\u2019t really think that it will affect their electoral base here in Germany that much,\u201d he added. Expect more of the same D\u00fcker told CNN that the trend of increased AfD extremism is likely to continue. \u201cWe can expect that things that are more radical, more extreme will become more acceptable,\u201d he said. The AfD\u2019s open radicalism is an interesting phenomenon for Blumenthaler too, especially when compared to its European allies. \u201cIt\u2019s still the Austrians and the German far-right branches that are the craziest\u2026 you would think that the taboo due to the German and Austrian past would be far higher here. And that the far right would act far more strategically trying to whitewash what they say how they act, but instead they are becoming more and more radicalized,\u201d he told CNN. The AfD is under domestic surveillance for the threat it poses to Germany\u2019s democracy and despite a recent dip is currently polling higher than each of the three parties in the coalition now governing the country. D\u00fcker noted a similarity between the AfD and Donald Trump, adding that: \u201cThe more scandals and the more outrageous things the ex-President said, the more his followers seemed to commit to him even more. And something similar appears to be going on with the AfD.\u201d Barbie Nadeau in Rome and James Frater in London contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/europe/germany-afd-elections-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_europe_ukraine-draft-law-conscription-intl", "text": "The air at the Ukrainian military recruitment office where a 30-year-old hairdresser is being interviewed is filled with anxiety. The man has no military experience and is unsure whether any of his skills would be useful. At one point, the recruiter jokingly suggests that he might be able to give everyone a nice haircut. But the man \u2013 who asked to remain anonymous given his pending military status\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is there anyway. \u201cThe time has come,\u201d he told CNN. Under Ukraine\u2019s new mobilization law, which came into effect on May 18, Ukrainian men are now facing a choice: Comply and face the possibility of being sent to the frontlines, or try to evade and risk penalties and condemnation. The hairdresser has chosen to pre-empt the choice and volunteered, becoming one of six men to be interviewed at the Da Vinci Wolves Battalion\u2019s recruitment center in Kyiv that day. The office is housed in an ordinary residential building, hidden from the outside world. Inside though, the walls are decorated with photos and big banners showing the logo of the battalion, a drawing of three teeth-baring wolves inside a stylized Ukrainian trident. The unit\u2019s recruitment slogan is \u201cEveryone will fight\u201d and the recruiter\u2019s laptop is covered in stickers, one of them saying \u201cYour pack is waiting for you.\u201d Ukraine has made no secret of the urgent need to recruit more people as it tries to defend itself against the Russian aggression. While the government doesn\u2019t reveal the number of dead and wounded, estimates made by experts speak of hundreds of thousands of casualties on both sides of the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. One Ukrainian commander who asked not to be named for security reasons said the personnel shortages are having devastating effects on the battlefield. \u201cIf there had been 1,000 to 1,500 more servicemen in Avdiivka, we would have protected the weak spots through which the enemy entered. \u2026 If we had more people, we would have held out much longer,\u201d he told CNN of the eastern industrial city, which fell to Russian forces in February after Ukraine held it for more than a decade. Making the case for a new mobilization, Yurii Sodol, the commander of the Joint Forces of Ukraine\u2019s military, told Ukrainian lawmakers last month that Russian troops outnumbered Ukrainian \u201cseven to 10 times\u201d in eastern Ukraine. This lack of personnel is putting immense pressure on those who are already serving. \u201cThe war is still going on and mobilization is essential. People who have been fighting for two years are tired. Some are going crazy,\u201d said Yaroslav Galas, who is currently serving with the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade. \u201cSoldiers need proper rest for several months. They need to heal, relax and forget. They need to spend the money they have earned with sweat and blood, to solve their economic and personal issues,\u201d he told CNN. To make the recruitment process more efficient and more transparent, the new law requires all Ukrainian men between the ages of 18 and 60 to register with the military and always have their documents on them. However, only men aged 25 to 60 are subject to mobilization under the new law. The lower limit has been slashed by two years from 27 years, but it\u2019s unlikely to make much difference because of Ukraine\u2019s demographic challenges. High emigration and low birth rates in the 1990s and 2000s mean there are far fewer\u00a0people currently in their 20s, compared to those in their 30s and 40s. Women who have medical or pharmaceutical qualifications must also register with the military, although they are not required to serve. The new rules have been controversial \u2013 the draft law was amended more than 4,000 times during the approval process. \u2018Desire to fight\u2019 It is unclear how many people will end up being called up. Late last year, the leader of President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s Servant of the People faction in parliament said the military was looking for an extra 500,000 servicemen and women. But the Commander-in-Chief of Ukrainian Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi said recently that any increase in numbers would likely be significantly lower. Some military officers are already questioning whether it will work. Their main worry is that they\u2019ll end up with units full of men who are only there because someone forced them to be. \u201cWe still want people to join voluntarily. Because there is a big difference between someone who was drafted into the army and someone who went to defend their homeland,\u201d said Dmytro Kulibaba, a soldier with the 114th Territorial Defense Brigade. \u201cThe desire to fight the enemy is very important, in addition to training, equipment and preparedness,\u201d he told CNN. Galas said that many people are worried that if they get drafted, they will be automatically sent to the frontlines \u2013 which he said is not the case. \u201cIf you are a specialist, for example, who in civilian life was engaged in IT, accounting, project management, even cooks, clerks, then the Armed Forces also need you \u2026 and you can also make a fairly large contribution to the common victory by joining the Armed Forces,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe have a separate drone unit who are a little further away from the frontline. People who are good at electronics, even those who like to play computer games, will quickly master this specialty.\u201d \u2018Sense of camaraderie\u2019 One Kyiv-based business owner told CNN he had been researching his options long before receiving the draft notice in the mail. He knew it was coming, he said, he just didn\u2019t know when. \u201cI had been preparing for this for about a year or six months. I talked to my friends who are serving, I asked them about everything,\u201d the 35-year-old said, explaining that his goal was to find a unit that would be a good fit for him. The man is currently in a training center and will be joining the army in couple of months, which is why he cannot be named by CNN. \u00a0He is currently considering two options \u00a0\u2013\u00a0reconnaissance or anti-aircraft missile troops. He said agreeing to serve was a clear choice for him \u2013 despite some of his loved ones trying to steer him away from it. \u201cYou think about all the options when you must make such a decision. How can I look my son in the eye when I say that I was somewhere (else)? I don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t work for me. I made a moral and ethical decision for myself. And then I had to decide with whom I would (feel most comfortable) serving with,\u201d he said. Galas told CNN he believes the mobilization campaign has not been going well because it does not give people enough information. \u201cIt scares people away,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what is happening in the combat brigades and it needs to be explained to them.\u201d He said that despite the initial worry, many soldiers adapt well to their new life, giving an example of a young IT specialist who was mobilized within the past few months. \u201cOnce he joined this team, he saw that life in an infantry unit is not what civilians imagine. Yes, it is dangerous and difficult. But good people are there, and the bad ones don\u2019t stay. There is a sense of camaraderie. And this is important,\u201d he explained. The IT man had impressed his commanders immediately, he added. \u201cHe did very well during his first combat mission in Robotyno, holding positions 400 meters away from the Russians. He not only withstood assaults but also took prisoners,\u201d he said. But not everyone is able to adjust to the realities of life on the frontline. The commanding officer who asked to remain anonymous spoke of another problem with the mobilization, saying that in recent times some recruits have not received the training they need to withstand the pressure. \u201cThe infantry being sent to the frontline needs to be given special training to make them real professionals. Because they come in here, drop their weapons, and run away from their positions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be motivation for the current military and those about to serve. We cannot use the methods used in Russia or Belarus \u2013 catching and imposing \u2013 this will not help. It will only lead to people running away and giving up their positions,\u201d he added. Running away But the military clearly isn\u2019t for everyone.\u00a0CNN spoke to one man who is determined to avoid serving no matter what.\u00a0He asked to remain anonymous because he is afraid of retribution. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill people, and in principle, I\u2019m not ready for that.\u00a0If shelling starts on the frontline, I think I will be confused and will only create problems for others,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI think I\u2019d be more useful making money and bringing dollars to the country than digging trenches or guarding military facilities,\u201d he added. He said he believes Ukraine doesn\u2019t have enough weapons to militarily reclaim territory seized by Russia in the war. The only way forward, he said, is a political agreement that would lead to Ukraine regaining its land. The man said that if he was to receive a draft notice, he would leave the country. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave; I know that things are not so beautiful and sunny in Europe. But if I had to choose between going to war or going abroad, I would choose abroad, I would pay a bribe. My life comes first. And I realize that there is a very high chance of being killed,\u201d he said. The soldiers who are currently serving have little patience for men like this one, who say they can\u2019t join the fight. \u201cSoldiers who go on leave or for treatment, who are exhausted \u2026\u00a0of course that (seeing other men) drinking coffee in coffee shops, going to restaurants, pumping their biceps and (saying they were) \u2018not born for war\u2019 make soldiers angry,\u201d Galas said. Unless they obtain a special permit, men between the ages of 18 and 60 have been forbidden from leaving Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion and last month, the government suspended consular services for men who are not registered with the military. Still, many attempt to run away anyway. Andrii Demchenko, the spokesperson for the Border Guard Service of Ukraine, told CNN his officers detain people trying to cross out of Ukraine on daily basis. Some are willing to risk everything trying to escape. The Border Service said that since the start of the full-scale invasion, the bodies of 32 men have been found in the Tysa River on the border with Romania and Hungary.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/europe/ukraine-draft-law-conscription-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_uk_prime-minister-rishi-sunak-election-intl", "text": "When British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced on Wednesday that the United Kingdom would hold a general election on July 4, many observers wondered: why now? More specifically, why has the PM called an election that is almost certain to lose? For months, polls have placed Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party way behind the opposition Labour Party and, as things stand, Labour leader Keir Starmer is set to not only win power but have a massive parliamentary majority. The answer to that question is simple: it\u2019s very unlikely there will be a better time. Almost everything Sunak tries seems to\u00a0backfire,\u00a0and it\u2019s not implausible that his favorability with the public will get even worse before the end of the year. The past couple of days have been relatively good for Sunak. The economy does seem to be recovering, with the\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0(IMF) updating the UK\u2019s growth forecast and inflation finally returning to something resembling a normal level. Nothing went catastrophically wrong in the last week or so ahead of calling the election. It\u2019s a low bar, but since his time in office, right now he probably has the most stable base to launch a campaign that he\u2019s ever had or ever will have. As one key\u00a0adviser\u00a0to Sunak told CNN: \u201cThe PM came into office facing a series a key challenges: inflation, no growth, migration. And he saw dealing with those as his primary mission. And he\u2019s made genuine and significant progress on that. On Tuesday, the IMF upgraded our growth forecasts, yesterday we saw inflation back to normal levels, today we see migration falling as a result of our reforms. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got a solid foundation to say that things are going in the right direction, and the view was that now was the best time to go to the country and say \u2018here\u2019s what we\u2019ve done, our plan is working, now who do you think has the plan and the capacity to take the bold action to move this country forwards towards a more secure future.\u2019\u201d Sunak had to call the election before the end of this year, constitutionally speaking. The fact he hadn\u2019t until this week allowed his opponents to paint him as a coward, terrified of facing the public. It didn\u2019t help that the country has felt in need of an election for quite a long time, nor that the Conservative Party has looked from the outside like a basket case for a number of years. Their time in office didn\u2019t begin formidably. In 2010, after 13 years of Labour rule, David Cameron won the general election but didn\u2019t win a majority in parliament. He was forced to make a coalition government with the centrist Liberal Democrats. Cameron, against the odds, kept the coalition together until the 2015 election, at which he won a surprise majority and secured the first fully Conservative government since 1997. The celebrations didn\u2019t last long. Holding the 2016 Brexit referendum split his party in two and made governing nearly impossible for his four (yes,\u00a0four) successors. First up was Theresa May. A botched snap election and the inability to pass her Brexit deal because her party hated\u00a0it ended May\u2019s tenure, and she\u00a0was replaced by Boris Johnson in 2019. Johnson blew his own majority when he became so weighed down by scandal \u2013 including the notorious illegal parties in Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 he had to resign in 2022. Liz Truss took over for 45 days, in which time she managed to cause sufficient economic havoc that the pound sank to its lowest ever level against the dollar, interest rates spiked and inflation ballooned. Eventually, the Conservative Party had enough of the chaos and put Sunak in charge as a safe pair of hands. Whether or not he has been that\u00a0is up for debate. Despite what Conservative sources might say about his record in office, his dire poll ratings cannot be denied. His flagship immigration policy, which would see illegal migrants sent to Rwanda to have their asylum claims processed, has already cost millions despite the fact only one person \u2013 voluntarily and given money to do so \u2013 has made the trip. His world-leading smoking ban, which caused Sunak major embarrassment when his own MPs didn\u2019t approve it, has been shelved due to the election. These are just two recent examples of how things seem to go wrong for Sunak. But the most damaging issue around him is the general sense that he is a bit of a loser and that his own party has so little faith in him. No amount of facts, figures or soundbites can change that he has an undeniable stench of failure around him. The sense that something is inevitable is powerful in politics, and for Sunak, defeat seems inevitable. Of course, it isn\u2019t. There is a chance that the polls are misleading us, and there is a chance that the Conservative campaign will work. They are making it personal: a clear choice between Labour leader Starmer and Sunak. Conservatives claim\u00a0Starmer cannot be trusted on national security, is a shameless opportunist with no principles and has no plan. Right now is probably the best time to hammer that message home. Labour will have to rush out its manifesto, which will inevitably be picked apart by commentators. The longer Sunak held off, the more time Labour had to get its house in order. Sunak inherited a mess, no one can deny that. It currently seems unlikely that he has cleaned up that mess enough to earn the Conservatives another term in office. But given the size of the task ahead of him, it makes sense that he seize on this rare period of good news and hope for the best.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/uk/prime-minister-rishi-sunak-election-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

The vast size of the slide is even more visible from nearer the ground. More than 150 houses in Yambali village were buried in debris, officials said Sunday. The country\u2019s National Disaster Center said almost 2,000 were feared to be buried. The landslide\u00a0hit the remote village of Kaokalam, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby, at approximately 3 a.m. local time on Friday (1 p.m. Thursday ET), leaving a scar of debris that humanitarian workers said was\u00a0as big as\u00a0four football fields. The phenomenon slammed tons of rock and mud into locals\u2019 homes as they slept, and rescuers struggled to reach such a remote part of what is already one of Asia\u2019s poorest nations, leaving villagers with no choice but to dig through the collapsed mountainside with whatever tools they had. The area has remained unstable, with smaller landslides occurring regularly and endangering rescue workers, Sandis Tsaka told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re getting huge rocks and debris that keep falling down and land further beyond the original landslide area are being impacted,\u201d Tsaka said. He added the government had ordered nearly 7,000 people to evacuate. Evit Kambu said after the disaster that she had lost more than a dozen family members. \u201cI have 18 of my family members buried under the debris and soil that I am standing on and a lot more family members in the village I cannot count,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cI am the landowner here \u2026 but I cannot retrieve the bodies so I am standing here helplessly.\u201d Papua New Guinea is home to around 10 million people. Its vast mountainous terrain and lack of roads have made it difficult to access the affected area. Miok Michael, a local community leader, told CNN that it was likely there were few survivors. \u201cPeople are gathering and mourning,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have been digging since day one but can\u2019t locate bodies as they are covered by huge rocks.

{"id": "2024_05_31_middleeast_idf-central-rafah-intl", "text": "The Israeli military is in central Rafah, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed in a statement Friday, despite international concern and anger over its military operation in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city. The IDF statement confirms what eyewitnesses told CNN earlier this week, when tanks were spotted in central Rafah for the first time since it entered the city earlier this month. \u201cIDF\u00a0troops in central Rafah located Hamas rocket launchers, terror tunnel shafts, and weapons. The troops also dismantled a Hamas weapons storage facility in the area,\u201d the\u00a0IDF\u00a0said in the statement. On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had established \u201coperational control\u201d over the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14-kilometer (8.7-mile) buffer zone on the Palestinian side of the Egypt-Gaza border. Access to cell phone services in Rafah was interrupted on Thursday due to the ongoing Israeli offensive,\u00a0Palestinian telecommunications company Jawwal said in a\u00a0statement. Israel\u2019s incursion into Rafah earlier in May marked a new phase in its war against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in the enclave, displaced the majority of the strip\u2019s population and sparked a humanitarian catastrophe that has appalled international agencies. Over the weekend, Israel launched an airstrike on a displacement camp in the city, killing dozens and creating global outrage. The strike also took out two Hamas leaders, Israel said. Footage obtained by CNN showed the camp in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. \u201cThe word tragic doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it,\u201d US Vice President Kamala Harris said of the incident on Tuesday. But neither she or President Joe Biden have said the strike crossed a red line for US support. Biden had said in a CNN interview earlier this month\u00a0that he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. The confirmation of the IDF\u2019s presence in central Rafah came as it said it had ended operations in eastern\u00a0Jabalya,\u00a0in the north of the Gaza Strip. The military said in a statement that its troops had destroyed more than 10 kilometres (six miles) of tunnels and weapons production sites in the Jabalya operation, which began earlier this month and involved what the IDF described as \u201cintense combat and close-quarters encounters\u201d with combatants. The statement also said the bodies of seven hostages were recovered during the operation. The hostages were killed on October 7, it said, and their remains were then taken to Gaza. But Mahmoud Basal, a civil defense spokesperson in Gaza, told CNN on Friday that\u00a0Jabalya\u00a0was a \u201cdisaster area\u201d following Israel\u2019s presence, with \u201centire residential squares\u201d decimated. \u201cJabalya\u00a0camp is not suitable for life, unfortunately,\u201d Basal said. \u201cThere are no water wells, schools, or hospitals, all of which have been completely destroyed. There is nothing that would enable the life of the citizen in this area, and there are a large number of martyrs and houses that have been leveled to the ground with citizens inside them, and we cannot recover the bodies from under the rubble.\u201d Israel resumed fighting in northern Gaza earlier this month, despite having said it had dismantled Hamas\u2019 command structure in the area back in January. The renewed fighting show the challenges Israel faces in achieving its goal of destroying Hamas, with a top security official this month warning the war could last into next year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/middleeast/idf-central-rafah-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

The ceremonial display on June 8 is the traditional dress rehearsal for the King\u2019s official birthday parade known as Trooping the Colour, which takes place a week later on June 15. It is not yet clear if Kate will also miss that annual military spectacle \u2013 a highlight of the royal calendar full of pomp and pageantry \u2013 at Horse Guards Parade in the British capital. It had been widely hoped that the popular 42-year-old royal might oversee proceedings at the run-through in her capacity as Colonel of the Irish Guards. The regiment will be trooping its colour \u2013 presenting its regimental flags \u2013 at this year\u2019s ceremony. Lt. Gen. James Bucknall will step in to take the salute in Kate\u2019s absence.

The Princess of Wales has not carried out any public engagements since December and had been expected to return to official duties after Easter. However, in March, she revealed her cancer diagnosis and that she had started chemotherapy. Following the announcement, a royal source told CNN that she would not be returning to frontline royal duties until she has been cleared to do so by her medical team. There had also been speculation over whether King Charles would participate in next month\u2019s Trooping the Colour as he continues his own cancer treatment. However, Buckingham Palace has now confirmed his attendance. In a slight change from last year, the 75-year-old monarch will inspect troops from a carriage rather than on horseback. He will conduct the review in an Ascot Landau carriage seated alongside his wife, Queen Camilla. The adjustment reflects previous guidance from the royal household that each engagement involving the King would be reviewed, with adaptations made based on doctors\u2019 recommendations.

{"id": "2024_05_28_middleeast_spain-ireland-norway-recognize-palestinian-statehood-intl", "text": "Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized Palestinian statehood on Tuesday, cementing a joint move that further isolates Israel over its war against Hamas in Gaza. Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said his country made the decision, which was strongly condemned by Israel, \u201cto keep the miracle of peace alive.\u201d The nations had announced they would take this step last week, but on Tuesday their respective governments simultaneously approved the declaration, meaning it has now officially come into effect. The move also highlights just how split Europe is on whether to recognize Palestinian statehood. A majority of countries around the world do so, and reaffirmed that stance this month in a United Nations resolution in support of Palestinian membership that passed with the support of 143 nations. Among them were many European states. But it is difficult to be truly definitive about how many countries view the issue; some former Eastern bloc countries, for example, recognized Palestinian statehood decades ago while under Soviet rule, but have since distanced themselves from that stance as independent countries. Spain, Ireland and Norway The move by these three countries to recognize Palestinian statehood in tandem sent an impactful message to Israel, and other Western states. Harris said in a statement on Tuesday that Ireland \u201chad wanted to recognise Palestine at the end of a peace process,\u201d but ultimately \u201cmade this move alongside Spain and Norway to keep the miracle of peace alive\u201d \u2013 underlining how the joint declaration gave each nation some level of cover, and may have accelerated the process. \u201cI again call on Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to listen to the world and stop the humanitarian catastrophe we are seeing in Gaza,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,\u201d the Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide added as his country formalized the move on Tuesday. \u201cThe international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.\u201d In Madrid, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said in a nationally televised address that Spain would join \u201cmore than 140 countries that already recognize Palestine\u201d and that it \u201cis the only way to realize the solution that we all recognize as the only possible one to achieve a future of peace: that of a Palestinian state that coexists alongside the state of Israel in peace and security.\u201d But all three countries have received a furious response from Israel since announcing their decision last week. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors to the trio, and said in a statement: \u201cI am sending a clear message today \u2013 Israel will not hold back against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security.\u201d \u201cAfter the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has seen, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state,\u201d Katz added. Western Europe In 2014, Sweden became the first major Western European nation to recognize Palestinian statehood. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said the decision was made because it \u201cmet the criteria of international law.\u201d \u201cIn the light of the international law analysis, we see no reason to delay this decision,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a territory of people and a government. Not to recognize Palestine because of the occupation would be against the principle of international law about no fruits of aggression.\u201d But that move did not lead to a groundswell of Western European support for the declaration. Instead, some countries have inched towards supporting Palestinian statehood as part of their wider advocacy for a two-state solution, but have not yet taken the step of formal recognition. Notably, France, Belgium, Poland and Greece voted in favor of the May 10 UN General Assembly resolution that called for Palestinian membership of the UN earlier this month. Denmark was also among the countries that voted \u201cYes.\u201d But on Tuesday, as its neighbor Norway formalized its recognition, Denmark\u2019s parliament voted down a proposal to do so, Reuters reported. Other countries \u2013 including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands \u2013 abstained from the UN vote, which was significant but ultimately symbolic given the United States\u2019 veto. In total, 143 votes were passed in favor of the UN resolution, 25 nations abstained and nine voted against. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u00a0said Friday that the time for a German recognition had not yet come, as there is \u201cno clarity on the territory of the state.\u201d For now, it\u2019s about achieving a long-term ceasefire,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cThe path of symbolic recognition of\u00a0statehood\u00a0is not the way forward.\u201d Eastern Europe Officially, a number of countries that previously fell under the Soviet sphere of influence in eastern Europe recognize Palestinian statehood. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria all take that stance, Reuters reported on Tuesday. But in eastern Europe, that recognition is often complicated, given that the order to formalize ties was given under a Soviet regime that sought to disrupt American global partnerships, such as that with Israel. Some former Soviet-bloc countries, such as Poland, have maintained close ties with Palestinian authorities, and have visited or hosted leaders from the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. Others have since distanced themselves from their historical declaration of support for Palestinian statehood, such as the Czech Republic, which was one of just nine countries to vote against the UNGA resolution earlier this month. The other nations were Hungary, Argentina, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Israel and the United States. Slovenia\u2019s government will consider a proposal this week to recognize an independent Palestinian state, according to Prime Minister Robert Golob. Golob said in a statement that \u201cafter a series of consultations over the last few days,\u201d a government meeting on Thursday will consider forwarding \u201cthe recognition of Palestine\u201d to the country\u2019s legislature for approval.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/spain-ireland-norway-recognize-palestinian-statehood-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_style_princess-diana-exhibition-london-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "Some of the most unforgettable photos of Princess Diana, such as her \u201crevenge dress\u201d that broke royal protocol and her handshake with an AIDS patient that changed the way the world treated those with the illness, have gone on display in a new exhibition in London. The exhibition, which is being held at Dockside Vaults just north of London\u2019s Tower Bridge and runs from May 25 to September 2, traces Diana\u2019s life as a humanitarian, a mother and a fashion icon. It displays a carefully curated selection of work by renowned royal photographer Anwar Hussein, 85, who started snapping Diana when she was 19. \u201cAt first, some told me \u2018you can\u2019t do pictures of royals,\u2019\u201d Anwar told CNN ahead of the exhibition\u2019s launch. \u201cI said, \u2018why not? I want a change.\u2019 I was doing rock and roll pictures - Bob Marley, Elton John, The Beatles. And then I got fed up with show business.\u201d Weaving through the vault\u2019s underground network of tunnels, CNN was given a tour of the exhibition by Anwar\u2019s two sons, Samir, 45, and Zak, 43. The pair have followed in their father\u2019s footsteps to become royal photographers in their own right, snapping viral photos of younger generations of the royal family. \u201cDiana did really buck the trend, especially for royals. She changed so much, and things that are now seen as normal, such as what Kate or Meghan wear, it was really Diana that changed all of that,\u201d said Samir, standing in front of a floor-to-ceiling print of the famed \u201crevenge dress\u201d photo, taken at a Vanity Fair party on the same day that Charles publicly admitted to adultery. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t think she was going to come out, and then she just came out looking like a million dollars and made a really big statement that, \u2018I\u2019m not going to hide away, I\u2019m still going to be my own person,\u2019\u201d Zak added. For Anwar, it\u2019s a very different photo that stands out to him. \u201cThis was Diana\u2019s favorite,\u201d he said, looking up at a photo of Diana cradling a young cancer patient during a trip to a hospital in Lahore, Pakistan, in 1996. \u201cThe boy was blind. He smelled of all these chemicals they had been using, but she didn\u2019t care and she cuddled him,\u201d Anwar said. \u201cLater on, he died and she was very sad about that. It shows her humanitarian side.\u201d Over the years, Anwar and his sons have taken hundreds of thousands of photos of the royal family. There is one word, however, which seems to encapsulate the images on display: legacy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want (the exhibition) to be controversial. We wanted it to be a celebration of Diana\u2019s life and her legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had \u2018The Crown,\u2019 we\u2019ve had films about Diana, so it feels like there is a whole new generation experiencing it.\u201d And for Samir and Zak, their father\u2019s influence has also had a profound impact on their lives, something which is illustrated by two almost identical, yet eerily different, photos on display in another part of the exhibition. In the first photo, taken in 1992, Diana sits alone in front of the Taj Mahal in India, her red and purple suit, designed by Catherine Walker, is a pop of color against the softer backdrop of the ivory-white marble mausoleum. Anwar was told on the day of the Taj Mahal visit that Charles had other engagements, so Diana went without him, Zak says, recalling his father\u2019s recollections. \u201cShe ended up posing up in front of it, in front of this monument to love,\u201d he said. \u201cFairly soon afterwards, they announced their separation.\u201d Some 24 years later, Zak returned to the same spot to photograph Prince William and his wife, Catherine. \u201cThere was a lot of speculation. Would they recreate the picture of Diana there?\u201d Zak said. \u201cThey arrived and sat on the bench, but this time it\u2019s two people that are very much in love.\u201d In many ways, the exhibition is a love letter to two families: the Husseins behind the lens, multiple generations of royals in front of it. \u201c(Our father has) never done anything like this before,\u201d Samir said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting on now, he\u2019s a bit older and I think he really wanted to do a celebration of what he had done and a celebration of her as a person.\u201d In a statement, Anwar said: \u201cI am delighted that the images captured, as well as those of my sons, are coming home to London to recognize and memorialize such a remarkable woman and her sons.\u201d Tickets for the exhibition, which start at \u00a317 (about $22), include a 60-minute audio tour detailing the first-hand accounts behind each photograph.

{"id": "2024_05_31_weather_power-grid-outages-us-texas-climate", "text": "Picture this: It\u2019s a Thursday night in Houston and thunderstorms are rolling in. Suddenly, winds roar past 100 mph. Trees snap, windows shatter and the city darkens as power flickers out. Even after it\u2019s over, it takes days for the lights to come back on in parts of the city. A week and a half later, the Tuesday morning commute is just getting underway in Dallas. Thunderstorms rush through the city, unleashing hurricane-strength wind gusts and torrential rain. Trees and power lines topple to the ground, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of people. Many homes and businesses remain without power days later. That\u2019s exactly the scenario that played out in Texas over the past few weeks, and these kinds of outages are happening more frequently as destructive extreme weather thrashes the aging electric grid. From 2000 to 2023, 80% of all major US power outages were due to weather, according to analysis by Climate Central, a non-profit research group. The number of weather-related outages from 2014 to 2023 doubled compared to outages at the start of the century. Being without power is not only expensive \u2013 keeping people out of work and school, and keeping businesses closed \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous. There doesn\u2019t need to be a heat wave in Texas for summertime temperatures to soar to unhealthy levels. Heat is particularly dangerous without A/C at night, which is when the body needs to cool itself after a hot day. Experts say there could be ways to keep the lights on in the face of extreme conditions, even if there\u2019s no single perfect solution. Why can\u2019t the lights stay on? Power generation, transmission and distribution within the US happens on a power grid, an interconnected series of power plants, power lines and electrical substations. But the grid\u2019s infrastructure is aging fast and struggling to keep up with modern power demands, according to the US Department of Energy. It\u2019s also struggling as extreme weather gets more intense as the planet warms. \u201cOur (power) infrastructure was built for the weather of the past,\u201d Michael Webber, a professor of engineering at the University of Texas said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t built for the weather of the future, and the weather of the future is already here.\u201d A majority of the US electric grid was built in the 1960s and 1970s, but some of the first parts of the system were constructed in the early 1900s. And 70% of transmission lines in the US are approaching the end of their 50- to 80-year lifecycles, according to the DOE. Every element within the power grid is vulnerable in some way to extreme weather, Webber told CNN. Power is largely distributed by above-ground power lines from large transmission towers to smaller \u2013 and abundant \u2013 power poles. Most outages happen because of failures with power lines and poles, making them a \u201cbig weakness\u201d in the overall system, according to Webber. Severe weather \u2013 defined as thunderstorms, high winds, heavy rain and tornadoes \u2013 was far and away the main cause of weather-related major outages at 58%, according to Climate Central. And it directly impacts these exposed lines. Power lines and poles can be brought down by falling tree limbs, topple over in fierce winds and be snapped by heavy ice. Extreme events, like the derecho and tornado that tore through the Houston in mid-May, can turn massive transmission towers into mangled metal. Hurricanes, like 2021\u2019s Ida, inflict damage at a colossal scale. When infrastructure can\u2019t withstand extreme weather, it not only disrupts power, it also creates its own disasters: The massive Smokehouse Creek Fire ignited earlier this year after a \u201cdecayed\u201d power pole toppled in strong winds, according to a report from the Texas House of Representatives. But it\u2019s not just power lines and power poles under attack from extreme weather; the things that generate power can also take a beating. Blasts of frigid cold can freeze necessary equipment, leaving it unable to keep up with demand. Historic cold shuttered power plants and froze non-winterized wind turbines in Texas in 2021. The resulting power outages were vast and deadly in the brutal cold. Meanwhile, searing heat sends electricity demands skyrocketing as cooling needs surge. If power needs cannot be met, blackouts and brownouts arise. Equipment also overheats and fails if temperatures soar too high. Modernized equipment can keep the A/C running \u2013 for a price In order to keep power flowing during extreme weather, or restore it quickly in the aftermath, the US grid needs to be upgraded and fortified on a vast scale. It will cost trillions of dollars to do this well, according to Webber. Power poles, power lines and transmission equipment need to be built or rebuilt stronger and operate at a higher capacity to keep larger amounts of power flowing, even when demand spikes. At the most basic level, a wooden power pole is less durable and has a shorter lifespan than a metal pole. Installing sturdy, metal poles means more stay upright in extreme weather, but they could come at an environmental cost, given how energy intensive it is to make steel. Fortified power lines above ground will still sometimes be knocked over by violent storms, so another solution is to put power lines underground. Parts of the US are already doing this, including cities like Anaheim, California, and Fort Collins, Colorado. But burying electricity isn\u2019t perfect solution, either. Running power lines underground is often 10 times more expensive than building overhead wires, and the lines are susceptible to flooding and can be difficult for crews to service, according to Rob Gramlich, founder and president of Grid Strategies, a power grid consulting firm. Modernization of outdated power lines costs around $100,000 per mile, while new power lines can run anywhere from $1 million to $10 million per mile depending on geography and whether they are above or underground, according to Webber. But it\u2019s an investment that will pay for itself when fewer power lines spark devastating wildfires or outages that cost up to billions of dollars are avoided, Webber contends. A stronger grid also has to have smarter controls to rapidly reroute power where it\u2019s needed when outages do occur. \u201cAny number of things can happen to power generation in any one area,\u201d Gramlich told CNN. \u201cBut if you have fortified inter-regional transmission, you have an insurance policy against many risks.\u201d The US is designed so that if power needs in one region spike because of increased demand or power generation fails, another region steps in to help handle the load. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind make the grid more resilient by diversifying the number of ways power is generated if another method fails. But, the energy generated by renewable means is still delivered via the same vulnerable infrastructure as all other power. It may be an insurmountable task to eliminate weather-related power outages completely, but it should be possible to eradicate major, multi-day outages. \u201cUltimately, I think it really should be extremely rare to have a multi-day power outage,\u201d Gramlich said. \u201cWe can plan the whole electricity system so that never happens.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/weather/power-grid-outages-us-texas-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_donald-trump-conviction-european-allies-reaction-intl", "text": "European allies of former US President Donald Trump have rallied around him in support following his historic conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The conviction \u2013 which has been heralded as a somber moment for America with wide-reaching implications \u2013 has been painted by Trump\u2019s allies in Europe as political persecution, aimed at derailing his bid to return to White House. Italy\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini called Trump\u2019s conviction \u201cjudicial harassment\u201d in a post on X, while Hungarian President Viktor Orban urged him to \u201ckeep on fighting\u201d for the presidency. But other countries declined to comment on the development \u2013 a conventional response for governments when asked about another nation\u2019s domestic matters. A Manhattan jury\u00a0found Trump guilty\u00a0of all 34 charges\u00a0of falsifying business records on Thursday, an unprecedented verdict that makes\u00a0him the first former president in American history to be convicted of a felony. The\u00a0verdict\u00a0was announced after jurors deliberated for nearly 12 hours over two days. It will ultimately be up to voters in November to decide the significance of the guilty verdict delivered by 12 ordinary New Yorkers, which, on a legal basis, does not prevent him from being elected president again. Salvini, who is a long-time supporter of the former president and visited him in Philadelphia,\u00a0Pennsylvania during his first presidential campaign, said Trump was a \u201cvictim of judicial harassment and a process of political nature.\u201d He wrote on X that \u201cin Italy, we are sadly familiar with the weaponization of the justice system by the left,\u201d which he said has for years tried to \u201celiminate political opponents through legal means.\u201d \u201cI hope Trump wins; it would be a guarantee of greater balance and hope for world peace,\u201d he added. Orb\u00e1n said he knew Trump to be \u201ca man of honour.\u201d \u201cAs president, he always put America first, he commanded respect around the world and used this respect to build peace,\u201d he said Friday in a\u00a0post\u00a0on \u2018X\u2019. \u201cLet the people make their verdict this November! Keep on fighting, Mr. President!\u201d he added. Meanwhile, Russia suggested there was a political conspiracy at play, despite Trump being convicted by a jury. \u201cIn general, if we talk about Trump, it is obvious that political rivals are being eliminated there through all legal and illegal means,\u201d President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in a daily call to journalists. \u201cThis is visible to the whole world with the naked eye.\u201d Other countries, sticking to protocol, declined to comment on Trump\u2019s conviction. Asked in a press briefing Friday whether he would potentially be willing to work with a convicted felon, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak avoided the question, stating that his focus was \u201csquarely on the election here at home, talking to people across the country about the choice at our election.\u201d Germany\u2019s Foreign Office spokesperson Christian Wagner, meanwhile, told journalists in a daily briefing: \u201cWe do not comment on this.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/donald-trump-conviction-european-allies-reaction-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

The attack occurred in Kuchi village, Munya district, in Niger state, beginning at about 5:30 p.m. on Friday and lasting until 4:00 a.m. Saturday, according to district official Aminu Abdulhamid Najume. Niger state, which borders Nigeria\u2019s capital Abuja, has experienced repeated kidnappings for ransom by armed groups, including mass abductions, in recent years. Najume reported that about 300 gunmen arrived on motorbikes and stayed for several hours, making themselves at home before leaving with the abductees. \u201cThey made a fire to curb the cold because it was raining throughout that day,\u201d Najume said. \u201cThey cooked and made tea; they made Indomie (instant noodles) and spaghetti.\u201d Some of those killed were members of a local vigilante group who confronted the attackers but were overpowered. Najume added that security forces had not yet started rescue operations. \u201cThe police visited Kuchi yesterday [Sunday] and left, nothing else.\u201d A spokesperson for the Niger State Police Command did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. \u201cThis is not the first or second time Kuchi village has been attacked. This is the fifth time,\u201d Najume said, noting that the area frequently suffers from kidnappings for ransom. The kidnappers have not yet made any demands regarding the latest abduction, he said. Amnesty International said in a post\u00a0on social media platform X on Sunday that it was \u201cdeeply concerned by the abduction,\u201d criticizing Nigerian authorities for leaving \u201crural communities at the mercy of gunmen.\u201d \u201cSince 2021, gunmen have been consistently attacking Kuchi village and raping women and girls in their matrimonial homes,\u201d the agency stated. \u201cThe invasion of the village by the gunmen is yet another indication of the Nigerian authorities\u2019 utter failure to protect lives,\u201d Amnesty added. Nigeria\u2019s security forces have struggled for years to control insurgent groups in the north of the country. The Kuchi abduction comes two months after 21 people, including a newlywed, were killed when gunmen described locally as \u2018bandits\u2019 stormed a market in Rafi, another affected district in Niger. At least 137 schoolchildren were kidnapped earlier in March in Niger\u2019s neighboring Kaduna state but were later released after the kidnappers made an initial demand of 1 billion naira (over $675,000) and threatened to kill them all if their demands were not met.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/africa/gunmen-kidnap-scores-in-nigeria-deadly-raid-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_europe_us-weapons-ukraine-strike-russia-kharkiv-intl", "text": "The story of the past 27 months since Russia invaded Ukraine has been one of crumbling taboos. After repelling Russia\u2019s initial march on Kyiv, Ukraine has asked its Western allies for greater and greater support: first ammunition, then tanks, then cluster munitions, then fighter jets. Each time, the West has agonized over whether to grant Kyiv\u2019s latest request, fearing escalation and a potential Russian response. Each time, the taboo was broken \u2013 and nothing happened. What seemed beyond the pale one week had become banal the next. But the rhythm of deliberation and delay has been hard to shake. Despite securing more weapons from the United States last month, Ukraine has not been able to use them as it pleases. As Moscow this month launched its surprise assault on the northeastern Kharkiv region, Washington forbade Kyiv from using US weapons to strike targets inside Russia. This too crumbled. President Joe Biden this week gave Ukraine permission to carry out limited strikes using US weapons in Russian territory around Kharkiv, after several European nations had removed restrictions on how the weapons they have given to Kyiv can be used. \u201cOver the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that were provided to defend against this aggression\u201d near Kharkiv city, \u201cincluding against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border,\u201d US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday on a visit to Prague, the Czech capital. He confirmed Biden had approved Ukraine\u2019s request. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the decision as a \u201cstep forward\u201d which will help his forces to defend the embattled Kharkiv region. While the decision may mark a new phase of the war, analysts have questioned whether the new freedoms will significantly bolster Ukraine\u2019s ability to repel Russia\u2019s invasion. Some are bullish. This month, the calls for the US to remove the restrictions became more desperate, as Russia continue to pummel Kharkiv city with missiles and make gains elsewhere in the region. In a CNN op-ed, Adam Kinzinger and Ben Hodges described the bizarre effect of the US taboo: \u201cWe have heard Ukrainian soldiers repeatedly tell stories of Russian columns attacking, being repelled, and retreating to safe Russian territory to regroup, have a hot meal, plan and attack again.\u201d \u201cUkraine cannot win if Russians can attack civilian targets with impunity and call \u2018time out\u2019 in their own territory,\u201d they wrote, urging Biden to call his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin\u2019s bluff. But military analysts have tempered expectations, partly because the US is standing firm in not allowing Ukraine to use the most formidable munition it has been given to fire into Russia: the long-range missiles known as ATACMS that can hit targets 300 kilometers (nearly 200 miles) away. Instead, Ukraine can only use shorter-range missiles known as GMLRS, which have a range of around 70 kilometers (around 40 miles). Kateryna Stepanenko, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington, told CNN the policy change will \u201cblunt\u201d Russia\u2019s offensive in Kharkiv, but still \u201cpreserves the majority of Russia\u2019s sanctuary space.\u201d \u201cThe policy still protects Russia\u2019s operational and deep rear sufficiently that this change near Kharkiv Oblast is insufficient to bring about a turning point in the war. Ukraine particularly needs the capacity to strike deep rear areas to defeat the Russian ground and air threats, as many Russian airfields that support strikes against Ukrainian cities are located outside of the allowed GMLRS range,\u201d she said. Franz-Stefan Gady, an associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN the GMLRS cross-border strikes will allow Ukraine \u201cto hit some Russian staging areas, command and control centers, as well as supply depots. It will not stop but complicate Russian military operations against Kharkhiv.\u201d \u201cWe need to be realistic about what can be expected from this policy change, since the Russian armed forces have already adapted to the introduction of ground-based precision fires,\u201d he said. Mathieu Boulegue, a researcher at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said the policy change would allow Ukraine to \u201cbe more efficient when it comes to repelling attacks and pushing back preemptively.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a game changer, per se. It\u2019s an add-on, a steroid, an extra booster for Ukraine to defend itself,\u201d he said. Red lines fade The US is joining the United Kingdom, France, Germany and several others in removing restrictions on how Ukraine uses the weapons it is given. Before Biden gave the green light, Putin had made veiled nuclear threats to countries considering allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with their weapons. He warned the move could lead to \u201cserious consequences,\u201d particularly for \u201csmall and densely populated countries.\u201d As well as making nuclear threats, Putin also signaled earlier this month that he was open to peace talks. \u201cAll of these false narratives deliberately aimed to discourage Western decisionmakers from allowing Ukraine to preempt Russia\u2019s attack on Kharkiv city,\u201d Stepanenko said. While the removal of this taboo appears to mark a new chapter in the war, Russia has previously experienced Ukrainian strikes with Western weapons on territory it considers its own. Ukraine has frequently targeted occupied Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, using \u201cStorm Shadow\u201d missiles provided by the UK. Ukraine also launched strikes on Kharkiv and Kherson in late 2022, as it sought to liberate the regions occupied by Russia in the early weeks of the full-scale invasion. In both cases, Russia had warned Ukraine and its Western allies not to cross its red line. In both cases, Ukraine and its Western allies ignored the warning. \u201cThe Kremlin already regards strikes against occupied Crimea and Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia oblasts as \u2018strikes against Russia,\u2019 but the reality is that there are few things that Russia can do to further escalate its war in Ukraine without incurring major risks,\u201d Stepanenko said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/europe/us-weapons-ukraine-strike-russia-kharkiv-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_africa_south-africa-elections-polls-open-intl", "text": "Millions of South Africans are voting in what is expected to be the most pivotal general election since the end of apartheid. For months, polls have shown the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party could lose its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led it to power in 1994. While polling can be challenging in South Africa, most analysts believe that the ANC faces its stiffest challenge yet with a population deeply frustrated by the country\u2019s direction. If support for the ANC drops below 50% for the first time, the party will be forced to enter into a coalition government. ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Wednesday\u2019s vote \u201cone of the most important elections in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d while addressing a crowd of thousands at Soweto\u2019s FNB soccer stadium on Saturday. \u201cOur people will decide whether our country continues moving forward with the ANC towards a better, brighter future or backwards to a terrible past,\u201d Ramaphosa said. The South African leader, who cast his ballot at a polling station in Soweto, told reporters on Wednesday that he has \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that voters will again trust in the ANC. \u201cThis is the day when South Africa decides, decides on the future of our country, (on) who should lead the government of South Africa, and I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart of hearts that the people will once again invest confidence in the African National Congress to continue to lead this country,\u201d Ramaphosa\u00a0said. South Africa is the most unequal country in the world, according to the World Bank. Citizens are also contending with the highest sustained rate of unemployment in the world, rampant corruption, feeble economic growth, crippling power cuts and\u00a0rising violent crime. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the\u00a0failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Voters in Johannesburg told CNN they headed to vote shortly after polls opened at 7 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) on Wednesday, and many expressed their hopes that the country would move in a different direction. \u201cWe want to see the change,\u201d said Sydney Radebe. \u201cThis is a rich country but people don\u2019t have anything,\u201d the 66-year-old actor and filmmaker added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have land, we don\u2019t have property\u2026 you cannot own nothing and say you are \u2018free.\u2019\u201d Radebe was among the first early morning voters at one of the biggest polling stations in Johannesburg. On a crisp morning as the Southern Hemisphere heads into winter, the line of voters gradually began to grow inside Joubert Park. Events worker Newton Ugboh, 20, was voting for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m looking for change so I came early in the morning,\u201d he said. Ugboh said that some of his friends didn\u2019t want to vote as \u201cthey think things aren\u2019t going to change at all,\u201d but that there are \u201cbig issues\u201d facing young people in the country. The \u201cunemployment rate is crazy,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s a \u201cbig-time struggle to find work, most of my friends are unemployed.\u201d Healthcare worker Roselyne Tswakae, 46, said she\u2019s worried about the future of South Africa\u2019s youth and also believes \u201cit\u2019s time for change.\u201d \u201cYoung South Africans were promised that education would be the key to success, they went to university but they are unemployed and often end up getting involved in drugs, drinking, smoking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are hoping for the light,\u201d Tswakae added. Land surveyor David Ngobeni, 31, also said \u201cthere isn\u2019t much hope\u201d for young people in South Africa. He says unemployment, inflation, crime and corruption are the \u201cbig issues facing everyone right now.\u201d \u201cIf you have a job, you are very lucky,\u201d Ngobeni told CNN. He added that he hopes the outcome of this election will lead to inflation going down and boost the economy. At the very end of a long line in Joubert Park was 40-year-old Ncumisa Xabanisa. She said she has been voting for the same party since 1994 and is very loyal to the ANC. \u201cit\u2019s only one party for me, it\u2019s from home, it\u2019s from my grandmother, I grew up knowing them,\u201d Xabanisa told CNN. She said the major problem the country is facing is a lack of jobs. \u201cSome of us we went to school, we graduated but we have the certificates like it\u2019s a display. It\u2019s hurting.\u201d The mother-of-two added that she is educated but is currently sitting at home most of the time, and sells plastic food containers to make a living. There are 52 parties on this election\u2019s national ballot, including new parties formed by previous ANC members such as former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK). Zuma was forced to\u00a0resign as president in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court. The 82-year-old was barred from running for parliament last week after the country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled that five years must have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. However, his party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Capping off a heated few months of election campaigning, many of the largest parties held their final rallies this weekend, including the Democratic Alliance (DA), the official opposition party. \u201cOn Wednesday, the ANC will lose the outright majority it has abused for decades to subject the people of this country to unemployment, corruption and misrule\u2026 we close the ANC chapter of our history,\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen told supporters in the town of Benoni, east of Johannesburg. The DA has formed a coalition bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. This is the seventh general election South Africa has held since the end of white minority rule 30 years ago. A record 27.79 million people are registered to vote \u2013 the highest number to date, according to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC.) The country\u2019s electoral commission (IEC) said that, by 11 a.m. in South Africa, a \u201csignificant majority\u201d of voters had already cast their ballots, as lines to vote had formed before the polls opened. \u201cThis, we think, is testament to the enthusiasm of South Africans to record their political choice,\u201d the IEC\u2019s deputy CEO Masego Sheburi added during a briefing at the National Results Center. Sheburi said that some voting stations opened late, but by midday \u201cgood progress\u201d was made with \u201cminimal incidences\u201d across the country. One of the issues some polling stations faced was late delivery of ballot papers, mainly in the Johannesburg area, according to the IEC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/africa/south-africa-elections-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_americas_mexico-female-president-violence-miltiarization-intl-latam", "text": "Claudia Sheinbaum was campaigning for president in southern Mexico when hooded men approached her car, filming\u00a0the interaction\u00a0as they implored her to keep their town from being taken over by gangs. One man said he felt helpless, and that the government had \u201cnever done anything for these lands.\u201d They lived in Chiapas, Mexico\u2019s poorest state and an\u00a0increasingly\u00a0important territory for criminal organizations moving illegal drugs, firearms and migrants from\u00a0neighboring Guatemala.\u00a0Sheinbaum thanked the men, shaking one of their hands before her car pulled away. The former Mexico City mayor\u00a0is the frontrunner in a landmark election\u00a0this weekend\u00a0where Mexico is all but certain to emerge with its first female president \u2013 a remarkable achievement in a country known for its patriarchal culture and high rates of gender-based violence, where\u00a0around 10 women\u00a0are murdered every day. Sheinbaum is riding on a wave of popularity\u00a0with the support\u00a0of her long-time ally, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and their leftist Morena party. Trailing her in the polls is former senator Xochitl G\u00e1lvez, from the conservative PAN party, who is representing a coalition of\u00a0opposition parties. But what should have been celebrated as a ground-breaking election\u00a0has become overshadowed by the bloodiest election campaign\u00a0in Mexico\u2019s history,\u00a0and ongoing high levels of violence across the country. At least\u00a034 political candidates or applicants have been murdered\u00a0since\u00a0June 2023\u00a0as gangs try and influence those coming into power, according to a report by research group Laboratorio Electoral, which also found hundreds of attacks on candidates and people related to the current electoral process. And while\u00a0the murder rate has fallen in Mexico\u00a0between 2019 and 2022, in absolute numbers the country is still reeling from historically high levels of homicides of around 30,000 people\u00a0murdered\u00a0each year, say experts. The central challenge for the next president will be\u00a0convincing voters that she can end the near-certain impunity in Mexico;\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved\u00a0in the country in\u00a02022, according to think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua. \u201cMexico is a country where more than nine out of 10 crimes committed against the population go unpunished,\u201d Stephanie Brewer, Mexico Director at the Washington Office for Latin America (WOLA), told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a country with low levels of reporting of crimes due largely to distrust in authorities, lack of faith in investigations, which can be very well founded.\u201d \u2018Paradoxical\u2019 Mexico is a world leader when it comes to gender equality in elected office, which was cemented in 2019 constitution\u00a0reform.\u00a0It\u00a0outflanks\u00a0several countries in\u00a0terms of women\u2019s\u00a0parliamentary representation. Yet Mexico remains a dangerous place to be a woman, with\u00a0sky-high femicide\u00a0rates for\u00a0the region.\u00a0The most\u00a0recent data\u00a0from Mexico\u2019s\u00a0National Institute of Statistics and Geography found that at least 11,852 femicides were recorded in the first three years of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s presidency \u2013 higher than the 7,439 reported during the same period of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s presidency (2012-2018). With security topping voter concerns, both Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez have largely remained coy about their proposals. Neither\u00a0has\u00a0repudiated a nearly two-decades-long approach of relying on the armed forces to tackle organized crime \u2013 which\u00a0has coincided with\u00a0historically high levels of homicides. Sheinbaum, a former climate scientist, has pledged to continue with her predecessor\u2019s policies. She has pointed to her record as Mexico City mayor, with her team indicating having improved conditions for police and better intelligence gathering about criminal networks. Galvez has been critical of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s non-confrontational approach to cartels. She has suggested\u00a0pulling forces back from\u00a0domestic security\u00a0roles, increasing the number of police in violent areas, and building a new high\u00a0security prison. \u201cIn 2018, millions of Mexicans voted for change with hope, but the truth is that it did not happen,\u201d\u00a0G\u00e1lvez\u00a0said during a presidential debate in April, taking aim at the incumbent\u2019s approach to tackling organized crime. \u201cClaudia Sheinbaum is offering to continue the hugs for criminals \u2026 I am offering to build a Mexico where we can end violence, but above all, to bet on health and education.\u201d Both have spoken of the need to strengthen police and civilian institutions, and better use intelligence and coordination. \u201cBut the extent to which either one of them really means to emphasize or follow through on that is very unclear,\u201d Brewer said. Experts have been underwhelmed by the lack of new approaches to the security situation, saying there is a connection between militarization and more bloodshed in the country since its inception\u00a0in\u00a02006,\u00a0when former President Felipe Calder\u00f3n declared an all-out-war against criminal groups. \u201cMexico cannot deploy its way out of problems like impunity or corruption in institutions or lack of effective criminal investigation,\u201d\u00a0Brewer\u00a0told CNN. \u201cMilitarization simply is not a tool that could ever do that.\u201d \u2018Hugs, not bullets\u2019 Incumbent L\u00f3pez Obrador won the presidency in 2018 on a platform of demilitarizing the country\u2019s war against drug cartels,\u00a0vowing\u00a0to restore peace with \u201chugs, not bullets.\u201d Popular social welfare programs would address the root causes of economic insecurity, instead of violent confrontations with criminal groups,\u00a0he promised. It was a strategy that saw the son of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d\u00a0Guzman released\u00a0on the orders of L\u00f3pez Obrador in 2019\u00a0to avoid bloodshed.\u00a0He was later re-arrested and extradited to the US. However,\u00a0he never really de-militarized public security.\u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador instead merged several law-enforcement agencies, such as the federal police, to create the\u00a0National Guard\u00a0that was,\u00a0in principle, to be under civilian command. But\u00a0he soon after\u00a0placed\u00a0the\u00a0body under the Secretary of Defense, sparking criticism across the political spectrum,\u00a0which said\u00a0it was furthering\u00a0militarization\u00a0in Mexico. The Supreme Court upheld an opposition complaint and ordered L\u00f3pez Obrador to return the National Guard to civilian jurisdiction. He said he would follow suit, but the National Guard still reports to the Secretary of Defense. This creation was part of what\u00a0Brewer described as a \u201cpopulist\u2026and highly visible measure that\u201d\u00a0intended to give\u00a0the perception that something is being done about crime. The National Guard has gone on to take\u00a0over several civilian\u00a0functions including building infrastructure projects and airport management \u00ad\u2013 a situation ripe for corruption, warn Mexico watchers. Meanwhile,\u00a0criminal groups have only expanded\u00a0their reach. A May report by the Crisis Group documented limited crime-fighting where there were large military deployments in areas most affected by warring cartels. Instead, the report found that \u201ca set of largely unspoken rules has been established, encouraging illegal groups to reduce and conceal the violence they perpetrate,\u201d the report wrote. \u201cIn exchange, authorities have turned a blind eye to a degree of illegality, enabling these organisations to diversify their trafficking operations (including into newer illicit drugs such as fentanyl), expand their extortion rackets, branch out into legal business, and assume greater control of communities and local governments.\u201d This may have distorted official statistics around homicides, Falko Ernst, a senior analyst on Mexico at the Crisis Group who led the report, told CNN. \u201cBut what we have seen in a number of high conflict states is that while official murders have dropped, disappearances have gone up, even the official ones, so that puts another question mark behind the drop in homicides,\u201d he said. The report found there was also political pressure to reduce the recorded rate of lethal violence has led to \u201cmurders being logged under other causes of death or going unrecorded.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Mexican Secretary of Defence for comment. There is a through line between militarization and gender-based violence in Mexico, say experts. Feminist groups in the country began documenting a \u201cdramatic increase in women being killed by firearms\u201d after 2007 as well as women being targeted in the public sphere,\u201d said\u00a0Gema Kloppe-Santamar\u00eda, assistant professor of Latin American History at George Washington University. Female homicides often fail to get prosecuted, with 88.6% impunity rate for femicide cases, according to Mexico Evalua. Both candidates have recognized the crisis of femicide, but Sheinbaum, who holds a sizeable polling lead against Galvaz, has a tense relationship with some feminists \u201cwho encountered lots of repression by Mexico City police under the purview of Sheinbaum,\u201d said Kloppe-Santamar\u00eda. Sheinbaum has touted her efforts for women and girls, saying there was \u201czero impunity\u201d to femicides in Mexico City during her time as leader, and that there was a large reduction in femicides under her watch. Though the claims have\u00a0not\u00a0borne out\u00a0after some scrutiny, say critics. Amid ongoing \u201cgender-based violence, including femicides and disappearances,\u201d Kloppe-Santamar\u00eda said, getting a female president at this moment feels\u00a0\u201cvery paradoxical.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/americas/mexico-female-president-violence-miltiarization-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_china_hong-kong-47-verdict-intl-hnk", "text": "More than a dozen of\u00a0Hong Kong\u2019s leading democracy figures were found guilty Thursday on subversion charges, following the largest national security trial since Beijing\u2019s sweeping crackdown on the once free-wheeling city. The 14 activists and politicians were convicted of \u201cconspiracy to commit subversion\u201d for their roles in holding\u00a0an unofficial primary election\u00a0in 2020 to decide who should contest city lawmaker elections. They were among 47 defendants in what became known as the trial of the \u201cHong Kong 47\u201d \u2013\u00a0a closely watched, landmark prosecution under a national security law\u00a0Beijing imposed on the city in the wake of mass anti-government protests the previous year. Those on trial represented a broad swathe of Hong Kong\u2019s now dismantled democracy movement and most pleaded guilty during the prosecution process. But 16 activists and politicians decided to fight the charges, opting for a full trial which lasted for more than a year. Two were acquitted on Thursday and walked free from the court. The remaining 45 now await sentencing at a later date and could face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Thursday\u2019s verdict offers one of the clearest windows into how the national security law has rewritten the city\u2019s political landscape, with a once-permitted pro-democracy opposition now decimated and dissent all but erased. The Hong Kong and Beijing governments have repeatedly denied the national security law is suppressing freedoms, arguing it has ended chaos and \u201crestored stability\u201d to the city. In an executive summary outlining the convictions, a panel of judges ruled the prosecution had proved the defendants were engaged in a conspiracy to disrupt the government\u2019s \u201cduties and functions \u2026 with a view to subverting the state power.\u201d Supporters of those convicted maintain they were simply taking part in the kind of oppositional politics that was once allowed to flourish in Hong Kong, and Thursday\u2019s verdict signals China\u2019s control of the once-outspoken city is all but complete. Since the national security law came into effect in 2020, civil groups have disbanded, and independent media outlets have been shut down. The city\u2019s legislature now comprises only of pro-Beijing loyalists, while most pro-democracy figures are either in jail or in exile overseas. The 47 defendants were first arrested in dawn raids on January 6, 2021 \u2013 1,240 days ago \u2013 and most have been held in detention for more than three years. They\u00a0include seasoned politicians, elected lawmakers and young protest leaders, as well as academics, unionists, journalists and medical workers. They hail from multiple generations and a wide political spectrum - from moderate democrats to those who advocate for Hong Kong\u2019s self-determination. Among those who pleaded not guilty and were convicted on Thursday\u00a0were former journalist Gwyneth Ho, 33, who famously live-streamed an attack on pro-democracy demonstrators inside a subway station, and former lawmaker Leung Kwok-hung, 68, known by the nickname \u201cLong Hair,\u201d a left-wing activist who began his long political career campaigning against British colonial rule. Following the verdicts, some family members cried openly in the courtroom and waved to the defendants. Some defendants smiled and waved back, others looked resigned. The two acquitted were former\u00a0district councilors\u00a0Lawrence Lau\u00a0and Lee Yu-shun, who took part in the unofficial primary held by democrats in 2020. \u201cToday, I shouldn\u2019t be the focus of attention. I hope everyone will continue to pay attention to\u00a0other friends in the case,\u201d Lau, a barrister, said after he walked free from the court. \u201cThank you very much for the concern over all the defendants of this case, please, please carry on your concern and give them love.\u201d Lee, sporting a golden chain and a tiger print shirt, said he could not say much even after being acquitted. \u201cBecause the Department of Justice has indicated that it may appeal, I cannot make any comments or give any opinions on the ruling or this case at this stage.\u201d he said. \u201cSo I can only tell you that I feel very calm and thank you for your concern. Now I want to go have dimsum with my family because I haven\u2019t been able to see them yet.\u201d Hours later, the prosecutors confirmed in court they would appeal against the acquittals. Human Rights Watch condemned the convictions, arguing the democracy leaders were prosecuted for \u201cpeaceful activism\u201d and that the verdict showed \u201cutter contempt for both democratic political processes and the rule of law.\u201d A \u2018vicious plot\u2019? The case of the \u201cHong Kong 47\u201d arose from an unofficial primary election held by the pro-democracy opposition in July 2020 for the city\u2019s legislature. The goal was to narrow down their best chances for candidates to try and win a majority, much like similar polls found in other democracies around the world. But Hong Kong authorities said the primary vote was a \u201cvicious plot\u201d intended to \u201cparalyze the government and undermine state power\u201d and accused those who took part of intending to use their mandate to block legislation indiscriminately. The Legislative Council election \u2013 which the defendants had hoped to win by holding the primary vote \u2013 was postponed to 2021 due to Covid health concerns cited by the authorities during the\u00a0pandemic. During the postponement, Beijing and Hong Kong authorities rewrote the city\u2019s electoral rules, putting in place a stricter screening system to weed out candidates deemed \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative Council currently has no pro-democracy lawmakers, and the upcoming district council elections, to be held in\u00a0December, also do not feature any pro-democracy candidates. In the face of a trial without jury,\u00a031 defendants pleaded guilty, a move that in Hong Kong usually leads to a reduced sentence. But that strategy is now in doubt after another local national security law enacted earlier this year curtailed access to reduced sentences for guilty pleas. Those who pleaded guilty included Joshua Wong, 27, who gained international fame as the face of Hong Kong\u2019s years of student-led democracy protests and\u00a0was labeled an \u201cextremist\u201d by China\u2019s state media, Benny Tai, 59, a former law professor and co-founder of the 2014 Occupy Central movement, and Claudia Mo, 67, a former journalist-turned-reform minded legislator. Sweeping changes Hong Kong\u2019s democracy activists are no strangers to courtrooms. Many served time for their activism. But the trial of the \u201cHong Kong 47\u201d showed how the legal system has changed under the national security law, which criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign powers and carries a maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Its wording, as well as its application, is more in keeping with laws in mainland China, where courts are tightly controlled by the ruling Communist Party and have a conviction rate above 99.9%. In contrast, Hong Kong follows a common law system that had been kept intact after the former British colony was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997. Nearly 300 people, aged between 15 and 90, have been arrested under the Beijing-imposed national security law since it was enacted, according to police. Like all national security cases so far, the trial of the Hong Kong 47 was heard without a jury, deviating from the common law tradition, a power granted by the Beijing-imposed law. It was also presided over by a bench of three High Court Judges designated by the city\u2019s Chief Executive to handle national security cases. The law also places a higher threshold for bail. Thirty-two defendants have been denied bail and have been in detention since 2021 \u2013 a highly unusual practice for cases that do not involve murder. Only 15 were granted bail, but two of them had their application revoked later for breaching bail conditions. The trial brought the imposition of mainland legal concepts, mainland law into the common law system into sharp relief, said John Burns, emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely clear that the national security law reduced the independence and the autonomy of the judiciary. No juries, much more difficult to get bail \u2013 those are all things that previously were determined by the judges.\u201d Legal scholars\u00a0and Western governments have lamented how the national security law has dealt a blow to the city\u2019s\u00a0judicial independence, but authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have warned foreign parties against interfering in the city\u2019s internal affairs and judicial system. Before the trial began in February, the Hong Kong government called criticism on the trial \u201cscandalizing of the criminal justice process\u201d and \u201ca blatant act undermining the rule of law of Hong Kong.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/china/hong-kong-47-verdict-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

Now it is also interested in a country with good public policy,\u201d said Rafael Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro Medina, director of the Center for US-Mexico Studies at the University of California, San Diego, pointing to the increasing number of Latinos in the US and the two countries\u2019 growing ties. Here are a look at some of the biggest issues affecting the US-Mexico relationship that will be influenced by Sunday\u2019s vote: It\u2019s the economy, stupid Mexico became the United States\u2019 top trading partner last year, surpassing China and Canada. Experts say this is largely because geopolitical issues such as the pandemic, the legacy of  Trump\u2019s trade war against China, and the war in Ukraine all encouraged near-shoring \u2013 the relocation of supply chains nearer to home \u2013 which boosted US imports from Mexico and its investment in the country. Key to facilitating this shift was the creation of the USMCA trade agreement, which came into effect in 2020 between Mexico, the United States and Canada. \u201cThe USMCA offered, in that favorable context, a legal regulatory framework that provided a lot of certainty to the three North American countries, and Mexico has seized the opportunities and strengthened its preferential tariffs to make this happen,\u201d explained Lila Abed, director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center. However, it\u2019s not all been plain sailing. Mexico\u2019s compliance with the USMCA has been an issue of contention between the administration of Mexico\u2019s current President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and those of both US President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump. \u201cThe next president of Mexico will have to deal with a series of legal disputes that the United States, supported by Canada, has filed within the framework of the USMCA,\u201d Abed points out. \u201cThese range from [L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s] ban on the import of transgenic corn for human consumption; the shift towards a nationalist energy policy, which has affected US investments in electricity and hydrocarbons, as well as the little importance given to clean energies,\u201d Abed said. According to Abed, whoever wins the Mexican presidency on June 2 will have to deal with a lawsuit filed by the United States on these issues. They will also have to renegotiate the agreement when it comes up for renewal in 2026. Many analysts believe the US is currently playing down disputes over the USMCA in the hope that this can ease differences in other areas, both in domestic Mexican issues \u2013 such as alleged human rights violations, the government\u2019s treatment of journalists, and the increase in political assassinations \u2013 and bilateral concerns such as immigration and the drug trade. \u201cIt\u2019s very transactional. Mexico agreed to partially manage the immigration crisis in the US, keeping immigrants in Mexican territory and taking care of their deportation, in exchange for the United States not activating these lawsuits,\u201d said Raquel L\u00f3pez Portillo Maltos, executive secretary of the youth group of the Mexican Council on Foreign Relations (Comexi) think tank. Jorge Alberto Schiavon Uriegas, vice president of the Center for Studies and Analysis on Mexico\u2019s Foreign Policy, said L\u00f3pez Obrador followed a quid pro quo policy towards both Trump and Biden, and this would possibly continue with Sheinbaum, if elected. \u201cMexico committed to addressing the two main Mexican issues affecting the United States and that will determine the next election: migration and fentanyl. In exchange, the United States dramatically reduced its criticism of Mexico\u2019s democratic and institutional weakness, and reduced its interventions, leaving more room for L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s domestic policy,\u201d said Schiavon Uriegas. Migration: Mexico, \u2018part of Trump\u2019s wall\u2019 While migration across the countries\u2019 1,933 miles long border is a shared concern, the issue is much lower on Mexican politicians\u2019 agenda than in the US \u2014 where it could be a decisive factor in the November vote, according to Carin Zissis, editor-in-chief of the Americas Society/Council of the Americas website. \u201cThe speeches of Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez on migration are neither very strong nor very different from each other, nor do they address too much what to do with migrants in the country,\u201d she said. \u201cProof of this is that, during the last presidential debate, when migration was addressed, the main angle was Mexican migrants currently living in the US; they were talking to their potential voters north of the border and to the Latino community in general, which is large and powerful due to remittances.\u201d The rub for US politicians is that they need buy-in from their Mexican counterparts if their own immigration policies are to succeed. Zissis gave the example of how Lopez Obrador had made Mexico \u201cpart of Trump\u2019s wall\u201d by sending \u201cthousands of members of the National Guard and the Army to take care of migration control.\u201d \u00a8Trump didn\u2019t have to build the wall because Mexico is the wall,\u201d said Zissis. Abed, of the Mexico Institute, said Mexico\u2019s next president would face a different conundrum to previous leaders, because the country had changed from being merely a transit country, which immigrants passed through on their way to the US, to being in many cases their final stop. \u201cThe reaction of the L\u00f3pez Obrador government has been to transport migrants who are waiting at the border between Mexico and the United States to the southeast of the country and leave them there. The migration authorities are overwhelmed, the Mexican Refugee Aid Commission (Comar) is also overwhelmed, the centers where migrants stay are very precarious, migrants \u2014 specifically unaccompanied minors and women, as well as young people \u2014 are at risk from organized crime and human traffickers, and their human rights could be violated,\u201d Abed detailed. She said the next Mexican government will need to assume responsibility for this large migrant population, \u201cand decide whether to give them a temporary visa, whether to allow them to work, whether they will have access to medical services, etc.\u201d Fentanyl and the drug trade Security is another pillar of the bilateral relationship, particularly in terms of the thriving cross-border drug trade that blights both countries. While the United States has been grappling with a domestic health crisis due to the amount of fentanyl on its streets, Mexico faces increasing cartel-linked violence \u2013 including in the run-up to the election which has been marred by dozens of assassination attempts and other political violence. \u201cM\u00e9xico has made progress in dismantling clandestine drug laboratories, but the next government must do more to stop the entry through maritime ports of precursor chemicals mostly coming from China, because after that is when they fall into the hands of organized crime to produce these synthetic opioids,\u201d Abed said. \u201cBut the United States also has to dismantle the network of traffickers within (its own borders). That is, once fentanyl arrives, its distribution throughout the territory is not magical. There is a significant network of organized crime in the United States that the administration must arrest, bring to trial, and whose activities it must restrict,\u201d she added. One issue the US may be keen to revisit with whoever wins on June 2 are the reforms to Mexico\u2019s National Security Law that the L\u00f3pez Obrador government implemented in 2018 as one of its first measures, which limited the activity of foreign agents operating on Mexican territory. \u201cIt was a symbol, a sign that the Mexican government was not going to open the door so easily to security agencies such as the DEA, the CIA, and others. He removed the diplomatic immunity (and) they had to register all their activities with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc,\u201d explained Abed. Experts who spoke to CNN said, however, that much of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s confrontational discourse with the United States was a facade that, at times, hid a well-oiled process of negotiations with both the Republican and Democratic administrations. \u201cL\u00f3pez Obrador often speaks to his Mexican base and then negotiates. He knows that the US needs him on migration and security matters,\u201d said Zissis at the Americas Society website.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/americas/mexico-elections-us-relationship-analysis-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}

We are investigating the case,\u201d Netanyahu said in a speech at the Israeli Knesset. At least 45 people were killed and more than 200 others injured after a fire broke out at the camp following the strike, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian medics. No hospital in Rafah had the capacity to take the number of casualties, the ministry said. Footage obtained by CNN showed the camp in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. \u201cSeveral civilians are still trapped inside the camp, which was attacked without warning,\u201d a Palestinian man filming the fire said. \u201cThis was declared a safe zone.\u201d United Nations Secretary-General\u00a0Ant\u00f2nio Guterres issued a blistering condemnation on Monday. \u201cI condemn Israel\u2019s actions which killed scores of innocent civilians who were only seeking shelter from this deadly conflict,\u201d\u00a0he said on X. \u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.\u201d A UN diplomat told CNN that the Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Tuesday to discuss the airstrike at the request of Algeria. It will hold private discussions at 3.30 p.m., the diplomat said. A US official told CNN Monday that Israel had told the Biden administration it used a precision munition to hit a target in Rafah, but that the explosion from the strike ignited a fuel tank nearby and started a fire that engulfed a camp for displaced Palestinians and led to dozens of deaths. \u201cWe can\u2019t confirm that but it\u2019s what Israel shared with us,\u201d the official said, \u201cand we assume we will learn more once Israel completes its investigation.\u201d The attack came after Hamas launched rockets at Tel Aviv on Sunday for the first time in months. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that eight rockets were fired from the Rafah area, and that \u201ca number of projectiles\u201d had been intercepted. The IDF said it destroyed the rocket launchers used by Hamas shortly after the strikes. The Israeli military said in a statement earlier on Monday that it had struck \u201ca compound in Rafah in which significant Hamas terrorists were operating.\u201d It said the strike killed two Hamas officials \u2013 West Bank Chief of Staff Yassin Rabia and senior Hamas member Khaled Nagar. CNN cannot verify these claims. The IDF said in a later statement Monday that its Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism \u2013 an independent body responsible for examining allegations of misconduct in conflict \u2013 will investigate the \u201ccircumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area of the strike.\u201d It was among the deadliest strikes by the Israeli military on Gaza\u2019s southernmost city since Israel began its operation there on May 7. It also came just days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations\u2019 top court, ordered Israel to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its military operation in Rafah, and any other action in the city, \u201cwhich may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d The IDF said the attack was conducted based on \u201cprior intelligence\u201d indicating that senior officials of Hamas\u2019 West Bank wing were present at the site. The IDF said it had assessed there would be \u201cno expected harm to uninvolved civilians.\u201d More than 36,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military operation there, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave, which started after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. \u2018Hell on earth\u2019 Footage of the aftermath shared on social media showed chaotic scenes. In one video, the lifeless body of a man was seen being dragged by the legs out of the flames. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, he\u2019s dead,\u201d a rescuer says before moving on to find others. In another video, a man wept as he held up the headless body of a toddler for the camera. Women shrieked in grief as children peered into the fire. A man with a bloodied face stood in apparent shock, examining his wounds with one hand, as he held an infant with blood-stained clothes in the other arm. One of the bodies pulled out of the fire was charred-stiff. By Monday morning, the camp was in ruins with small fires still burning. Men and boys gathered around, rummaging through the burned and smoking wreckage for food and their belongings as drones hovered above. One of the structures still standing was a sign that read: \u201cKuwait peace camp 1.\u201d Children and women living in makeshift tents were among those killed, according to a post on X from UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. \u201cThe images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on earth,\u201d the commissioner-general said Monday. \u201cOthers were reportedly burnt to death,\u201d Lazzarini said. The reporting is based on open-source photos and videos which were shared with UNRWA, including from social media, UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma told CNN. Mohammad Abu Al Subeh, a displaced Palestinian man who survived the strike, said as he was lying in bed in the evening when he saw \u201crockets fired down at us.\u201d \u201cIt shook the earth like an earthquake,\u201d Abu Al Subeh, who fled his home in Nuseirat some five months ago, told CNN. He had to escape through the window of his makeshift house  in the desert area where the camp is located. \u201cI came here based on the leaflet that was dropped (by Israel) saying go to this humanitarian area,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just civilians here.\u201d Abu Nidal Al Attar, another displaced Palestinian who witnessed the attack, told CNN: \u201cWe were sitting as normal people do\u201d when they suddenly saw strikes and fire. \u201cWe went to see, and they were pulling out burned people.\u201d Hamas called the attack \u201ca horrific war crime\u201d and \u201cterrible massacre.\u201d International outrage International condemnation was swift, with UN agencies, aid groups and governments calling on Israel to respect the ICJ ruling and halt its Rafah operation. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday condemned the airstrike. \u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cDespite the ICJ binding ruling, Israel struck Rafah and Hamas fired rockets to Israel,\u201d the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, wrote Monday on X. \u00a0On Monday, in a meeting with Arab leaders to discuss Gaza and the Middle, Borrell said that \u201cwhat we have seen in the immediate hours is that Israel continues the military action that it has been asked to stop.\u201d Medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it was \u201chorrified by this deadly event, which shows once again that nowhere is safe.\u201d The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said \u201cGaza is hell on earth,\u201d referring to the Rafah attack. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \u201coutraged\u201d and called for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire.\u201d Critics have pushed back on Israel\u2019s claims. Already worried about an intensifying war right on its border with Gaza, Egypt on Monday condemned Israel\u2019s strike on Rafah, calling on the Jewish state to implement the ICJ ruling of \u201chalting military operations\u201d in Rafah and to \u201ccomply with its responsibilities as an occupying power\u201d. A mediator in the war, Egypt is set to host another round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas on Tuesday. Qatar, another key mediator, said Israel\u2019s strike could \u201chinder\u201d ongoing negotiations, and called the attack a \u201cserious violation of international law.\u201d Over a million Palestinians had been sheltering in Rafah before Israel began its operations there, having fled there from other areas of Gaza after Israel began its military campaign in the territory. Israel has said it had ordered civilians to leave some areas of Rafah, but many remain there, sheltering in what Israel designated as \u201csafe zones.\u201d More than 800,000 people have fled Rafah since May 6, according to UN figures. Israel has vowed to press on with its Rafah operation despite international outrage and a US warning not to proceed. In response to the ICJ ruling last week, Israel said it \u201chas not and will not conduct military actions in the Rafah area which may inflict on the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d Clarification: This story has been updated after additional review of the translation from Hebrew to English, to clarify the wording used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he referred to a deadly Israeli strike on Rafah, Gaza.\u00a0The word\u00a0\u201cerror\u201dwas originally translated as \u201cmistake.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/middleeast/gaza-rafah-displaced-people-camp-israel-strike-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "weather_us-leads-tornado-numbers-tornado-alley-xpn", "text": "The US averages over 1,150 tornadoes every year. That\u2019s more than any other country. In fact, it\u2019s more than Canada, Australia and all European countries combined.  Within the US, every state has had at least one tornado, and some have dozens each year.  The US is special in terms of producing so many tornadoes, especially violent ones. In the US, the average number of tornado fatalities per year is 73. But in Europe, where the tornadoes are usually much weaker, the fatalities are estimated to be between 10 and 15 annually. Some states are deadlier than others Texas on average has 140 tornadoes every year \u2013 the most of any state. Kansas, Florida, Oklahoma, and Nebraska round out the top five. But the total number of tornadoes does not always tell the whole story. For example, despite Alabama having on average 42 tornadoes per year \u2013 more than three times fewer than Texas \u2013 it is at the top of the list for tornado fatalities. Alabama averages 14 tornado fatalities per year, almost double the next highest \u2013 Missouri with eight deaths per year. The time of day and the topography where the tornado occurs makes a big difference in the fatality rate. The topography in Alabama and other Southern states often includes rolling hills, plateaus, and many more trees than the Plains states like Kansas, Texas, and Nebraska, where a tornado often can be seen from miles away. The more likely a tornado can be seen often leads to the tornado being reported faster, allowing more time for people to be warned and seek shelter. Southern states such as Tennessee, Kentucky and  Arkansas also see more tornadoes overnight versus any other state. This can lead to higher fatalities, since many people are sleeping and unaware that a tornado is approaching.  \u201cTornadoes in the Southeast tend to be more dangerous than their Great Plains counterparts,\u201d says Brandon Miller, CNN Meteorologist.  \u201cThere are a number of reasons for this, some weather and some geographic. Southeastern tornadoes often travel faster, moved by a faster jet stream.\u201d  All of these factors can lead to higher fatality rate in Southern states compared to the Plains. But all of these states have a few things in common: the ideal atmospheric conditions for tornadoes to form. \u201cThe basic ingredients for severe thunderstorms that can make tornadoes are warm, moist air near the ground, relatively dry, cool air aloft (about 10,000 to 30,000 feet), and horizontal winds in the environment the storm forms in that increase as you go from the ground up and change direction with height, blowing from the equator near the ground and from the west aloft,\u201d says Dr. Harold Brooks, senior scientist with the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory. Low pressure systems in the US pull warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air aloft from the Rocky Mountains or the High Desert in the southwest. The states that fall in between those two regions end up being in the ideal location for severe weather to ignite.  \u201cNo place else in the world has the large warm water on its equatorward side with a wide high range of mountains extending from north to south to the west of it,\u201d Dr. Brooks said. \u201cAll the other tornado prone regions have at least one feature suboptimal.\u201d  The US leads every other country for tornadoes Other countries experience tornadoes, including Germany, Australia, South Africa, eastern China, Japan, Bangladesh, Argentina, and more. Europe as a whole is comparable to the size of the US, but there is a vast difference in number of tornadoes and tornado fatalities.  From 2011 to 2020, the US averaged a preliminary total of 1,173 tornadoes per year, and Europe around 256. However, Dr. Pieter Groenemeijer, Director of the European Severe Storms Laboratory (ESSL), cautions that the European number may be on the low side. \u201cWeaker tornadoes are likely still under-reported in some countries, such as France and the UK,\u201d Groenemeijer says. European Russia (which is the part of the country west of 58 degrees East longitude), tops the list at 86 tornadoes annually. Germany comes in second with an average 28 tornadoes annually. The peak density of tornado reports coincides with the high population density over Belgium, the Netherlands, and northern Germany, according to a study on severe storms in Europe published in December 2020. The study also reports that thunderstorms are twice as frequent over the United States, with as many as four times more storm reports, compared to Europe. One thing most countries have in common is the time of day that tornadoes occur, which is most frequently during the afternoon and early evening. But the peak season is not the same. In the US, spring is the peak for tornado activity. For central and northern Europe the main tornado season is in summer, whereas it is autumn for the western and central Mediterranean region, and winter in the eastern Mediterranean. Outside of the US, Canada actually ranks second on the list for most tornadoes, with an average of 100 per year. Tornadoes are not limited to the Northern Hemisphere. Australia has dozens every year, and South Africa also reports annual occurrences. South America, much like other continents, has its own tornado hotspot, known as \u201cpasillo de los tornados.\u201d This tornado corridor includes Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and a portion of Brazil.  According to the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, tornadoes are relatively rare there. On average, around seven to 10 moderate to strong tornado events are reported in New Zealand every year. Southern Hemisphere tornadoes typically rotate clockwise, which is the opposite of how tornadoes primarily spin in the Northern Hemisphere.

{"id": "2024_05_31_americas_vatican-sodalitium-christianae-vitae-peru-investigation-in", "text": "Like many victims of sexual abuse, it took years for Santiago to acknowledge that he was raped as a teenager. \u201cYou get into a kind of mental confusion there is something that is not right, but it is not clear at that time,\u201d Santiago,\u00a0who is being identified only by\u00a0a pseudonym\u00a0to protect his privacy, told CNN in an exclusive interview. Four decades on, he is still waiting for a measure of justice to address his claims against Sodalitium Christianae Vitae (SCV), a\u00a0secretive\u00a0Roman Catholic society founded in Peru that has been mired in scandal since its layman founder Luis Fernando Figari and other senior members were accused of sexually abusing numerous adult and minor recruits. Santiago\u00a0says\u00a0that he was sexually abused by Figari at least three times in the 1970s, when he turned 17. He recalled Figari leading him to a room and raping him, saying it was \u201cthe only way to correctly see his aura.\u201d He doesn\u2019t\u00a0clearly\u00a0remember other incidents. \u201cIt is difficult to count because your brain starts to block things, I have tried, but there are some memories that are blocked,\u201d he said. CNN has reached out to Figari\u2019s legal team\u00a0as well as SCV for comment.\u00a0Figari has denied all the allegations against him. Santiago is among the dozens of reported\u00a0victims\u00a0who have been waiting eagerly for the Vatican to reveal its findings about the SCV allegations, after a months-long investigation. SCV has already admitted that sexual, physical and\u00a0psychological\u00a0abuse took place. In 2017, it removed Figari\u00a0from the group and published a\u00a0two-part report\u00a0by international experts that found that more than a dozen men and three women alleged being sexually\u00a0abused\u00a0by SCV members\u00a0when they were young adults. In the report\u2019s preface, SCV asked for \u201cforgiveness from each person that has been hurt by a member or a former member of the\u00a0Sodalitium,\u201d and\u00a0said the organization was \u201ccommitted to a process of self-examination and of change.\u201d Now the case has moved into the hands of church authorities in Vatican City, whom victims hope will be able to take serious measures including disbanding the entire organization. As part of the ongoing investigation, the Vatican sent letters to several SCV members in February giving them 45 days to respond to allegations of abuse, according to a source familiar with the investigation. Vatican top abuse investigators, Archbishop Charles Scicluna and Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu,\u00a0made a\u00a0surprise\u00a0visit to Lima in July 2023, interviewing\u00a0victims including\u00a0Santiago and SCV representatives, among others. SCV told CNN via email the organization received specific guidance from the Vatican\u2019s mission in March to open investigations against former members, but the information is confidential. For now, it is unclear when the investigation results will be delivered, or in what form. But in August last year, Pope Francis confirmed to\u00a0reporters,\u00a0\u201cWe\u00a0are working on this. We are trying to bring the situation to light.\u201d Decades of \u2018impunity\u2019 SCV was founded in 1971 in Peru and has chapters across Latin America. In Peru, the lay organization,\u00a0under Figari\u2019s charge, recruited mostly young White\u00a0boys from elite Catholic schools and upper and middle-class families with political or business links, journalist and SCV\u00a0victim\u00a0Pedro Salinas told CNN. Many of them came from\u00a0families with divorced or single parents, according to former members. An explosive 2015 book by journalists Salinas and Paola Ugaz revealed 30 anonymous testimonies from SCV victims\u00a0including Santiago\u2019s, shocking conservative Peruvian society but only resulting in\u00a0failed leadership reforms and an ongoing court case against the group that has largely gone nowhere. In the book, titled \u201cHalf Monks, Half Soldiers,\u201d former SCV\u00a0members detailed that once the recruits reached the legal age, 18, they were encouraged to leave home and cut ties with family\u00a0and friends. Teenagers who were recruited were\u00a0brainwashed \u201cto become a kind of zombie, a robot, a fanatic, where there is a syncretism that mixes the Catholic religion with fascist ideas \u2013 Spanish fascism,\u201d according to Salinas, who says he himself was physically and psychologically abused at the Sodalitium when he was a teenager. Figari was seen as a charismatic figure, but he was also\u00a0described by former and current members as\u00a0\u201cvulgar, vindictive, manipulative, racist, sexist, elitist,\u00a0and obsessed with\u00a0sexual issues and the sexual orientation of SCV members,\u201d the 2017 SCV report found. It added that Figari committed \u201cmultiple acts of sodomy of a minor male and a young adult male,\u201d\u00a0filmed young recruits \u201cin their underwear or bathing suits,\u201d and\u00a0directed them to perform sex acts on each other and himself, all under the justification of it being part of their spiritual formation. Figari denied\u00a0all\u00a0the\u00a0allegations publicly for the first time in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m innocent, totally innocent. I come here to tell the truth because the authorities have not allowed me to speak,\u201d\u00a0Figari told reporters in Rome. CNN has requested an interview with Figari\u2019s lawyer but has not received any response. It is believed he still resides in Italy. Military training and alleged sexual abuse When Santiago first joined the group as a curious student, he was keen to learn not only about religion but also about mysticism and the power of the mind, he told CNN. At the age of 15, Figari told him he had great mental powers and offered to train him in ancient techniques, Santiago said.\u00a0Part of this training involved Santiago only\u00a0wearing underwear and sitting on Figari\u2019s leg, he said. On another occasion, Figari made Santiago and another minor sit in the lotus position and asked them to touch each other, including their genitals, Santiago said. Years later, Santiago first reported his abuse to SCV members and filed a complaint against Figari at Lima\u2019s Archdiocesan Tribunal in 2011.\u00a0He did not get an official response or follow up,\u00a0he said. According to the 2017 SCV report, Figari also\u00a0imposed military training, gleaned from movies he watched, on the young recruits: Young boys were ordered to swim \u201cin cold ocean waters for several hours at a time\u201d\u00a0late at night or very early in the morning,\u00a0run long distances in severe weather and sleep on floors or stairs. Another\u00a0victim,\u00a0Oscar Osterling, now 51, told CNN that when he was 18 he and three other recruits were made to form a line naked and were filmed. He eventually joined SCV\u2019s team as community leader\u00a010\u00a0years later but said he\u00a0regrets potentially playing a part in the psychological abuse of other young recruits. \u201cAfter making my complaint I thought: \u201cHow many people I have also affected?,\u201d he said, adding that he has since \u201ccalled many people to ask for forgiveness.\u201d SCV declined to be interviewed for this article, saying they are fully cooperating with the Vatican\u2019s inquiry and highlighted\u00a0a private audience between its General Superior Jose David Correa and Pope Francis on\u00a0December\u00a01, when they shared \u201cupdated information about the organization.\u201d The search for justice According to Salinas and other victims, the steps toward accountability taken by SCV so far are not enough. They want to see the perpetrators formally punished and the organization dissolved. The Peruvian legal system so far has not led to any\u00a0resolution. A criminal case in Peru against Figari and other SCV members was dropped by Peru\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office in 2017, with prosecutors\u00a0saying\u00a0none of the alleged sexual abuse\u00a0victims\u00a0had come forward and\u00a0that\u00a0the alleged crimes fell outside the statute of limitations.\u00a0A\u00a0separate case on allegations of kidnapping, serious psychological injuries, and illicit association to commit a crime, is still working its way through the justice system. \u201cAfter so many years, this legal case is about justice for the victims and not about money, and that also means no impunity for those who have committed those crimes,\u201d\u00a0Dr. Jose Ugaz, former ad-hoc state attorney who represents seven of the victims,\u00a0told CNN. His clients demand\u00a0\u201cthis organization to stop\u00a0and (that)\u00a0harm does not continue to be caused to new children, teenagers or young people in Peru and in other several countries where it has expanded,\u201d he said. \u201cSodalitium is still active.\u201d Salinas, who has written to Pope Francis about the case, is pinning his hopes for justice on the Vatican\u2019s investigation. The Vatican has the power to dissolve SCV \u2013 a measure that Peruvian Cardinal Pedro Barreto has already called for. Pope Francis could also order sweeping reforms of the group, including the expulsion of members and special measures that must be followed. And the Pope recently changed the church\u2019s Code of Canon Law in 2021 to make lay people who hold an office in the church accountable for abuse, which would appear to\u00a0apply to Figari,\u00a0who is not a cleric. Church penalties for him could include fines, removal from all offices and expulsion from SCV. For the victims,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0about being heard and recognized after so many years. \u201cI felt privileged, I felt listened to \u2026 (with) that phone call,\u201d\u00a0 Santiago told CNN about\u00a0when he first learned the Pope\u2019s envoys wanted to meet him.

{"id": "2024_05_29_asia_chinese-ships-japan-senkaku-islands-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "China Coast Guard ships have been in waters around Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea for a record 158 consecutive days, according to Tokyo\u2019s latest count released Monday, surpassing the previous record set in 2021. Analysts fear the uninhabited islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China, have the potential to become a flashpoint for conflict between the two Asian neighbors. \u201cThe Japanese government takes very seriously the fact that there have been a succession of vessels sailing in the contiguous zone and trespassing in territorial waters,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at a Monday briefing in Tokyo. The Japanese government\u2019s chief spokesperson did not say how often Chinese ships entered Japan\u2019s territorial waters, though foreign ships are allowed \u201cinnocent passage\u201d through such waters. A contiguous zone extends another 12 nautical miles beyond a country\u2019s territorial waters, the area that stretches 12 nautical miles from the shore. Foreign warships are allowed into contiguous zone waters \u2013 so the Chinese Coast Guard hasn\u2019t broken any international agreements \u2013 but the continuous presence of the Chinese vessels there is seen as a provocation. Hayashi said Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has raised Tokyo\u2019s \u201cserious concerns\u201d with Chinese Premier Li Qiang during a trilateral summit with South Korea in Seoul on Monday. \u201cWe will continue to take every possible precaution and surveillance around the Senkaku Islands with a sense of urgency,\u201d he said. Competing claims The uninhabited island chain has been a sore spot in Japan-China relations for years. Claims over the rocky chain, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) southwest of Tokyo but only about 205 miles (330 kilometers) from China\u2019s east coast, date back centuries, and neither Japan nor China is likely to back down over territory considered a national birthright in both capitals. Tensions heated up in 2012, after Tokyo bought some of the islands from a private Japanese owner, which Beijing took as a direct challenge to its sovereignty claims. It has frequently dispatched China Coast Guard and other government vessels to the waters around the islands to assert those claims. \u201cDiaoyu Dao and its affiliated islands are China\u2019s inherent territory,\u201d Beijing\u2019s foreign ministry said. \u201cIt is legal and reasonable for our Coast Guard to conduct normal patrols in waters administered by China.\u201d Experts have said China makes a statement and sets up a possible legal argument for sovereignty over the islands by keeping government ships near them. To present an international legal claim to the islands over Japan, \u201cChina simply needs to establish a greater and more enduring presence of its ships in the waters around the islands,\u201d James Brown, an associate professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo, told CNN in 2022. Hayashi, the Japanese government spokesperson, said Monday that Tokyo is answering the Chinese presence around the islands with vessels of its own. \u201cWe ensure a comprehensive security system for territorial waters by deploying Coast Guard patrol vessels that are consistently superior to other party\u2019s capacity,\u201d Hayashi said. Any Japanese-Chinese incident in the Senkakus raises the risk of a wider conflict, analysts note, due to Japan\u2019s mutual defense treaty with the United States. Washington has made clear on numerous occasions that it considers the Senkakus to be covered by the pact. China exerts pressure at sea The extended Chinese presence around the Senkakus comes as Chinese forces assert themselves in two other East Asian hotspots \u2013 around Taiwan and near Philippines-controlled features in the South China Sea. China staged its largest military exercises this year around Taiwan last week after the island\u2019s new democratically elected leader, President Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity, was sworn in. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary. And in the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard has been taking action against Philippine vessels trying to resupply a contingent of Philippine marines on Second Thomas Shoal, using water cannons that have injured Filipino sailors and damaged their craft. The developments come as leaders and military officials prepare to gather in Singapore for the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia\u2019s premier defense summit. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is scheduled to give the keynote speech Friday evening, with Chinese-Philippine clashes around Second Thomas Shoal expected to be a prime topic. The US and Chinese defense chiefs are also expected to address the conference. CNN\u2019s Himari Semans contributed to this report.

{"id": "2024_05_29_india_india-narendra-modi-meditation-island-election-intl-hnk", "text": "India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on his way to meditate inside an island shrine for two days to cap weeks of election campaigning \u2013 his latest public display of religiosity days after proclaiming he was sent by god. India\u2019s election is the world\u2019s largest, a mammoth exercise in democracy that has taken place over six weeks. The final day of voting takes place on Saturday and results will be announced three days later. Modi will visit the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari, a pilgrimage site off India\u2019s southernmost tip, from May 30 to June 1, according to Indian state broadcaster DD News. The site is where popular Hindu monk and philosopher Swami Vivekananda attained enlightenment. Modi has twice before ended an election campaign with meditation. But he has recently been making increasingly grand displays of piety, to capitalize on Hindu-nationalist sentiment as he eyes a third consecutive five-year term in power. In an interview last week with local news channel NDTV, Modi said: \u201cI\u2019m convinced that God has sent me for a purpose, and when that purpose is finished, my work will be done.\u201d \u201cGod doesn\u2019t reveal his cards. He just keeps making me do things,\u201d he continued. India is constitutionally bound to secularism, but since assuming power in 2014 Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have promoted a strident brand of Hindu nationalism that has deepened religious divides. When he first contested national elections a decade ago, Modi chose India\u2019s spiritual capital Varanasi as his constituency, making the ancient city the perfect backdrop to meld his religious and political ambitions. At the end of that campaign, Modi visited Pratapgad in the western state of Maharashtra, where the Hindu-led Maratha forces won a historic battle against the Mughal empire army in the 17th century. Toward the end of the 2019 national elections, which he also won, Modi went to meditate in the revered Kedarnath shrine dedicated to Hindu deity Lord Shiva high in the Himalayas. In January, just months before campaigning began, Modi consecrated the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, a controversial Hindu temple that was built on the site of a destroyed mosque, taking on a role typically reserved for priests. In a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith, critics say Modi\u2019s brandishing of Hinduism has led to rising Islamophobia and persecution of the country\u2019s more than 200 million Muslims. Modi and the\u00a0BJP have increasingly resorted to overtly Islamophobic language during his recent election speeches. In a controversial speech last month, Modi said that if the opposition wins, they would distribute the country\u2019s wealth among \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and \u201cthose who have more children,\u201d in apparent reference to the Muslim community.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/india/india-narendra-modi-meditation-island-election-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_31_travel_library-book-1939-late-scli-intl", "text": "There\u2019s nothing like getting lost in a good book, but one reader in Finland seems to have taken that to an extreme. Staff at a public library in Helsinki were rather surprised when a copy of Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s \u201cThe Refugees\u201d was returned to them more than eight decades after its due date. The novel, which is a Finnish translation of the English original, was received at Helsinki Central Library Oodi\u2019s lobby on Monday - more than 84 years after its due date of December 26, 1939. The returned book contained the borrower\u2019s library card, leading staff to believe that the original patron who took out the book was a businessman from the Pursimiehenkatu area of the Finnish capital. Librarian Heini Strand, who received the book at the library, told CNN in an email Friday: \u201cThe one who returned the book didn\u2019t tell - and we didn\u2019t ask - what was their relation to the one who originally loaned the book.\u201d Strand added: \u201cWe get these kinds of returnings that are tens of years late every once in a while, and many times they are books that friends and family find when they go through the belongings of a deceased relative. I don\u2019t know if this was the case with this book.\u201d The timing of the due date could be crucial in trying to explain why the book was never returned - the Soviet Union attacked Finland on November 30, 1939. Strand said: \u201cThe winter war had started just a month before the due date, so probably returning of a library loan wasn\u2019t the first thing on the loaners mind at the due date.\u201d The copy was in reasonably good shape considering its age and may now return to circulation for public borrowing. Strand said that the library already has two copies of the book in its collection, adding: \u201cWe sent the book to the book storage of Helsinki city library\u2019s main library which is in Pasila. \u201cThe people working there can decide whether to take it in to the collection or not. If it\u2019s taken in, then library customers can reserve it online and loan the book.\u201d The maximum penalty for an overdue book at the Helsinki library is \u20ac6 ($6.50) but no fine is being levied as the book was no longer in the library\u2019s system, which had changed many times since it was initially borrowed. Siina Tiuraniemi, a librarian colleague of Strand, told CNN: \u201cOur purpose is not to guard the books, we are here to promote reading and enable access to books and knowledge to everyone. The library is a very humane place, and people in Finland use the libraries a lot and understand how they work. Library books belong to all of us and late returns are not a big problem.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/31/travel/library-book-1939-late-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_weather_hawaii-power-cuts-wildfires", "text": "The main power utility in Hawaii will cut off electricity to some areas in future extreme weather conditions to avoid another wildfire disaster, the state announced Wednesday. The Public Safety Power Shutoff program is in response to last year\u2019s fire that\u00a0killed more than 100 people in Lahaina\u00a0on the island of Maui and left $6 billion in damages. \u201cThis means they may turn off power in high-risk wildfire areas during extreme weather conditions,\u201d the Hawaii Division of Consumer advocacy said in a\u00a0public notice\u00a0Wednesday. \u201cWhile this may create hardships for affected customers, PSPS aims to prevent wildfires caused by downed power lines.\u201d The new program goes into effect July 1. Hawaiian Electric says\u00a0on its website\u00a0that \u201ca best-case scenario\u201d would allow them to give people 24-48 hours\u2019 notice before a shutdown.\u00a0According to the public notice,\u00a0residents would be notified of a potential shutoff through news releases, social media, outage maps or the Hawaiian Electric website. If weather changes suddenly, then a shutoff may occur with little or no notice. High wind and red flag warnings were issued by the National Weather Service on August 8, the day of the devastating Maui wildfires. But during the disaster,\u00a0the community\u2019s siren warning system did not sound. Investigations\u00a0by the state and the Western Fire Chiefs Association said the disaster was exacerbated by lack of preparation and coordination. Maui County\u2019s top emergency management official\u00a0resigned\u00a0days after defending the siren\u2019s silence, citing health reasons. Maui\u2019s government filed a lawsuit in August accusing Hawaiian Electric of causing the wildfires. The lawsuit alleged the electric company\u00a0\u201cinexcusably kept their power lines energized,\u201d despite the National Weather Service\u2019s warning that winds could knock down power lines and cause fires. The utility announced Wednesday it designated\u00a0high-risk areas\u00a0in three of the state\u2019s counties \u2013 including parts of the west coast of Oahu, its most populous island \u2013 where emergency power shutoffs are authorized in a weather emergency. Hawaiian Electric says\u00a0over 48,000 customers\u00a0are in the affected areas. \u201cThis is an action that is a last line of defense,\u201d said Hawaiian Electric vice president Jim Kelly at a news conference. Hawaii\u2019s new power shutoff program is based on a\u00a0similar program\u00a0that has been in place in California since 2012.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/weather/hawaii-power-cuts-wildfires/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_uk_alderney-british-island-nazi-atrocities-intl-gbr", "text": "Alderney, a quiet British island in the English Channel known for its outstanding natural beauty, was once the site of the only Nazi camps\u00a0on British soil \u2013 and a hell on Earth for its thousands of inmates. A fresh inquiry, ordered by the UK\u2019s Special Envoy for Post Holocaust Issues,\u00a0Eric\u00a0Pickles, and led by a panel of experts, has sought to determine the exact death toll of prisoners and\u00a0laborers\u00a0on Alderney, while also bringing an end to the conspiracy theories and misinformation surrounding the island. The findings were published on Wednesday and determined there were a greater number of deaths than initially documented following liberation, but found no evidence of a \u201cmini-Auschwitz.\u201d The inquiry also explored why the Nazi perpetrators \u2013 most of whom evaded justice \u2013 never stood trial in Britain. Stretching for three square miles, the island was occupied by the Nazis for most of World War II. During that time, three forced\u00a0labor\u00a0camps and a concentration camp called Lager Sylt were built. Nearly eight decades later, the fingerprints of Nazi occupation are still visible on the picturesque island, including bunkers, anti-tank walls and the notorious Water Lane tunnels constructed by the occupying forces to store munitions and fuel. According to its tourist board, the residents of Alderney \u2013 which has a population of just over 2,000 \u2013 gather once a year in May for a memorial service to commemorate the island\u2019s victims. Described by Pickles as housing the \u201cmost westerly concentration camp in the Third Reich,\u201d questions over the scale of horror that occurred on the island have persisted among locals as well as internationally \u2013 and the exact number of dead has never been clear, until now. The Channel Islands were the only British land the Germans occupied during World\u00a0War II.\u00a0Unlike Jersey and Guernsey \u2013 the other Nazi-occupied islands \u2013 Alderney was evacuated of nearly all of its residents, meaning the island does not have extensive war-time records. According to Pickles, the lack of records has led to unsubstantiated claims being made about Alderney and the war crimes that took place there. \u201cClaims of mass murder that anywhere else would be checked carefully have been accepted at face value,\u201d\u00a0Pickles \u2013 who has stressed the importance of historic accuracy regarding the Holocaust \u2013 said. \u201cThird- or fourth-hand testimonies of atrocities, without any supporting evidence, are given as a\u00a0fact\u2026 What\u00a0happened on Alderney was bad enough with its brutality, sadism and murder, without the need for embellishment.\u201d \u2018Unvarnished truth\u2019 Following the island\u2019s liberation from the Nazis, official figures from a post-war investigation put the death toll at 389. This figure has long been disputed. Historians, members of the Jewish community and members of the public have estimates ranging from hundreds to several thousand. Speculation has also been rife that the true scale of what happened on the island may have been deliberately concealed by the British government. The inquiry denies such theories. It found that the number of deaths in Alderney is unlikely to have exceeded 1,134, with a more likely range of deaths being between 641 and 1,027. In addition, at least 97 people died and one disappeared during transit to and from the island. The estimated minimum number of prisoners or\u00a0laborers\u00a0sent to Alderney throughout the German occupation stands between 7,608 and 7,812, the panel found. Alderney\u2019s camps, according to the inquiry, shared many of the traits of those in mainland Europe.\u00a0Laborers\u00a0were kept in atrocious conditions and forced to work long hours carrying out dangerous construction work. They were subject to beatings, maiming,\u00a0torture and\u00a0in some cases executions. The inquiry found that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d for arguing that many thousands of victims died. Assertions that Alderney housed an extermination center and constituted a\u00a0\u201cmini-Auschwitz\u201d\u00a0are also untrue, the panel found. \u201cPrisoners were treated appallingly, and life was cheap, but Alderney did not house a \u2018mini-Auschwitz\u2019; there was no extermination centre on the island,\u201d\u00a0Pickles said. He added, \u201cAnyone who claims so has never visited Auschwitz or understood the extent of the Nazi\u2019s death factories in Eastern Europe.\u201d Pickles believes overestimated death tolls at the hands of the Nazis can be damaging and play into the hands of Holocaust deniers. \u201cAt a time when parts of Europe are seeking to rinse their history through the Holocaust, the British Isles must tell the unvarnished truth,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cNumbers do matter. It is as much of a Holocaust distortion to exaggerate the number of deaths as it is to underplay the numbers.\u201d He added, \u201cExaggeration plays into the hands of Holocaust deniers and undermines the six million dead. The truth can never harm us.\u201d \u2018Egregious injustice\u2019 A separate section of the inquiry focused on the failure to prosecute war crimes committed in Alderney, something that it described as an \u201cegregious injustice.\u201d This was due to the British government\u2019s decision to hand the case over to the Soviet Union after World\u00a0War II\u00a0as the majority of victims were Soviet citizens. Research conducted by Anthony Glees, an academic\u00a0and adviser to Pickles,\u00a0found there had been a \u201csuccession of cover-ups\u201d on the part of the British government, which handed all Alderney\u2019s files of evidence over to the Soviet Union via the United Nations War Crimes commission on September 12, 1945. From there, the USSR decided to \u201cdo nothing with the evidence,\u201d according to Glees, meaning that the majority of perpetrators who had systematically tortured and in some cases murdered their victims escaped trial. Glees believes that this has deliberately been hidden from public view by the British government. He is calling on the government to issue an apology. \u201cIt seems scarcely understandable that Britain, of all countries, declined to try Nazi war criminals for appalling atrocities committed on British soil against citizens of some 30 nations,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, the British authorities passed all the evidence that they had carefully collected in the so-called \u2018Alderney Case\u2019 to the\u00a0USSR\u2026\u00a0despite the USSR not having requested it and so, apparently, directly contravening Britain\u2019s international treaty obligations.\u201d According to Glee, the lack of trials of Alderney\u2019s war criminals has meant that justice was denied to victims and their families. Pickles, meanwhile, said the fact that the perpetrators never faced British justice is a \u201cstain on the reputations of successive British governments.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/uk/alderney-british-island-nazi-atrocities-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_world_all-eyes-on-rafah-image-ai-cec", "text": "It\u2019s unclear exactly what the image is. A series of tents? Truck beds against a rust orange background? Multicolored rectangles? Mountains are visible in the background, and in the foreground are the following words: \u201cAll Eyes on Rafah\u201d \u2014\u00a0 a reference to the southernmost Gazan city that became the center of war coverage this week, after an Israeli strike on a refugee camp in the city, on what had been labeled a safe zone, killed dozens of already displaced Palestinians. In the wake of the attack, the aforementioned image has seemingly been everywhere. Likely created using artificial intelligence, the graphic \u2014 which is not an actual picture from Rafah or the war in Gaza \u2014 has been shared more than 46 million times on Instagram alone. It\u2019s become so ubiquitous, comedian Tim Dillon noted it\u2019s been shared like \u201cit\u2019s a new show on NBC.\u201d But the picture\u2019s popularity has raised questions and critiques on the passivity of the act. Eyes being on Rafah has not stopped the violence, wrote scientist Ayesha Khan on Instagram. Simply posting an ambiguous graphic is performative, Khan and others have noted. Still, the post\u2019s momentum has continued. Here\u2019s where the phrase comes from, where the graphic originated and what it could signal. Where did \u2018All Eyes on Rafah\u2019 come from? The phrase \u201cAll Eyes on Rafah\u201d has been appearing in various graphics and images associated with the war in Gaza for months and is not necessarily tied to this specific viral image. It likely originated from comments made in February by Rik Peeperkorn, who leads the World Health Organization\u2019s office in the West Bank and in Gaza. At the time, more than 1.5 million Palestinian refugees, many of whom had been fleeing from the north and the center parts of Gaza, were crammed into the southernmost city of Rafah, which was also undergoing a wave of Israeli airstrikes \u2014 attempts to \u201chit Hamas terrorists in the area,\u201d an IDF spokesperson said. \u201cAll eyes\u201d were on Rafah, Peeperkorn said, a phrase which then became widely used by activists and made its way into graphics, like the one currently going viral. Instagram credits user shahv4012 as the creator behind the story template, which includes a watermark to the account chaa.my, listed as his second account. The user behind the accounts did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. What makes this image so popular? There are a few aspects of this image that may have contributed to its popularity, noted Faiza Hirji, an associate professor at Ontario\u2019s McMaster University who studies race, religion and media. One is the image\u2019s inherent shareability. Because it\u2019s not an actual image of the violence, it\u2019s instead a more \u201csanitized\u201d rendering, Hirji told CNN, which means there\u2019s less risk of social media platforms suppressing it from being shared. This allows the image to circulate more readily than would actual images of war. Also, the way the image is being shared on Instagram \u2014 with a handy \u201cadd yours\u201d feature that allows users to easily repost the image onto their own personal stories \u2014 only aids in its viral success. The easier it is to share, the more likely it is that people will do so. Still, there\u2019s been some criticism of the image. To understand the graphic, the user would need to have some sense of what is actually happening in Rafah and would therefore know that the image being shared does not actually depict the violence and the scale of destruction taking place. For some, this could make the graphic more appealing, while others have argued that the image takes away from what is actually occurring on the ground. \u201cI think for some people, this also causes a kind of discomfort,\u201d Hirji said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re directing everyone\u2019s gaze to an image that doesn\u2019t really show the horror of what happens in conflict zones.\u201d What does \u2018All Eyes on Rafah\u2019 mean? Others have pointed out that the image does not actually include the words \u201cPalestine\u201d or \u201cGaza\u201d \u2014 names that have been widely politicized even before October 7. \u201cRafah does not have the immediate name recognition for people who haven\u2019t been paying attention,\u201d said writer Heben Nigatu on X. \u201cAre people Googling Rafah? Sharing without looking it up?\u201d Everybody likely has differing motivations behind sharing an image. For some, sharing the image might be a call for others to investigate what\u2019s happening in the region, and in Rafah specifically, Hirji said. Reposting the image could be a way to say to an audience: \u201cDon\u2019t look away. You can\u2019t pretend this isn\u2019t happening.\u201d Other interpretations are less charitable. Take for instance the argument that the graphic is a performative gesture, an image that can\u2019t be bothered to show the reality in Gaza with a vaguely political statement stamped atop \u2014 not dissimilar to the black squares posted on social media during the racial reckoning of 2020. But unlike debates about racism in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s murder, for many people in the West the war in Gaza is not happening close to home. This could make it difficult for people to feel empowered, Hirji said, in terms of their direct ability to affect the war\u2019s outcome. \u201cI think that many people are powerless and feel that powerlessness,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of it may be performative, but maybe they feel that the only action they can really take at this time is to at least raise awareness. And so this notion of \u2018All Eyes on Rafah,\u2019 if it can be a bit informative or educational, then perhaps there\u2019s a sense that this is the action they can take.\u201d And still, there are worries of \u201cslacktivism,\u201d the notion that all we need to do to change the world is share a single infographic enough times. \u201cWe need far more than performative rallies and symbolic protests that don\u2019t aim to disrupt anything,\u201d wrote Khan. \u201cBearing witness is still a passive act. And we shouldn\u2019t coddle ourselves pretending like a post a day \u2026 is substantial.\u201d The phrase itself \u2014 keeping \u201ceyes on\u201d a place \u2014 inherently prioritizes the audience rather than Rafah, creating a distance between the viewers and the victims. And still, Hirji said, even amid calls to not look away, the world often does so anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s important, you could say, that if nothing else, we acknowledge our complicity, or we acknowledge our inaction,\u201d Hirji said. \u201cThat\u2019s one interpretation.\u201d But there\u2019s another interpretation, too, which could be that audiences are setting themselves up as watchers to this trauma, Hirji noted, becoming both indifferent and inactive. History and research of past conflicts in parts of the Middle East or the Global South speak for itself, Hirji said \u2014 \u201coften so much of what we do is we watch, we judge, we comment,\u201d even while not knowing enough about the places we are watching or commenting on. \u201cAnd is that also a point that some people are trying to make by having this call out? To say: So we\u2019re watching it, now what?\u201d Hirji said. \u201cWhat happens after watching?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/world/all-eyes-on-rafah-image-ai-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/01/2024", "section": "world"}}
