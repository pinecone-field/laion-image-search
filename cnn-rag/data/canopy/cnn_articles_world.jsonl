Citing sources from inside the meeting, the Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica newspapers reported Monday that the Pope had made the comments while meeting with Italian bishops on May 20. The newspaper articles, which were translated from Italian, claimed the Pope had said there is \u201cfrociaggine\u201d \u2013 which translates in English to \u201cfaggotry\u201d \u2013 in some of the seminaries. The remarks took place in the context of proposals from the Italian bishops to amend guidelines on candidates to seminaries. The Vatican ruled in 2005 that the church cannot allow the ordination of men who are actively gay or have \u201cdeep-seated\u201d homosexual tendencies. In 2016, Francis upheld this ruling. Two years later he told the Italian bishops not to accept gay candidates for the priesthood. During his pontificate, the Pope has sought to offer a more welcoming approach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, saying \u201cwho am I to judge?\u201d when asked about gay priests, and has also offered the possibility that priests could offer informal blessings for same-sex couples. The Corriere della Sera newspaper stated that the Argentine pope, who speaks Italian as a second language, may not have been aware of how offensive his language was, adding that the remark was greeted with incredulous laughter by the bishops. A source close to the Pope told CNN that it could also be understood as there is a \u201cgay climate\u201d in the seminaries. There is no official transcript of the comments due to the nature of the closed-door meeting. CNN has reached out to the Vatican to request comment on whether the Pope used the term. They have not yet responded.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/europe/pope-francis-accused-homophobic-slur-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

An explosion. But as the\u00a010-year-old\u00a0younger son of Larisa and Mykola Glushko staggered in the dark,\u00a0toward\u00a0his mother\u2019s room, he\u00a0realized\u00a0he was awake, and that his mother lay before him, crushed beneath a collapsed concrete baton. \u201cSomething\u00a0fell,\u201d\u00a0he recalled.\u00a0\u201cMom\u00a0was saying, \u2018Kolya, Kolya.\u2019 I\u00a0shouted,\u00a0\u2018Mom, I\u2019m alive.\u2019\u201d He said he frantically scraped the dust from his face and eyes. \u201cI saw my\u00a0Mom crushed down by the ceiling. I tried to pull it\u00a0away,\u00a0but I couldn\u2019t.\u00a0Mom was moaning and shaking her legs. And I was\u00a0shouting,\u00a0\u2018Mother, mother, it\u2019s just a dream, a horrible dream.\u2019\u201d Mykola had a similar nightmare days earlier, and felt it might be recurring. \u201cThen there was darkness.\u201d His mother died in front of him. His father was killed by the initial explosion. Hours earlier, the family had a barbecue, and Mykola senior drank one beer too many and talked passionately about enlisting. In the pitch black, his son clambered outside, the front of their comfortable family home beyond recognition, its gates torn clean away. Mykola said: \u201cI was\u00a0screaming,\u00a0\u2018God, why did you do this to\u00a0me?\u2019\u00a0I was running in underwear asking for help.\u201d For Mykola, the act of survival stretches what any\u00a010-year-old\u00a0could be expected to\u00a0bear. His\u00a0loss,\u00a0part of a patina of suffering across Ukraine\u2019s two years of war, where Russian missiles that slammed inexplicably into civilian targets, claim lives that do not make the headlines, and unravel childhoods in ways that will echo for decades in Ukraine. Mykola was given a shot\u00a0of medicine\u00a0to calm him in\u00a0hospital,\u00a0and his brother came to explain what had happened. \u201cHe told me now it\u2019s only me and him left. He repeated it four times. I was trying to calm myself down, but also hated myself. Because I couldn\u2019t save my mom.\u201d He\u00a0has spoken\u00a0with his new guardian, his godmother,\u00a0who lives\u00a0nearby,\u00a0and is\u00a0clear he will stay\u00a0in the military town of Pokrovsk to tend their graves. \u201cI will visit them,\u201d he said. \u201c(I will)\u00a0apologize for not able to save them. Will apologize to my father that I couldn\u2019t save my mom, his wife.\u201d He\u00a0said\u00a0his dream now is\u00a0different, to ask his\u00a0parents\u00a0important questions.\u00a0\u201cWhat should I do now? How do I live? Another dream is to take revenge on the one who launched the missile.\u201d Across the\u00a0eastern frontline, notably\u00a0around Pokrovsk, the\u00a0pace of Russia\u2019s advance appears to quicken, and with it the unspeakable loss of families like Mykola\u2019s. At the ruins of his home,\u00a0neighbors\u00a0said\u00a0there is no military target nearby. Workers\u00a0sifted\u00a0through the dust. The smell of the decaying family dog lingered. On a nearby radio, Russians are so close their\u00a0stations\u00a0were\u00a0audible, explaining to their audience how the West refuses to give Ukraine modern equipment and so \u201cthe ordinary boys from Ukrainian armed forces will be the ones to suck it up.\u201d A short drive away, at a\u00a0stabilization\u00a0point in an\u00a0eastern town, the life-changing hideousness of even light injuries\u00a0wasapparent. Sunset means frontline units can begin the task of evacuating their wounded, safe from the Russian attack drones that haunt daylight hours. The medical point\u00a0waited\u00a0in complete darkness, and a car\u00a0raced\u00a0out from the night. Two wounded soldiers from\u00a0Klishchiivka\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a town where Moscow has recently claimed success, partially owing to Ukraine having to relocate forces from there to defend against the onslaught in Kharkiv region\u00a0\u2013\u00a0emerged\u00a0from the car. One has his head fully bandaged up and talked,\u00a0his arms outstretched,\u00a0as\u00a0groped\u00a0his way\u00a0forward. The other\u00a0was laid\u00a0flat on a gurney. They\u00a0were\u00a0quickly tended to. Clothes\u00a0were\u00a0gently cut away. One had\u00a0damage to his eyes, swollen shut, yet appearedotherwise less badly hurt. The other had\u00a0shrapnel in his leg, flesh injuries to his arm, and\u00a0was\u00a0peppered with shrapnel on his back. His face\u00a0was\u00a0covered with dirt and his eyes also struggled\u00a0to open. A mortar landed about\u00a0four\u00a0feet\u00a0(1.2 meters)\u00a0from their dugout. It is a matter of luck and a few feet that they are still physically intact. The staff swiftly tried\u00a0to clean their eyes. \u201cWhen I open the eye like this, do you see the light?\u201d a\u00a0doctor asked. \u201cWhat about people?\u201d The patient could\u00a0only see light. A nurse noticed\u00a0damage to his right hand. They examined\u00a0his back and saw\u00a0a morass of tiny wounds. Suddenly, the patient worsened. \u201cSomething on my\u00a0side,\u201d\u00a0he screamed. It is possible the force of the blast caused internal injuries. The doctors moved\u00a0to quickly intervene. Anaesthetic\u00a0was\u00a0injected into his lung, and a tube inserted. \u201cCough, and it will get better,\u201d a doctor\u00a0told\u00a0the patient. Around the pair, there\u00a0were\u00a0four empty beds. A year ago, one doctor, Ivan, told\u00a0us, they could have 250 patients a day, when the Russian assault on Bakhmut was at its peak. Yet the drop in patients does not herald an improvement in Ukraine\u2019s war. The 93rd mechanized brigade lacks infantry, and finds it hard to resupply and position them on the frontline because of the threat of Russian drones, an official\u00a0told\u00a0us, and so this stabilization unit lacks patients. It is a chilling reminder of the manpower shortage Kyiv is dealing with after two years of war. The patients\u00a0were\u00a0led to a waiting ambulance, which\u00a0left\u00a0in the pitch black, its headlights off. Russia has targeted medical facilities before.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/europe/eastern-ukraine-oprhan-stories-of-loss-cmd-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_weather_memorial-day-weekend-forecast-monday", "text": "Millions in the East are in the path of severe weather on Memorial Day after intense and deadly storms ravaged a large area of the central United States over the weekend. Destructive thunderstorms and tornadoes were responsible for at least 23 deaths over the long weekend, including four children, in parts of Kentucky, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma and Alabama. The storms killed 15 in Arkansas and Texas alone. Another five people died in Kentucky. LIVE UPDATES: At least 23 killed in tornado-spawning storms sweeping central US Sunday was the busiest severe weather day of the year so far, with more than 600 reports of storm damage across at least 20 states, including tornadoes, wind gusts in excess of 75 mph and hail the size of softballs. Storms turned buildings into piles of rubble, damaged cars and brought down power lines. More than 450,000 homes and businesses in the central, southern and eastern US were still without power in the wake of weekend storms Monday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us. Harsh storms pummeled parts of Kentucky Sunday night and inflicted damage on some communities, prompting Gov. Andy Beshear to issue a state of emergency early Monday. Phone lines in the Bowling Green area were knocked out, leading police to set up alternate emergency numbers for those who needed help. The National Weather Service office in Paducah, Kentucky, is sending out at least two storm survey teams Monday to assess damage, the office said. Five storm-related deaths have been reported in the state \u2013 one in Hardin County, one in Hopkins County, one in Caldwell County, one in Mercer County and one about 70 miles away in Louisville. Another person is \u201cfighting for their life,\u201d Beshear said in a Monday news conference. Severe thunderstorm threat shifts to East More than 70 million people from the South to the Northeast are under a level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms Monday. Severe thunderstorms will rumble to life through Monday evening in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, including a vast section of the I-95 corridor. Storms in the regions could unload damaging wind gusts, hail and tornadoes. Tornadoes are possible in any severe storms that develop in the East Monday, but areas from eastern North Carolina to eastern Pennsylvania and western New Jersey are at a slightly increased risk. Richmond, Virginia, DC, Baltimore and Philadelphia are just a few cities that could contend with tornadoes. Storms will also unload drenching rainfall which could lead to flooding, especially in low-lying or urban areas. A level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall is in place for parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland. Severe thunderstorms in the East will come to an end Monday night after tracking offshore and out into the Atlantic Ocean. Isolated severe thunderstorms could bubble up later Monday afternoon and evening in parts of the southern Plains. A level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place in north-central Texas and includes the Dallas-Fort Worth metro. Large hail and damaging wind gusts are the main threats with any storms in the area, but a tornado is also possible. High temperatures scorch parts of the South High temperatures and an early season heat wave are making for a sweltering Memorial Day holiday across parts of southern Texas, the central Gulf Coast and southern Florida. Excessive heat warnings are in effect through Monday evening for parts of Texas while heat advisories stretch from Texas to Mississippi. Houston; New Orleans; Miami; Mobile, Alabama; Tampa, Florida; and Charleston, South Carolina, are some areas experiencing extreme warmth Monday. Air temperatures in some locations were rising to near-record highs mid-afternoon Monday, with heat index readings exceeding 110 degrees from Texas to southern Louisiana. The heat index \u2013 a measure of how the body actually feels when it\u2019s hot out \u2013 was between 110 and 115 degrees in parts of the Houston metro Monday afternoon. It broke into the low 120s near Texas\u2019 border with Mexico. The heat index soared to at least 108 degrees in New Orleans and flirted with the triple-digit mark in Mobile, Alabama. Nightfall may not bring relief in some areas. Overnight low temperature are expected to be 10 to 15 degrees above normal and could be record-warm in dozens of locations. Such extreme, prolonged heat raises the risk of heat illness such as heat stroke, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, adults with underlying health conditions, pregnant women and outdoor workers. The risks of excessive heat \u2013 the most deadly form of extreme weather \u2013 are becoming more widespread as human-driven climate change drives warming global temperatures. During the warm season last year, heat-related illnesses accounted for a 20% larger share of emergency department visits than they did in the five previous seasons.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

The congestion charge was introduced in 2003 in order to stem traffic and pollution in central London. Drivers within the congestion charge zone are required to pay a $19 daily charge between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays and 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. on weekends. TfL says it will pursue all unpaid fees and said in a statement it is even \u201cpushing for the matter to be taken up at the International Court of Justice.\u201d The US embassy has declined to pay up and is claiming diplomatic immunity from the fines. \u201cIn accordance with international law as reflected in the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, our position is that the Congestion Charge is a tax from which diplomatic missions are exempt,\u201d\u00a0a US embassy spokesperson said. \u201cOur long-standing position is shared by many other diplomatic missions in London,\u201d the spokesperson added. However, TfL is insisting that in agreement with the UK government, London\u2019s congestion charge constitutes a service and not tax. \u201cThis means that diplomats are not exempt from paying it.\u201d It has also politely declared there to be a \u201cstubborn minority\u201d of embassies that do not pay the charge, despite \u201crepresentations through diplomatic channels,\u201d and posted a lengthy list of offenders. As of December 31, 2023, a total of 161 embassies, high commissions and consulates owed more than $182 million combined in unpaid congestion charge fees, according to TfL data. According to TfL\u2019s figures, the Japanese embassy owes the second highest amount from unpaid congestion charge fees, at around $12.8 million.  This not the first time a dispute has emerged over whether the US embassy should pay the charge. In July 2005, the embassy issued a diplomatic note, claiming the charge \u201cis a tax that cannot be lawfully imposed on the U.S. Government, its diplomatic and consular personnel, or its military force.\u201d While the embassy initially paid the charge, it stopped doing so on July 12, 2005, declaring the charge to be \u201cin tension\u201d with \u201cduties owed to foreign missions and diplomats.\u201d In 2020, then UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said British officials held \u201cmeetings with a number of diplomatic missions and international organisations\u201d to press for \u201cpayment of outstanding fines and debt,\u201d including \u201cunpaid congestion charge\u201d fees. The Japanese embassy told CNN \u201cthe Government of Japan is of the view that the charge corresponds to neither \u2018dues and taxes\u2026 such as represent payment for specific services rendered\u2019 nor \u2018charges levied for specific services rendered\u2019, as stipulated in the relevant international conventions, and therefore the Embassy, its diplomatic agents and their family members should be exempt from the charge.\u201d The UK Foreign Office said that diplomats are expected to pay the charge, adding that they believe there are no legal grounds for diplomatic exemptions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/uk/us-embassy-london-congestion-fees-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

Bette inspired generations of flight attendants. Fly high, Bette.\u201d The Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), the union representing flight attendants in the United States, posted its own tribute to Nash on Facebook. \u201cBette\u2019s remarkable career spanned over six decades, during which she touched countless lives with her warmth, dedication and unparalleled service,\u201d said the post. \u201cHer passion for flying and her commitment to her passengers were truly inspiring. Bette\u2019s legacy will forever be remembered in the aviation community and by all who had the privilege of knowing her.\u201d Nash started her lifelong career with the now-defunct Eastern Airlines in Washington, DC, on November 4, 1957. In 2016, CNN had an opportunity to fly with her on her daily route from Reagan Washington National to Boston Logan on American Airlines. Nash, who was 80 at the time, said the romance and glamor of flying initially attracted her to the job. \u201cI wanted to be a flight attendant from the time I got on the first airplane \u2013 I was 16 years old, I was sitting with my mother on a green leather couch at Washington [Reagan National Airport], and this crew came up from TWA,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThe pilot and the flight attendant walked across the hall and I thought \u2018Oh my God,\u2019 and I said that was for me.\u201d Nash said she went on to get a college degree, but she never deviated from her dream. She applied for a job as a stewardess, as flight attendants were then known, shortly after graduating. \u201cAnd the rest is history,\u201d she told CNN with a big smile. According to ABC News,\u00a0Nash never officially retired from her role with American Airlines and died on May 17 in hospice care. From blackboards to tablets, Nash has seen it all Nash was awarded the Guinness World Record for having the longest career as a flight attendant in early 2022. \u201cHer career surpasses the last longest flight attendant with 63 years, 61 days as of January 4, 2021,\u201d said the Guinness announcement. Nash saw many changes in the world of aviation over those six-plus decades of flight, telling CNN planes were places of luxury when she started flying, a time when everyone wore their Sunday best and ate lobster on real china. \u201cYou worked harder physically in those days,\u201d said Nash. \u201cWe served this big meal tray. And I was the only one on the plane, so I had to take care of everybody.\u201d But the biggest changes she witnessed over the years related to technology. When Nash first began flying, all flight schedules were chalked up on a blackboard, and manuals and regulations came in book form. Eventually, those papers were replaced with tablets \u2013 which she says was a big adjustment. \u201cTechnology really made the difference of, \u2018Am I going to stay or am I going to go?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut even when I think I might retire or something, then I come to work and think, \u2018Oh, I couldn\u2019t do that.\u2019 It\u2019s stimulating coming out here.

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall", "text": "Microsoft\u2019s buzziest new AI feature is raising concerns that it could potentially be misused in the wrong hands. This week, the company showed off a new tool called Recall for Windows computers that acts as a personal \u201ctime machine,\u201d allowing users to quickly pull up anything that\u2019s ever been on screen, such as documents, images and websites. It\u2019s different from a keyword search; the tool regularly saves screenshots of the user\u2019s screen and stores them directly on the device. It then uses AI to process the data and make it searchable. For example, if someone previously searched for a green dress or the name of a local ice cream shop, they can ask the feature to \u201crecall\u201d anything in their history that was shown on screen. Although so-called semantic search is a big step forward for AI, it comes at a time when the industry is moving so quickly and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Jen Golbeck \u2013 a professor of AI at the University of Maryland who focuses on privacy\u00a0\u2013 said the recall feature could pose a potential \u201cnightmare\u201d if the device falls into the wrong hands. \u201cStuff may stay on your device, but that doesn\u2019t mean people can\u2019t get to it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou won\u2019t have an option to protect yourself even if you use incognito mode or clear your history because the tool has access to everything that\u2019s been on your screen.\u201d The UK\u2019s independent regulator for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), told CNN it is investigating the tool \u201cto understand the safeguards in place to protect user privacy.\u201d \u201cWe expect organisations to be transparent with users about how their data is being used and only process personal data to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a specific purpose,\u201d the ICO said in a statement. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CEO Satya Nadella told The Wall Street Journal in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s launch that web searches must only be done on Microsoft\u2019s Edge web browser and that the screenshots never leave the user\u2019s computer. \u201cYou have to put two things together: This is my computer and this is my Recall \u2013 and it\u2019s all being done locally,\u201d he said. Geoff Blaber, CEO of market research firm CCS Insight, said that makes the issue less concerning. \u201cThe backlash by some to this feature isn\u2019t surprising, but it\u2019s an overreaction given that the data stays exclusively on the device and the user has full control,\u201d Blaber said. Someone can decide whether to turn the feature on during the device setup process and can customize and blacklist which apps and websites Recall can access. \u201cThese controls suggest the feature has been built with security and privacy at its core,\u201d he said. \u201cRecall won\u2019t appeal to everyone but the utility provided is likely to be significant.\u201d Potential for malicious uses But Golbeck cited times when that protection might not be enough, such as a journalist in a hostile country, a person trying to get out of an abusive relationship, someone searching for sensitive medical information or an employee whose boss wants to track them. She believes issues around the tool will likely impact the workplace the most. \u201cWe know jobs monitor what we\u2019re doing on their devices, but a lot of people will do a personal thing on their work computer and all of that will be archived and visible to an IT department, even if it just stays on device,\u201d she added. Golbeck said technology, despite the benefits, is too often developed without the consideration of malicious uses. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the last 15 years is every single one of those potential malicious use cases comes to fruition in some way or another,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will want to use this cool feature without understanding the privacy risk \u2013 that there will be a permanent record of everything you do.\u201d Similar reactions to features such as biometric passwords, such as fingerprints, facial recognition and iris scans, have emerged in the past. Blaber said to overcome some of the initial concerns, Microsoft and its partners will need to prove the value, security and privacy of the product in the real world. Still, Michela Menting, a senior research director at ABI Research, believes the feature is a \u201cstep backwards\u201d for privacy. \u201cThe argument that hackers need physical access to even be able to manipulate Recall is short-sighted at best because there are plenty of highly ingenious ways threat actors could exploit such a valuable tool,\u201d she said. \u201cAll it takes is time and effort to find a way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

Each of us will now undertake whatever national steps are necessary to give effect to that decision.\u201d \u201cThere is never a wrong time to do the right thing,\u201d Harris later said, speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiana Amanpour on Thursday. \u201cIt was my government\u2019s preferred position to recognize a two-state solution as part of a peace process to bring that about, but sadly, unfortunately, such a comprehensive peace settlement now seems, in many ways, further away than it has ever been,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe believe you can\u2019t say you\u2019re in favor of a two-state solution and not recognize the very existence of two states,\u201d he added. The recognition will come into force in all three countries on May 28, according to Irish Foreign Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. Norway\u2019s\u00a0Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said that a Palestinian state was \u201ca prerequisite for achieving peace in the Middle East.\u201d \u201cThere will be no peace in the Middle East without a two-state solution,\u201d St\u00f8re said in a statement. \u201cThere can be no two-state solution without a Palestinian state.\u201d Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez sought to characterize the decision as one that was not anti-Israel. \u201cThis recognition is not against the people of Israel and certainly not against the Jewish people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in favor of Hamas. It\u2019s in favor of co-existence.\u201d The announcement was welcomed by Palestinian officials. \u201cThis step reflects Spain\u2019s keenness to support the Palestinian people and their inalienable and legitimate rights to their land and homeland,\u201d the office of the president of the Palestinian Authority said in response to Madrid\u2019s decision, as reported by Palestinian news agency Wafa. Hamas, the militant group which governs Gaza, urged other countries to follow suit and \u201crecognize our legitimate national rights, support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence, and end the Zionist occupation of our land.\u201d But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said recognizing a Palestinian state would be a \u201creward for terror.\u201d \u201cThis will be a terror state, which will attempt to perpetrate the onslaught of October 7 time and again, and to that we shall not agree,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding, \u201cthis evil must not be given a state.\u201d As Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors to Spain, Norway and Ireland, he said, in a statement: \u201cI am sending a clear message today \u2014 Israel will not hold back against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security.\u201d \u201cAfter the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has seen, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state,\u201d Katz added. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza\u00a0on October 7\u00a0after militants led by Hamas killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israel has come under fierce criticism for its war. Earlier this month, a panel of independent UN experts condemned \u201cthe continued and systematic onslaught of violence committed against Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d The agency has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages taken by Hamas. Israeli attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza have since killed at least\u00a035,647\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a079,852\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures. Two-state solution All three European leaders stressed the importance of having Palestinian statehood in reaching a two-state solution in the Middle East, a decades-long goal that the international community has failed to achieve. Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister Martin said the decision came amid \u201cgrowing impatience\u201d with Israel\u2019s lack of political will for a two-state solution. \u201cThe integrity of that two-state solution has been undermined in recent years by the strategy of the Israeli government and, in particular, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has declared opposition to it,\u201d Martin told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest during a live interview. Meanwhile, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson that Israel was wrong to see recognizing Palestinian statehood as rewarding Hamas. \u201cWe are sending the opposite signal. We are supporting the Palestine authorities which spring out of the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] who renounce violence and who many decades ago promised to leave the violent struggle behind and work for peaceful settlement with Israel \u2014 a promise they have kept by the way,\u201d Eide said. Senior officials in the United States, a close ally of Israel, have insisted the only way to bring peace and stability to the region is through the creation of a Palestinian state with guarantees for Israel\u2019s security. Lawmakers in Israel have long rejected those calls. Reacting to the news on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesperson told CNN that US President Joe Biden \u201cis a strong supporter\u201d of a two-state solution. The spokesperson added, however: \u201cHe believes a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\u201d France, meanwhile, said that now is not the \u201cright time\u201d for it to join its European neighbors in recognizing a Palestinian state. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Stephane S\u00e9journe, added that such a decision is not merely a \u201csymbolic issue or a question of political positioning\u201d but rather a \u201cdiplomatic tool\u201d in the service of a two-state solution. Germany, another one of Israel\u2019s staunchest allies, also questioned the decision. Michael Roth, the chair of the parliament\u2019s\u00a0Foreign Affairs Committee, posted on X: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that the recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state is an appropriate measure after the horrific massacres (by) Hamas (on) October 7 last year.\u201d Qatar, a key mediator in stalled ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, said it hopes \u201cfor more countries to recognize the State of Palestine,\u201d according to a statement from the foreign ministry. The foreign ministry of Saudi Arabia, another regional actor, called on \u201cmore countries to swiftly take the same stance.\u201d Ireland has a long history of being openly supportive of the Palestinian cause, consistently criticizing Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank and Gaza before Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack in Israel. Since then, Israel\u2019s war in response has shredded huge parts of the Gaza Strip and drained critical supplies, exposing the entire population of more than 2.2 million people to the risk of famine. \u201cI can say this to the people of Israel: we recognize the state of Israel. We recognize the state of Israel\u2019s right to live in peace and security. That is their right. The people of Palestine also must have an equivalent right to peace and security,\u201d Harris told Amanpour on Thursday. \u201cAnd let me also say this to the people of Israel: the Irish people know what it\u2019s like to have their national identity hijacked by a terrorist organization. The IRA was never the people of Ireland and Hamas is not the people of Palestine.\u201d \u201cWe have been clear and unequivocal that we condemn Hamas, that we condemn the most horrific barbaric massacre that Israel experienced on the 7th\u00a0of October. We call for the unconditional and immediate release of all hostages. But it is entirely possible to say what I have just said and also say the next bit which sadly some refuse to say: that what is happening in Palestine, what is happening in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe, that children are being starved, are being deprived of food and that there are children who will go to sleep in Gaza tonight not sure if they will wake in the morning,\u201d he added. A source familiar with the matter told CNN the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently considering further diplomatic steps against the three countries. Steps under consideration include cancelling visits of officials from these countries to Israel and revoking visas from diplomats, which will limit their ability to visit areas in the West Bank under control of the Palestinian Authority, the source said. Another step under consideration by Israel is to reach out to the US to seek diplomatic support in providing clarification from Norway, Ireland and Spain on their intended decision, and to ask the US to try and convince other countries to not follow suit. Pressure on Israel The planned recognition adds pressure on Israel after seven months of fighting, according to H.A. Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies in London. \u201cFor individual Palestinians on the ground in the Occupied Territories, it\u2019s not going to mean anything at all in the short term, perhaps in the medium term,\u201d Hellyer told CNN. \u201cIt is obviously political recognition by states that don\u2019t have a presence on the ground.\u201d Hellyer added that Israel risks becoming an \u201cinternational pariah\u201d given that Western nations are now beginning to recognize a Palestinian state.  Israel captured Gaza from Egypt in the 1967 war, then withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005. The territory, home to some 2 million Palestinians, fell under Hamas\u2019 rule in 2007. After Hamas took control, Israel and Egypt imposed a strict siege on the territory, which is ongoing. Israel also maintains an air and naval blockade on Gaza. These severe restrictions have been fiercely criticized by international bodies, including Amnesty International,\u00a0who say\u00a0Israel has violated international law. The vast majority of the population in Gaza are descendants of 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were\u00a0forcibly expelled\u00a0from their homes during what Palestinians call\u00a0al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d of the 1948-49 war, in what is now Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/middleeast/palestinian-statehood-spain-norway-ireland-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

The flight, which landed in Dublin shortly before 1pm local time, was met by emergency services, including airport police and the fire and rescue department. According to a statement from Dublin Airport, six passengers and six crew members were injured in the incident, eight of which were taken to hospital following assessment. The Qatar Airways flight QR017 experienced turbulence while flying over Turkey, the statement said. Dublin Airport said it was assisting passengers and staff and that operations were unaffected. The plane\u2019s return flight to Doha, flight QR018, is scheduled to go ahead as expected, though its departure will be delayed, the airport said. In a statement to CNN, Qatar Airways said that the flight landed safely in Dublin, but that \u201ca small number of passengers and crew sustained minor injuries in flight and are now receiving medical attention.\u201d \u201cThe matter is now subject to an internal investigation,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThe safety and security of our passengers and crew are our top priority.\u201d It comes days after 104 passengers were injured and a man with a heart condition was killed on a Singapore Airlines flight that was hit with severe turbulence. Flight SQ321 from London to Singapore was cruising at 37,000 feet on Tuesday\u00a0when the plane\u00a0dropped sharply before climbing\u00a0several hundred feet, according to flight tracking data. It then repeatedly dipped and ascended for about a minute. Is turbulence on the rise? About 65,000 aircraft suffer moderate turbulence every year in the US, and about 5,500 run into severe turbulence. These numbers, however, might be destined to grow. Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom, told CNN in 2022 that he believes climate change is modifying turbulence. \u201cWe ran some computer simulations and found that severe turbulence could double or triple in the coming decades,\u201d Williams said. The findings, which were later confirmed by observations, highlight a type of turbulence called \u201cclear air turbulence,\u201d which isn\u2019t connected to any visual clues such as storms or clouds. Unlike regular turbulence, it hits suddenly and is hard to avoid. Singapore Airlines\u00a0has previously\u00a0said its flight encountered sudden turbulence.\u00a0A spokesperson said Sunday that its investigations are ongoing. An\u00a0earlier\u00a0CNN analysis of satellite data found the flight entered an area where thunderstorms were developing, which can produce turbulence. It is not yet known what kind of turbulence the Qatar Airways plane experienced. CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect that the cause of the turbulence that hit the Singapore Airlines flight is yet to be determined and that investigations are ongoing. An earlier version also misstated the number of the Qatar Airways flight that experienced turbulence. It was flight QR017.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/world/qatar-airways-turbulence-dublin-injured-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

Macron was leaving Paris on Tuesday night and will \u201cset up a mission\u201d in the French territory, government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot told a press conference, without giving further details. He will be accompanied by Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin, Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, and Overseas Minister Marie Gu\u00e9venoux, Darmanin told the National Assembly. New Caledonia has been roiled by riots sparked by electoral changes from the national government. The unrest has killed at least six people, and has left a trail of burned cars and looted shops, with road barricades restricting access to medicine and food. The violence is the latest outburst of political tensions that have simmered for years and pitted the island\u2019s largely pro-independence indigenous Kanak communities \u2013\u00a0who have long chafed against rule by Paris \u2013 against French inhabitants opposed to breaking ties with their motherland. Macron\u2019s visit comes as Australia and New Zealand deploy government planes to evacuate their nationals from New Caledonia and as hundreds more French security personnel have been deployed to assist in the unrest. France\u2019s High Commission of New Caledonia said Tuesday the airport remains closed for commercial flights until May 25. Thevenot said Tuesday that 1,000 more members of French security forces have arrived in New Caledonia to support the 1,700 personnel already on the island. Darmanin also told the French legislature the number of police and gendarmes in New Caledonia would soon reach 3,000. Also speaking to France\u2019s National Assembly, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said Tuesday \u201cthe situation is starting to improve.\u201d Protests began May 13 involving mostly young people, in response to the tabling of a vote in the French parliament proposing changes to New Caledonia\u2019s constitution that would give greater voting rights to French residents living on the islands. On Tuesday, legislators voted overwhelmingly in favor of the change. The proposed changes to the constitution add thousands of extra voters to New Caledonia\u2019s electoral rolls, which have not been updated since the late 1990s. Pro-independence groups say the changes are an attempt by France to consolidate its rule over the archipelago. Supporters of the change say voter rolls will better reflect the current population. Lying in the South Pacific with Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu for neighbors, New Caledonia is a semiautonomous French territory \u2014 one of a dozen scattered throughout the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean. Colonial France took control of New Caledonia in 1853. White settlement followed and the indigenous Kanak people were longtime victims of harsh segregation policies.

{"id": "2024_05_24_middleeast_israel-isolation-deepens-icj-gaza-rafah-analysis-intl", "text": "It\u2019s been a tumultuous month for Israel. Never before has the Jewish state come under such intense and sustained international pressure from multiple fronts for its policies towards the Palestinians. This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined the ranks of world leaders branded as international pariahs when he became the target of the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against him and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant for suspicion of war crimes and crimes against humanity during Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The court has previously sought warrants against the likes of Sudan\u2019s Omar Al Bashir, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Libya\u2019s Moammar Gadhafi. And on Friday, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, saying the humanitarian situation there is \u201cdisastrous\u201d and expected to \u201cintensify further.\u201d Seven months after Hamas attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, Israel\u2019s retaliatory war has failed to achieve its goals. Top Hamas leaders remain at large and 125 hostages remain captive in the enclave. Gaza is now in ruins and more than 35,000 Palestinians have died during Israel\u2019s onslaught. Pressure on Israel to end the war is mounting from all sides: US college campuses, international courts, American celebrities, Israel\u2019s Western allies, and even the families of the Israeli hostages. But the most significant of those may be the legal and diplomatic action taken against Israel this month. Israeli officials are scrambling to contain the fallout. They have accused critics of antisemitism and vowed not to relent in the face of international pressure. \u201cEven if Israel is forced to stand alone, we will stand alone, and we will continue to strike our enemies powerfully until victory,\u201d Netanyahu declared in a fiery speech at the opening ceremony of Holocaust Remembrance Day this month. Palestinian statehood For years, Israeli officials have opposed unilateral recognitions of Palestinian statehood, fearing it would enable the Palestinians to bring Israel before international courts and weaken its position in future peace negotiations. The Palestinians have therefore failed to gain full membership at the United Nations due to objections from the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally and primary defender on the world stage. However, a non-binding vote at the UN General Assembly on May 10 showed overwhelming international support for an independent Palestinian state, leaving the US and a few of Israel\u2019s allies isolated. Israel and the US maintain that a Palestinian state should only be established through a negotiated settlement. But as Israel continues to reject the prospect of Palestinian independence, some states have chosen to act independently. This week, Ireland, Spain and Norway\u00a0announced\u00a0plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state, saying they hope the move would prod other European nations to follow suit. \u201cWe live in a time in world history where doing the bare minimum is both heroic and insufficient. That is why we cannot stop,\u201d Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda D\u00edaz said in a video posted on her X page. \u201cPalestine will be free from the river to the sea,\u201d she added, using a pro-Palestinian protest slogan that Israel says calls for its destruction, a charge rejected by those who use it. The move prompted swift condemnation from Israel, which recalled its ambassadors from all three countries. Aside from international efforts to end the war, Netanyahu is also under intense pressure domestically to strike a deal with Hamas to bring back the hostages. With hostage-ceasefire talks stalled, relatives of the captives are pressing the prime minister to return to negotiation. This week, the families of seven female Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas released graphic footage of their abduction to pile pressure on the government to secure their release. But there were signs that the talks may resume. On Thursday, the Israeli war cabinet directed the country\u2019s negotiating team to resume talks, without saying when they\u2019ll take place, and CIA Director Bill Burns has traveled to Europe to try to get the deal back on track, a US official told CNN, adding that the Israelis are \u201cvery engaged.\u201d Quandary for Israel\u2019s allies The cases brought before the ICJ and ICC have tested Western states\u2019 commitment to the rules-based international order as they struggle to navigate the increasing legal actions against their ally in these courts. This has created a rift between Israel\u2019s Western allies and a growing coalition of Global South countries spanning Asia, Africa, and South America that are increasingly vocal in their calls for Israel to be held accountable for its actions in Gaza. In a recent case at the ICJ, Germany was compelled to defend its arms sales to Israel against allegations of \u201cfacilitating genocide\u201d brought by Nicaragua. Despite the pressure, the court rejected the demand for an immediate halt to Germany\u2019s arms exports to Israel. Meanwhile, the ICC\u2019s decision to pursue arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant has divided Israel\u2019s Western allies. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Karim Khan, the ICC\u2019s prosecutor, recounted a conversation with a senior leader who remarked: \u201cThis court is built for Africa and for thugs like Putin,\u201d underscoring the complexities surrounding international legal proceedings. While the US and the United Kingdom have denounced the move, European nations such as France, Germany, and others have affirmed the independence of the court and have not ruled out the possibility of arresting Israeli officials if they enter their territory following the issuance of a warrant. The court is also\u00a0pursuing warrants against three top Hamas officials: Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Mohammed Deif. A panel of judges at the ICC is still deliberating on whether to issue these warrants. The response to the warrant request has been particularly fierce in the US Congress, where a bipartisan effort to penalize the ICC is underway, potentially including sanctions.\u00a0US Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to work with Congress on legislation to penalize the ICC. \u201cIf they do this to Israel, we\u2019re next,\u201d Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has led the efforts against the ICC in Congress, told a Senate hearing this week \u2013 a reminder that however much pressure Israel is under, it still has one very powerful friend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/middleeast/israel-isolation-deepens-icj-gaza-rafah-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_africa_nigerias-rivers-state-investor-magnet-intl", "text": "Nigeria\u2019s oil-rich Rivers State has a unique opportunity to emerge as a beacon of progress, replacing hopelessness with hope, according to former Apex Bank governor Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. At the same time, Rivers State Governor Siminalayi Fubara has highlighted the state\u2019s efforts to create a more vibrant, investment-friendly environment, aiming to reassure investors of the requisite return on their investments. Located in the Niger Delta region, Rivers State is a key oil-producing area in Nigeria. It hosts several major oil companies and boasts several oil wells. Despite its vast oil wealth, the region has faced oil theft and sabotage over the years and suffers from a high unemployment rate. Building an investor\u2019s paradise However, Fubara emphasized that his administration is taking measures to re-industrialize the state and bring back numerous production factories that had shut down operations. During the two-day Rivers State Economic and Investment Summit (RSEIS), themed \u201cRivers Emerge: Advancing Pathways to Economic Growth and Sustainability,\u201d held at the Dr. Obi Wali International Conference Centre in Port Harcourt, Sanusi delivered a keynote address where he called for better management of the state\u2019s resources. \u201cWith rich abundant land, abundant resources, and natural resources, as well as the strategic location of the state, Rivers can be one of the best investors paradises, not just in Nigeria but in West Africa if the right things can be done,\u201d Sanusi said. The Emir of Kano stressed that a prosperous future relies on the capacity of state institutions and the quality and skills of its population. He drew comparisons with countries like Japan, Singapore, Germany, Australia, and Rwanda, which have thrived without significant natural resources, attributing their success to good governance, innovation, and education. Fubara highlighted the various measures taken to make Rivers State a destination for all categories of investors. \u201cWe have already implemented certain policy initiatives and reforms, including the prompt allocation and issuance of land titles and certificates of occupancy to prospective investors and a moratorium on State taxes and levies on new businesses. We are also working on the harmonization of state and local government taxes to eliminate double taxation and the imposition of multiple levies on investors,\u201d he said. Fubara also announced a N4 billion (over $2.7 million)\u00a0matching fund loan scheme with the Bank of Industry Limited for small, micro, and medium-scale businesses to drive financial inclusion and enhance the growth and development of these businesses. \u2018Oil is not a curse, the curse is the leaders\u2019 Sanusi pointed out that while countries like Russia, the UAE, and Norway have benefitted from their natural resources, their success also hinges on visionary governance and strong institutions. He argued that resources can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on leadership. \u201cOil is not a curse; the curse is the leaders we have had,\u201d he said. Fubara detailed further initiatives, including providing hundreds of hectares of land for projects like a multi-billion-naira aluminum rolling mill and collaborations with international firms to develop the state\u2019s agricultural potential. He emphasized the importance of reviving abandoned agricultural projects and infrastructure, saying he would set aside about $10 million for these efforts this fiscal year. Governor Fubara highlighted the investment opportunities across diverse sectors, including oil and gas, agriculture, manufacturing, hospitality, tourism, education, ICT, healthcare, infrastructure development, glass products, garments production, and power generation and transmission. With over 40% of fertile cultivable landmass, Rivers State has the potential to significantly contribute to national food security through commercial investments in mechanized agriculture and agro-processing industrial value chains, he said. In his keynote address, former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Moghalu, said that due to the prevalence of poor governance in Nigeria, the abundant human and natural resources in the country have not been sufficiently harnessed to achieve the desired prosperity. He particularly advocated for the implementation of well-meaning policies to dismantle barriers to doing business while promoting transparency and building investor confidence. Moghalu added that, alongside developing requisite skills among the people and building enduring critical infrastructure, the foundation for good and competent governance should be assured to make the foreign direct investment (FDI) sought truly beneficial to the country. Sanusi concluded by highlighting the importance of investing in human capital and creating an education system that meets contemporary labor market demands. He called for an end to corruption in the judiciary, sensible tax policies, and the development of a skilled workforce to reduce dependence on foreign expertise. He urged Rivers State to aspire beyond being a recipient of federal allocations to becoming a commercial and industrial hub where citizens enjoy a decent standard of living.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/africa/nigerias-rivers-state-investor-magnet-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

Israel began a limited ground offensive in Rafah on May 7, defying calls from the international community, including the United States, not to proceed. More than a million Palestinians were taking shelter in Rafah before Israel started its operation, but the court noted that around 800,000 have since been displaced. Upon entering Rafah, the military\u00a0seized the city\u2019s border crossing\u00a0with Egypt, which has remained shut since. The crossing was a vital entry point for humanitarian aid. The court ordered Israel to open the Rafah crossing for humanitarian assistance and said it had found that the evacuation and living conditions provided by Israel are not \u201csufficient to alleviate the immense risk, which the Palestinian population is exposed\u201d to.  Rulings by the court are final and binding, but the ICJ doesn\u2019t have a mechanism to enforce them, and they have been ignored in the past. Israeli officials have condemned the ICJ\u2019s ruling. Yair Lapid, leader of Israel\u2019s opposition party Yesh Atid, said that \u201cthe fact that the ICJ did not even directly connect the end of the military operation in Rafah to the release of the hostages and to Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against terror is an abject moral failure.\u201d Naftali Bennett, who was the 13th\u00a0Prime Minister of Israel, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201cThe International Court of Justice just provided every terror organization on earth with THE PERFECT METHOD TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER.\u201d Hamas welcomed the order in a statement, but said it had expected it would be for the entire Gaza Strip, emphasizing that the situations in Jabalya and other cities are equally dire and warrant similar attention. South Africa filed an urgent request on May 10 for additional measures against Israel, accusing it of using forced\u00a0evacuation orders\u00a0in the southern Gaza city of Rafah to \u201cendanger rather than protect civilian life.\u201d The request was part of a larger case brought by Pretoria against Israel in which South Africa accuses Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians during the seven-month-long conflict. Israel\u2019s Deputy Attorney General for International Law Gilad Noam denied the allegations in his opening remarks at the ICJ last week and asked the court to \u201crespect the predicament\u201d Israel is in. Two interpretations Following the ruling, a joint statement by the Israel\u2019s National Security Council and Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that Israel \u201chas not carried out and will not carry out military activity in the Rafah area that creates living conditions that could lead to the destruction of the Palestinian civilian population.\u201d In response to other orders by the ICJ, including keeping the Rafah crossing open, the statement said that Israel will \u201ccontinue its efforts to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip\u201d and \u201creduce as much as possible the harm to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip.\u201d Eliav Lieblich, a professor of international law at Tel Aviv University, told CNN that the text of the ruling had some ambiguity. \u201cThe order can be understood in two ways: either that Israel has to halt the offensive in Rafah; or specifically components that may lead to conditions of life that could bring physical destruction,\u201d he said. What is clear, however, is that in the eyes of the court, \u201cthe operation cannot continue in the same way, because it found that as it is now the situation is a risk to the rights protected by the (genocide) Convention,\u201d Lieblich said, adding that it is hard to tell whether Israel will comply with the ruling. \u201cI\u00a0hope that it doesn\u2019t argue that the order means that nothing has to change, because that clearly isn\u2019t the case,\u201d he added. The development comes as Israel faces mounting international and domestic pressure to end the war in Gaza. This week, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), a separate court in The Hague, sought arrest warrants for Hamas leaders as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. Families of Israeli hostages held in the territory also stepped up pressure on Netanyahu to bring the captives home, releasing graphic footage of female members of the Israel Defense Forces before they were abducted. Unclear how US will respond It is unclear how the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally, will respond to the ICJ\u2019s order. The Biden administration has spoken out strongly against the genocide case against Israel, but it has repeatedly warned Israel that Washington will not support a major ground offensive in Rafah unless it sees a credible plan to ensure the safety of civilians. This month, the US halted arms shipments to Israel for the first time out of fear that they could be used in Rafah to harm civilians. In an interview with CNN, US President Joe Biden acknowledged that American bombs had been used to kill civilians in Gaza, in a stark recognition of the US\u2019 role in the war. The US is Israel\u2019s biggest weapons supplier. The move by the ICJ is likely to add to mounting pressure on Israel to scale down its war in Gaza, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that his country will defend itself even if \u201cforced to stand alone.\u201d Israel says that Rafah is the last bastion of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that led an attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. Israel\u2019s subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 people, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 pressure The international pressure facing Israel is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN. \u201cBecause this war is unprecedented, and the way Israel conducts the war is unprecedented.\u201d While there has always been criticism of some of Israel\u2019s actions, such as the expansion of settlements, \u201cthis is on a different scale, a different universe altogether,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current Israeli government does its best to make Israel a pariah state.\u201d The ruling could also undermine Israel\u2019s own judiciary, according to Neve Gordon, professor of human rights law at Queen Mary University of London. In response to the ICC\u2019s decision to seek arrest warrants against top Israeli officials, Israel\u2019s Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and State Attorney Amit Aisman were cited by the Times of Israel as backing the Israeli military and said the judicial system is capable of handling such cases. \u201c(The) ruling would serve yet another blow to Israel\u2019s judicial system, and particularly the attorney general and the Supreme Court, since the subtext would be that it is not doing its job in ensuring that Israel abide by international law,\u201d said Gordon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/middleeast/israel-icj-gaza-rafah-south-africa-ruling-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_americas_haiti-gang-mss-kenya-explainer-intl", "text": "After months of planning and discussion, the deployment of an international force to violence-wracked Haiti has been delayed again, puncturing hopes that a vanguard of Kenyan police would arrive this week. High-profile meetings on Thursday hinted at once-high expectations. In the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, the country\u2019s governing Transitional Presidential Council posted photos of its meeting with a Kenyan delegation. In Washington, US President Joe Biden and Kenyan President William Ruto touted their nations\u2019 collaboration on the mission (largely equipped by the US) at a joint press conference. Peace and security in Haiti are the \u201ccollective responsibility of all nations,\u201d Ruto said, warning that Kenya will \u201ctake that responsibility along with the Haitian police\u201d and \u201cbreak the backs of gangs and criminals.\u201d But for now, armed groups continue to rampage in capital city Port-au-Prince, extorting residents and controlling the movement of vital fuel, food and medical supplies. On Thursday evening, a young US missionary couple were attacked by gangs at a church in the city and later killed, their family said. Who are Haiti\u2019s gangs? Originally created as enforcers for Haiti\u2019s political and business elite, Haiti\u2019s rival gangs have in recent months formed a broad coalition known as \u201cViv Ansamn,\u201d or \u201cLive together,\u201d and are now coordinating attacks on government institutions like police stations and prisons. Haiti\u2019s National Police have been battling the gangs block by block, but they are understaffed and under-equipped. Since the assassination of then-President Jovenel Moise in 2021, the gangs\u2019 grip has expanded from an estimated 50% of the city to 80% today. Law enforcement sources in Haiti now liken the urban battlefield to quicksand, telling CNN that they need reinforcements to hold and defend territory. Complicating the situation is a torrent of smuggled guns and ammunition arming Haiti\u2019s gangs, despite an arms embargo on the island. Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken defended US backing for the international mission, warning a Senate Foreign Relations hearing that without foreign support, Haiti is \u201con the precipice of becoming an all-out failed state.\u201d What is the Multinational Security Support mission? Haiti\u2019s government has been asking for international military assistance since 2022. In October last year, the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) was finally greenlit by the United Nations\u2019 powerful Security Council. Designed to coordinate closely with Haiti\u2019s National Police, the MSS is expected to focus on securing the city\u2019s airport, seaport and key roads, according to people with knowledge of the mission\u2019s planning. Kenya, which volunteered to lead the mission, has committed 1,000 police officers. Most of those are Kenyan border police, chosen for their experience in dealing with armed non-state actors such as Al Shabaab and in operating in foreign contexts such as Somalia, Sudan and Congo, according to Bill O\u2019Neill, the UN expert on human rights in Haiti. According to documents seen by CNN, the mission will be helmed by a Kenyan police commissioner and a Jamaican police lieutenant, with other top posts filled by Kenyan staff. The Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Chad, and Jamaica have also promised to contribute personnel to the mission. Although the MSS was approved more than seven months ago, it has been mired in complications, including court challenges in Kenya and political tumult in Haiti. In March, a surge of gang violence forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign shortly after inking a deal with Kenya for the mission; Ruto\u2019s administration has since found a new partner in Haiti\u2019s Transitional Presidential Council, established last month. During the Thursday press conference, journalist Ayub Abdikadir from Kenya\u2019s Citizen TV questioned Ruto on the strategy of sending forces to a crisis in the distant Caribbean while security problems endure in Kenya\u2019s North Rift region. \u201cWhy are you committing to Kenya when we have a problem back home?\u201d he asked. Kenya\u2019s responsibility is broader than its own borders, Ruto responded, underlining that troops and police had already been deployed to \u201csort out the banditry problem\u201d in the North Rift. A UN-managed trust fund for the mission currently contains $21 million, provided by Canada ($8.7 million), the United States ($6 million), France ($3.2 million) and Spain ($3 million), according to the UN. The US and Canada have also committed more, much of it expected to take the form of equipment and other resources. Why hasn\u2019t the MSS begun yet? (A shortage of medevac helicopters, in part) May 23 had been the working deadline for a first instalment of 200 Kenyan police officers to arrive, according to documents seen by CNN. Several dozen Jamaican officers were expected to arrive in Haiti by mid-June, with more trickling in through the summer. This week, a Kenyan team including several police commanders visited Port-au-Prince to assess whether facilities were ready to accommodate a deployment. A base for the MSS near Toussaint Louverture airport in Port-au-Prince is close to completion \u2013 boasting a medical facility and a trauma surgeon already on site \u2013 but the Kenyan delegation concluded that some equipment was insufficient. They were particularly concerned by a lack of helicopters for medical evacuations, multiple sources said, citing confusion over which nation would provide them. Kenyan authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Documents seen by CNN show that El Salvador had been floated as a potential provider of medevac helicopters, which Salvadoran Vice President Felix Ulloa played down as unlikely in comments to CNN. \u201cWe would like to be part of the solution, but we would need a mandate clearly from the United Nations and the acceptance of the host country,\u201d he said, adding that El Salvador could potentially offer its highly trained helicopter pilots and experts to oversee air operations for the MSS if called upon. More equipment, including armored vehicles and radios, is expected to arrive in Haiti for the MSS over the coming days and weeks. What now? Experts on the ground say the Haitian government also has more work to do to lay the groundwork for the mission, particularly in communicating with the public \u2013 and even the gangs \u2013 about how it will work. One source with experience in dealing with Haiti\u2019s gangs said the Transitional Presidential Council should be developing messaging to the gangs themselves about potential \u201coff-ramps\u201d from outright confrontation with the MSS, potentially by turning themselves in or otherwise seeking nonviolent resolution. Haitian police union SPNH17 meanwhile told CNN that plans for their collaboration with the international mission were too opaque and questioned why there wasn\u2019t more focus on providing material support to the local police. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the international community working with a few sectors with no clear plans on what they\u2019ll do and how. We don\u2019t even know how we will communicate with the Kenyan police officers who speaks English. We speak French and Creole in Haiti,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cWe believe only the Haitian police can provide long term security for Haiti. What we need are materials and logistical support.\u201d Haitian anti-corruption group Nou Pap D\u00f2mi (NPD) echoed the concern about transparency, noting that there needs to be clear mechanisms of accountability for the foreign forces\u2019 conduct in Haiti. \u201cWhile NPD believes that international support is necessary to address the crisis, we have always advocated for an approach that focuses primarily on strengthening the Haitian National Police so that it can address these challenges with lasting effect,\u201d the group said in a statement to CNN. Amid the continuing uncertainty this week about when the MSS will come, NPD said: \u201cThe Kenyan mission remains a mystery to the Haitian people; no one knows what it entails and there has been no communication on the matter, despite the arrival of several US military planes in Haiti.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/americas/haiti-gang-mss-kenya-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_vietnam-vintage-steam-trains-intl-hnk", "text": "Train enthusiasts and history buffs alike will soon have a new Southeast Asian destination to visit, as Vietnam prepares to unveil a revamped pair of vintage steam locomotives from the 1960s. The two Revolution Express locomotives are the last working steam trains in Vietnam, dating from when the country was still a French colony, according to hospitality brand Wafaifo Optimisers, which is managing the project. In recent years, the trains have been slowly restored to working condition using original parts, and crafted by the last remaining steam engineers working for the national railway system. Now, the trains are nearly ready to take on tourists and visitors \u2013 with the first trips expected to come late 2024 or early 2025, Wafaifo Optimisers said in a news release. Tickets aren\u2019t on sale yet, and there are no details on pricing \u2013 but booking information will come in the next few months, it said. The trains will travel between the central city of Da Nang, known for its beach resorts on the coast, and the former royal capital Hue, famous for its many palaces and elaborate royal tombs, Wafaifo said. Each train will have two retro-styled carriages for passenger seating, a kitchen car and a baggage carriage. Renderings of the interiors show luxurious furnishings that call back to the trains\u2019 colonial French past with mahogany tables and chairs, gold accents and decorative tiling. Large windows on all sides will allow sweeping views of the passing landscape, as the train winds past the Hai Van coastal mountain range \u2013\u2013 famous\u00a0for its rolling green hills overlooking the vast sea \u2013\u00a0and the village of Lang Co, known for its fishing community and seafood. It\u2019s not just the decor that hearkens back to Vietnam\u2019s past; there will even be staff dressed in \u201cperiod costume,\u201d and a brass band in army regalia to greet disembarking guests, according to the news release. Each train station along the route will be fitted with an appropriately themed restaurant, including one in Hue with an imperial theme to match its royal history, and an independence-themed joint in Lang Co. \u201cWe are proud to bring these old dames of rail back to life and to showcase important periods in Vietnamese history from imperial through colonial rule and finally the struggle to independence,\u201d said Michael Gebbie, the chairman of Indochina Rail Tourist Service. Vietnam declared its independence from France on September 2, 1945 \u2013 a claim that neither France nor the United States recognized. The US proceeded to aid France with military equipment to fight the Vietnamese rebels. By 1954, Vietnam signed the Geneva Accords \u2013 splitting the country into two halves, the Communist-led north and US-supported south, and kicking off the bloody Vietnam War, which would last nearly two decades. The war finally ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City), with more than 1.3 million military deaths for all countries involved and 1 million total civilian deaths. Today, a number of tourism sites commemorate Vietnam\u2019s past, ranging from war memorials to ancient citadels that have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites \u2013 including Hue \u2013 preserving the country\u2019s bygone emperors.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vietnam-vintage-steam-trains-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_asia_us-congressional-visit-taiwan-defense-intl-hnk", "text": "US lawmakers\u00a0vowed to bolster Taiwan\u2019s deterrence against China on Monday during a bipartisan congressional visit to the self-governing democracy just days after Beijing surrounded the island with massive military exercises. Last week\u2019s drills were the largest China has launched in more than a year and came days after Taiwan\u00a0swore in its new president,\u00a0Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. In a news conference in Taipei, US Representative\u00a0Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the drills an \u201cintimidation tactic to punish democracy\u201d and vowed to bolster Taiwan\u2019s defense by speeding up the delivery of defensive weapons from the US. Citing recent\u00a0foreign military financing\u00a0for\u00a0Taiwan approved by the US House, McCaul pledged to get Taiwan the weapons it purchased from the US \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d \u201cWe are moving forward on those weapons systems. I\u2019d like to see them faster, but they are forthcoming,\u201d he said. The US maintains close but informal relations with Taiwan and is bound by law to supply the island with weapons to defend itself. However, Taiwan has repeatedly raised concerns about delays in US weapon deliveries, particularly after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cPresident Lai and I have always had a very sobering and yet very direct conversation about the threat that this island faces from its neighbor to the north,\u201d McCaul said, referring to China. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. China\u2019s military kicked off two days of exercises last Thursday, sending warships and fighter jets around Taiwan and its outlying islands in\u00a0what it called \u201ca strong punishment for separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces.\u201d It said the drills were designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power\u201d over the island. Beijing has long denounced Lai as a \u201cdangerous separatist\u201d and decried his inauguration speech, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan. The vast majority of Taiwanese have no desire to live under Chinese rule. But under Xi Jinping, China\u2019s most authoritarian leader in a generation, Beijing has grown more assertive\u00a0and ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on its democratic neighbor. In the often bitterly polarized atmosphere of Capitol Hill support for Taiwan has become one of the few bipartisan points of agreement. \u201cWithout deterrence, Chairman Xi has bold and aggressive ambitions, and we just need to do everything we can to make it possible for him to see that the risk outweighs the reward, that the risk is too high. I do think the deterrence we will provide, and we\u2019re providing by our presence here today, will help prevent that,\u201d McCaul, a Republican,\u00a0said. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it \u201cfirmly opposed\u201d the visit and had lodged stern representations with the US. It urged the American lawmakers to \u201cstop playing the Taiwan card, stop interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs, stop supporting and condoning Taiwan independence separatist forces, and stop undermining Sino-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular news conference Monday. \u2018Gesture of solidarity\u2019 Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Minister\u00a0Lin Chia-lung called the visit by US lawmakers \u201ca powerful display of the strong bipartisan support of Taiwan in the United States.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s also an important gesture of solidarity that shows America stands firmly with democratic Taiwan, and for this, we are deeply grateful,\u201d Lin said at the news conference alongside McCaul, vowing to advance the \u201crock-solid partnership\u201d between the two sides. China\u2019s military drills, he said, were \u201cto express their displeasure with President Lai, a president democratically elected by the people of Taiwan.\u201d But he added they had another objective. \u201cI believe the military exercises were also the PRC way of welcoming this delegation,\u201d he said, referring to China\u2019s official name the People\u2019s Republic of China. The delegation also met with Lai, Taiwan\u2019s new leader, on Monday morning. Calling McCaul \u201cTaiwan\u2019s longtime friend,\u201d Lai thanked the delegation for their firm support for Taiwan and vowed to deepen cooperation with the US and other like-minded countries to maintain regional peace, stability and prosperity. \u201cI deeply admire former US President Ronald Reagan\u2019s concept of \u2018peace through strength.\u2019 Therefore, moving forward, I\u2019ll enhance reform and bolster national defense, showing the world the Taiwanese people\u2019s determination to defend their homeland,\u201d Lai said. \u201cWith your support, I hope that the US Congress through legislative action will continue to assist Taiwan in strengthening its self-defense capabilities, thereby advancing bilateral exchanges and cooperation.\u201d In response, McCaul congratulated Lai for assuming the presidency, saying \u201cTaiwan has the right man at the right time in the right place.\u201d \u201cWe must make sure no one in the right mind will try to upset the peace that let you thrive,\u201d McCaul told Lai. \u201cAmerican is and will always be a reliable partner, and no amount of coercion or intimidation will slow down or stop the routine visits by the congress to Taiwan.\u201d McCaul last visited Taiwan in April 2023 and met former President Tsai Ing-wen. China responded with a show of military force and later imposed sanctions on McCaul. In August 2022, China staged massive war games around Taiwan to show its displeasure with then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei. Beijing fired missiles into waters surrounding the island and simulated a blockade with fighter jets and warships, in its largest show of force in years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/asia/us-congressional-visit-taiwan-defense-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_europe_depardieu-paparazzi-harrys-bar-rome-intl-latam", "text": "In a scene reminiscent of La Dolce Vita era, French actor Gerard Depardieu has been accused of attacking celebrity photographer Rino Barillari outside Harry\u2019s Bar on the famed Via Veneto in Rome. Depardieu was dining at an outdoor table with a female companion and two other people around 2 p.m. local time on Tuesday when Barillari \u2013 known as \u201cthe king\u201d in Roman press circles \u2013 apparently snapped the diners, according to Italian media reports. Exactly what happened next is a matter of dispute, though both sides say they have filed police reports known locally as denouncements. Barillari, age 79, said Depardieu\u2019s partner Magda Vavrusova jumped up and started punching him before Depardieu joined the fight, according to Barillari\u2019s lawyer, as cited in several Italian media outlets including the Messaggero newspaper where Barillari works. Police confirmed to CNN that \u201ca local photographer\u201d had filed a complaint around an incident at Harry\u2019s Bar on Tuesday, but did not divulge the names of those involved. Piero Lepore, the owner of Harry\u2019s Bar in Rome, confirmed to CNN that the incident happened, but did not cast blame. Barillari often captures celebrities dining at the establishment, which is famous for appearing in the 1960 Federico Fellini film \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d \u2013 whose photographer character Paparazzo is reputed to have inspired the term \u201cpaparazzi.\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen fisticuffs here in two decades. This sort of thing never happens here,\u201d Lepore told CNN by telephone. \u201cWe are used to celebrities and we are used to paparazzi \u2013 they can\u2019t survive without each other. But we are no longer used to these fights.\u201d When asked for details, he said that because there was now a denouncement by Barillari, he could not comment. \u201cI gave my testimony to the police. I can\u2019t say any more.\u201d Barillari was taken to hospital by ambulance, according to Lepore. Magda Vavrusova\u2019s lawyer, Delphine Meillet,\u00a0said in a statement to CNN that it was Barillari who had pushed Vavrusova. Meillet told the Adnkronos news agency that Vavrusova filed a denouncement with Rome police stating: \u201cThe photographer pushed me, touching my torso and chest with his arm. At this moment in which I present the complaint I still feel pain, it was very violent.\u201d Meillet told the news agency that Vavrusova was also in the hospital, though calls to the University Policlinico Umberto did not confirm her as a patient. Meillet also told the news outlet that in fact Depardieu had run to intervene after the photographer attacked his companion and \u201cslipped and fell on him.\u201d CNN has also reached out to Depardieu\u2019s lawyer for comment. A spokesperson for Rome police said they are currently looking for surveillance footage from the area. Barillari got his start as a celebrity paparazzi when he was just 16 years old by delivering photos he had taken of celebrities at the Trevi Fountain to various news outlets, according to his biography. He has been to the emergency room 200 times after being attacked by his subjects, he said in a documentary to mark his 70th birthday nine years ago. He went on to become Rome\u2019s most infamous paparazzi, publishing several books of his images which have included popes, presidents and stars like Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Liz Taylor and Frank Sinatra, according to his bio. He has suffered 82 broken cameras, 11 broken ribs and a broken femur after photographing a local celebrity allegedly beating up his girlfriend in Piazza Navona, where he lives and keeps a photo studio. Depardieu\u2019s run-in with Barillari comes after the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office told CNN last month that the French actor \u2013 known for his roles in films like \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Man in the Iron Mask\u201d and \u201cLife of Pi\u201d \u2013 would face trial in October over allegations of sexual assault said to have taken place during the shooting of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d in 2021. The actor is also being formally investigated on suspicion of rape and sexual assault allegedly committed in August 2018 against actress Charlotte Arnould, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. The French actor has denied all the rape and sexual assault  accusations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/europe/depardieu-paparazzi-harrys-bar-rome-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

Among the dead is a 12-year-old girl, police said Sunday. The attack came as Russian forces continue to advance in northeastern Ukraine after crossing the border earlier this month and opening a new front in the two-year-old conflict.  Kharkiv has seen a spate of Russian attacks, as Russia seeks to tie up Ukrainian forces elsewhere and create a buffer zone.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the strike a \u201cbrutal attack\u201d in a post on X, later writing that \u201cRussia is run by men who want to make it a norm \u2013 burning lives, destroying cities and villages, dividing people, and erasing national borders through war.\u201d In his nightly address on Sunday, he said hundreds of personnel from State Emergency Services, police, and local authorities were involved in the response efforts. He also reiterated his calls for more air defense systems and stronger preventative measures against Russian forces. Officials have said there were nearly 200 people inside the building when the strike occurred. According to Chief of the Investigative Department of the Kharkiv Regional Police Serhii Bolvinov, investigators and forensic experts spent the night searching the ruins of the store for human remains. \u201cWe fear that they will have to sift through the ashes to find the remains and identify the victims,\u201d he continued. Ukraine\u2019s Interior Minister, Ihor\u00a0Klymenko, said Sunday that the hours following the strike were \u201chellish\u201d and thanked everyone who helped to put\u00a0out the flames that engulfed the hardware store after the attack. Oleh Syniehubov, head of the Kharkiv regional military administration, noted that there is \u201cnot a single military object nearby\u201d the site of the strike. He said the remains of 10 people who died in the strike had been identified and eight people were still missing. Meanwhile, further south in the Kherson region, authorities warned residents to avoid open spaces as there have been reports of explosions. \u201cThe enemy is attacking from the temporarily occupied left bank,\u201d Roman Mrochko, the head of the Kherson City Military Administration, said in a Telegram post Sunday. \u201cDo not stay in open areas. Take care of yourself and your loved ones,\u201d he wrote. Russian forces attacked Ukrainian frontline positions in Kharkiv 15 times over the weekend, General Serhii \u201cMarcel\u201d Melnyk, Commander of the Kharkiv city defense forces, said earlier on Sunday, adding that \u201csome of the attacks are still ongoing.\u201d Overnight Saturday into Sunday, Russian forces launched 14 missiles and over 30 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian military. Seven people were killed in Russian strikes on the city Thursday, after locations including a printing house were targeted. \u201cRussia continues its savage attacks on Kharkiv this week, striking a busy shopping center, a book publishing house and other civilian targets,\u201d US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said Saturday. \u201cWe condemn these attacks and commit to holding Russia accountable for its unprovoked war,\u201d she added. After Saturday\u2019s attack, Zelensky reiterated that \u201cif Ukraine had enough air defense systems and modern combat aircraft, such Russian strikes would have been impossible.\u201d \u201cThat is why we are appealing to all leaders, to all states: we need a significant strengthening of air defense,\u201d he said. Zelensky\u00a0has since appealed to US President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0and Chinese leader\u00a0Xi Jinping\u00a0to attend a peace summit in Switzerland next month. \u201cPlease, show your leadership in advancing the peace\u00a0\u2013 the real peace and not just a pause between the strikes,\u201d Zelensky\u00a0said. \u201cThe efforts of the global majority are the best guarantee that all commitments will be fulfilled,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, at least two people were killed and at least 10 injured as a result of a Ukrainian strike on a Russian village in the Belgorod region, the region\u2019s governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said Saturday. Among the injured is an 8-year-old boy, he said, adding that \u201call victims had shrapnel wounds in various parts of the body.\u201d As a result of the strike, a private residential building caught fire, and about 20 other buildings and 23 cars sustained damage. \u201cAll operational services are working on site,\u201d Gladkov said.

More than 150 houses in Yambali village are buried in debris, Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the country\u00a0Serhan Aktoprak said on Sunday. The new estimate is a sharp increase from earlier in the week, when the UN initially said it believed more than 100 people had died. The population of the village was first reported to be about 4,000 people, but new estimates found the actual number of residents to be much higher, Aktoprak\u00a0added. More than 250 houses have been evacuated with an estimated 1,250 people displaced, and many locals have taken up temporary accommodation with relatives and friends nearby, according to the official. The area continues to pose an \u201cextreme risk\u201d as rocks continue to fall and the ground soil is exposed to a constant increased pressure, Aktoprak said. People are removing bodies buried under the soil with digging sticks, spades, and agricultural forks, he added. The disaster\u00a0hit the remote village of Kaokalam, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby, at approximately 3 a.m. local time on Friday, leaving a scar of debris that humanitarian workers say is\u00a0as big as four football pitches.

{"id": "2024_05_27_style_lilly-pulitzer-rebrand-fashion-resort", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 A decade ago, Lilly Pulitzer\u2019s bright prints were omnipresent on college campuses across the US, and a pop-up for its 2015 collaboration with Target in New York\u2019s Bryant Park drew crowds of Millennial shoppers at the height of their modern preppy obsession. That same year, sales grew 22 percent. Fashion has since moved on from that aesthetic, but Lilly Pulitzer hasn\u2019t: In an era of quiet luxury, affordable facsimiles of the loud colors and patterns favored by the wealthy denizens of Palm Beach, Florida, where the brand was founded 65 years ago, look out of place. Sales reflect that stagnation, growing 1 percent last year to $343.5 million. Looking to usher in the brand\u2019s next era, earlier this month Lilly Pulitzer unveiled a new logo that retains its signature bright pink hue \u2014 but now with a typeface that looks straight out of the 1950s, the decade the brand was founded. Connecting with a new generation will take more than a new font, however. Gen-Z tastes reign supreme now, and they have a very different idea of what preppy looks like. Rather than shift dresses, they\u2019re big on neutral oversized blazers and baggy jeans. Rather than fully capitulate to Gen Z\u2019s tastes, Lilly Pulitzer is targeting customers who \u201clove the brand that maybe hadn\u2019t shopped in a while,\u201d said the brand\u2019s chief executive Michelle Kelly. That includes occasion wear, where bright and bold still flies even in today\u2019s quiet luxury moment. In March, it released a collaboration with Badgley Mischka, with pieces running from $400 to $700, versus a $100 to $300 standard price point. \u201cThere are definitely moments in the culture where trends are going to be in our favor or less,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cOur approach\u2026 is to do what we do. That balance of staying grounded to who we are, but being aware of changes.\u201d The cultural tides may also be turning in Lilly Pulitzer\u2019s favor once again. Palm Beach has been on the rise as a fashion destination in recent years, with brands including Hill House Home, Nili Lotan and MyTheresa hosting events and opening stores there. Plus, 1960s Palm Beach style has been in the spotlight this spring on Apple TV\u2019s series \u201cPalm Royale.\u201d More than that, it\u2019s a brand that plenty of women \u2014 from those who were contemporaries of Pulitzer herself to their granddaughters who are sharing their Lilly hauls on TikTok \u2014 have a soft spot for. \u201cLilly is one of the few brands that customers of all ages can come to an event, shop and not be alarmed that someone three decades older or younger is shopping,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cIt\u2019s just really special that all ages can have an affinity (for the brand).\u201d Lilly\u2019s new look Founded in 1959, the brand was born out of a conundrum faced by its eponymous founder: Palm Beach residents Pulitzer and her husband owned several orange groves, and Pulitzer operated a juice stand. Constantly finding juice stains on her clothes, she asked her dressmaker to make a dress with colors bright enough to hide the marks. They were so popular she began selling them at the juice stand, too. By the 1960s, they had become something of an icon of American apparel, and were particularly a favorite among well-heeled women including Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and socialite Wendy Vanderbilt. In 2010, the company was acquired by Oxford Industries, which also owns Tommy Bahama and Johnny Was, among other brands, and is now headquartered in Philadelphia. But it maintains firm roots in Palm Beach. \u201cNothing is more rooted in a resort Americana aesthetic than Lilly Pulitzer,\u201d said Robert Burke, chief executive of retail consultancy Robert Burke Associates. \u201cIt\u2019s always stayed very grounded in that Palm Beach mentality.\u201d Kelly sees the brand\u2019s history as an advantage in connecting with a younger audience. \u201cGen-Z wants that authenticity, and we have an authentic brand story that we lean into, and that I think differentiates us in the crowded market right now,\u201d she said. Still, she\u2019s aware that the brand needs to push forward as well as look to the past. The logo switch up is just one element in a \u201cjourney of brand refreshment\u201d that Lilly is currently undergoing, Kelly said. The goal, she added, is to strike the right balance between honoring the brand\u2019s history \u2014 and its loyal customers \u2014 while pushing it forward enough that it resonates with young consumers. \u201cWe just saw the opportunity to have our visual identity and our overall branding fit our needs a bit better,\u201d she said. The new logo, created by designer Robin Kramer, she said felt like a \u201cgreat balance of look backward, but a huge step forward\u201d with a more modern take on a retro-inspired typeface. As well, the brand is popping up in new spaces. Collaborations have long been a part of the brand\u2019s strategy; since Target, it inked a partnership with Pottery Barn that\u2019s still ongoing. This year, in addition to the Badgley Mischka collaboration, it rolled out a team-up with Natalie\u2019s Juice, selling bottles of orange juice featuring a custom Lilly Pulitzer sticker. The nod to the brand\u2019s origin story made it a natural fit for its diehard consumers, Kelly said. The brand is predominantly a direct-to-consumer business, with 85 percent of its sales coming from its own channels. That means it\u2019s more insulated from wholesale troubles, but more reliant on its direct connection with consumers. With about 66 percent of its direct sales coming online, Lilly Pulitzer wants to grow its brick-and-mortar presence and plans to open six stores in 2024, including a new location in Cranston, Rhode Island that opened its doors in April. To reach new consumers \u2014 and reconnect with older ones \u2014 it\u2019s also building its presence on TikTok, creating more cuts of its ads to run across various platforms. The hope is all these ingredients will keep the brand\u2019s longtime loyalists happy, but intrigue new customers, too. \u201cSometimes brands just have periods where they have popularity again because they take a fresher direction,\u201d said Burke. \u201cThere\u2019s no written script for it, but it certainly has incredibly good bones.\u201d This article was originally published by\u00a0The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

{"id": "2024_05_22_weather_iowa-tornado-damage-storm-forecast-wednesday", "text": "The destructive tornado that ravaged the town of Greenfield, Iowa, on Tuesday has left four dead and at least 35 injured, the Iowa State Patrol said in a Wednesday evening\u00a0news release. Two residents, Dean Wiggins, 78,\u00a0and\u00a0Pamela Wiggins, 77, were killed\u00a0when their home was struck by a\u00a0tornado, according to the Adair and Guthrie County Emergency Management Agency. Another\u00a0man, Michael Jensen, 73, died at his residence. And William Williamson, 70, succumbed to his\u00a0injuries after being\u00a0transported from his home to a hospital. In addition to the fatalities reported in Greenfield, at least one person was killed as storms passed through nearby Adams County, officials said earlier. Monica Irma Zamarron, 49, lost her life after being ejected from her vehicle on Highway 148, according to\u00a0officials. The Iowa State Patrol said the number of those injured from the Greenfield twister \u201cis likely higher, but these numbers reflect only those patients treated for their injuries at designated alternate care sites.\u201d At least 14 patients were taken to medical facilities outside of the county, the release added. The\u00a0tornado that carved through Greenfield \u2013 about 50 miles southwest of Des Moines \u2013\u00a0was\u00a0an EF4,\u00a0the National Weather Service in Des Moines said Thursday, and\u00a0is\u00a0the deadliest of the year. The tornado had peak winds of\u00a0175 mph to\u00a0185 mph,\u00a0was\u00a0more than a half-mile\u00a0wide\u00a0and was on the ground for 44 miles,\u00a0according to the National Weather Service in Des Moines. More than 100 first responders were combing through the wreckage of the town Wednesday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said. The city\u2019s hospital sustained damage and some patients were moved to other facilities in surrounding areas. At least four medical airlift flights occurred. A \u201cmakeshift hospital\u201d was set up in the city\u2019s lumberyard Tuesday right after the tornado tracked out of the area, State Rep. Ray Sorensen said Wednesday. Sorensen lives in the area and assisted with recovery efforts in the immediate aftermath. \u201cWe pulled a guy from the rubble and put him on a little makeshift stretcher that we made for him on the back of a truck,\u201d Sorensen recalled. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows homes and other structures were obliterated and the community is blanketed with heaps of debris, tossed cars and uprooted trees. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific,\u201d Reynolds said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe until you can actually see the devastation.\u201d At least three tornadoes were reported in Iowa on Tuesday \u2013 part of a torrent of storms that left widespread power outages, structural damage and flooding across the US this week. Tornado reports have skyrocketed well-above average in recent weeks as the typically busiest period of severe weather season unfolds. The more than 800 tornadoes reported so far make 2024 one of the most active years for twisters on record. Greenfield, home to just over 2,100 residents, must now recover from the damage of the deadliest tornado in a year that\u2019s recorded fewer deaths from twisters than 2023. Despite the number of tornadoes this year, there had been 17 deaths from the beginning of 2024 until Tuesday, while 65 people died due to tornadoes during the same period last year. Nearly 15,000 homes and businesses were in the dark across Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. On Wednesday, a tornado hurtled through Temple, Texas \u2013 about 35 miles south of Waco \u2013 causing widespread power outages and making many roads dangerous or impassable. First responders were flooded with emergency requests and were prioritizing life-saving calls Wednesday night, the city said in a release announcing a disaster declaration. \u201cCurrently, no life-threatening injuries or fatalities have been reported,\u201d the release said. More than 125,000 homes and businesses in Texas were without power Thursday morning, including nearly 55,000 in Bell County, where Temple is located, according to PowerOutage.us. More than 200 homes destroyed in Iowa The governor expanded her disaster declaration from 15 counties to 32 on Thursday, and said state officials are working with the FEMA to get the federal declaration approved, citing \u201ca lot of destruction and damage across the state.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to process it as quickly as we can,\u201d said FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell. More than 200 homes were destroyed in Iowa, Reynolds said. Greenfield and other parts of western Iowa bore the brunt of the storms\u2019 catastrophic impacts: In Greenfield\u2019s county, Adair, 153 homes were either damaged or destroyed, according to Reynolds. A tornado also toppled a hulking wind turbine just south of Greenfield in Prescott, Iowa, and more than two dozen homes were damaged or destroyed in Montgomery County, including some \u201ccritical public facilities,\u201d emergency management officials said. No injuries have been reported but damage assessments are still ongoing. But Greenfield is the epicenter of Tuesday\u2019s event. \u201cThere is basically nothing left,\u201d Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday. Valerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, pleaded with God to protect her home and her family before she rode out the storm in her basement, she told KCCI. \u201cI was in the furnace room and then I heard (the storm) like a train,\u201d she said, describing insulation flying off of basement windows. \u201cI heard it, and I knew it was hitting.\u201d Warrior said the scale of damage is devastating to see, but she is confident residents will pull each other through the crisis. \u201cThey\u2019ll get through it. You already see people out helping each other, working together. And that\u2019s what they do, people come together when a tragedy happens. People come together to support and encourage each other.\u201d Fighting back tears, Warrior looked out the rubble strewn across her neighborhood and tried to crack a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jessica Jordan, Sara Smart, Amy Simonson, Andy Rose, Brad Parks and Raja Razek contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/weather/iowa-tornado-damage-storm-forecast-wednesday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_europe_russian-strike-kharkiv-megastore-intl", "text": "Eighteen people, including a 12-year-old girl, are among those killed in a Russian strike that hit a large store in Kharkiv\u00a0at the weekend, regional officials have said, making it the deadliest attack Ukraine has endured in several weeks. Five people remain missing, Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv region military administration, said Monday. He said that 48 people were injured in the strike that hit the Epicenter hypermarket shopping center building while nearly 200 people were inside. Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second biggest city, which sits near its border with Russia, has seen a spate of Russian attacks in recent weeks. Security camera footage of the moment of the strike shows the building shake on impact, with the whole site immediately engulfed in thick smoke and flames. Police and witnesses described at least two explosions taking place. Oleksandr Lutsenko, director of the Epicenter shopping center, said he was in his office on the second floor at the time of the two explosions. \u201cI started to make my way down the corridor to the evacuation exit, but it was dark and the whole corridor was covered in dust. There was no air to breathe,\u201d he told CNN over the telephone. \u201cThe employees were also leaving. Everyone was groping, and people were holding each other. We could hear the ceiling falling.\u201d Once outside, he saw the hypermarket was on fire. \u201cThere was black smoke everywhere, and it was hard to breathe. Some people were jumping out of the windows,\u201d Lutsenko added. Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, Ihor\u00a0Klymenko, said the hours following the strike were \u201chellish\u201d and thanked everyone who helped to put\u00a0out the fires. Photographs from inside the store following the attack show the building in complete ruin, with burnt stock and collapsed walls. Ukrainian Catholic University identified the killed 12-year-old as Maria Myronenko, saying in a Facebook post that she had died in the strike alongside her mother, Iryna, who was a student at the institute. Her father had also been injured and was being treated in hospital, it said. Serhii Bolvinov, Chief of the Investigative Department of the Kharkiv Regional Police, said the family had been shopping when the two bombs hit. Maria\u2019s elder sister, Nadiya, 20, was not with them at the time, and learned of the deaths only after finding her father in hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the strike as a \u201cbrutal attack,\u201d saying that\u00a0\u201cRussia is run by men who want to make it a norm \u2013 burning lives, destroying cities and villages, dividing people, and erasing national borders through war.\u201d Zelensky, who was in Spain for an official visit on Monday, urged Ukraine\u2019s allies to provide it with more air defenses. Meeting with Zelensky in Madrid, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced on Monday a new $1.08 billion weapons deal for Ukraine that \u201caims to reinforce air defense systems\u201d and protect Ukrainian citizens and infrastructure from Russia\u2019s attacks. \u201cWe are sending Patriot missiles,\u201d Sanchez said of the American-built air-defense system. \u201cZelensky\u00a0asks for the platforms to launch those, asking how many we can give. We are sending another batch of Leopard tanks and above all, munitions that the [Ukrainian] troops need.\u201d Zelensky\u00a0was due to visit Spain earlier this month but postponed the trip due to Russia\u2019s offensive around Kharkiv and other parts of Ukraine. That offensive appears to continue, with Kharkiv enduring intense attacks daily. The United States announced on Friday that it\u2019s sending $275 million in military assistance to Ukraine as part of \u201cefforts to help Ukraine repel Russia\u2019s assault near Kharkiv,\u201d according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The top US diplomat said the new tranche of assistance \u201ccontains urgently needed capabilities\u201d for Ukrainian troops as they\u00a0fight to hold back Russia\u2019s advances\u00a0toward the key northeastern city. Ukraine tamps down French trainer comments News of the new military assistance came as Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry tamped down expectations that French military trainers could soon be in Ukraine after online comments from army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi appeared to suggest their arrival in country was a done deal. \u201cI welcome the initiative of France to send instructors to Ukraine to train Ukrainian military personnel,\u201d Syrskyi had written on Telegram following a video conference between himself and the two countries\u2019 defense ministers. \u201cI have already signed the documents that will allow the first French instructors to visit our training centres and get acquainted with the infrastructure and personnel.\u201d Syrskyi\u2019s statement gave no possible timeline, but seemed to indicate France was ready to make what would be a very significant shift in NATO countries\u2019 involvement in Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia. Further heightening that sense, Syrskyi went on to write, \u201cI believe that France\u2019s determination will encourage other partners to join this ambitious project. I thanked the minister for the friendly support of the French people and military and economic assistance to Ukraine to repel Russian military aggression.\u201d In a later comment to CNN, apparently designed to lower expectations, and possibly soothe key allies, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry toned down the language, saying Kyiv had \u201cexpressed interest in the prospect of welcoming foreign instructors in Ukraine\u201d ever since a conference in Paris at the end of February. \u201cWe have ongoing discussions with France and other countries on this issue and have started internal paperwork to move forward when the decision is taken,\u201d the short statement concluded. The French Defense Ministry, in a comment to CNN, had a similar message about military trainers. \u201cAs with all the projects discussed at the conference, we are continuing to work with the Ukrainians to understand their exact needs,\u201d the statement said. At the Paris conference, French President Emmanuel Macron had floated the idea that sending military trainers to Ukraine was one way Kyiv\u2019s western allies could deploy troops in the country.

{"id": "travel_article_best-nude-beaches-world", "text": "2024 is already shaping up to be another banner year for nudity around the world with a nude cruise and nude beach weddings on the horizon. Earlier this year, tour and travel company Bare Necessities announced an 11-day voyage from Miami to the Caribbean in collaboration with Norwegian Cruise Line. It\u2019s due to set sail in February 2025. With stopovers in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, \u201cThe Big Nude Boat\u201d is billed as a \u201conce in a lifetime experience\u201d with amenities designed to \u201cfit everyone\u2019s style of bare cruising.\u201d  And couples will soon be able to tie the knot sans clothes at Is Benas Beach in Sardinia, which has a naturist-designated area. The news was confirmed in May by Luigi Tedeschi, mayor of San Vero Milis, the closest town to the beach. \u201cNudity has nothing to do with sex. For [naturists], it\u2019s a philosophy of life, and is linked to nature,\u201d Tedeschi said. \u201cIt should be respected \u2013 so why not?\u201d Meanwhile, there are more places than ever to sun, swim or build sandcastles au naturel at clothing-optional beaches around the world.  From rocky coastlines to talcum-powder fine sands and big city bays to secluded shores, there are now hundreds of beaches where it\u2019s perfectly legal (or at least de facto legal) to frolic beside the sea in nothing more than your birthday suit.   \u201cSoft, smooth sand, warm ocean breeze, gentle ocean waves and lots of other naturists makes for a great clothing-optional beach,\u201d says Nicky Hoffman of The Naturist Society, who\u2019s also the managing editor of Nude & Natural magazine and co-author of \u201cThe World\u2019s Best Nude Beaches & Resorts.\u201d  While clothing-optional beach destinations may seem like a modern invention, it\u2019s actually quite an old idea, a product of the otherwise prudish Victorian era. During the 1880s, American poet Walt Whitman extolled the virtues of the \u201cAdamic air bath\u201d \u2013 his nude walkabouts and swims along Timber Creek in New Jersey, writing of \u201cthe free exhilarating ecstasy of nakedness in Nature.\u201d Channeling that same vibe, the naturist movement took off in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th century, with city parks, camp grounds and eventually beaches established for those who wanted to experience nature nude in their most natural state.  One of the spin-offs of the socially and sexually liberal 1960s was a \u201cfree beach\u201d movement that saw a proliferation of nude beaches around the world. And their popularity continues today, with more and more popping up each year. Here are 24 of the best nude beaches you can visit around the world in 2024:  Playa Naturista Chihuahua, Uruguay  Located about a 30-minute drive from Punta del Este, Uruguay\u2019s best-known nude beach overlooks Portezuelo Bay on the Atlantic coast.  Photogenic dunes and water temperatures that reach 25 Celsius (77 F) and higher even in the Southern Hemisphere winter add to the strand\u2019s allure.     After decades as an unofficial naked getaway, Chihuahua finally achieved legal status in 2000.  Since then, amenities have expanded to include the Hotel El Refugio Nudista Naturista clothing-optional resort. Playa Naturista Chihuahua, Avenida Las Amarras, 20003 Chihuahua, Uruguay   Nida Nude Beach, Lithuania The chilly Baltic Sea may not seem like the most obvious place to skinny dip. But this gorgeous strand on the long, sandy Curonian Spit offers one of Europe\u2019s most picturesque spots to take it all off. With its wildflower-covered dunes (among the highest in Europe) and shoreline forest, the beach was the focus of a 19th-century artists\u2019 colony that attracted many of the leading painters, poets and writers of the time.  Walk far enough south along the strand and you eventually come to a fence that marks the Lithuania-Russia border.  Nida Nude Beach, Nidos-Smiltyn\u0117s pl., Nida, Lithuania Agesta Beach, Sweden Sweden may be home to many beaches where nudity is accepted, but Agesta Beach, located roughly 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Stockholm, is its only official nude beach.  Based in the southern end of the lake Magelungen, Agesta Beach\u2019s sandy shores are popular with locals as well as visitors looking for an escape from the bustling capital city. Open from May to September, this beach is very well looked after, with picnic tables, BBQ areas, public bathrooms and play areas for children available. Agesta Beach, Huddinge, Sweden Little Palm Beach, Waiheke, New Zealand  Although it\u2019s technically legal to go naked on any beach in personal-liberty-loving New Zealand, the nation\u2019s naturists tend to congregate at well-known clothing-optional spots like Little Palm Beach on Waiheke Island.  Reaching the secluded strand entails a 40-to-60-minute ferry ride from Auckland, a taxi or rideshare to the island\u2019s north shore, and then a short downhill hike.  You can top or tail your beach adventure at Waiheke\u2019s many wineries, restaurants, and art galleries.    Little Palm Beach, Miro Road, Waiheke Island 1081, New Zealand   Nugal Beach, Croatia Flanked by sheer cliffs and shades by pine trees, this remote beach on the mainland opposite Bra\u010d island is reached via a narrow path that seems ready made for goats rather than people seeking an apparel-free escape on the Adriatic.   Be sure to bring a thick towel or even a beach chair \u2014 like many Croatian beaches the surface is pebbles rather than sand.  Nugal is about a half-an-hour walk from the nearest town, although it can also be reached by boat or sea kayak from Makarska or Tu\u010depi. Nugal Beach, 21300 Makarska, Croatia   Moshup Beach, Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts Perched at the island\u2019s western extreme, Moshup is a long curving strand that wraps around a headline crowned by the historic Gay Head Lighthouse (built in 1799).  Located right below the ancient light, the clothing optional portion lies beneath rust-colored sandstone cliffs that were declared a National Natural Monument in 1966.  Moshup is open free of charge to anyone who wants to take their clothes off, as opposed to Lucy Vincent, the island\u2019s private nude beach.    Moshup Beach, 71 Moshup Trail, Aquinnah, MA 02535  Black\u2019s Beach, La Jolla, California Set beneath the high cliffs of Torrey Pines, Blacks has been the Golden State\u2019s favorite place for all-over tans for more than 50 years and was once the only legal nude beach in the entire United States.  Long, wide and blessed with great surf, the beach is reached via the zig-zag Ho Chi Minh Trail from the cliff-top Torrey Pines Gliderport near the University of California, San Diego. Black\u2019s Beach, Torrey Pines Scenic Drive, San Diego, CA 92037 Lady Bay Beach, Sydney, Australia  Although it sometimes seems like just about any beach in Australia is clothing optional, there are a number of official nude beaches here such as Lady Bay. (also known as Lady Jane Beach.)  Perched just inside the South Head of Sydney Harbour, it\u2019s small and narrow, but incredibly secluded for such a big city location.  The rocky ledges around South Head are also used for nude sunbathing.  Lady Bay Beach, Watson\u2019s Bay, Sydney, Australia Buhne 16, Sylt, Germany \u201cGrin and bare it\u201d might well be the motto for nudists on this North Sea island, where the average water temperature in summer is a chilly 17 C (63 F).  Technically all of the beaches on Sylt are clothing optional, but Buhne 16 was the first and is still the foremost location for nude sunbathing along the German shore.   It\u2019s a place where beachgoers can chill in the famous blue and white striped wicker beach chairs or let it all hang out at summer beach parties.  Buhne 16, Listlandstr 133b, 25980 Kampen (Sylt), German Wreck Beach, Vancouver, Canada Billed as one of the world\u2019s longest nude beaches at 7.8 kilometers (4.9 miles) long, Wreck Beach is actually a series of sandy strands, pebble flats and rocky outcrops wrapped around the end of Point Grey.  With the University of British Columbia just across the street, a steady stream of students and teachers have shed their clothes on this beach since the early 1970s, when it first became popular.  Evergreen trees along the shore and snowcapped peaks across the water complement the Canadian ambiance.  Wreck Beach, Vancouver, British Columbia; Canada Red Beach, Crete, Greece This secluded shore on the south side of Crete is a hotspot for nude sunbathing in Greece.  Named after its ocher-colored sand and cliffs, Red Beach (or Kokkini Ammos) is reached via a 20-minute hike from Matala or a very short boat ride from the village waterfront. Pioneered by Euro hippies during the 1960s, the beach offers chair and umbrella rentals and is home to a funky little bar called Yianni\u2019s that\u2019s renowned for its mojitos.  Note: the mysterious rock carvings at the end of the beach are a modern creation and definitely not ancient Minoan relics.    Red Beach, Matala, Crete 702 00, Greece  Callantsoog Beach, Netherlands Callantsoog is the oldest nudist beach in the Netherlands, having been officially recognized as a nudist beach since 1973.  Situated 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Amsterdam, near the coastal town of Callantsoog, this beautiful stretch of sand enjoys Blue Flag status and is a great place to spot seals.  Its designated nudist section is marked between two poles. Those keen to get even closer to nature can pay a visit to the nearby Zwanenwater, a protected nature reserve and home to the largest natural dune lakes in Europe. Callantsoog Beach, Strandslag Dorpsplein, 1759 Callantsoog, Netherlands Anse de Grande Saline, St. Barts While the Caribbean may be full of wonderful, chilled out beaches, this wild, white sand strand on the rear side of St. Barts is one of the few places on the islands where public nudity is tolerated (although sunbathing naked is technically prohibited in St. Barts.) Anse de Grande Saline (or Saline Beach) is another self-catering beach. Visitors will need to bring along everything they need for a day at the shore, especially sunscreen, as there is no shade to speak of.  L\u2019Esprit, an excellent French restaurant, is within walking distance of Grand Saline and well worth a visit. Just make sure to put your clothes back on before heading over. Anse de Grande Saline, St. Barth\u00e9lemy Platja des Cavallet, Ibiza, Spain Set between the deep blue Mediterranean and multicolored salt pans near Ibiza\u2019s southernmost point, official nudist beach Es Cavallet is separated into various different sections, including a beach club party section, a gay scene and a more secluded, middle section where the clothing-free crowd hang out.  However nude sunbathers aren\u2019t the only beings who frequent this area. Those bright pink things you\u2019ll see pacing in the background aren\u2019t sunburned tourists, but rather flamingos that like to gather in the shallow salines.    Platja des Cavallet, 07818, Balearic Islands, Spain Little Beach, Maui, Hawaii Flanked by ancient lava flows and backed by a volcanic cinder cone, Little Beach would be super-cool even if you couldn\u2019t take your clothes off.  Part of Makena State Park on the island\u2019s southeast coast, it overlooks a national marine sanctuary renowned for its sea turtles, dolphins, whales and tropical fish.  Gnarled trees behind the sand provide a modicum of shade and the cove is well protected for swimming.  Additionally, a drum circle and fire dancers entertain the crowd during Sunday sunsets. Little Beach, Makena State Park, Makena Rd, Kihei, HI 96753, USA Cap d\u2019Agde beach, France Sometimes called the \u201cNaked City,\u201d Cap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village is the world\u2019s largest clothing-optional beach resort, attracting as many as 40,000 guests on any given day during high season. Visitors are free to be naked wherever they want \u2013 restaurants and stores, post offices or banks, sailing their boat or lounging on the long public beach (where nudity is obligatory, even for those not staying at the resort).  Non residents can stay overnight at the naturist hotel, camp ground or rental units.  Cap d\u2019Agde Naturist Village, Rond-Point du Bagnas, 34300 Agde, France Is Benas Beach, Sardinia, Italy Situated along Sardinia\u2019s west coast close to the town of San Vero Milis, Is Benas is known for its remoteness and pristine environment. The idyllic beach has had a partially hidden naturist-designated area for the past two years. Mayor Luigi Tedeschi of nearby San Vero Milis recently confirmed that local authorities had given the go ahead for couples to say their vows there au naturel at Is Benas in the future. \u201cWe have this beach, a place that lends itself brilliantly to naturism,\u201d Tedeschi told CNN. \u201cAnd then we thought, let\u2019s make a beach for weddings. If people want to marry nude, they can.\u201d The beach is right next to the more famous Is Arenas Beach, while the ruins of Tharros, a Roman city dominating a thin peninsula, can also be found nearby. Is Benas Beach, Province of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy Mpenjati Beach, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  South Africa\u2019s only official nude beach \u2013 and perhaps the only legal clothing-not-obligatory strand on the entire African continent \u2013 is located in the Mpenjati Nature Reserve south of Durban.  Its legal status was achieved in 2014, but this came with a list of prohibitions including no staring, no photography, no suggestive behavior, etc.  Local clergy and others continue to mount protests (legal and otherwise) against the naked designation. Mpenjati Nature Reserve, Palm Beach, Port Edward, South Africa Playa Zipolite, Oaxaca, Mexico  Live your \u201cY Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\u201d fantasies at the beach where so many of the scenes from the sensuous 2001 Mexican movie starring Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal were shot on location. Pioneered by Mexican and American hippies during the 1960s, the strand stretches about two kilometers with rocky bluffs at either end, and is famed as a clothing-optional beach (although it isn\u2019t legal here.) While the main beach here is backed by budget hotels and cafes, a tiny sliver of sand at the eastern end called Playa del Amor offers far more privacy. Playa Zipolite, San Pedro Pochutla, Oaxaca, Mexico  Metsoke Dragot, Israel Float nude in the warm, ultra-buoyant salty water and smear your entire naked body with soothing, mineral-infused black mud at this rocky beach on the western shore of the Dead Sea.  Perhaps the only place in the Middle East where any kind of public nudity is tolerated, Metsoke Dragot is located about an hour\u2019s drive from Jerusalem and requires a short but rough drive along an unpaved road to reach the shoreline. Primitive camping is aloud along the shore. The only nearby hotel and bar is the cliff top Metzoke Dragot Travelers Village.  Metsoke Dragot, Highway 90, Dead Sea, Israel  Praia Massarandupi\u00f3, Bahia, Brazil   The string bikinis on Copacabana may expose an awful lot of Brazilian flesh, but not nearly as much as this naturist beach along the Bahia coast.  A two-hour drive north of Salvador, the nude beach is about a one-kilometer walk from the parking lot along the shoreline flanked by coconut palms, rolling dunes and very surfable waves.  Praia Massarandupi\u00f3, Bahia, Brazil  Spiaggia di Guvano, Vernazza, Italy  Located on the gorgeous Cinque Terre, this primo Italian nude beach looks like something out of a movie (think \u201cSwept Away \u201d \u2013 the 1974 version directed by Lina Wertm\u00fcller.) Adding to the beach\u2019s mystique is the fact that it can only be reached via an old, abandoned railway tunnel (bring a flashlight) on a path from Corniglia village.  Guvano is totally primitive, with no facilities of any kind, so bear this in mind when planning your visit. The beach is also pebble rather than sand, but the water is clear, clean and gorgeous.   Spiaggia di Guvano, 19018 Vernazza, SP, Italy  Vecaki Beach, Riga, Latvia Edged with pine trees, this Latvian beach is as calming as it is beautiful.  Based close to the capital city of Riga and a relatively short walk from Vecaki train station, it\u2019s known for its shimmering waters, stunning sunsets and of course, its nudist section. The zone, which happens to be the biggest nudist beach area in the country, includes a beach volleyball area that\u2019s a big hit with local residents. Vecaki Beach, Selgas iela 20, Riga 1030, Latvia  Haulover Beach Park, Miami, Florida The most popular public nude beach in the United States, Haulover attracts more than 1.3 million bare bottomed people to its white sands and warm water each year.  The clothing-optional portion, marked at either end by picket fences, offers rental beach chairs and umbrellas, as well as lifeguards.  Given the stellar weather in south Florida, there\u2019s usually someone in the buff on any given day.  But the biggest crowds gather during National Nude Recreation Week in July and whenever Haulover is trying to set a new Guinness World Record for skinny dipping.

Young adults will be able to choose between spending one weekend a month volunteering over the course of a year, or take up one of 30,000 spaces to spend a year in the armed forces, Sunak said. The announcement followed Labour Party leader Keir Starmer\u2019s comments on Saturday that he was in favour of allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to vote. Sunak\u2019s Conservatives\u00a0lag Labour\u00a0by a wide margin in opinion polls, which have shown little change in fortunes for the prime minister since his surprise election call last Wednesday. \u201cBritain today faces a future that is more dangerous and more divided. There\u2019s no doubt that our democratic values are under threat. That is why we will introduce a bold new model of national service for 18-year-olds,\u201d Sunak said in a statement. The Conservative Party said the proposal would be funded by cracking down on tax avoidance and evasion, and by diverting money from the\u00a0UK\u00a0Shared Prosperity Fund, which existed to reduce regional economic inequality. Labour politicians derided the announcement. \u201cThe national service we need from our young people is to vote for change on July 4,\u201d said Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester. Interior minister James Cleverly told broadcasters there would be no criminal sanctions for skipping mandatory service but that people will be compelled to do it, without providing further details. Asked by the BBC if forcing adults to volunteer was at odds with the Conservative Party\u2019s liberal tradition, Cleverly said: \u201cWe force people to do things all the time.\u201d He cited compulsory education or training for teenagers until the age of 18 as an example.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/europe/national-service-britain-uk-sunak-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

Kapadia\u2019s film \u201cAll We Imagine As Light\u201d is a drama centered on two Malayali nurses who have moved to a beautifully-shot Mumbai, and are navigating life, love and sisterhood. It is the first Indian movie in three decades to compete in Cannes\u2019 main competition. \u201cIt was already a dream to be selected in competition and this was beyond my imagination,\u201d Kapadia said in her acceptance speech, turning to face the Cannes\u2019 jury, which this year include director Greta Gerwig and actor Lily Gladstone. \u201cPlease don\u2019t wait another 30 years to have an Indian film,\u201d she said to the audience. The win has reverberated across the country, with many on social media including top politicians, remarking on its significance. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X that the country was \u201cproud\u201d of Kapadia\u2019s \u201chistoric feat.\u201d \u201cHer remarkable talent continues to shine on the global stage, giving a glimpse of the rich creativity in India. This prestigious accolade not only honors her exceptional skills but also inspires a new generation of Indian filmmakers.\u201d Rahul Gandhi, a leader of India\u2019s main opposition political party, the Indian National Congress, also congratulated the director, along with Anasuya Sengupta, the first Indian actor to win Best Actress for her role in \u201cThe Shameless,\u201d in the festival\u2019s Un Certain Regard section. \u201cIndian stars shining bright\u2026 These women have scripted history, and inspired the entire Indian film fraternity,\u201d he wrote on the platform. Sooni Taraporevala, the screenwriter on \u201cSalaam Bombay!\u201d which won the festival\u2019s Camera d\u2019Or in 1988, told CNN that Kapadia\u2019s \u201cunprecedented\u201d win \u201chas personally touched women and those in the indie film space.\u201d \u201c(It\u2019s) allowed us to dream and hope and celebrate her with unabashed pride and joy,\u201d she said, adding that India\u2019s independent film\u00a0scene can feel \u201chopeless\u201d in an industry \u201cdominated\u201d by mainstream productions. \u201cAll We Imagine As Light\u201d received an eight-minute standing ovation when it premiered during the festival. Some have pointed to the film\u2019s depiction of the romance between main character Prabha (Kani Kusruti) and her Muslim boyfriend (Hridhu Haroon) as particularly bold, given the country has become increasingly polarized along religious lines. India is the largest film producing country in the world, but still lags behind Hollywood when it comes to making movies that gain international recognition and pick up major awards. Last year the Telegu-language historical fantasy \u201cRRR\u201d became the country\u2019s first feature film to win an Oscar for best original song. The tune \u201cNaatu Naatu\u201d was praised for its catchy beat and vibrant dance moves. \u201cThe Elephant Whisperers,\u201d directed by Indian filmmaker Kartiki Gonsalves, also took the prize for best documentary short at the ceremony. In 1947, filmmaker Chetan Anand took Cannes\u2019 top prize for his film \u201cNeecha Nagar,\u201d becoming the only Indian to win the accolade.

The attack occurred in Kuchi village, Munya district, in Niger state, beginning at about 5:30 p.m. on Friday and lasting until 4:00 a.m. Saturday, according to district official Aminu Abdulhamid Najume. Niger state, which borders Nigeria\u2019s capital Abuja, has experienced repeated kidnappings for ransom by armed groups, including mass abductions, in recent years. Najume reported that about 300 gunmen arrived on motorbikes and stayed for several hours, making themselves at home before leaving with the abductees. \u201cThey made a fire to curb the cold because it was raining throughout that day,\u201d Najume said. \u201cThey cooked and made tea; they made Indomie (instant noodles) and spaghetti.\u201d Some of those killed were members of a local vigilante group who confronted the attackers but were overpowered. Najume added that security forces had not yet started rescue operations. \u201cThe police visited Kuchi yesterday [Sunday] and left, nothing else.\u201d A spokesperson for the Niger State Police Command did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. \u201cThis is not the first or second time Kuchi village has been attacked. This is the fifth time,\u201d Najume said, noting that the area frequently suffers from kidnappings for ransom. The kidnappers have not yet made any demands regarding the latest abduction, he said. Amnesty International said in a post\u00a0on social media platform X on Sunday that it was \u201cdeeply concerned by the abduction,\u201d criticizing Nigerian authorities for leaving \u201crural communities at the mercy of gunmen.\u201d \u201cSince 2021, gunmen have been consistently attacking Kuchi village and raping women and girls in their matrimonial homes,\u201d the agency stated. \u201cThe invasion of the village by the gunmen is yet another indication of the Nigerian authorities\u2019 utter failure to protect lives,\u201d Amnesty added. Nigeria\u2019s security forces have struggled for years to control insurgent groups in the north of the country. The Kuchi abduction comes two months after 21 people, including a newlywed, were killed when gunmen described locally as \u2018bandits\u2019 stormed a market in Rafi, another affected district in Niger. At least 137 schoolchildren were kidnapped earlier in March in Niger\u2019s neighboring Kaduna state but were later released after the kidnappers made an initial demand of 1 billion naira (over $675,000) and threatened to kill them all if their demands were not met.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/africa/gunmen-kidnap-scores-in-nigeria-deadly-raid-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities.

As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments.

We are investigating the case,\u201d Netanyahu said in a speech at the Israeli Knesset. At least 45 people were killed and more than 200 others injured after a fire broke out at the camp following the strike, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian medics. No hospital in Rafah had the capacity to take the number of casualties, the ministry said. Footage obtained by CNN showed the camp in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. \u201cSeveral civilians are still trapped inside the camp, which was attacked without warning,\u201d a Palestinian man filming the fire said. \u201cThis was declared a safe zone.\u201d A US official told CNN Monday that Israel had told the Biden administration it used a precision munition to hit a target in Rafah, but that the explosion from the strike ignited a fuel tank nearby and started a fire that engulfed a camp for displaced Palestinians and led to dozens of deaths. \u201cWe can\u2019t confirm that but it\u2019s what Israel shared with us,\u201d the official said, \u201cand we assume we will learn more once Israel completes its investigation.\u201d The attack came after Hamas launched rockets at Tel Aviv on Sunday for the first time in months. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that eight rockets were fired from the Rafah area, and that \u201ca number of projectiles\u201d had been intercepted. The IDF said it destroyed the rocket launchers used by Hamas shortly after the strikes. The Israeli military said in a statement earlier on Monday that it had struck \u201ca compound in Rafah in which significant Hamas terrorists were operating.\u201d It said the strike killed two Hamas officials \u2013 West Bank Chief of Staff Yassin Rabia and senior Hamas member Khaled Nagar. CNN cannot verify these claims. The IDF said in a later statement Monday that its Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism \u2013 an independent body responsible for examining allegations of misconduct in conflict \u2013 will investigate the \u201ccircumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area of the strike.\u201d It was among the deadliest strikes by the Israeli military on Gaza\u2019s southernmost city since Israel began its operation there on May 7. It also came just days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations\u2019 top court, ordered Israel to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its military operation in Rafah, and any other action in the city, \u201cwhich may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d The IDF said the attack was conducted based on \u201cprior intelligence\u201d indicating that senior officials of Hamas\u2019 West Bank wing were present at the site. The IDF said it had assessed there would be \u201cno expected harm to uninvolved civilians.\u201d More than 36,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military operation there, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave, which started after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. Footage of the aftermath shared on social media showed chaotic scenes. In one video, the lifeless body of a man was seen being dragged by the legs out of the flames. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, he\u2019s dead,\u201d a rescuer says before moving on to find others. In another video, a man wept as he held up the headless body of a toddler for the camera. Women shrieked in grief as children peered into the fire. A man with a bloodied face stood in apparent shock, examining his wounds with one hand, as he held an infant with blood-stained clothes in the other arm. One of the bodies pulled out of the fire was charred-stiff. By Monday morning, the camp was in ruins with small fires still burning. Men and boys gathered around, rummaging through the burned and smoking wreckage for food and their belongings as drones hovered above. One of the structures still standing was a sign that read: \u201cKuwait peace camp 1.\u201d Children and women living in makeshift tents were among those killed, according to a post on X from UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. \u201cThe images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on earth,\u201d the commissioner-general said Monday. \u201cOthers were reportedly burnt to death,\u201d Lazzarini said. The reporting is based on open-source photos and videos which were shared with UNRWA, including from social media, UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma told CNN. Mohammad Abu Al Subeh, a displaced Palestinian man who survived the strike, said as he was lying in bed in the evening when he saw \u201crockets fired down at us.\u201d \u201cIt shook the earth like an earthquake,\u201d Abu Al Subeh, who fled his home in Nuseirat some five months ago, told CNN. He had to escape through the window of his makeshift house  in the desert area where the camp is located. \u201cI came here based on the leaflet that was dropped (by Israel) saying go to this humanitarian area,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just civilians here.\u201d Abu Nidal Al Attar, another displaced Palestinian who witnessed the attack, told CNN: \u201cWe were sitting as normal people do\u201d when they suddenly saw strikes and fire. \u201cWe went to see, and they were pulling out burned people.\u201d Hamas called the attack \u201ca horrific war crime\u201d and \u201cterrible massacre.\u201d International outrage International condemnation was swift, with UN agencies, aid groups and governments calling on Israel to respect the ICJ ruling and halt its Rafah operation. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday condemned the airstrike. \u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cDespite the ICJ binding ruling, Israel struck Rafah and Hamas fired rockets to Israel,\u201d the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, wrote Monday on X. \u00a0On Monday, in a meeting with Arab leaders to discuss Gaza and the Middle, Borrell said that \u201cwhat we have seen in the immediate hours is that Israel continues the military action that it has been asked to stop.\u201d Medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it was \u201chorrified by this deadly event, which shows once again that nowhere is safe.\u201d The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said \u201cGaza is hell on earth,\u201d referring to the Rafah attack. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \u201coutraged\u201d and called for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire.\u201d Critics have pushed back on Israel\u2019s claims. Already worried about an intensifying war right on its border with Gaza, Egypt on Monday condemned Israel\u2019s strike on Rafah, calling on the Jewish state to implement the ICJ ruling of \u201chalting military operations\u201d in Rafah and to \u201ccomply with its responsibilities as an occupying power\u201d. A mediator in the war, Egypt is set to host another round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas on Tuesday. Qatar, another key mediator, said Israel\u2019s strike could \u201chinder\u201d ongoing negotiations, and called the attack a \u201cserious violation of international law.\u201d Over a million Palestinians had been sheltering in Rafah before Israel began its operations there, having fled there from other areas of Gaza after Israel began its military campaign in the territory. Israel has said it had ordered civilians to leave some areas of Rafah, but many remain there, sheltering in what Israel designated as \u201csafe zones.\u201d More than 800,000 people have fled Rafah since May 6, according to UN figures. Israel has vowed to press on with its Rafah operation despite international outrage and a US warning not to proceed. In response to the ICJ ruling last week, Israel said it \u201chas not and will not conduct military actions in the Rafah area which may inflict on the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/middleeast/gaza-rafah-displaced-people-camp-israel-strike-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_europe_norway-ireland-spain-palestinian-state-analysis-intl", "text": "Europe has struggled over the Middle East for a very long time. The decision by Ireland, Spain and Norway to recognize\u00a0a\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0state\u00a0tells us more about the domestic politics of those countries than anything else. Obviously, the decision of three European nations to take this step is newsworthy and will have repercussions diplomatically, perhaps putting pressure on their allies to take a firmer stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict. However, it is also reasonable to say that thus far, no amount of pressure from even the US has had a major impact on the thinking of\u00a0Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu.\u00a0Israel responded by recalling the ambassadors of the three countries, accusing them of rewarding terror with the decision. Conversations about what recognition of statehood practically means and how helpful\u00a0it is\u00a0to the Palestinian cause in the long run are all entirely valid. But the reality is that the stakes are quite low for the majority of European countries when it comes\u00a0to\u00a0issues relating to Israel and\u00a0the\u00a0Palestinians. In Ireland, Spain and Norway, support for\u00a0a Palestinian state\u00a0chimes with the broader electorate and is unlikely to receive any political blowback. That isn\u2019t necessarily the case in other European countries. While supporting a peaceful two-state solution in the long-term, Germany has been consistent in its support for Israel, as have Hungary, Poland, the UK and others. The main consequence of this is military support, which inevitably raises questions about complicity in the war against Hamas \u2013 namely weapons being used to kill civilians.\u00a0The UK government is currently under pressure to publish legal advice on whether or not selling arms to Israel falls foul of international law. But these are largely domestic issues. For a long time, European governments have\u00a0mostly\u00a0considered the Middle East \u2013 especially Israel \u2013 to be something that the US deals with,\u00a0in part due to the US\u2019s military operations in the region. European countries simply do not have a huge amount of influence in this area. The Middle East was not something that dominated European thinking in a major way until the fallout from the Arab Spring led to an enormous influx of migrants into continental Europe. Aside from the practical implications of mass migration, it also presented a security risk, with terror groups hiding among refugees and carrying out atrocities across the continent. That isn\u2019t to say Europeans didn\u2019t care about the Middle East, specifically\u00a0the Palestinian cause.\u00a0Large sections of Ireland are supportive of Palestine due to its own history of occupation, while Norway mediated the famous Oslo accords. The European Union has historically sent huge amounts of humanitarian aid into Palestinian territories and supported a two-state solution. Indeed, the European Commission responded to Wednesday\u2019s news: \u201cThe European Union has a long-standing commitment to the vision of an independent and sovereign state of Palestine, living side by side with Israel in peace and security.\u201d Whether this pushes any kind of peace process along or not remains to be seen. This is not a coordinated European effort. Norway is not a member of the EU and the idea that 27 member states would all be willing to go as far as Ireland and Spain seems extremely unlikely. Yes, it might put pressure on bigger players to take a stand. But Europe doesn\u2019t speak with one voice and is unlikely to any time soon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/europe/norway-ireland-spain-palestinian-state-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

Just under 109 million people across broad swaths of the US were under threat of large hail, damaging winds and a fierce twisters Sunday, mainly throughout the mid-Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee River valleys. As the storms move east, the Storm Prediction Center warned of \u201cviolent tornadoes, extreme hail and corridors of widespread wind damage.\u201d President Joe Biden has been briefed on the storms. A heightened tornado watch designated as a rare \u201cparticularly dangerous situation\u201d calling for \u201cseveral tornadoes and few intense likely\u201d went into effect on Sunday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. LIVE UPDATES FROM THE REGION The watch covers parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee \u2013 including in St. Louis and Jefferson City, Missouri; Paducah, Kentucky; and Carbondale, Illinois \u2013 and impacts 4.7 million people. This is a special kind of tornado watch issued only when there\u2019s unusually high confidence in the potential of multiple at least EF2-strength and long-lived tornadoes in the area, according to the National Weather Service. The supercell thunderstorms firing up in the watch area will also be capable of large hail bigger than the size of baseballs and damaging wind gusts to 75 mph. \u201cIntense supercell thunderstorms will continue to develop across the watch area through this evening. Several tornadoes are likely, some of which are expected to be intense. Very large hail is also likely, along with the risk for potentially significant damaging wind gusts,\u201d says the Storm Prediction Center. Severe storms kill over a dozen people At least seven people in Cooke County, Texas, were killed when severe storms hit the area Saturday night, Sheriff Ray Sappington told CNN. Two victims were 2 and 5 years old. At least eight people died in Arkansas, officials say. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency Sunday afternoon to support the severe weather and tornado-ravaged parts of the state.\u00a0 One person died in Kentucky, according to Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg. In northeast Oklahoma, two people were killed and at least 23 were injured as a result of severe storms overnight, local officials told CNN. Survey teams from the National Weather Service found severe damage Sunday in Claremore, Oklahoma, giving the tornado a preliminary rating of EF3 \u2013 which pack winds between 136 and 165 mph. Inside a Shell gas station in northeast Texas, 60 to 80 people were trapped until the storm blew over, Sappington said. Multiple injuries were reported at the station, but none were life-threatening, he added. In north Denton County, a possible tornado injured an unknown number of people, damaged several homes, overturned 18-wheelers, downed trees and knocked out power lines on Saturday night, authorities said early Sunday. \u201cMultiple victims\u201d were reported in Ray Roberts after severe weather struck the area overnight, city of Denton fire officials\u00a0said. Damage to several homes was also reported in the neighboring city of Celina, where officials said the city was affected by \u201capparent\u00a0tornadic activity\u201d on Saturday. Lake Ray Roberts Marina\u00a0in the city of Sanger in Denton County sustained damage to boats, boat houses and the fuel dock by the severe weather Saturday night. Despite reports of people rescued after being trapped in overturned RVs, there are no reports of serious injuries. \u201cThere is so much damage, we don\u2019t even know where to start,\u201d the marina said in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0Sunday morning. \u201cWe know the boat houses are heavily damaged, all have lost walkways, and most boats are damaged,\u201d the post said. \u201cWe lost our fuel dock and offices along with our dock cat, Ginger.\u201d A survey team with the National Weather Service in Dallas found that a tornado of at least a preliminary rating of EF2 strength struck Valley View in northern Texas with estimated maximum winds of 135 mph. The team also said damage found in south Montague County, just south of Forestburg, was consistent with an EF2 tornado and estimated maximum winds of 125 mph. Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday signed a disaster declaration for four additional counties \u2013 Denton, Collin, Cooke and Montague \u2013 bringing the total to 106 counties. \u201cI saw the harrowing video inside the Valley View gas station as the tornado passed through with the people stockpiled in their clinging to safety,\u201d Abbott said at a news conference, adding that it\u2019s a \u201cmiracle\u201d everyone made it out alive. At least 100 people have been injured in Texas, said Abbott, who referred to the deaths as a \u201cheart-wrenching loss of life.\u201d As damaged areas recover, storms move east More than 600,000 customers across 12 states were without power by Sunday evening, including more than 135,000 outages in Kentucky alone, according to the tracking website\u00a0poweroutage.us. There is a Level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys into Monday morning, and EF2 to EF5 tornadoes and wind gusts of 74 mph are possible, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Storms will move\u00a0toward the East Coast on Monday, bringing disruptive high winds and large hail from DC through the Southeast. The travel hubs of Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Nashville could have to contend with damaging storms, leading to delayed or canceled flights. The potential for heavy rain over parts of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, middle Mississippi Valley, and Central Appalachians prompted the slight risk, Level 2 of 4, of excessive rainfall in those regions through Monday morning. Louisville, Kentucky; Cincinnati; St. Louis; Nashville and Indianapolis are among the cities included in the Level 3 threat. Record-breaking heat possible for some The unofficial start of summer is also ushering in sweltering heat, reaching potentially record high temperatures for parts of the US on Monday. Houston; New Orleans; Miami; Mobile, Alabama, Tampa, Florida; and Charleston, South Carolina, are among locations where warm weather will feel more like July than late May through the holiday weekend. A subtropical upper-level high over Mexico will help spawn excessive heat warnings and heat advisories over southern Texas through Monday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cThe ridging will create a dangerous early-season heat wave over south Texas and southern Florida,\u201d according to the center. Daily high temperatures and heat index reading exceeding 115 are possible in some areas, the Storm Prediction Center noted. Those spending time outdoors or who are dealing with a loss of power should drink enough water, dress in lightweight clothing and locate cooling centers if necessary.

{"id": "2024_05_23_asia_china-taiwan-drills-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Tensions are once again ratcheting up in the Taiwan Strait, with China launching two days of military drills encircling Taiwan just days after the democracy swore in a new leader long loathed by Beijing. The exercises began early Thursday, in what China described as \u201cpunishment\u201d for \u201cseparatist acts\u201d \u2013 alluding to the election and inauguration of the self-governing island\u2019s new President Lai Ching-te. China\u2019s military says the drills are designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power\u201d over Taiwan. Though relations between the two sides have been steadily worsening in recent years, this latest escalation marks a significant test for Taiwan\u2019s new leader, whose ruling party has championed democracy in the face of growing threats\u00a0from its authoritarian neighbor. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.\u00a0And it has become much more bellicose under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Here\u2019s what you need to know. What\u2019s happening with the drills? The Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) said it launched joint military drills involving the army, navy, air force and rocket force in areas around Taiwan early\u00a0Thursday morning. The drills are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 a narrow body of water separating the self-ruling island from mainland China \u2013 as well as north, south and east of Taiwan. They are also taking place in areas around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off China\u2019s southeastern coast, the command said in a statement. Naval Colonel Li Xi, spokesperson for the command, called the exercises \u201ca strong punishment for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces and a serious warning against interference and provocation by external forces.\u201d As part of the drills on Thursday, dozens of Chinese fighter jets carrying live ammunition conducted mock strikes against \u201chigh-value military targets\u201d of the \u201cenemy\u201d alongside destroyers, frigates and missile speedboats, according to China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV. On Friday, the Eastern Theater Command said it was continuing the drills on both sides of the Taiwan island chain to \u201ctest the ability to jointly seize power, launch joint attacks and occupy key areas.\u201d CCTV aired\u00a0footage that shows PLA soldiers moving mobile artillery and missile systems into position, though it did not show any live fire. China\u2019s military drills are often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally. Chinese state media heavily covered the drills while the military also posted footage on social media. The exercises subsequently went viral on China\u2019s heavily regulated internet. How has Taiwan reacted? Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had dispatched sea, air and ground forces to respond to China\u2019s drills. It expressed regret at \u201csuch irrational provocations and actions that undermine regional peace and stability.\u201d Taiwan has also been closely monitoring China\u2019s warplanes and naval ships that came close to the island. Between 6 a.m. Thursday and 6 a.m. Friday, the ministry detected 49 Chinese aircraft, 19 warships and seven coast guard vessels. The island\u2019s presidential office said in a statement that it was \u201cconfident and capable of defending national security,\u201d accusing China of \u201cusing unilateral military provocation to threaten Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom.\u201d But despite Beijing\u2019s large show of force, life continued as normal in Taiwan, whose 23 million people have become used to China\u2019s military threats, even as they become more regular and prominent in recent years. \u201cWe are not scared of the Chinese Communist Party, and we have confidence,\u201d\u00a0an 88-year-old retiree, who gave his surname Liu, told CNN. \u201cIf the Chinese Communist Party does attack Taiwan, it won\u2019t be easy for them to take Taiwan. Taiwanese people are not afraid of war.\u201d What triggered this? The most obvious answer is Lai\u2019s inauguration on Monday. Lai\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), now in power for a historic third term, views Taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation with a distinct Taiwanese identity. Ahead of Taiwan\u2019s elections back in January, Beijing had warned that a Lai victory could inflame tensions and spark conflict \u2013 repeatedly framing the vote as a choice between \u201cpeace and war.\u201d Taiwanese voters dismissed those warnings, returning the DPP to power \u2013 although two opposition parties that favor closer ties with China now have a majority in parliament. China\u2019s government and state media regularly rebuke Lai, calling him a dangerous separatist, \u201ctroublemaker\u201d and \u201cwar maker,\u201d while rejecting his repeated offers of talks. Their vehement dislike of Lai is rooted in his political past, as well as Beijing\u2019s refusal to deal directly with a huge swathe of Taiwan\u2019s leaders. The 64-year-old former doctor and political veteran was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence \u2013 a red line for Beijing. His views have tempered over the years, and he now says he favors the status quo, saying there is \u201cno plan or need\u201d to declare independence since the island is \u201calready an independent sovereign country.\u201d But Beijing has never forgiven him for those early comments \u2013 making its stance clear with the drills on Thursday. Lai, too, has set the tone for his new administration\u2019s approach to China \u2013 using his inaugural speech on Monday to declare that a \u201cglorious era of Taiwan\u2019s democracy has arrived,\u201d and reiterating a determination to defend its sovereignty. He also called on Beijing to cease its \u201cintimidation\u201d of Taiwan and respect that its people want to decide their own destiny. What\u2019s the relationship between China and Taiwan? The Chinese Civil War ended with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) taking power in the mainland, establishing the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in Beijing in 1949. The defeated Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan, moving the seat of their Republic of China (ROC) government from the mainland to Taipei. Both proclaimed themselves the sole rightful government of the entire Chinese territory. In recent years, Taiwan has downplayed its territorial claims over mainland China, and is today a vibrant democracy, with its own military, currency, constitution and elected government. But it is not recognized as an independent country by most governments in the world.\u00a0Over the decades it has become increasingly isolated, with a number of governments switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.\u00a0But unofficial diplomatic ties with many Western nations have in fact been bolstered in recent years, in part thanks to China\u2019s saber-rattling. Meanwhile, under Xi, China has become increasingly assertive in foreign policy and grown more authoritarian at home. China has cut official communication with Taiwan since the DPP took office in 2016, and has ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure on the island. At the same time, ties between Taipei and Washington have become more robust, with increased arms sales and high-level political engagement under Lai\u2019s popular predecessor Tsai Ing-wen. This has infuriated Beijing, spurring it to unleash more pressure on Taiwan and sending cross-strait relations on a downward spiral. Where does the US stand in this? The US formally switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 \u2013 but has long trod a delicate middle path. In what is known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, Washington recognizes the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China; it also acknowledges Beijing\u2019s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never accepted the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s claim of sovereignty over the island. The US maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan, which have been strengthened in recent years. It is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and supplies it with defensive weaponry. American lawmakers regularly visit Taiwan and have supported legislation to bolster US support for the island and its defensive capabilities. But it has historically remained deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in case of a Chinese invasion, a policy known as \u201cstrategic ambiguity.\u201d After the election in January, the US sent a bipartisan delegation to Taiwan, where they met with Lai and Tsai \u2013 and promised that American support for\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0will continue no matter who wins the upcoming US election. Beijing on Tuesday also announced sanctions against former US House Representative Mike Gallagher, who led that delegation, citing his \u201cremarks and actions\u201d that \u201cinterfere\u201d in China\u2019s internal affairs.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/asia/china-taiwan-drills-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_27_style_on-becoming-a-guinea-fowl-cannes-rungano-nyoni-interview-spc", "text": "The final, searing shot of Rungano Nyoni\u2019s \u201cOn Becoming a Guinea Fowl\u201d is a convergence of everything that\u2019s come before. The film, about a sudden death and family secrets in Zambia, comes to a thundering conclusion in a shouting match that threatens to drown out all empathy. Trauma, misogyny and Kafkaesque logic combine in a toxic brew that\u2019s difficult to stomach, for us as well as its main character. For a film that has remained even-tempered in its study of family values \u00ad\u2013 and the groupthink family can foster \u2013 finally, its pulse quickens. You realize that rage, that had felt disquietingly absent before, was there all along. Nyoni\u2019s first movie \u201cI Am Not A Witch\u201d broke through at the Cannes Film Festival in 2017 and won her a BAFTA. The Zambian British filmmaker returned to the festival with another acerbic work, this time with heavyweight backing in the form of US distributor A24 (\u201cEverything Everywhere All At Once,\u201d \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d) and producer Element Pictures (\u201cPoor Things\u201d), winning the award for best director in the Un Certain Regard competition on May 24. Like her debut, a satire on the practice of witch camps, also set in Zambia, the country of Nyoni\u2019s birth, \u201cGuinea Fowl\u201d deals with injustice in tragicomic fashion. This time the writer-director\u2019s target is historic abuse, and what happens when the perpetrator can\u2019t or won\u2019t be held accountable. The idea came from a scrapped plotline for Nyoni\u2019s previous film, she told CNN, in an interview during the festival. She revived it through intensive research, interviewing survivors in Zambia for her Bemba and English-language screenplay. \u201cWhat I found quite remarkable was how casual people are about sexual abuse,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes everybody knows the perpetrator and sits at the (same) dinner table. How do you cope with that? How do you cope with somebody, that everybody knows they do that, and then ask them to pass the salt? It\u2019s bizarre to me. How do you not get up and just set everything on fire?\u201d That most people don\u2019t is the thread Nyoni wanted to pull at. \u201cThe difficulty of speaking up and the submissiveness you experience in that silence,\u201d she said, is \u201can ongoing subject\u201d in her filmmaking. Her sophomore feature concerns Shula (Susan Chardy), a middle-class Zambian who has recently returned from a life abroad. One night, on the way back from a fancy dress party, she discovers her uncle dead by the roadside. She reports this to her father only to be met with the first of a series of bizarre responses to the news. \u201cUncle Fred can\u2019t die. Just sprinkle some water on him,\u201d she\u2019s told. Her father is right, albeit for the wrong reasons: Uncle Fred has been living in Shula\u2019s head ever since he abused her as a child. She\u2019s not the only survivor in the family, we learn, nor was any of this much of a secret. Nevertheless, there\u2019s a funeral to be arranged, public displays of mourning to wail through, and a lot of history to be swept under the carpet. Spiking her drama with surreal images and poetic flourishes, Nyoni sends audiences through the looking glass, then pulls them back with pitch black humor, asking us to question whether what we\u2019re watching is all that absurd in the first place. \u201cYou don\u2019t even look traumatized,\u201d one affronted aunty tells Shula in the aftermath of Fred\u2019s discovery. Later at a gathering of mourners, another aunty instructs her to \u201ccry a bit.\u201d \u201cWhy are you so cold hearted?\u201d she adds, \u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing us.\u201d Nyoni sees her film as corrective to how abuse is often depicted. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you see in a lot of movies,\u201d she explains, \u201c(where) you say your secret, and everyone comes around you. From my experience \u2013 and from what I saw from other people \u2013 sometimes that doesn\u2019t happen. Then how do you live with that?\u201d \u201cGuinea Fowl\u201d zeroes in on a bitter irony: the same conspiracy of silence that is breaking apart individuals is also holding the family together. Deference and duty remain paramount, and to the mourners who descend on the family home to pay their respects, everyone appears outwardly functional. (That this is happening in a matriarchal society, where men are largely side-lined, makes it even more confounding.) \u201cI know quite well about keeping secrets,\u201d said the writer-director, cryptically. Of the film\u2019s family dynamics, \u201cI know this subject,\u201d she elaborated, \u201cbut this is definitely a fictionalized version of whatever it is I\u2019ve experienced.\u201d Faced with a family omerta and a dead perpetrator, there\u2019s nowhere for Shula to place her anger. \u201cYou can\u2019t question a corpse,\u201d her father says, imploring her to let bygones be bygones. It\u2019s taboo to speak ill of the dead. But as memories continue to hemorrhage through, her reaction to her abuser\u2019s death poses questions of his enablers. In her feature debut, Chardy rises to the challenge of playing Shula. \u201cI empathize with her a lot,\u201d said the actor. \u201cAs a person I have a lot to say, and to find this medium where you\u2019re trying to say something without saying something, it\u2019s a push and pull between feeling powerless and powerful at the same time.\u201d The writer-director also sees some of herself in her lead. \u201cI have this rage,\u201d Nyoni said. \u201cYou can see it, but maybe it\u2019s more subtle, it\u2019s somehow repressed.\u201d Screenwriting is \u201calways a reflection of what I\u2019m going through,\u201d she added, \u201cI try not to get in the way of that.\u201d Shula is not the only perspective the director was interested in, however. Nyoni increasingly folds in the narrative of Fred\u2019s young widow (played by Norah Mwansa) \u2013 a victim herself, further victimized by his death. \u201cThe widow I struggled with, so we found people who\u2019ve been in the same situation,\u201d Nyoni said. \u201cThey were very candid, and told me about their stories and were really open.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got worse stories to tell about what happens (than what appears in the film),\u201d she added. \u201cWidows end up being a scapegoat for a lot of people\u2019s frustrations.\u201d In its final act, \u201cGuinea Fowl\u201d shows how difficult it can be to truly break the cycle of abuse. Yet Nyoni\u2019s complicated portrait of family trauma is not without hope, thanks to Shula and a last gasp moment full of sound and fury, signifying everything. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s the most powerful shot in the film,\u201d said Chardy. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than \u2018(Shula) finds strength;\u2019 she owns what happened to her and wants to take everybody else with her.\u201d Chardy hopes the film\u2019s sense of resolve will resonate. \u201cThere are a lot more women in the world who have gone through this, and you really don\u2019t know until you speak to someone,\u201d she added. \u201cI hope that (audiences) will be able to find some strength from the journey that Shula finds herself on.\u201d \u201cOn Becoming A Guinea Fowl\u201d premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and is coming soon to theaters in the US and UK.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/style/on-becoming-a-guinea-fowl-cannes-rungano-nyoni-interview-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

In the videos, horse-mounted police and water cannons can be seen in Tel Aviv\u2019s Democracy Square attempting to disperse crowds refusing to leave, resulting in violent clashes. At a separate protest, police said they arrested two people \u201cfor disorderly conduct\u201d after they allegedly left the approved demonstration site at the Kaplan intersection, headed to the Azrieli intersection and \u201clit fires and began to break the order, not obeying the police\u2019s instructions.\u201d \u201cA police officer declared the demonstration illegal and warned that if they did not disperse the police would be forced to use measures,\u201d police added in a statement. The clashes followed anti-government protest marches that took place in several cities across Israel, calling for the release of hostages taken during Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on Israel on Oct 7, and for a general election. Around 250 people\u00a0were taken hostage during\u00a0Hamas\u2019 surprise October 7 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli officials. Since then, Israel\u2019s retaliatory war on Hamas in Gaza has killed\u00a0more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. Many of the protesters in the streets of Tel Aviv, Haifa, Rehovot and beyond on Saturday took aim at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing his government of corruption and criticizing his handling of the war against Hamas. Families of current and past hostages also held a rally calling for an immediate resumption of negotiations with Hamas to \u201cadvance a deal that will bring them all back.\u201d Israel\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) believes 125 hostages are still being held in Gaza, following the release deal in November that freed more than 100. Of those still in Gaza, 121 were kidnapped on Oct 7; the four others were already being held before the attacks. The PMO believes that at least 37 of the hostages still in the Gaza Strip are dead. Negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage swap deal will resume on Tuesday, an Egyptian official with knowledge of the matter told CNN. The Egyptian official said the talks would take place in Cairo. An Israeli official with knowledge of the matter also told CNN talks were set to resume next week but did not specify a location.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/middleeast/tel-aviv-protests-gaza-hostages-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_asia_wwii-submarine-wreck-uss-harder-found-philippines-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "The wreck of one of the most storied US Navy submarines of World War II has been found in the South China Sea eight decades after its last patrol, the Navy\u2019s History and Heritage Command said Thursday. The USS Harder lies under 3,000 feet (about 900 meters) of water off the northern Philippine island of Luzon, sitting upright and intact except for damage behind its conning tower from a Japanese depth charge, the NHHC said in a press release. Harder was lost in battle on August 24, 1944, along with its entire crew of 79 submariners, while on its sixth patrol of the war, as the US sought to retake the Philippines from occupying Japanese forces. \u201cHarder was lost in the course of victory. We must not forget that victory has a price, as does freedom,\u201d NHHC Director Samuel J. Cox, a retired US Navy admiral, said in the press release. According to a US Navy history, Harder sank two Japanese escort ships off the Bataan Peninsula on August 22, 1944, and then headed north along the Luzon coast with two other subs in search of more targets. In a battle with Japanese escort ship CD-22 on the morning of August 24, Harder fired three torpedoes that missed and was later sunk by the Japanese ship\u2019s fifth depth charge attack, according to Japanese records cited by NHHC. The NHHC said the wreck of the Harder was confirmed by data provided by the Lost 52 Project, an effort led by Tim Taylor, CEO of Tiburon Subsea, to find the 52 US subs lost in World War II. The group has previously located at least six WWII subs, the NHHC said. \u201cWe are grateful that Lost 52 has given us the opportunity to once again honor the valor of the crew of the \u2018Hit \u2018em Harder\u2019 submarine,\u201d the NHHC\u2019s Cox said, in reference to the vessel\u2019s motto. The NHHC said the wreck is \u201cthe final resting place of Sailors that gave their life in defense of the nation and should be respected by all parties as a war grave.\u201d The Philippines was a US territory attacked by Japan just after its strike on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. By the spring of 1942, US and Philippine forces on Luzon surrendered to Tokyo\u2019s forces and Japan used the captured archipelago to protect its supply lines from the East Indies and Southeast Asia. But by mid-1944, the US was rolling back Japanese gains across the Pacific, and was planning landings to do the same in the Philippines. Harder,  which had the motto of \u201cHit \u2018em Harder,\u201d was captained by Cmdr. Samuel Dealey, who would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, the US military\u2019s highest decoration, for his actions in Harder\u2019s fifth patrol, from March to July 1944. During that time Harder sank three Japanese destroyers with another two likely destroyed or heavily damaged over the course of just four days, according to the National Medal of Honor Museum. The museum\u2019s page on Dealey described one particularly harrowing encounter. Coming under attack from a Japanese destroyer, Dealey ordered a head-on torpedo shot at the bow of the charging enemy, known as a \u201cdown the throat\u201d shot, according to the museum account. \u201cAt 1,500 yards, Dealey fired three torpedoes and ordered the sub to dive.\u00a0\u00a0As the\u00a0Harder\u00a0passed 80 feet underneath the destroyer, two of the torpedoes struck the ship, sending shock waves through the submarine.\u201d On its first four patrols after commissioning on December 2, 1942, Harder sank 14 Japanese warships and merchant vessels, according to the Medal of Honor Museum.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/asia/wwii-submarine-wreck-uss-harder-found-philippines-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_24_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-american-sentencing", "text": "The first of several Americans recently charged with possession of ammunition in Turks and Caicos headed home Friday after getting a suspended 52-week sentence and a $6,700 fine, his representatives said. But four other Americans still await their fate. In recent months, all were arrested and accused of bringing in various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. In the Turks and Caicos, possession of firearms or ammunition carries a minimum 12-year sentence, though the law allows reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d the local governor said. Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania had pleaded guilty to the charge, the Turks and Caicos government said. On Friday, he got a 52-week sentence that was suspended for one year, meaning he would not face immediate incarceration, Hagerich\u2019s attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel, told CNN. Hagerich was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory and return to the United States once he paid the fine, Smith said. He would have to serve the full 12-month sentence if the fine was not paid. Hagerich flew back to the US Friday afternoon, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign. The organization helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. \u201cVery grateful to the Court for giving two very special kids their dad back. Even more grateful to the numerous (Turks and Caicos Islands) nationals who helped along the way,\u201d Franks posted to X along with a picture of Hagerich boarding a plane. After Hagerich arrived at Pittsburgh International Airport on Friday night, he told reporters he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d to have his two children jump into his arms, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WTAE. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Hagerich said. \u201cA lot of memories to make together. Just so elated to see them. They\u2019ve been so strong through all this.\u201d Smith said his client was \u201cpleased, he\u2019s relieved\u201d by the outcome. \u201cThe sentence, in all its circumstances, is reasonable and fair,\u201d Smith said. After Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said justice \u201chas been served as the law intended.\u201d \u201cAs we have said, The Firearms Act includes consideration for exceptional circumstances,\u201d Misick said, \u201cand today\u2019s decision reflects our commitment to judicial independence along with upholding the law. Residents and visitors can be confident that the Turks and Caicos Islands are dedicated to safety and compassion as we protect the safety and rights of all.\u201d The four other Americans charged have been released on bail while they await their court dates, Misick\u2019s office said in a statement. One was allowed to return to the US for medical reasons, and the rest are staying in Turks and Caicos. US lawmakers tried to get Americans freed A US congressional delegation traveled to the islands this week and asked for charges to be dropped for the five Americans whom they said \u201cinadvertently\u201d had ammunition in their luggage. Hagerich\u2019s sentencing came after the US officials expressed disappointment over their attempted intervention. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward,\u201d Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said in a statement this week. In addition to Hagerich, two other Americans \u2013 Michael Lee Evans and Tyler Wenrich \u2013 have pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the territory\u2019s government. Evans was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, Smith said. A fourth American, Ryan Tyler Watson, will have a hearing Tuesday to determine if he will enter a plea or go to trial, Smith said. A fifth American, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, director of communications in the Office of the Premier and Public Policy.

Turks and Caicos: No special treatment should be given to any group Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said the mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms or ammunition is in place to protect those on the islands, and judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said. \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly,\u201d Misick said. And US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick said Thursday. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date. Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Misick said. By contrast, the United States has more guns than people. Now, bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d While the US and Turks and Caicos collaborate in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d But at least one appointed member of the opposition, Alvin Garland, expressed concern about the American citizens\u2019 arrests. Garland said the islands\u2019 governor is correct in not interfering with the ongoing court cases in order to adhere to the government\u2019s separation of powers, but added he believes most, if not all, of the cases involving American tourists will fall into the \u201cexceptional circumstances category\u201d and sentences could be shorter than the mandatory 12-year minimum.

{"id": "2024_05_27_travel_dubai-old-town-historical-walking-tour-hnk-intl-spc", "text": "On a trip to Florence in 2015, while immersing herself in Italian food and history, Nada Badran had a \u201ceureka moment.\u201d The former management consultant wanted tourists to experience culture and history like this in her home city, Dubai. The Middle Eastern metropolis \u2014 largely built in the past 50 years off the back of the discovery of oil in the Arabian Gulf in the 1960s \u2014 is a far cry culturally from the medieval Tuscan city that Badran was inspired by. But she was tired of hearing people say, \u201cDubai has no soul\u201d or \u201cit could be anywhere in the world,\u201d and felt that this perception was the result of shortcomings in the tourism industry, rather than the city itself. \u201cI started looking at the local tourism scene, and it wasn\u2019t really anything special, in my opinion: it catered to the mass tourists, people that maybe go on buses, see things to take a few photos, and then go,\u201d says Badran. And while there\u2019s no denying that the superlative skyscrapers, sprawling maze of malls, and glamorous beach resorts are what attract most tourists to the city, Badran wanted to show them the Dubai beyond that \u2014 one with culture, history and traditions, a place with distinctive dishes, people and memories; the Dubai that she grew up in. So in 2016, Badran set up her own tour company, Wander with Nada, to \u201cshow a different side of Dubai\u201d to travelers. Her bespoke private tours are designed to suit the interests of each visitor, but her favorite itinerary is Dubai\u2019s \u201cold town,\u201d a group of small neighborhoods around Dubai Creek where the city began and Badran spent her childhood. \u201cI think it has a very unique personality,\u201d she says. A historic neighborhood History is often equated with \u201csoul.\u201d Cities that wear their past lives on their sleeves, like Rome, Athens, or Edinburgh, have a certain character or gravitas: the architectural equivalent of wrinkle lines and graying hair. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a relatively new country, formed in 1971. Yet Dubai, one of its seven emirates and most populous city, has a much longer history: strategically located on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, Dubai has been a trading port for centuries, particularly between Oman and today\u2019s Iraq. People made their livelihood through pearl farming, and the settlement was little more than a fishing village before the Al Maktoum family, descendants of a semi-nomadic Bedouin tribe called the Bani Yas, settled there in 1833. This is where Badran starts our tour (which took place just before Dubai experienced historic flooding) \u2014 in Al Shindagha, the neighborhood where the city\u2019s first homes were built around 200 years ago. While there\u2019s little left to show for the pearl diving trade that put Dubai on the map, Badran feels it is important context to understand the city \u2014 including the acknowledgment of some of its more controversial history, including exhausting and brutal working conditions for divers. Plastered in coral and gypsum, the burrow-like homes have small windows to keep the heat out, with a myriad of small rooms around a central courtyard, designed to host multiple generations of a family under one roof. The Al Maktoum family home is still there, where the city\u2019s current ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, was born in 1949. Today, no one lives in the neighborhood. Instead, these homes are museums, each paying tribute to a different aspect of Emirati heritage, like \u201cAl Talli,\u201d a traditional embroidery skill that was recognized as an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in 2022; or the complicated manufacturing of Arabic perfume scents and the role of fragrance in Emirati hospitality. There\u2019s a house dedicated to fishing, and another to the multitude of uses for palm trees, where craftspeople turn rough palm brush into rope in front of your eyes. From house to house, Badran weaves historical tales, painting a picture of what life was like for early settlers in the city, and carefully explaining how each element relates to life in the historic Dubai Creek. \u201cIf you ask me what my profession is, I don\u2019t say tour guide \u2014 I\u2019m a storyteller,\u201d says Badran. A temporary population An oft-cited fact about Dubai, and the UAE in general, is that it\u2019s a diverse melting pot of 200 nationalities. But it\u2019s not just in the present day that it hosts a culturally varied population: even the original pearl fishing communities were a mix of Arabs, Persians, Sudanese, and Balochis, an ethnic group from South and West Asia. \u201cDubai has a very fluid population \u2014 people come and go, come and go,\u201d Badran says. The influence of other cultures is woven into the fabric of the city, and Badran points this out at the souks, across the creek from Al Shindagha: Indian agarwood used to create oud for perfume, Persian saffron, and rich Medjool dates from Saudi Arabia. In the historical Al Fahidi district, we wander through a maze of alleys, between the former homes of Iranian traders who settled there in the 1890s. A little over 10% of the original dwellings remain there and like Al Shindagha, no one lives there: it was revitalized in the 1990s to host shops, cafes, and boutique hotels. While beautiful, it feels oddly empty \u2014 soulless, some might say. \u201cIt\u2019s an area that\u2019s frequented by people, but they\u2019re mostly tourists,\u201d says Badran, adding, \u201cTry telling Dubai residents to come here \u2014 you\u2019ll have to pay them.\u201d And that\u2019s a problem. Heritage is not just historic buildings, but the communities that build them. As architecture professor Djamel Boussaa put it in his 2014 paper on Dubai\u2019s urban heritage, it\u2019s the inhabitants of a city that \u201cbring life to the built environment\u201d and so social communities need to be conserved alongside heritage sites. \u201cUrban conservation does not necessarily mean preserving a building but reviving its spirit and life,\u201d Boussaa writes. \u201cIt means being flexible enough to adapt the objectives of rehabilitation to the needs of modern living while respecting the local community values.\u201d Today, the city\u2019s largely migrant population, accounting for 92% of residents, is temporary; there to work without putting down roots, as there are no long-term permanent residency options. Dubai\u2019s transient population, from the deep past to the present day, leaves very little room for community culture to settle, or grow. A changing city Badran, despite feeling deeply rooted in the city she has called home for the best part of three decades, has experienced this too. She saw a high turnover of school friends, most of whom she hasn\u2019t seen since they were children, and her own family, who moved to Dubai from Jordan in the 1980s, will ultimately leave the city. But as a frequent traveler herself, she also knows that people make a place, and has endeavored to make the people who live in the city \u201can integral part\u201d of her tour. At the museum, Badran facilitates conversations with craftspeople who have inherited their perfume-making or fabric-stitching trade from their parents, and wandering through the Deira souks, she hands over her storytelling platform to Rashid Haghaght, an Iranian spice trader who has taken over his father\u2019s store. (He talks me through how to spot real and fake saffron in the market \u2014\u00a0a useful skill for the world\u2019s most expensive spice.) \u201cThe most important part (of the tour) is the conversations and interactions with the community,\u201d Badran adds. \u201cI want (visitors) to actually have a conversation with someone who\u2019s from here, who can tell them something they didn\u2019t know before.\u201d While Old Dubai is one of Badran\u2019s most popular tours, she also creates itineraries for other districts, as well as neighboring emirates Abu Dhabi and Sharjah. For visitors who really want to get off the beaten track, Badran recommends exploring Al Rigga in Deira, an area adjacent to the souks that\u2019s home to an eclectic mix of stores and Naif Souk, a clothing market; and Al Karama, a neighborhood filled with South Asian restaurants and fabric stores. Knowing the city \u201cinside-out,\u201d Badran creates itineraries that are a careful curation of places she\u2019s frequented over her years living in the city. \u201cTime has not affected some corners, and those are the parts that I love to go to,\u201d she adds. Of course, though, things change. Badran leads me through the narrow alleys around the Dubai Old Souk, home to stores run by Indian-origin families. You won\u2019t find the clutter of tourist souvenirs here \u2014 instead, brightly colored floral garlands, Hindu god figurines and prayer beads adorn the doorways. But many of the stores are closed or boarded up. One of the city\u2019s two Hindu temples, located a stone\u2019s throw from these alleyways, was closed in January and relocated 35 kilometers (22 miles) away, near Jebel Ali, Badran explains. Many businesses are moving with it, fragmenting a community that has been here since the two temples opened in 1958. When I ask her how she feels about the way the city constantly changes, Badran describes it as \u201chumbling.\u201d \u201cI always say, in one year, if you come back, you will find it to be a different place,\u201d she adds. It\u2019s hard not to see things like the temple relocation as a loss of culture. But spending time in Dubai\u2019s old town, drifting between century-old homes built by once-nomadic people, and souks run by migrant merchants, tasting spices from Iran, touching textiles from India, sipping tea from China and scents from Oman, the restless churn becomes the common thread connecting disparate peoples, products, places. \u201cDubai is about opening your mind,\u201d Badran says, \u201cand embracing this diversity that makes it unique.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/travel/dubai-old-town-historical-walking-tour-hnk-intl-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

Another civilian was also\u00a0killed\u00a0during the shooting, which took place on May 15, the\u00a0Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office said, as intense battles between Ukrainian and Russian forces for control of the border town continue. Russia has ramped up its offensive\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Kharkiv region\u00a0in\u00a0recent weeks, launching its most surprising operation\u00a0in\u00a0more than two years of war on May 10, when\u00a0Russian\u00a0forces\u00a0crossed the\u00a0border\u00a0and subsequently took control of close to a dozen villages. The 70-year-old husband told prosecutors the situation in Vovchansk had become unbearable because of the heavy fighting, so he found a wheelchair for his wife who was experiencing health issues, and the two left their home in the early hours of the night. What followed adds to the repeating horrors that residents in the town and battlefield areas face daily, as Russia continues its push to claim control of more Ukrainian land. Husband shared details of the shooting The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office said the husband, who \u201cmiraculously survived\u201d the shooting in Vovchansk, shared the painful details of the harrowing ordeal. The man said there was heavy shelling around 2 a.m. local time, and he told his wife they should evacuate, according to the\u00a0investigation. Another resident of the embattled\u00a0town joined them. \u201cThe man found a\u00a0wheelchair\u00a0and put his wife\u00a0in\u00a0it because she had been having problems with her legs for a long time. The three of them set off\u00a0in\u00a0the direction of Kharkiv,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office said. \u201cWhen the civilians were near the local hospital, the occupiers opened fire on them. The man who joined the couple and the\u00a0woman\u00a0died on the spot.\u201d The Russian military had opened fire on the evacuees from a five-story building, the husband told prosecutors. \u201cThe wheelchair got stuck, I was pulling it by the handles,\u201d he told prosecutors. \u201cI leaned down and there was a machine gun burst,\u201d he said. \u201cI immediately shouted, what are you doing, we are civilians.\u201d Then\u00a0he said he\u00a0turned around and saw that his wife and the other resident were killed. He started screaming and didn\u2019t know how to proceed. He started pushing the\u00a0wheelchair\u00a0towards the hospital where he knew there were emergency personnel. A man at the hospital shouted at him, urging him to leave the body of his wife and come\u00a0inside the building. But the man continued moving further with the body of his wife towards a flooded bridge, where he realized the two had to part ways. \u201cShe stayed in the wheelchair,\u201d the man told prosecutors. The man managed to reach the outskirts of the Vovchansk, where he met Ukrainian soldiers who took him to Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city. Situation in Vovchansk worsening for civilians Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly urged civilians to evacuate from Vovchansk and frontline areas because of the heavy fighting. Ukrainian officials have previously said\u00a0Russian\u00a0forces\u00a0have captured dozens of civilians\u00a0in\u00a0Vovchansk, and a top regional police officer has accused them of\u00a0using civilians as \u201chuman shields.\u201d CNN is unable to\u00a0independently verify the claims that Russia is using civilians as human shields and has contacted the\u00a0Russian\u00a0Defense Ministry for comment.

{"id": "2024_05_25_europe_putin-peace-ukraine-russia-analysis-intl", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s\u00a0signaling this week that he is open to peace talks should be viewed with vast, overshadowing caveats, and the weight of Ukraine\u2019s - and the West\u2019s - past experience of Russian diplomacy. Friday saw a wealth of noise about negotiation, in\u00a0the same month\u00a0Moscow launched a third invasion of Ukraine from the north of Kharkiv. The\u00a0Reuters\u00a0news agency\u00a0cited four sources, in a report from two deeply experienced and connected Russia reporters, that Moscow was willing to consider peace talks which would freeze the current Russian occupation of about a fifth of Ukraine. Putin responded\u00a0to that report\u00a0by\u00a0suggesting Russia was willing to talk peace, based on earlier agreements. He hinted at an aborted deal in Istanbul, just after the war began, in 2022, which fell apart, mostly because Moscow\u2019s forces were still rampaging across Ukrainian territory, and massacres around Kyiv had come to light. The idea floated in the Reuters report would stop short of Moscow\u2019s stated goal of capturing all of eastern Donetsk, but also eradicate Kyiv\u2019s insistence it should not surrender any territory. The context of Putin\u2019s remarks was\u00a0key. They came during a visit to Belarus\u2019 President Alexander Lukashenko - something which in the past\u00a0occurred moments before the Kremlin\u00a0used\u00a0Belarusian territory for military moves into Ukraine,\u00a0while on\u00a0Friday\u00a0took place\u00a0during joint tactical nuclear weapons drills between the two countries.\u00a0Putin was talking peace with a backdrop that was anything but. Putin\u00a0questioned\u00a0the\u00a0legitimacy of Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky,\u00a0who\u00a0Moscow has repeatedly assailed, after Kyiv had to delay elections because of the very war Putin started.\u00a0At the same time, there were unconfirmed reports that the private jet of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich had landed in Belarus.\u00a0The\u00a0pro-Russian Yanukovich fled Ukraine in 2014 after forces loyal to him shot dead dozens of protestors in central Kyiv. The mere possibility of his presence while Putin and Lukashenko met led to speculation Moscow was again hoping to engineer the return of a proxy to power in Ukraine. The Kremlin\u2019s less brutal goal in Ukraine \u2013 short of full or partial occupation \u2013 has involved a president in Kyiv it considers loyal, who will stop the country\u2019s march towards the European Union and NATO. It was fanciful before the 2022 invasion, and came up during the aborted 2022 Istanbul talks. But now it would likely need an occupying Russian force to impose it on a population seething at the Kremlin\u2019s brutality. So why the talk of peace, particularly when Russia appears to be having its most successful moment on the frontlines in months, if not since the invasion? Diplomacy has always been a military tool for the Kremlin. It talked peace over Syria in 2015, as their jets\u00a0pounded\u00a0civilians in rebel-held areas. It talked peace in 2015 with Ukraine, while Russian troops and their proxies were in the throes of a full assault against the strategic Ukrainian town of Debaltseve. It is not cynical to distrust Russia\u2019s sincerity when it negotiates, but a practical necessity. Experience shows it considers talks worth pursuing in case they unexpectedly produce a useful outcome without violence, or give their opponent cause for pause in fighting to try and encourage a deal. Moscow may also be talking peace again now for two reasons. Firstly, Ukraine and its allies are convening a peace summit in Switzerland in June, where it will discuss, without Russia, what sort of deal it might accept. It is likely aimed at building momentum for an off-ramp the Kremlin can take when its forces are finally militarily exhausted or in a stalemate. Zelensky has said he hopes China - Russia\u2019s most potent ally but only partial supporter in the Ukraine war - will attend. Putin may be talking peace now to suggest to Beijing to not be involved in diplomacy about Russia without Russia present. There is little serious chance the Switzerland summit will end the war, but it might concretize minds in the West as to how serious a threat Moscow poses to an actual peace deal by laying out the bones of what damage Ukraine might have to absorb to its territorial integrity to stop the bloodshed. Ukraine\u2019s\u00a0Foreign\u00a0Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Friday\u00a0that\u00a0Putin\u2019s hints at peace talks were directly aimed at sabotaging the summit. \u201cPutin currently has no desire to end his aggression against Ukraine\u201d, he wrote on\u00a0X, adding \u201cthis is why he is so afraid of\u201d the Switzerland summit. Secondly, and most importantly, Putin is messaging governments in the West and the current American presidential campaign. He is trying to opaquely suggest \u2013 perhaps to populists in Europe, or MAGA Republicans in the United States \u2013 that a simple deal is in hand, one in which frontlines, on which Ukraine is currently losing with significant casualties, can suddenly freeze. Western support for the war is costly, and increasingly unpopular \u2013 although the recent $61 billion passed by Congress has perhaps given the issue a\u00a0reprieve\u00a0from being at the mercy of electoral opinion\u00a0for about a year. The Reuters report permits those in the West who want to see an end to the war to believe the Kremlin could stop the war, as it stands, immediately. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov made the report sound like it reflected Russia\u2019s permanent position. But ultimately it may sound new and interesting to key Western figures: Donald Trump - who has failed to explain how he would enact his claim he could stop the war in 24 hours \u2013 and other NATO members who are less bullish than France, the UK and the Baltic states, about the need to never trust Russia at the negotiating table. Putin is a pragmatist. He started the war thinking it would be easy. He continued it thinking his tolerance for pain, autocratic security, and patience for victory would triumph. He might be right, just now. He now sees a moment of electoral weakness in the US, and other European states, which he has met with a vague, opaque signal that there might be a time for diplomacy. It will likely gain some traction among those who desperately hope the war in Ukraine will just go away, and who are less mindful of the existential threat a victorious and hyper-militarized Moscow poses to NATO\u2019s eastern members. But it should be viewed through the lens of the deep cynicism of Moscow\u2019s earlier diplomacy in Syria and Ukraine: used as a time to ferociously pursue the same military objectives, but with the illusory backdrop that peace might be just around the corner.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/europe/putin-peace-ukraine-russia-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_middleeast_raisi-funeral-analysis-intl", "text": "From his days as a clerical student, to overseeing executions as part of the judiciary, Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s life has been intimately tied with Iran\u2019s tumultuous modern history. Yet after all that, his presidency was notably unremarkable. Unlike previous Iranian presidents, Raisi seemed content to serve as an empty vessel that carried out the reactionary policies of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,\u00a0the final arbiter on policymaking. He showed none of the subtle pushback of his predecessor, the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani. He also lacked the charisma of conservative former presidents who were happy to do Khamenei\u2019s bidding\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as the firebrand Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but who sought to carve out autonomy for the position of the presidency. So, when foreign dignitaries from a whopping 68 countries gathered for Raisi\u2019s funeral on Thursday, they may not have been preoccupied with thoughts of the late president. This was not a game-changing death like the 2020 assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, the military mastermind credited with creating a strategic stranglehold over much of the Middle East and helping to put the US on the backfoot. Raisi\u2019s absence, in contrast, is unlikely to be felt. Yet his untimely death could hardly have come at a more pivotal time for Iran. \u201cForeign dignitaries will be trying to get a read of the country,\u201d Washington-based Iran analyst and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute Trita Parsi told CNN. \u201cThis is also an opportunity for many of them to manifest how their relationship with Iran has changed.\u201d Iran is deeply enmeshed in the war in Gaza, with Tehran-back armed groups engaged in a low rumbling tit for tat with Israel and its allies across four different countries. In April, it launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel from its territory after an apparent Israeli airstrike on Tehran\u2019s consulate in Damascus. In this fraught moment for the region, leaders from Turkey to India and China \u2013 many of which declared days of national mourning for the late president \u2013 appear keen not to ruffle feathers. The deaths also come after years of diplomatic efforts to achieve a rapprochement with former regional nemeses, such as\u00a0Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,\u00a0both of which were represented at the funeral. Qatar\u2019s emir, as well the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait attended the funeral. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who the International Criminal Court is seeking an arrest warrant for alongside Israeli leaders, was also in attendance. Tens of thousands flocked to the streets to mark the funeral, throwing flowers at the coffins. It was a strong show of support for the regime, and a demonstration of its powerbase. Iran\u2019s populace is deeply polarized, but the regime showed that it could still mobilize a critical mass. Iran today seems not to be the pariah state that former US President Donald Trump almost turned it into in 2018 when he pulled out of a landmark Obama-era nuclear deal that exchanged sanctions relief for curbs to Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cThis (funeral) is a way for countries to show the progress they have made in repairing relations with Iran,\u201d said Parsi. \u201cWe have missed how Iran\u2019s relations in the region have gone through a significant transformation.\u201d Foreign dignitaries are likely engaged in sideline chats to try to get a read on Khamenei\u2019s opaque and sometimes unpredictable thinking on domestic policy\u00a0that could have repercussions for the region. Constitutionally, a presidential election must be held within 50 days of the demise of a sitting president. That is a relatively short time to prepare for a race charged with consequence for Iran\u2019s theocratic leadership. The election will have ramifications for the question of the succession plans of the ailing 85-year-old Khamenei, who is only the second Supreme Leader to rule the Islamic Republic. Moreover, the race can\u00a0either appease or, conversely, fuel the tensions brought on by\u00a0the\u00a0youth-led\u00a0nationwide uprising that rocked the country less than two years ago. Khamenei has ultimate sway over elections through the country\u2019s Guardian Council, which consists of jurists appointed by the Supreme Leader, and which is tasked with vetting election candidates. In the 2021 presidential election, the council disqualified most viable candidates besides Raisi, paving a clear path to his presidency. The race was widely seen as heavily engineered and produced a record low voter turnout. The leader may orchestrate a repeat of that race. He could also decide to change tack, opening it up so that Iran\u2019s next president enjoys broad popular support. \u201cThe election can be a watershed moment for Iran,\u201d Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran analyst and editor of\u00a0Amwaj.media,\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson. \u201c(Khamenei) has a golden opportunity to reverse course in a face-saving way, make a U-turn, open up the space and allow people to run.\u201d During his tenure, Raisi made only feeble attempts to dispel the notion of him as a fig leaf president. He was widely criticized for presiding over the hollowing out of what remains of Iran\u2019s institutions. Legislative elections this March had a record low turnout of 41%.\u00a0The 2022 nationwide uprising posed the biggest domestic threat to the regime in decades. Since the brutal crushing of those protests, the bridge between the regime and its young and largely disgruntled population has grown ever wider. \u201cKhamenei has put the Islamic Republic on a path in which it will only be able to remain in power by increasing repression,\u201d said Parsi. Choosing to open up the election may appease the country\u2019s frustrated young population buckling under continued economic and political strains. That may set Iran on a course to stabilize its restive domestic situation. It may also pave a path for a more Western-friendly administration like that of Rouhani, which presided over the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, albeit within the confines set by Khamenei. Yet analysts say this remains wishful thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see why Khamenei would change course at this point. It would necessitate that he recognizes that he is on a path that is not good for him, but that\u2019s not the conclusion the regime has come to,\u201d said Parsi. \u201cBecause of the succession (of the Supreme Leadership), the regime wants the status quo. They\u2019re going to choose a direction that keeps everything as-is.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/middleeast/raisi-funeral-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_weather_memorial-day-weekend-forecast", "text": "(CNN) \u2013 The National Weather Service has issued a tornado watch for parts of three states, labeling it a \u201cparticularly dangerous situation,\u201d a rare designation indicating the possibility of exceptionally strong storms. The tornado watch covers parts of northern Texas, much of central Oklahoma and south-central Kansas. It will expire at 11 p.m. CT. The watch calls for several tornadoes \u2013 a few intense ones likely \u2013 over an area that includes cities such as Wichita, Kansas, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, according to the Storm Prediction Center. This is a special kind of tornado watch issued only when there\u2019s unusually high confidence in the potential of multiple at least EF2-strength and long-lived tornadoes in the area, according to the National Weather Service. Another tornado watch was added to portions of Kansas until 1 a.m. CT, affecting half a million people, according to the Storm Prediction Center. More than 4.5 million Americans were under tornado watches Saturday evening. The supercell thunderstorms firing up in the watch area will also be capable of extremely large hail up to the size of grapefruits and damaging wind gusts to 80 mph. An EF4 tornado \u2013 the third such violent tornado this year \u2013 killed at least four people in Greenfield, Iowa, Tuesday and left parts of the city in ruin. More strong tornadoes \u2013 at least EF2-strength \u2013 are possible Saturday in parts of the Plains and Sunday in portions of the Midwest. Some tornadoes Saturday could be particularly violent and exceed EF4-strength, the Storm Prediction Center warned Friday. Supercell thunderstorms that began firing up Saturday could be capable of producing a couple tornadoes, scattered large hail up to the size of softballs and damaging wind gusts to 70 mph, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Dangerous storms are expected to rumble to life in the evening in parts of western Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. Storms will expand in both scope and strength in the evening and overnight and move east into the Mississippi Valley. A Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place Saturday for a large swath of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Wichita, and far western Missouri. \u201cViolent tornadoes, extreme hail and corridors of widespread wind damage\u201d are most likely within this area, according to the SPC, but could extend beyond it. Anywhere from Texas through Nebraska to the Mississippi Valley could encounter storms unloading strong wind gusts, hail and tornadoes. Robust thunderstorms will continue over parts of the Mississippi Valley through Sunday morning before gradually losing their strength. But a new round of damaging storms is expected to arrive quickly after. Thunderstorms will develop over portions of the Midwest by Sunday afternoon and develop farther south and east through the evening and overnight hours. Powerful storms could ultimately stretch from the Great Lakes to the South Sunday night. Damaging wind gusts and hail will be the main hazards with any severe thunderstorm Sunday, but some could produce tornadoes. At this time, the greatest tornado threat is in parts of the Midwest, especially during the afternoon and evening. The travel hubs of Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Nashville could have to contend with damaging storms, leading to delayed or cancelled flights. Thunderstorm activity will likely continue for Memorial Day Monday and could disrupt outdoor plans and travel for a large part of the East. Some of these thunderstorms could become severe, but it\u2019s not yet clear how widespread the threat will be. Even in the absence of damaging wind gusts, hail or tornadoes, lightning is a serious threat for any outdoor plans like picnics, pool parties or beach trips. Unofficial start of summer will officially feel like summer Meanwhile, dangerous storms and searing heat will\u00a0continue affecting vast portions of the United States this Memorial Day weekend and could disrupt outdoor plans and travel. A near-record number of people will travel this weekend in what could be the busiest period in nearly two decades, according to AAA. Travelers will have to contend with a hazardous and disruptive multi-day severe thunderstorm event with damaging winds, dangerous hail and strong tornadoes. It is expected to unfold this weekend in portions of the central, southern and eastern US. Severe weather has been unrelenting in May, but hit an even more\u00a0frenetic pace\u00a0this week. Nearly 850 wind damage reports and at least 80 tornado reports have occurred across the US since Sunday. While severe storms pound inland areas this weekend, some coastal areas will face a different threat. A heaping serving of summerlike heat is on the menu as many head to the beach to celebrate the unofficial start of summer. It\u2019s already been record hot in parts of the South this month, especially in South Texas and South Florida, the type of extreme heat made more likely by human-caused climate change. Record heat will expand over the weekend and jeopardize daily high temperature records in jeopardy from Texas through the Southeast as air temperatures soar well into the 90s. Houston, New Orleans, Miami, Mobile, Alabama, Tampa, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, are just a few cities along the Gulf and southeast Atlantic coasts where it\u2019ll feel more like July than late May through Memorial Day. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could approach triple-digits along the southern tier of the US, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. For those out in the heat, it\u2019s important to stay hydrated and be vigilant for signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Heat index values skyrocketed well into the 100s this week in southern Texas and could climb higher into seriously dangerous territory through Monday. The heat index is expected to max out between 110 and 120 degrees in southern Texas, including in Corpus Christi and Laredo, according to the National Weather Service.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/weather/memorial-day-weekend-forecast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_asia_china-military-drills-taiwan-second-day-intl-hnk", "text": "China\u2019s military drills around Taiwan are designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power\u201d over the island, the People\u2019s Liberation Army said Friday as its forces kicked off a second day of large-scale exercises encircling its democratic neighbor. The drills are the largest in more than a year and come just days after Taiwan swore in its new president, Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. Beijing has denounced Lai as a \u201cdangerous separatist\u201d and decried his inauguration speech on Monday, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan, which has grown much more pronounced under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The PLA, which dwarfs Taipei\u2019s outgunned military, kicked off the exercises on Thursday morning, sending warships and fighter jets around Taiwan and its outlying islands in\u00a0what it called \u201ca strong punishment for separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces.\u201d On Friday, the PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command said it was continuing the drills on both sides of the Taiwan island chain to \u201ctest the ability to jointly seize power, launch joint attacks and occupy key areas.\u201d China\u2019s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. The vast majority of Taiwanese have no desire to live under Chinese rule. But Xi, China\u2019s most authoritarian leader in a generation, has made clear the island\u2019s \u201cinevitable reunification\u201d with the mainland cannot be put off indefinitely. The two-day exercises, involving joint operations of China\u2019s army, navy, air force and rocket force,\u00a0are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 a narrow body of water separating the island from mainland China \u2013 as well as north, south and east of Taiwan, according to the PLA. For the first time, the PLA drills also involved China\u2019s Coast Guard, operating in areas around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off the southeastern coast of China. CCTV aired footage on Friday that shows PLA soldiers moving mobile artillery and missile systems into position, though it did not show any live fire. Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry has condemned China\u2019s military exercises as \u201cirrational provocations\u201d and dispatched its own sea, air and ground forces in response. Between 6 a.m. Thursday and 6 a.m. Friday, the ministry detected 49 Chinese aircraft, including 35 that crossed the Median Line, an informal demarcation point in the Taiwan Strait that Beijing does not recognize but until recent years had largely respected. A total of 19 Chinese warships and seven coast guard vessels were detected near the Taiwan Strait, according to the ministry. Taiwan\u2019s presidential office said Thursday it is \u201cregrettable to see China threatening Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom and regional peace and stability with unilateral military provocations,\u201d adding Taiwan has the \u201cconfidence and ability to protect national security.\u201d First week in office Lai has had a busy and politically turbulent start to his presidency after taking over from two-term leader Tsai Ing-wen, to kick off a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The PLA\u2019s drills pose the first real test for the veteran politician in managing tensions with Beijing, which has refused his offer to talk and to resume cross-strait tourism and student exchanges. On Friday, China\u2019s Defense Ministry accused Lai of pushing Taiwan into \u201ca dangerous situation of war\u201dand \u201cplaying with fire.\u201d \u201cThose who play with fire will burn themselves,\u201d ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters, using rhetoric China frequently deploys for Taiwan\u2019s government. \u201cWhenever \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 (forces) provoke us, we will push our countermeasures forward until the complete reunification of the motherland is achieved.\u201d Domestically, Lai is facing chaos in the legislature, where opposition parties who favor closer ties to China hold a majority, and have pushed to subject his administration to tighter scrutiny. Thousands of mostly young people have taken to the streets to protest the opposition\u2019s attempt to fast-track the proposed bills to grant the parliament more power. But despite Beijing\u2019s large show of force, life continued as normal in Taiwan, whose 23 million people have become used to China\u2019s military threats, even as they become more regular and prominent in recent years. \u201cWe are not scared of the Chinese Communist Party, and we have confidence,\u201d\u00a0an 88-year-old retiree, who gave his surname Liu, told CNN. \u201cIf the Chinese Communist Party does attack Taiwan, it won\u2019t be easy for them to take Taiwan. Taiwanese people are not afraid of war.\u201d A 42-year-old mother, who gave her surname Tsai, said she wasn\u2019t even aware the PLA drills were taking place. \u201cI believe leaders will prioritize people\u2019s happiness, so I\u2019m not worried. I think peace will be maintained,\u201d she said. \u2018Blockading Taiwan\u2019 China\u2019s military drills are often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally, and state media has ramped up coverage of the drills. Zhang Chi, a Chinese military expert, told China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV that the PLA\u2019s exercises focused on \u201cpracticing a new mode of blockading Taiwan.\u201d \u201cTaiwan is an isolated island, suspended in the sea with weak self-sufficiency. Taiwan\u2019s economy is export-oriented, and most of its energy consumption relies on imports. Once besieged and blockaded, it can easily lead to economic collapse, turning it into a dead island,\u201d he said. The exercises to the south of Taiwan are crucial for the blockade, targeting Kaohsiung port, Taiwan\u2019s largest port and an important base for the island\u2019s navy, Zhang said. Meanwhile, drills to the east of Taiwan are designed to practice cutting off the island\u2019s energy imports, the escape routes for \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d forces and the support line from the US and its allies, he added. The US maintains close but informal relations with Taiwan and is bound by law to supply the island with weapons to defend itself. Zhang also noted that the drills had achieved \u201ca new breakthrough\u201d by entering waters near Wuqiu\u00a0and Dongyin, which hold significant geographical importance. \u201cThe Taiwanese military views them as the front outposts for Taiwan Strait defense operations. This exercise further squeezed the activity space of the Taiwanese military,\u201d he said. Analysts said the China Coast Guard movement close to and around the outlying islands was an important new aspect of the current drills, which follow previous encirclement exercises in August 2022 and April 2023. \u201cThe pressing of Coast Guard and other forces into waters close to those offshore islands is provocative,\u201d said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center. He said he expected such Chinese activities to continue and that they \u201cwill become the norm,\u201d with Beijing at any point able to then turn an exercise into a real military operation. Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said China\u2019s pattern of exercises around Taiwan does not signal an imminent invasion threat. \u201cThese drills aid in blurring the lines between peace and war, so much so that future exercises could be used as a pretext for an actual invasion,\u201d Singleton said. But Singleton and others say the exercises are sending a bigger political message than a military one. \u201cJoint Sword - 2024A aims at reactivating the military pressure lever to assert a degree of influence on the new (Taiwan) administration and its narrative,\u201d said Lionel Fatton, assistant professor of international relations at Webster University in Geneva, using China\u2019s name for this week\u2019s drills. Beijing will use the pressure of the drills to try to increase divisions within Taiwan, which could \u201cweaken\u201d the island from the inside, he said. \u201cConstant and visible\u00a0military pressure on the island will also help polarize the political apparatus, if not the social fabric itself,\u201d Fatton said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/asia/china-military-drills-taiwan-second-day-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

Zverev\u2019s straight sets victory perhaps puts an end to one of the greatest love affairs in the history of sport. Nadal, the \u2018King of Clay,\u2019 walked off Court Philippe-Chatrier to a thunderous ovation befitting his remarkable record in Paris, which now stands at 112-4. Some of tennis\u2019 biggest stars \u2013 and Nadal\u2019s rivals \u2013 were in attendance to watch this piece of history; Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga \u015awi\u0105tek, a self-confessed Nadal superfan, were all there to see the Spanish gladiator battle it out in front of an adoring crowd. One final dance? \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to talk,\u201d Nadal said in his on-court interview after the loss. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be last time I\u2019m going to be here in front of you. I am not 100% sure, but if it is the last time, I enjoyed it. \u201cThe crowd have been amazing in the whole week of preparation. The feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words, but for me, it\u2019s so special to feel the love from the people in the place I love the most. \u201cThe first round wasn\u2019t the ideal one,\u201d he added of the draw against Zverev. \u201cI was competitive, I had my chances, but it wasn\u2019t enough against a great player like Sascha. For me, it\u2019s difficult to say what\u2019s going on in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s a big percentage that I will not be back here playing at Roland Garros, but I\u2019ve enjoyed it a lot. I\u2019m traveling with the family, having fun and the body is feeling a little bit better than two months ago.\u201d Nadal, who added that he was hoping to be back on Chatrier for the Summer Olympics, has struggled with injury since the 2023 Australian Open and was forced to miss the vast majority of last season as he tried to get his body ready for one last year on tour. But Eurosport pundit and two-time Roland Garros finalist \u00c0lex Corretja said Nadal had told him only last week that his body was feeling pain free for the first time in two years, leading him to think about potentially returning next season. Understandably, the French Open holds a special place in Nadal\u2019s heart and the 37-year-old did everything in his power to ensure that he was not only fit enough to play, but fit enough to compete at the highest level. He certainly did that at times in his defeat to Zverev. At the start of the third set, a couple of trademark forehand winners were whipped down the line, drawing a deafening roar from the crowd that almost blew the retractable roof off Chatrier. Even in the second set, Nadal found an early break of serve as the momentum appeared to be shifting after the German had taken the first, but he was unable maintain that level and Zverev fought back to take the set in a tie break. There was potential for the tide to turn again at 2-2 in the third when Nadal held a grueling 12-minute service game and fended off four break points, only for Zverev to break the Spaniard\u2019s next service game. Even staring defeat in the face, Nadal \u2013 famed for his tenacity and grit \u2013 never stopped battling for every shot, pumping his fist towards the crowd each time he won a point. In the end, though, Zverev was just too good; so good was one of his shots that Nadal couldn\u2019t do anything but applaud as it flashed past him. Maybe, he would have gotten there if he was 10 years younger. \u201cI never could imagine when I was a kid that I will be here with almost 28 [years of age] \u2013 38, I would love to be 28,\u201d he said with laughs from the crowd. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have dreamed it. It\u2019s been a beautiful process, all the memories have been different, but nonetheless special. The feelings that you make me feel here are unforgettable, thanks very much from the bottom of my heart.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/sport/rafael-nadal-alexander-zverev-french-open-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a speech celebrating US-Mexico cooperation on the case, US President Joe Biden on Saturday hailed the extradition of El Nini \u2013 also known as N\u00e9stor Isidro P\u00e9rez Salas \u2013 as \u201ca good day for justice.\u201d \u201cEl Nini played a prominent role in the notorious Sinaloa cartel, one of the deadliest drug trafficking enterprises in the world. The United States has charged him for his role in illicit fentanyl trafficking and for murdering, torturing, and kidnapping numerous rivals, witnesses, and others,\u201d Biden said, thanking Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. \u201cOur governments will continue to work together to attack the fentanyl and synthetic drug epidemic that is killing so many people in our homelands and globally, and to bring to justice the criminals and organizations producing, smuggling, and selling these lethal poisons in both of our countries,\u201d he added. According to the US Department of Justice, N\u00e9stor Isidro P\u00e9rez Salas \u201cwas one of the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s lead sicarios, or assassins\u201d and was involved in the \u201cproduction and sale of fentanyl\u201d in the United States. Biden has previously described El Nini as one of America\u2019s most-wanted criminals. P\u00e9rez Salas was charged in the US with cocaine and methamphetamine trafficking conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, and witness retaliation\u00a0in February 2021. The\u00a0US State Department\u00a0offered a reward of up to $3 million for information leading to his arrest and he was detained in Mexico\u00a0in November of last year.

{"id": "2024_05_27_china_counterspace-us-china-russia-intl-hnk-scn", "text": "As Russian forces rolled over the Ukraine border in the first moments of their invasion, another, less visible onslaught was already underway \u2013 a cyberattack that crippled internet linked to a satellite communications network. That tech offensive \u2013 conducted by Russia an hour before its ground assault began in February 2022 \u2013 aimed to disrupt Kyiv\u2019s command and control in the pivotal early moments of the war, Western governments say. The cyberattack, which hit modems linked to a communication satellite,\u00a0had far-reaching effects \u2013\u00a0stalling wind turbines in Germany and cutting the internet for tens of thousands of people and businesses across Europe. Following the attack, Ukraine scrambled for other ways to get online. For governments and security analysts, the cyberattack underscored how satellites \u2013\u2013 which play an increasingly critical\u00a0role helping militaries position troops, run communications, and launch or detect weapons \u2013 can become a key target during war. As countries and companies build out satellite constellations, a growing number of governments are vying for technology that could\u00a0disrupt or even destroy adversaries\u2019 assets \u2013 not just on land, like Russia\u2019s alleged cyberattack\u00a0\u2013 but\u00a0in space too. Enter signal jamming and spoofing, high-powered lasers to dazzle imaging sensors, anti-satellite missiles and spacecraft with the capacity to interfere with others in orbit \u2013 counterspace technologies that analysts say leading powers like the United States, Russia and China could use\u00a0to target each other\u2019s satellites. An extreme example of a potential\u00a0counterspace weapon was thrown into the spotlight earlier this year when US intelligence suggested, according to CNN reporting, that Russia was attempting to develop a space-based, anti-satellite nuclear weapon \u2013 a claim Moscow has denied. Far from only affecting military-use satellites, such a weapon could have broad, devastating\u00a0impacts \u2013 for example, upending satellites the world relies on to predict the weather and respond to disasters, or even potentially affecting global navigation systems used for everything from banking and cargo shipping to hailing a ride share and ambulance dispatch. Last week, the US accused Russia of launching a satellite \u201cpresumably capable of attacking others in low Earth orbit,\u201d with American officials saying it follows prior Russian satellite launches of likely \u201ccounterspace systems\u201d in 2019 and 2022. Tracking countries\u2019 development of counterspace capabilities is difficult, given their closely guarded nature and the dual use ambiguity of many space technologies. Both Russia and China have advanced their development of tech that could be used for such purposes in recent years, while the US\u00a0builds on related space research and capabilities, according to experts and open-source reports. Development of counterspace technologies is playing out amid a new era of focus on space \u2013 where the US and China are competing to put astronauts on the moon and build research bases there and advances in satellite launch technology mean a growing number of actors, including US adversaries like North Korea and Iran, are putting assets in orbit. And as geopolitical rivalries mount on Earth, experts say Beijing and Moscow are increasingly interested in finding ways to deny the US \u2013 as the country with the most ground-based capabilities linked to space \u2013 the ability to use them. Counterspace race The idea of weapons aimed at or positioned in space remains highly controversial, but it isn\u2019t new. Decades ago, the US and the Soviet Union vied for technologies to knock-out each other\u2019s satellites, with Russia\u2019s 1957 launch of Sputnik \u2013 the world\u2019s first artificial satellite \u2013 quickly followed by US counterspace tests. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, America has become the pre-eminent power when it comes to capabilities in space linked to conducting military operations on Earth, analysts say \u2013 a strength Russia and China have hoped to turn against it to even the battlefield. \u201cDeveloping counterspace capabilities such as\u00a0(anti-satellite)\u00a0weapons provides a means to disrupt your adversary\u2019s space-based capabilities, whether it is communication, navigation, or command and control systems and logistics networks that rely on space-based systems,\u201d said Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, director of the Center for Security, Strategy & Technology at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. \u201cDenying the US any advantage it may have from the use of space in a conventional military conflict is what is driving Russia and China in terms of their capability development and strategies,\u201d she said. To this end, Russia is believed to have dusted off Cold War-era anti-satellite research programs, such as for the development of an \u201caircraft-borne laser system\u201d to disrupt imagery reconnaissance satellites, according to an\u00a0annual report\u00a0by the independent US-based\u00a0Secure World Foundation (SWF)\u00a0released in March. New evidence suggests Russia may also be working to expand on its ground-based electronic warfare capabilities with the development of space-based technology for jamming satellite signals in orbit, said the report, which is compiled using open-source intelligence. In recent years, Russia has also launched spacecraft that appear able to surveil foreign satellites \u2013 with the high velocity of two of these devices and suggestions others were able to release aerosols\u00a0indicating they could be weapons tests, according to SWF. China announced its own counterspace ambitions in 2007 when it launched a missile some 500 miles into space to take down one of its own aging weather satellites. The move broke a decades-long, post-Cold War lull in such destructive, \u201cdirect ascent\u201d anti-satellite missile testing, and was followed by similar operations from the US, India and Russia. Since then, China is believed by analysts to have conducted multiple, nondestructive missile tests that could advance its ability to target satellites. The most recent of those was last April, according to SWF, though, like others, that was described by Beijing as a missile intercept technology test. China is also believed by the US Space Force to be \u201cdeveloping jammers to target a wide range of satellite communications\u201d and to have \u201cmultiple ground-based laser systems.\u201d Other Chinese operations in space are difficult to explicitly classify as weapons research but could have a military purpose, experts say. Those include satellites that can approach or rendezvous with others in orbit, such as for support and maintenance purposes, like the Shiyan-7, launched in 2013 and likely equipped with a robotic arm. There is suggestion from within China of the potential dual use of such technology. In a 2021 state media interview, Zang Jihui, a People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) engineer, described China\u2019s experiments with a satellite \u201cequipped with a robotic arm, able to change orbit and conduct all-round detection of other satellites\u201d as part of its \u201canti-satellite capabilities.\u201d Beijing included safeguarding its \u201csecurity interests in outer space\u201d as among its national defense goals in a 2019 white paper, but has long said it stands \u201cfor the peaceful use of outer space\u201d and opposes an arms race there. SWF says there is no confirmed public evidence of China using counterspace capabilities against any military targets. Russia has also said it opposes weapons in space. Both countries in recent years have established military forces dedicated to aerospace, as has the US, which launched its Space Force in 2019 as the first new military branch since 1947. US officials have described America as a leader in advancing the \u201cresponsible and peaceful use\u201d of outer space. And given its reliance on space for its defense, experts say the US military has the most at stake when it comes to ensuring countries don\u2019t use technologies against satellites there \u2013 one reason analysts say the US policy community has long shunned placing weapons in space. Among all nations, only non-destructive capabilities like signals jamming have been actively used against satellites in current military operations, according to SWF. \u2018Deny\u2019 China Since it took down one of its own malfunctioning satellites with a missile in 2008 after China\u2019s test, Washington has\u00a0pledged\u00a0to no longer conduct such destructive, direct-ascent anti-satellite missile tests, which can generate dangerous space debris, and is not believed to have an operational program for such capabilities. It also doesn\u2019t have an acknowledged operational program to target satellites from within orbit using other satellites or spacecraft, though it could likely quickly field one in the future, according to SWF. That\u2019s because the US has done extensive non-offensive testing of technologies to approach and rendezvous with satellites, including close approaches of its own military satellites and several Russian and Chinese military satellites, SWF says. The US only has one acknowledged, operational counterspace system \u2013 electronic warfare capabilities to interfere with satellite signals \u2013 and its army is widely seen to have advanced abilities to jam communications and capabilities to interfere with certain navigation satellites. It also has considerable research on ground-based lasers that could be used to dazzle or blind imaging satellites, according to SWF, which says there\u2019s no indication those have become operational. Speaking in Washington in November, US Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman explained why the US felt it needed to be able to counter other countries\u2019 space capabilities. He pointed to what he described as a \u201ckill web\u201d strategy used by China\u2019s PLA to enhance the range and accuracy of its weapons within the strategically important \u201csecond island chain,\u201d running from Japan to Guam. \u201cThat is all a space-enabled capability,\u201d Saltzman said. And should Beijing decide to use those weapons, \u201cWe have to be able to deny (China) access to the information to break that kill chain so that our joint forces are not immediately in target and in range inside the second island chain,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, concerns about potential adversaries\u2019 space activities have pushed US allies, including France and Australia, to seek\u00a0counterspace abilities \u2013 often non-destructive ways to interfere with enemy satellites, known as \u201csoft-kill\u201d capabilities, such as lasers to disrupt surveillance and jamming. Israel has also said it used GPS jamming in its war in Gaza to \u201cneutralize\u201d threats, likely ground-based efforts to avert missiles that reach their target using GPS tracking. More broadly, there has been a\u00a0trend toward\u00a0shorter-term-impact measures like jamming, spoofing and cyberattacks that don\u2019t permanently damage or destroy a target, according to Juliana Suess,\u00a0a research fellow for space security\u00a0at London-based defense think tank RUSI. \u201c(Actors) don\u2019t need to invest a whole lot of money into manufacturing these big sci-fi sounding anti-satellite weapons \u2013 they can just disrupt a whole network through a cyberattack,\u201d she said. \u2018Wipe out\u2019 More than 7,500 operational satellites are orbiting the Earth, according to the most recent figures from the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) in\u00a0May 2023. Of those satellites, more than 5,000 were US-owned, with most of them commercial. Nearest competitor China \u2013 which has been increasing its satellite launches \u2013 had 628, followed by Russia with fewer than 200, according to UCS. Since it invaded Ukraine, Moscow has accused the West of using commercial satellite systems for military purposes and warned that \u201cquasi-civil infrastructure may become a legitimate target for retaliation.\u201d Russia has also been accused of mounting cyberattacks against the largest commercial satellite constellation, American company SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, which has been an asset for the Ukrainian military. When it comes to allegations of developing a nuclear space-based weapon, Moscow has slammed the West as attempting to \u201cassign to us a certain plan of action which we do not have.\u201d A nuclear weapon in space would be a potential last-resort option \u2013 or hanging sword \u2013 for its potential to wipe out a wide swath of satellites, albeit indiscriminately. If Russia is developing \ufeffsuch a weapon, its concerns about American constellations like Starlink that have shown military utility are \u201clikely a key motivating factor,\u201d according to Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington. One reason is that as satellite constellations proliferate \u2013 aided by advances that have made launches in low Earth orbit (no more than 1,200 miles\u00a0above the planet) cheaper and easier \u2013 it could be difficult for an attacker to cause an impact by simply targeting a single satellite. By contrast, \u201cemployment of such (nuclear) weapons in space could wipe out large satellite constellations, potentially creating long-lasting debris and radioactive remnants that render orbits unusable for military and civilian purposes,\u201d Zhao said. That, he added, could also inflict \u201can inconceivable setback on the preservation of space as a common domain for future human development.\u201d Chinese scientists have expressed concern about a potential national security risk of Starlink, with a group writing in the peer-reviewed domestic publication \u201cModern Defense Technology\u201d in 2022 that \u201ca combination of soft and hard kill methods should be adopted to incapacitate some Starlink satellites functioning abnormally and destroy the constellation\u2019s operating system.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether this view reflects thinking within the Chinese government. Chinese researchers have also considered the ramifications of nuclear detonation in space, with a separate group at a nuclear technology institute publishing research last year on computer simulations of the impact of such blasts at different altitudes, in which they noted there could be potential effects on satellites and other aircraft. Space treaty Nuclear weapons already have a controversial history linked to space. America\u2019s 1962 Starfish Prime nuclear test some 250 miles over Earth damaged at least a third of the 24 satellites operating around that time, according to military documents. It also knocked out powerlines in Hawaii and turned the sky above it a violent shade of orange for hours. The test, launched from Earth, was part of series to evaluate the effect of such explosions, including against ballistic missiles. Five years later, countries concerned about the heating space race and nuclear standoffs banned the stationing of weapons of mass destruction in space with the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which doesn\u2019t explicitly ban conventional weapons in orbit or missiles launched from Earth. Though decades old, experts say that treaty \u2013 which affirms that space should be used for the benefit of all countries and is endorsed by Washington, Beijing and Moscow \u2013 remains a bedrock for a domain that lacks extensive international norms to ensure peace. Its tenets may be more relevant now than ever \u2013 but potentially under greater threat amid a new focus on military and space. Last month, Russia vetoed an effort in the United Nations Security Council led by the US and Japan to reaffirm the Outer Space Treaty principles, including the obligation not to place nuclear weapons in space. The resolution would have been the council\u2019s first on outer space and was supported by all other members besides China, which abstained. Instead, China and Russia, which have long worked together to shape rules around weapons in outer space, pushed for that resolution to be broadened to ban the placement of any weapons in space. Using language that appeared to target the US, it called on \u201call states, and above all those with major space capabilities\u201d to prevent the \u201cthreat or use of force\u201d in space. A second draft resolution backed by Russia that included that amendment, was rejected by the council last week, with the US calling it \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d Any future efforts to agree on rules for space face a complicated outlook, experts say. For example, placement in space of a nuclear weapon like the one Russia is reportedly considering would have far-reaching implications on how space is used \u2013 and how weapons are controlled, according to RUSI\u2019s Suess. \u201cIf the Outer Space Treaty was broken in such a way, it would make it even harder to imagine where multilateral efforts can go from here,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/china/counterspace-us-china-russia-intl-hnk-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

Alejandra Rodriguez made headlines across the world in April when she was crowned Miss Buenos Aires, becoming the first sexagenarian to win a contest organized by the Miss Universe franchise. While she was unable to repeat that triumph on Saturday to become Miss Argentina and earn the right to represent her country in the Miss Universe pageant, she did win the \u201cbest face\u201d category and celebrated her breakthrough as marking the beginnings of a shift in how beauty is perceived. \u201cThis is the first step of a change that is coming,\u201d Rodriguez, an attorney and journalist by profession, told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol after the contest. \u201cI hope this (my participating) marks a before and after.

{"id": "2024_05_26_europe_germany-afd-elections-analysis-intl", "text": "A right-wing German lawmaker made comments seen as so explosively outside the mainstream of acceptable political discourse, that his party was disowned by other far-right leaders, breaking a major coalition in the European Parliament. Maximilian Krah, of the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party, told an Italian newspaper that he didn\u2019t view all members of a notorious Nazi paramilitary group automatically as criminals. He claimed that some in the SS, whose primary role was guarding concentration camps during World War II, were in fact just farmers. \u201cBefore I declare someone a criminal, I want to know what he did. Among the 900,000 SS men there were also many farmers: there was certainly a high percentage of criminals, but not all of them were. I will never say that anyone who wore an SS uniform was automatically a criminal,\u201d Krah told La Repubblica last weekend. The AfD have since banned the 47-year-old Krah, their leading candidate in next month\u2019s European elections, from making public appearances. Experts say his remarks have also caused reverberations across Europe\u2019s far-right, shining a light on how the continent\u2019s far-right parties view themselves and their associations. After Krah\u2019s interview was published on Saturday, his party suspended him on Wednesday, and said that he had taken \u201dfull responsibility\u201d for his actions and agreed to step down from its federal executive board with immediate effect. In a scathing statement, the AfD accused Krah of having caused \u201cmassive damage to the party in the current election campaign, for which the candidate had provided the pretext.\u201d It is not immediately clear if Krah remains the AfD\u2019s official lead candidate for the upcoming European election. Lorenz Blumenthaler, a political analyst at the Amadeu Antonio Foundation in Berlin \u2013 which runs educational projects and researches right-wing extremism, racism and antisemitism \u2013 told CNN that the AfD only takes action like this in certain circumstances. \u201cThe only time when there exists this red line is when they feel like it\u2019s hurting their voting result. And that\u2019s the only time when they will act or whether they fear that it will basically change the way German security forces perceive them as the AfD.\u201d Blumenthaler added that reprimanding Krah this close to a major election is a pretty drastic step politically. It \u201cdelegitimizes you as a political party and hurts you much more than just running with a lazy dog (or deadweight candidate),\u201d he told CNN. Kicked out of a far-right coalition On Thursday, a far-right coalition of parties in the European Parliament expelled the AfD from the group. The Identity and Democracy (ID) bloc said in a statement, they had decided to exclude the AfD, \u201cwith immediate effect,\u201d adding that \u201cthe ID Group no longer wants to be associated with the incidents involving Maximilian Krah, head of the AfD list for the European elections.\u201d In Paris, the leaders of French right-wing party National Rally (RN) \u2013 the successor to the Front National led by Marine Le Pen, and part of the ID alliance \u2013 also dissociated themselves from the AfD. RN President Jordan Bardella said in a French TV debate on Tuesday that the AfD had \u201ccrossed red lines.\u201d \u201cWe will have new allies after the European elections and will no longer be in the same group as the AfD,\u201d Bardella added. Joe D\u00fcker, a researcher at the extremism monitoring think tank the Center for Monitoring, Analysis and Strategy (CeMAS), told CNN that European far-right parties, and RN in particular, have been trying to present themselves as more moderate. \u201cFar-right populists are always trying to appeal to a broad voter base and they are always trying to give themselves an image that seems cleaner than they actually are. We know that Le Pen\u2019s party has been trying to clean up their image in the past couple of years. She broke with her father, the founder of that party, because of that.\u201d Blumenthaler described this image cleansing as the \u201cmost absurd dynamic that we have, a new far-right self-consciousness all over Europe.\u201d That sense of self-awareness doesn\u2019t seem to extend to the AfD, though. There have been a series of incidents where AfD\u00a0members have expressed far-right ideologies openly in Germany. Recently scandals have also seen members accused of spying for China and accepting bribes from Russia. Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, a regional leader for AfD in the eastern state of Thuringia, was fined \u20ac13,000 ($14,000) by a German court earlier in May for using banned Nazi slogans, according to CNN affiliate N-TV. H\u00f6cke, a former history teacher, intends to run as the lead candidate for the AfD in the upcoming state elections in September, and is currently the clear favorite to win. According to Blumenthaler, these incidents don\u2019t appear to hurt the party, especially in Germany. \u201cAfter basically crashing the (far-right) European coalition, that really hurts the AfD on a European level, but I don\u2019t really think that it will affect their electoral base here in Germany that much,\u201d he added. Expect more of the same D\u00fcker told CNN that the trend of increased AfD extremism is likely to continue. \u201cWe can expect that things that are more radical, more extreme will become more acceptable,\u201d he said. The AfD\u2019s open radicalism is an interesting phenomenon for Blumenthaler too, especially when compared to its European allies. \u201cIt\u2019s still the Austrians and the German far-right branches that are the craziest\u2026 you would think that the taboo due to the German and Austrian past would be far higher here. And that the far right would act far more strategically trying to whitewash what they say how they act, but instead they are becoming more and more radicalized,\u201d he told CNN. The AfD is under domestic surveillance for the threat it poses to Germany\u2019s democracy and despite a recent dip is currently polling higher than each of the three parties in the coalition now governing the country. D\u00fcker noted a similarity between the AfD and Donald Trump, adding that: \u201cThe more scandals and the more outrageous things the ex-President said, the more his followers seemed to commit to him even more. And something similar appears to be going on with the AfD.\u201d Barbie Nadeau in Rome and James Frater in London contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/26/europe/germany-afd-elections-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

On Wednesday, FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel called on other agency commissioners to support such regulations amid growing fears that AI-generated deepfakes could disrupt elections. \u201cAs artificial intelligence tools become more accessible, the Commission wants to make sure consumers are fully informed when the technology is used,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a news release.\u00a0\u201cToday, I\u2019ve shared with my colleagues a proposal that makes clear consumers have a right to know when AI tools are being used in the political ads they see, and I hope they swiftly act on this issue.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s proposal aims to open a rulemaking process at the FCC that would likely take months to play out. The proposal calls for new rules governing broadcast TV and radio, as well as cable and satellite providers. Under the proposed rules, political advertisers on those mediums would have to make on-air disclosures if their ads contain AI-generated content. The FCC does not regulate internet-based media such as streaming video services or social media. As part of the proposed rule, political advertisers would also have to provide written disclosures in the files that broadcasters are\u00a0required to make available\u00a0to the public. The FCC move seeks to fill\u00a0a yawning gap\u00a0in the regulation of artificial intelligence in political advertising. Existing US election law prohibits campaigns from \u201cfraudulently misrepresenting other candidates or political parties,\u201d but whether this prohibition extends to AI-generated content is an open question. Last summer,\u00a0Republicans on the Federal Election Commission blocked\u00a0a move that could have made clear the law extended to AI-created depictions; the FEC has since agreed to revive the discussion, but it has not reached a decision on the matter. In the meantime, some US lawmakers have proposed legislation that could clamp down on AI in elections. In March, a bipartisan proposal by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski unveiled the\u00a0AI Transparency in Elections Act, which could require AI disclaimers on political ads. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, has stressed the urgent need for Congress to create guardrails for artificial intelligence, particularly for elections. Last week, he and a bipartisan group of senators\u00a0released a blueprint\u00a0for legislative action. But many\u00a0policy analysts doubt\u00a0that Congress can pass meaningful AI legislation during an election year. Online platforms such as Meta have taken their own steps to address AI in political ads,\u00a0requiring campaigns\u00a0to disclose the use of deepfakes and banning the use of its\u00a0in-house generative AI tools\u00a0for political advertising.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

He told the BBC that he started to feel ill and turned \u201ca very strange blue\u201d within about 30 minutes. \u201cMy whole body, top to bottom, ears, everything, blue,\u201d he said in an interview released Wednesday, describing the symptoms of septic shock. Sepsis is the body\u2019s extreme response to an infection. It can be spurred by any type of infection, even a minor one, and occurs when germs enter a person\u2019s body and multiply, causing illness and organ and tissue damage. The life-threatening condition requires urgent medical care to prevent organ damage and death. In some cases, sepsis or the infections leading up to it are not properly identified because they can come with a wide range of symptoms such as confusion or disorientation, shortness of breath, high heart rate, fever, shivering or feeling very cold, extreme pain or discomfort, and clammy or sweaty skin, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

On November 30, Mackinlay recorded a video from his hospital bed in which he showed the damage to his limbs. \u201cit\u2019s caused the complete death of my hands and also my feet,\u201d he said, describing them as \u201cgnarled, dry, dessicated\u201d and revealing that he was due to undergo a quadruple amputation the next day. \u201cThe reality is I probably shouldn\u2019t have survived this far,\u201d said Mackinlay. \u201cThe grim reaper let me survive, but he\u2019s taken his payment in four of my limbs,\u201d he adds. Mackinlay\u2019s wife, Kati Mackinlay, told GB News that doctors told her he had only a 5% chance of survival, but she remained hopeful. \u201cI never said goodbye, I never thought that\u2019s it for Craig,\u201d she said. \u201cI always knew that Craig would pull through and he did.\u201d The operation, in which his arms were amputated from the elbow and his legs from the knee, took around 4-5 hours, Mackinlay told GB News. He then went through a rehabilitation process to learn how to live with prosthetic arms and legs. He has also some scarring to his face and ears due to a lack of blood supply, he added. Nonetheless, Mackinlay is eager to get back to work. \u201cGet back into the saddle, get back into Parliament, get back doing the things I enjoy,\u201d he told GB News.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/uk/craig-mckinlay-sepsis-return-scli-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/28/2024", "section": "world"}}
