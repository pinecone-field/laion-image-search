Margot Friedl\u00e4nder, n\u00e9e Bendheim, was born in Berlin in 1921. According to a brief bio on the website of Berlin\u2019s Jewish Museum, Friedl\u00e4nder spent the early part of the war with her mother and younger brother Ralph after her parents separated. They had plans to flee the country but in 1943 her brother was arrested by the Gestapo. Their mother confronted the Gestapo, which led to her being deported to Auschwitz with her son, where they were both murdered. But before leaving, she left behind a message for her daughter that read: \u201cTry to make your life.\u201d Friedl\u00e4nder, then just 21 years old, went into hiding but was ultimately betrayed by \u201ccatchers\u201d and was sent to Theresienstadt camp in the then-Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia in 1944, according to the museum. In her interview with Vogue Germany, Friedl\u00e4nder said: \u201cI am grateful. Grateful that I made it. For being able to fulfill my mother\u2019s wish. That I have made my life.\u201d Vogue Germany said they\u2019d met with Friedl\u00e4nder four times this year and that the cover pictures were shot in April at the Botanical Garden in Berlin. Kerstin Weng, head of editorial content at the magazine, said that the theme of the issue was love, featuring their \u201cfavorite pieces, favorite people.\u201d The front of the collector\u2019s issue includes the word \u201clove\u201d written by Friedl\u00e4nder, as well as her signature. The multi-page piece, which includes numerous shots of Friedl\u00e4nder, covers a range of topics, from growing up in Nazi Germany to her commitment as a Holocaust survivor today. Weng said: \u201cThe most positive person I know is on this issue\u2019s cover: Margot Friedl\u00e4nder. To many she is known as a Holocaust survivor. But she not only survived the Nazis, she also overcame betrayal and loss. She would have all reason to be bitter, but remains open-minded and refuses to take sides. She stands up against forgetting and for humanity and togetherness. \u201cAt 102, she seeks to engage with the younger generation and proves that dialogue is still possible.\u201d \u2018Carry my story onward\u2019 Friedl\u00e4nder met her future husband, Adolf, while in the Nazi concentration camp, and married him soon after liberation. The pair emigrated to the US in 1946 and lived in New York for more than six decades. But in 2010, following her husband\u2019s death aged 88, Friedl\u00e4nder moved back to Berlin. Ever since, she has been campaigning as a Holocaust educator. Her tireless efforts have earnt her numerous awards, including the Federal Cross of Merit First Class. Friedl\u00e4nder told Vogue Germany that she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the growth of right-wing populism and the rise of antisemitic attacks. When addressing the issue of society becoming more polarized, she said: \u201cLook not toward what separates us. Look towards what bring us together. Be People. Be sensible.\u201d Grateful for the opportunity to pass on her message, she said: \u201cYou will carry my story onward.

Staff Sgt. Gordon Black was arrested in May on charges of theft in the far eastern city of Vladivostok, where he had traveled to visit a woman, believed to be his girlfriend. He was accused of stealing 10,000 rubles (roughly $112) from her when he visited Russia in April after meeting her in South Korea, state news agency TASS previously reported. Black was also accused of assaulting the woman during a quarrel. The US soldier did not admit to charges of threatening to kill the woman, but partially admitted guilt to theft charges, RIA Novosti previously reported. Black will appeal the sentence handed down by the court in Vladivostok, his lawyer said Wednesday, according to TASS. Speaking to the Pervomaisky District Court on Monday, Black said he took the money from the woman\u2019s purse, but the next day transferred $125 to her. He said he spent the money on food and three nights in a hotel, according to RIA. He also said the woman was to collect a deposit of 10,000 rubles from the landlord after the end of the lease of the apartment for which he was paying, RIA said. The woman also spoke in court on Monday, saying she was not yet ready to\u00a0reconcile with Black since the damage had not yet been compensated. Black\u2019s sentencing comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow, as\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u00a0rages on. A number of Americans are being held in Russia, including two who have been declared as wrongfully detained by the US State Department \u2013 former Marine\u00a0Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich. Gershkovich, 32, will stand trial behind closed doors in the city of Yekaterinburg from June 26, TASS reported Monday, citing the court\u2019s press service. The journalist has been imprisoned since he was arrested while on a reporting trip in March last year by the FSB, Russia\u2019s federal security service, which accused him of trying to obtain state secrets. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. Gershkovich, the US government and the Wall Street Journal have vehemently denied the charges against him. The\u00a0White House has previously alleged the Kremlin\u00a0is using Gershkovich, the first American reporter detained in Russia on allegations of spying since the Cold War, as a geopolitical hostage.

{"id": "2024_06_18_asia_thailand-same-sex-marriage-intl-hnk", "text": "Thailand will become the first nation in Southeast Asia to legalize same-sex marriage after the kingdom\u2019s Senate approved a marriage equality bill on Tuesday, with supporters calling it a \u201cmonumental step forward for LGBTQ+ rights.\u201d The Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of passing the bill following a final reading, with 130 senators voting in favor. Only four members opposed the bill. The bill still requires endorsement from the king before marriage equality can become reality in Thailand, but this process is considered a formality. The law will then come into effect 120 days after it is published in the royal gazette. The result of the vote means that Thailand will become only the third place in Asia to allow for marriage equality after\u00a0Taiwan legalized\u00a0same-sex marriage in 2019 and\u00a0Nepal in 2023. \u201cThe bill represents a monumental step forward for LGBTQ+ rights in Thailand,\u201d Panyaphon Phiphatkhunarnon, founder of Love Foundation \u2013 an NGO campaigning for\u00a0LGBTQ+ equality in\u00a0Thailand \u2013 told CNN. \u201cThe potential impact of this bill is immense. It would not only change the lives of countless couples but also contribute to a more just and equitable society for all.\u201d The bill grants LGBTQ+ couples the same legal rights and recognition as heterosexual couples, including rights related to inheritance, adoption and health care decision-making. \u201cBeyond the legal implications, the passage of this bill would send a powerful message of acceptance and inclusion,\u201d Panyaphon said. \u201cIt would inspire the younger generation to come out and live their lives authentically, it would showcase Thailand as a progressive and inclusive country \u2013 attracting tourists and businesses \u2026  and will foster a culture change where LGBTQ+ individuals feel accepted and supported.\u201d Bangkok residents Pokpong Jitjaiyai and Watit Benjamonkolchai say they plan to get married as soon as the law is passed. \u201cWhen I was young, people said people like us couldn\u2019t have a family, can\u2019t have children, so marriage was impossible,\u201d Pokpong told CNN. \u201cOver 10 years ago, we could not live together the way we are now. We could never be our true selves, the way it is now\u2026 and now I can freely say that I am gay.\u201d Pokpong said he hopes the marriage equality bill will start a \u201cdomino effect\u201d in other countries. \u201cI want the people around the world see how love is. Love is love,\u201d he said. The marriage equality bill was supported by all the major parties and marks a significant step in cementing the country\u2019s reputation as one of the friendliest in the region toward gay, lesbian and transgender people. Previous attempts\u00a0to legalize marriage equality over the past decade had stalled. In 2020, the Constitutional Court ruled that Thailand\u2019s current law, which stipulates marriage being between a man and a woman, was constitutional. Some of the major political parties contesting last year\u2019s election pledged to push marriage equality as part of their campaign, including the progressive Move Forward Party, which won the most seats. But that party, which had a huge youth following, was unable to form a government when former rivals joined forces to keep it out of office. Both the future of the party and of its popular former leader Pita Limjaroenrat remain uncertain as they face a slew of prosecutions. Nonetheless Thailand\u2019s Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, of the Pheu Thai Party, had also promised to bring the marriage equality bill to parliament. Dressed in a rainbow shirt, Srettha attended Pride Month celebrations in Bangkok earlier in June, joining a massive parade through the capital\u2019s streets. \u201cIt is a basic right to choose who to love,\u201d he said in a post on X on June 1. Srettha has been keen to showcase Thailand as a welcoming destination for\u00a0LGBTQ+ people, including voicing support for a bid to host World Pride in 2030. \u201cWe have come far in our journey towards social equality. I want to reaffirm my government\u2019s commitment in pushing for the realization of the Equal Marriage Bill which today we can visibly see the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Srettha said on X on June 1. \u201cWe look forward to hosting of the World Pride in 2030 in Thailand.\u201d Regional outlier As only the third territory in Asia to embrace marriage equality, Thailand remains an outlier in a region that has been slow to grant LGBTQ+ rights and where members of the community often face discrimination, prejudice and even violence. Rising religious conservatism and colonial-era laws have make life hard for the LGBTQ+ community in much of Southeast Asia, where same-sex relations are criminalized in several countries, including Myanmar and Brunei. In Indonesia, homosexual sex is not illegal except in the extremely conservative province of Aceh. But LGBTQ+ people have faced widespread discrimination, police raids, vigilante attacks and open hostility by Indonesian authorities and Islamic groups across the country. Indonesia\u2019s new Criminal Code, ratified in 2022, makes consensual sex outside of marriage a criminal offense and rights groups say this will disproportionately impact LGBTQ+ people as same-sex couples cannot marry in Indonesia. In Malaysia, homosexuality is a crime punishable by fines and prison terms of up to 20 years. The Muslim majority country that has seen a rise in conservative attitudes in recent years. Rights groups say the LGBTQ+ community faces growing intolerance in Malaysia and accuse the government of being at least partly to blame. Singapore only repealed a colonial-era law that criminalized sex between men in 2022 but the Singapore government has reiterated its opposition to gay marriage and vowed to make it harder for people to legally challenge the government\u2019s policies. In Singapore, couples in registered marriages have access to greater housing subsidies and adoption rights than single people. Japan is the only Group of Seven (G7) country that has not recognized either\u00a0same-sex civil unions\u00a0or\u00a0same-sex marriage, despite recent high court decisions that ruled not allowing same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. Last year, India\u2019s top court declined to legally recognize same-sex unions in a landmark ruling, after campaigners had sought to obtain the right to marry under Indian law. In mainland China, Beijing has\u00a0widened crackdowns\u00a0on LGBTQ activists and groups in recent years, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping increasingly stressing the ruling Communist Party\u2019s absolute control over every aspect of society. In other jurisdictions, campaigners have made small gains on a case by case basis as they appeal through the courts. South Korea does not legally recognize same-sex marriage but in February 2023, a South Korean court ruled in favor of a same-sex couple seeking equal health benefits. South Korea has also drawn international criticism for\u00a0its military penal code,\u00a0which makes same-sex relations between men punishable by up to two years in prison. In past years, dozens have been arrested in what critics have called a \u201cgay witch-hunt.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/asia/thailand-same-sex-marriage-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_20_asia_russia-putin-kim-deal-military-assistance-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea and Russia have pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked, according to the text of a new landmark defense pact agreed by the two autocratic nations. Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed the new strategic partnership agreement Wednesday in Pyongyang during a rare state visit\u00a0by the Russian leader who described the deal as a \u201cnew level\u201d in bilateral relations. The pact, which comes against the backdrop of Putin\u2019s grinding war against Ukraine, is the most significant agreement signed by Russia and North Korea in decades and is seen as something of a revival of their 1961 Cold War-era mutual defense pledge. It also consolidates the Kim regime\u2019s powerful link with a world power that wields a veto on the UN Security Council. On Thursday, North Korean state media KCNA published the full text of the pact, which also includes political, trade, investment, and security cooperation. According to the text, Article 4 states that should either country \u201cget into a state of war due to an armed aggression\u201d the other \u201cshall immediately provide military and other assistance with all the means at its disposal.\u201d The newly released text will now raise several questions for Western observers, including whether Russia\u2019s powerful nuclear deterrent now extends to North Korea, or if the two nations will now hold joint military drills. Putin referenced the defense clause after the meeting with Kim Wednesday, saying it provides \u201cfor the provision of mutual assistance in the event of aggression against one of the parties to this agreement.\u201d Kim, meanwhile, called the new \u201calliance\u201d a \u201cwatershed moment in the development of the bilateral relations.\u201d Some analysts say the pact reads more like a formal defense treaty than a partnership agreement. \u201cIn a sense this is laying out what they have been already building up in the recent months and years,\u201d said Jo Bee-yun, Associate Research Fellow at Korea Institute for Defense Analyses. \u201cBut definitely I would say this clause is very alarming because it is somewhere near reaching say a kind of a mutual defense treaty.\u201d Yu Ji-hoon, research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses said the treaty\u2019s \u201cautomatic intervention clause\u201d\u00a0means all military assets will be mobilized, \u201cincluding the army, navy, and air force.\u201d Details on the clause are scant, however, and Yu said it was \u201cnecessary to closely monitor the provisions regarding military intervention by North Korea and Russia.\u201d For example, North Korea refers to \u201cSouth Korea-US training, or training targeting North Korea\u201d as an attack, \u201cbut it is not viewed as equivalent to war,\u201d Yu said. The agreement cements the two countries\u2019 deepening alignment in the face of their international isolation over Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine and Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile program. The US, South Korea and other countries have accused North Korea of\u00a0providing substantial military aid\u00a0to Russia\u2019s war effort, while observers have raised concerns that Moscow may be violating international sanctions to aid Pyongyang\u2019s development of its\u00a0nascent military satellite program. Both countries have denied North Korean arms exports, despite significant evidence of such transfers. Speaking after his meeting with Kim, Putin rankled against what he called \u201cthe imperialist policy of the United States and its satellites,\u201d and said Russia \u201cdoes not rule out the development of military-technical cooperation with the DPRK,\u201d referring to North Korea by its official acronym. Analysts say any strengthening of technology cooperation would enhance North Korea\u2019s military power. \u201cThis includes advancements in nuclear weapons and effective means of delivering these nuclear capabilities,\u201d Yu said. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the pact \u201csymbolizes Moscow choosing Pyongyang over the international nonproliferation regime and Russia\u2019s obligations as a member of the UN Security Council.\u201d This story has been updated.

The MV Tutor is thought to be the second ship sunk by Houthis since March, when the British-registered vessel Rubymar was downed after being struck by ballistic missiles fired from Houthi territory in Yemen. The rebels have launched dozens of missile and drone attacks directed at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7\u00a0attacks. Since then, tensions have spiked across the Middle East, with key regional actors fiercely condemning the humanitarian crisis caused by more than eight months of Israeli bombardment of Gaza. Israel launched its military offensive\u00a0in October\u00a0after militants led by Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza have since killed at least\u00a037,396\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a085,523\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there. The Tutor was first hit on June 12 by a smaller boat before being struck a second time by \u201can unknown airborne projectile,\u201d according to the UKMTO. One crew member was reported missing after the attack, US Central Command (CENTCOM) said last week. After the ship\u2019s entire crew were evacuated from the vessel, it began to drift before reportedly sinking on Tuesday, according to the UKMTO. A Houthi spokesperson previously claimed that the ship had been attacked by a\u00a0sea\u00a0drone, ballistic missiles and other drones for violating their so-called \u201cban to the occupied Palestinian ports.\u201d Houthi-run news outlet Al Masirah acknowledged foreign media reports regarding the sinking on Tuesday. Meanwhile, CENTCOM said on X that, \u201cThe Houthis claim to be acting on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza and yet they are targeting and threatening the lives of third country nationals who have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza. The ongoing threat to international commerce caused by the Houthis in fact makes it harder to deliver badly needed assistance to the people of Yemen as well as Gaza.\u201d Earlier this month, CENTCOM launched attacks on Houthi radars that helped facilitate the group\u2019s ongoing assaults on ships in the Red Sea, according to US Central Command.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/middleeast/houthi-rebels-red-sea-attacks-mv-tutor-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Thousands of North Koreans chanting \u201cwelcome Putin\u201d\u00a0lined the city\u2019s wide boulevards brandishing Russian and North Korean flags and bouquets of flowers, as Putin kicked off his first visit to North Korea in 24 years with a finely choreographed display of influence in the dictatorship. The pair then signed the new strategic partnership to replace previous deals signed in 1961, 2000 and 2001, according to Russian state news agency TASS. \u201cThe comprehensive partnership agreement signed today includes, among other things, the provision of mutual assistance in the event of aggression against one of the parties to this agreement,\u201d Putin said after the meeting. He said the deal encompasses the \u201cpolitical, trade, investment, cultural spheres, and the security sphere as well,\u201d calling the pact \u201ctruly a breakthrough document.\u201d Putin said joint drills involving the United States, South Korea and Japan were \u201chostile\u201d toward North Korea,\u201d characterizing the US policy as \u201cconfrontational.\u201d Kim, meanwhile, called the new \u201calliance\u201d a \u201cwatershed moment in the development of the bilateral relations.\u201d But the deal between the two autocrats raised many questions, too \u2013 including whether Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent now extends to North Korea, and vice versa, or whether the two nations will now hold joint military drills. Putin greeted with fanfare Putin was met with exuberant celebrations at a welcome ceremony with his counterpart at Kim Il Sung Square in the heart of the North Korean capital, where mounted soldiers, military personnel and children holding balloons cheered against the backdrop of large portraits of the each leader. The two leaders presented their respective officials and stood together as the Russian national anthem played before riding off standing shoulder to shoulder in an open-top limousine as they smiled and waved to the crowds. The scenes of pomp and fanfare were a constant throughout the day, which closed with Kim escorting Putin to his plane late in the evening ahead of his trip to Vietnam. The staging reflected North Korea\u2019s reliance on Moscow and was likely intended as a reminder to the West that Putin still holds considerable influence in at least some corners of the world, after his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The relationship is important to Russia, too. Multiple governments have accused Pyongyang of supplying arms to Moscow for its grinding war in Ukraine, a charge both countries have denied, despite significant evidence of such transfers. On Wednesday Putin gave Kim an Aurus car when the two leaders exchanged gifts, according to Russian state media \u2013 the second time Putin has given his counterpart this car model. According to Putin\u2019s aide Yuri Ushakov, the Russian leader also presented Kim with a tea set. Ushakov did not specify what Putin received, but said they were \u201calso good gifts.\u201d Putin landed in North Korea in the early hours of Wednesday local time, exactly 24 years to the day he was last in Pyongyang, for a visit heralding the countries\u2019 deepening alignment in the face of shared animosity toward the West and international concerns over their growing military cooperation. In remarks ahead of talks between the two, Kim voiced his \u201cfull support and solidarity with the struggles of the Russian government, military and the people,\u201d pointing specifically to Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine \u201cto protect its own sovereignty, safety and territorial stability.\u201d \u201cSituations continue to be complicated and ever-changing, but I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that we will continue to strengthen and closely engage in strategic communication with the (Russian) leadership,\u201d Kim added. Putin hailed the countries\u2019 ties as based on \u201cequality and mutual respect,\u201d and said an expected new bilateral agreement would \u201cform the basis of relations between the two states for many years to come,\u201d according to Russian state agency TASS. He also added that he hoped Kim would visit Moscow for their next meeting. The burgeoning relationship has sparked concern in both Seoul and Washington, not only over North Korea\u2019s arms transfers to Russia, but also the prospect of Moscow transferring its superior military technology to aid Pyongyang\u2019s heavily sanctioned weapons program. \u2018Unwavering support\u2019 Kim, the third generation leader of a dynasty that has ruled North Korea with an iron fist, beamed visibly as he greeted Putin at the airport in the early hours of Wednesday morning, video footage of the Russian leader\u2019s arrival showed. The landmark visit marks a significant boost for Kim, who remains isolated on the world stage and has not hosted another world leader in his capital since the pandemic. It comes as tensions remain elevated on the Korean Peninsula, where Kim in recent months has ramped up bellicose language and scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea amid alarm in Pyongyang over tightening coordination between the US, South Korea and Japan. North Korea state media appeared to play heavily into the close rapport between Kim and Putin, describing them as \u201cexchanging their pent-up innermost thoughts and opened their minds to more surely develop (North Korea-Russia) relations,\u201d as rode together from the airport to the Kumsusan State Guest House where Putin is staying. Putin\u2019s trip follows\u00a0Kim\u2019s landmark visit to Russia last year, where the two leaders were widely seen as opening this\u00a0new chapter in their relations predicated on Putin\u2019s need for North Korean arms for its ongoing offensive. Russia has received more than 10,000 shipping containers \u2013 the equivalent of\u00a0260,000 metric tons\u00a0of munitions or munitions-related material \u2013 from North Korea since September, according to a US\u00a0statement\u00a0in February. Russian forces have also launched at least 10 North Korea-made missiles on Ukraine since September, a US official also\u00a0said\u00a0in March. The Russian leader is widely seen as looking to ensure this continued support, which may be especially urgent as delayed American military aid to Ukraine comes online. Putin also sought to link today\u2019s meeting to Moscow and Pyongyang\u2019s historic ties. The \u201cexploits of previous generations\u201d were a \u201cgood basis for the development of relations\u201d between the two nations, he told Kim, according to Russian state media TASS. A long history Putin made his last visit to Pyongyang in 2000 for a meeting with Kim\u2019s late father and predecessor Kim Jong Il. That trip, weeks after Putin\u2019s inauguration for his first term as president, made him the first Russian head of state to visit North Korea. The elder Kim then visited Moscow in 2001, taking a marathon nine-day rail trip across Russia for the meeting, in what was only his second overseas trip after an earlier visit to China. The two countries in 2000 also inked a new cooperation agreement. Unlike a 1961 document between the Soviet Union and North Korea, that new iteration did not include reference to mutual military defense assistance, but was seen as an important step in reviving a fraught and closely linked relationship. The two neighbors have deep ties on the Korean Peninsula. Kim\u2019s grandfather Kim Il Sung rose to power in the late 1940s as part of Soviet efforts to install a communist-controlled government in the north to rival a US-backed government in the south following the defeat of the Japanese imperial army during World War II. But tightly integrated relations frayed and transformed in the intervening decades, as the Soviet Union collapsed and the new state of Russia established diplomatic relations with Seoul and supported multiple United Nations sanctions on North Korea\u2019s weapons program. The latest raft of diplomacy comes as shared frustrations with the West have driven the two countries closer \u2013 a trend observers say has now been accelerated by the war in Ukraine and has seen North Korea gain a powerful friend in the UN Security Council. In March, Moscow\u00a0vetoed a UN resolution\u00a0to renew independent monitoring of North Korea\u2019s violations of Security Council sanctions \u2013 raising concerns about the relationship weakening controls on Kim\u2019s illegal weapons program.

{"id": "2024_06_19_asia_south-china-sea-philippines-injury-intl-hnk", "text": "Manila has accused China of injuring Filipino personnel and damaging Philippine vessels during a South China Sea collision earlier this week, as tensions simmer over territorial disputes in the resource-rich and strategically important waterway. The Philippines and China have both blamed each other for the clash Monday near Second Thomas Shoal in the contested\u00a0Spratly Islands, with a statement from the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday providing the first official confirmation from either side that injuries and damage were sustained. It follows multiple reports of injuries to Filipino sailors carried in local media and the Associated Press, citing sources, as well as from US officials. The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs \u201cdenounces the illegal and aggressive actions of Chinese authorities that resulted in personnel injury and vessel damage,\u201d the statement said, without specifying how many sailors were wounded or providing any details of their injuries. At least eight\u00a0Filipinos were injured in the incident \u2013 including one sailor who lost a thumb,\u00a0the AP reported Tuesday, citing an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. CNN has reached out to the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine Coast Guard for comment. Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times published photos of the incident online on Wednesday, showing a Philippine rigid-hulled inflatable boat sandwiched between a large China Coast Guard vessel and at least three other Chinese boats. When asked about the incident in a news conference on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, \u201claw enforcement measures taken by the Chinese Coast Guard on the spot were professional and restrained, aimed at stopping the illegal fishing by Philippine ships, and no direct measures were taken against Philippine personnel.\u201d The incident Monday is the latest in a string of confrontations between Chinese and Philippine ships that have raised the possibility of the South China Sea becoming a flashpoint for global conflict. It comes just weeks after Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr.\u00a0warned\u00a0that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the waterway would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war. Marcos has sought closer ties with the US, which\u00a0has repeatedly stressed Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad commitment\u201d to a 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines that stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party. China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims. In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its maritime territorial claims, with China Coast Guard ships \u2013 reinforced by militia boats \u2013 involved in multiple clashes over the past year that have damaged Philippine ships and seen\u00a0Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. Known as Ayungin Shoal in the Philippines and Ren\u2019ai Jiao in China, Second Thomas Shoal is a submerged teardrop-shaped reef\u00a0located about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Philippine island of Palawan. It lies in the Spratly Islands, a mostly uninhabited archipelago where oil and gas reserves have been found, and which is claimed by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. The Philippines carried a resupply on Monday to its soldiers stationed on the BRP Sierra Madre, a rusting US-built Philippine Navy landing craft that was run aground deliberately in 1999, with a national flag hoisted on board, to assert Manila\u2019s territorial claims over Second Thomas Shoal. The China Coast Guard on Monday said a Philippine supply ship \u201cignored China\u2019s repeated solemn warnings\u201d and \u201cdeliberately and dangerously\u201d approached a Chinese vessel in \u201can unprofessional manner,\u201d resulting in a collision. A supply ship and two rubber boats from the Philippines had attempted to \u201cillegally\u201d deliver supplies to the stranded warship, China Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu\u00a0said. China\u2019s Coast Guard also said it took measures including \u201cwarnings and interceptions, boarding inspections and forced evictions\u201d against the Philippine vessels. Multiple US officials criticized China\u2019s actions Monday and stressed Washington\u2019s support for\u00a0Manila. The \u201cUnited States stands with its ally the Philippines and condemns the escalatory and irresponsible actions\u201d by China, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/asia/south-china-sea-philippines-injury-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

In footage released by North Korean state media agency KCNA on Thursday, the two autocrats appear to enjoy each other\u2019s company as they take a jaunt in the Aurus luxury car. The carefully-choreographed moment shows Putin taking a turn in the driving seat first while Kim sits in the passenger seat, before the two swap places. The images are designed to highlight the close bond between the leaders, who say they have ramped up ties to a \u201cnew level\u201d during the Russian president\u2019s rare visit to the reclusive state this week. North Korea and Russia inked a new defense pact during the visit, pledging to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked. The pact, which comes against the backdrop of Putin\u2019s grinding war against Ukraine, is the most significant agreement signed by Russia and North Korea in decades and is seen as something of a revival of their 1961 Cold War-era mutual defense pledge. It also consolidates the Kim regime\u2019s powerful link with a world power that wields a veto on the UN Security Council. On Wednesday, Putin presented Kim with an Aurus car as the pair exchanged gifts, according to Russian state media \u2013 the second time the Kremlin leader has given his counterpart this car model. According to Putin\u2019s aide Yuri Ushakov, the Russian leader also presented Kim with a tea set. Footage from KCNA showed Putin in return receiving a pair of native Pungsan hunting dogs \u2013 the same breed Kim gifted to former South Korean President Moon Jae-in in 2018 during a breakthrough in the two countries\u2019 relations. Putin\u2019s trip has been a very public display of the strong relations between Russia and North Korea, whose alignment has deepened in the face of shared animosity toward the West. The Russian leader landed in North Korea in the early hours of Wednesday morning local time, exactly 24 years to the day that he was last in Pyongyang, amid international concerns over the two countries\u2019 military cooperation. During the visit, the two leaders announced a new strategic partnership driven by Moscow\u2019s need for weapons in its war in Ukraine. In remarks ahead of talks between the two, Kim voiced his \u201cfull support and solidarity with the struggles of the Russian government, military and the people,\u201d pointing specifically to Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine \u201cto protect its own sovereignty, safety and territorial stability.\u201d Putin, for his part, hailed the countries\u2019 ties as based on \u201cequality and mutual respect.\u201d The burgeoning relationship has sparked concern in both Seoul and Washington, not only over North Korea\u2019s arms transfers to Russia, but also the prospect of Moscow transferring its superior military technology to aid Pyongyang\u2019s heavily sanctioned weapons program. After his visit to North Korea, Putin landed in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi as he continues his attempts to boost economic ties with friendly countries amid Western isolation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/europe/putin-kim-north-korea-limousine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Around 270 million people in the US will experience temperatures at or above 90 degrees this week as an impressive heat dome parks over the eastern US. Hundreds of records could be tied or broken this week. Multiple all-time June high temperature records could fall as the heat rises to levels normally seen only on the hottest July days. Parts of the Midwest to the Northeast could endure the longest heat wave they\u2019ve seen in decades, the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center said. Scientists have warned that heat waves will become increasingly severe as the climate crisis intensifies. Tens of millions of people who live as far north as Maine and aren\u2019t used to heat this intense will be sweating in temperatures well into the 90s this week. It will feel even hotter than that as humidity helps drive heat index values \u2013 how temperatures feel to the body \u2013 into the low 100s. Read more: Search continues for US tourist and two others missing amid Greek heat wave An extreme heat risk is in place from the Great Lakes into the Northeast this week, according to the National Weather Service. Wednesday and Thursday will be the hottest days of the week, but the surrounding days will only be slightly less brutal. Heat will reach dangerous levels in many places including the major metropolitan areas of Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York City and Boston. Temperatures soared 15 to 20 degrees above normal Monday afternoon and remained at elevated levels overnight. A few dozen temperature records fell as a result, including daily record highs in Chicago and Cleveland, and daily record warm low temperatures in places like Des Moines, Iowa. Temperatures will rise up to 25 degrees above normal through the rest of the workweek. Some areas, including Montpelier, Vermont; Syracuse, New York; and Pittsburgh, haven\u2019t seen heat like this in about three decades. \u201cLast time we saw heat in Pittsburgh like what we\u2019re expecting next week was 30 yrs ago (almost to the day) when it reached 95\u00b0F or warmer for 6 straight days (June 15-20, 1994),\u201d the local weather service office said on X. \u201cThat stands as the longest stretch of 95+ (degree) days on record. We have a shot at tying or beating that.\u201d Some affected areas have started to activate heat protocols. Cooling centers will open across New York City starting Tuesday and cooling kits will be distributed to people working outdoors, Mayor Eric Adams said Monday. Burlington, Vermont, will also activate cooling centers starting Tuesday, according to the city. Recreation centers in Cleveland will be open for extended hours this week to serve as cooling centers, city officials said Monday. The city also suspended all playground programs for the week as temperatures soar. Heat domes like the one fueling this week\u2019s intense conditions trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. The oven-like conditions mean overnight temperatures often don\u2019t cool down enough to offer relief for overheated bodies, posing increased risks for heat-related illness. \u201cWarm overnight temperatures only dropping into the mid-70s will offer little to no relief, especially to those without adequate or reliable cooling,\u201d the Weather Prediction Center said.   Humidity will also join forces with extreme heat to create triple-digit heat indices \u2013 measurements of how hot the human body feels \u2013 in some areas. Chicago residents could feel\u00a0heat indices between 95 and 105 degrees through next week, the NWS in Chicago warned. Parts of eastern New York and western New England could see indices as high as 107 degrees. The NWS in Detroit, where the heat index could reach 100 degrees, urged residents to practice heat safety in the coming days, including limiting strenuous outdoor activities, staying hydrated, and checking up on neighbors who are elderly or don\u2019t have A/C. Heat-related illness is a concern in severely impacted areas, particularly for the elderly, young children and outdoor workers. Extreme heat is by far the deadliest form of severe weather, killing on average twice as many people a year as tornadoes and hurricanes combined.

The Princess of Wales, her husband William, their children George, Charlotte and Louis gathered together with King Charles and Queen Camilla to watch a Royal Air Force flypast. They waved and smiled at the crowd, who responded with cheers. The Princess, also known as Kate, was earlier driven in a state carriage with her children from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade to watch the celebration, known as Trooping the Colour. She could be seen wearing an Irish Guards regimental broach, a nod towards her role as their honorary colonel. The family were later seen watching events from a viewing point, while Kate\u2019s husband William, the Prince of Wales, rode on horseback. For Kate, it was her first public appearance since Christmas Day \u2013 weeks before her cancer diagnosis. Kate stepped away from public duties in January, following what Kensington Palace said at the time was surgery for a non-cancerous abdominal condition. In March, amid speculation about her wellbeing, she revealed she had been diagnosed with cancer after the operation, and was undergoing treatment. King Charles III and Queen Camilla were also taken in a carriage from Buckingham Palace, bringing cheers from the packed crowds as they made their way slowly up The Mall. The King took part riding a carriage rather than on horseback this year due to his own cancer diagnosis. People of all ages gathered along the length of the Mall for the event. Some onlookers are wearing Union Jack bucket hats and fascinators, while others are waving flags. Some sang the national anthem. Kate gave an update on her health on Friday, saying she had made \u201cgood progress\u201d in her recovery. But she said she expected her treatment to last for a few more months and was \u201cnot out of the woods yet.\u201d Trooping the Colour is the magnificent military spectacle which sees 1,400 officers and soldiers, together with 400 musicians and 200 horses, process through the streets of London from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guard\u2019s Parade, while crowds line the route. The event - one of the highlights of the royal calendar - is a tradition marking the official birthday of the British sovereign for more than 260 years. However, Charles\u2019s actual birthday is in November. Britain\u2019s Kings and Queens have doubled up on their festivities since the 18th century, holding both a public celebration \u2013 the official birthday \u2013 and a more private event on the real date. The tradition is believed to have started with the party-mad King George II in 1748. Like Charles III, George was born in November, when British weather is often far from ideal. Proving that point, the weather took a downward turn as events neared their end. Crowds waiting for the King to arrive back at the palace were lashed with heavy rain and gusts of wind. Some onlookers struggled to hold their umbrellas in place. Speaking about Kate\u2019s appearance on the balcony, David Betteridge, 66, told CNN that \u201cshe looked well so hopefully that is a good sign.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see her back actually,\u201d he added. \u201cFor the most part we stayed dry. But we got pretty wet just after the ceremony when the parade had finished. It rained very hard.\u201d Anna Yang, 30, who was visiting the UK from China on holiday, said she saw the flypast from her hotel nearby. \u201cIt was great. It\u2019s our first time, even in our own country, seeing all the national aircraft going through the sky,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIt was incredible.\u201d But anti-royalists turned out too, some of whom chanted \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cnot my king!\u201d This year\u2019s proceedings were adapted as the 75-year-old Charles continues his treatment for an unspecified form of cancer. Doctors have been encouraged by his progress, allowing him to resume public-facing duties in April, but each engagement he carries out is reviewed and adapted where appropriate. For the events on Saturday, he carried out his review of troops seated in an Ascot landau carriage alongside Queen Camilla. Three of the British Army\u2019s horses which bolted across in London in April returned to duty and took part in this weekend\u2019s birthday parade. The two remaining horses \u201care enjoying a summer holiday in the Chilterns\u201d and will return to service in due course, according to the army.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/uk/trooping-the-colour-princess-kate-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_20_asia_philippines-footage-south-china-sea-clash-china-intl-hnk", "text": "The Philippines has accused China\u2019s Coast Guard of launching a \u201cbrutal assault\u201d with bladed weapons during a South China Sea clash earlier this week, a major escalation in a festering dispute that threatens to drag the United States into another global conflict. Footage released by the Philippine military on Thursday showed Chinese coast guard officers brandishing an axe and other bladed or pointed tools at the Filipino soldiers and slashing their rubber boat, in what Manila called \u201ca brazen act of aggression.\u201d The Philippines and China have blamed each other for the confrontation near the Second Thomas Shoal in the contested\u00a0Spratly Islands on Monday, which took place during a Philippine mission to resupply its soldiers stationed on a beached World War II-era warship that asserts Manila\u2019s territorial claims over the atoll. The incident is the latest in a series of increasingly fraught confrontations\u00a0in the resource-rich and strategically important waterway. But the scenes captured in the latest footage mark an inflection point in the long-simmering tensions, with China adopting new, far more openly aggressive tactics that, analysts say, appear calculated to test how the Philippines and its key defense ally \u2013 the United States \u2013 will respond. China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims. Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore,\u00a0said it was unprecedented for China\u2019s maritime law enforcement to board a Philippine naval vessel. \u201cThey can be rubber boats, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that they are Philippine Navy vessels, and according to international law, they enjoy what we term as sovereign immunity,\u201d Koh said. \u201cThat is very dangerous, because, if anything, that could even be construed as an act of war.\u201d Boats \u2018looted\u2019 At a news conference on Wednesday, senior Philippine military officials said China\u2019s Coast Guard officers \u201cillegally boarded\u201d the Philippine rubber boats, \u201clooted\u201d seven disassembled rifles stored in gun cases, \u201cdestroyed\u201d outboard motor, communication and navigation equipment and took the personal cellphones of Filipino personnel. \u201cThey deliberately punctured our rubber boats using knives and other pointed tools,\u201d said Alfonso Torres Jr., commander of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Western Command. A Philippine Navy serviceman on the rubber boat lost his right thumb when the Chinese Coast Guard rammed it, Torres said. China\u2019s Coast Guard also deployed tear gas, \u201cblinding\u201d strobe lights and continuously blared sirens, the AFP said. \u201cOnly pirates do this. Only pirates board, steal, and destroy ships, equipment, and belongings,\u201d Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said in a statement. \u201cThe Chinese Coast Guard personnel had bladed weapons and our personnel fought with bare hands. That is what\u2019s important. We were outnumbered and their weapons were unexpected but our personnel fought with everything that they had,\u201d Brawner added. At a regular briefing with reporters on Thursday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry was asked to comment on the allegations from the Philippines that their vessels were damaged by Chinese coast guard personnel wielding blades and firing tear gas. Spokesman Lin Jian did not address those allegations, and instead reasserted Beijing\u2019s claims over the Second Thomas Shoal, known as Ren\u2019ai Jiao in China. \u201cThe Philippine operation was not for humanitarian supplies at all. The Philippine vessels carried not only construction materials but also smuggled weapons. They also intentionally rammed into Chinese vessels and splashed water and threw things on Chinese law-enforcement personnel,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThese actions have obviously aggravated tensions at sea and seriously threatened the safety of Chinese personnel and ships.\u201d Mutual defense treaty What happens in the South China Sea has profound implications for the US, which has a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines that dates back decades. The latest clash marks the first run-in between the two countries since a new law in China took effect Saturday to authorize its coast guard to seize foreign ships and detain crews suspected of trespassing for up to 60 days without trial. It also comes just weeks after Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr.\u00a0warned\u00a0that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the waterway would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war. Marcos has sought closer ties with the US, which\u00a0has repeatedly stressed Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad commitment\u201d to a 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines that stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller\u00a0said\u00a0Monday the \u201cUnited States stands with its ally the Philippines and condemns the escalatory and irresponsible actions\u201d by China. In a phone call with his Philippine counterpart Enrique A. Manalo on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China\u2019s actions, \u201cundermine regional peace and stability and underscored the United States\u2019 ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defense Treaty.\u201d Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, a US-based think tank, said the footage released by the Philippines \u201cclearly shows a Chinese attack on Philippine military assets,\u201d which according to Washington and Manila\u2019s defense pact\u00a0would trigger mutual defense commitments. \u201cHowever, in practical terms, the Philippines itself would have to initiate a move to activate (it) before the US would intervene militarily,\u201d he said. In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines\u2019 claims in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to assert historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its maritime territorial claims, with China Coast Guard ships \u2013 reinforced by militia boats \u2013 involved in multiple clashes over the past year that have damaged Philippine ships and seen\u00a0Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. Philippine \u2018restraint\u2019 The decision by China\u2019s Coast Guard to use bladed weapons in the latest South China Sea clash has drawn comparisons with clashes between China and India on their disputed Himalayan border, where soldiers on both sides have fought fiercely with sticks, rocks and their hands. The Philippine personnel on the rubber boats are elite forces hailing from the Navy Special Operations Group, Koh said. \u201cThey are trained in combat. They did not retaliate against the Chinese because they\u2019re just simply exercising restraint,\u201d he said. \u201cThey probably have received instructions right from the top that under whatever circumstance they are not supposed to fight back against the Chinese and escalate the situation.\u201d The footage released by the Philippine military also showed another striking development \u2013 that the clash took place right next to the BRP Sierra Madre, a rusting US-built Philippine Navy landing craft that was run aground deliberately in 1999, with a national flag hoisted on board, to assert Manila\u2019s territorial claims over Second Thomas Shoal. This is the closest China\u2019s Coast Guard has come to the BRP Sierra Madre, Koh noted. \u201cUnder normal rules of engagement, the garrison would have fired warning shots,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that this incident didn\u2019t escalate further is because the Philippines exercised utmost restraint. That\u2019s a simple fact.\u201d China, Koh said, was trying to test both Manila and Washington \u201cto find out exactly where the red line is.\u201d \u201cThey wanted to see how far the US is willing to pledge its security commitment to the Filipinos. And of course, I don\u2019t think Beijing is dumb enough not to have considered the possibility of having all these actions escalate the situation, but I believe that was a risk that they, in the end, decided to take.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/asia/philippines-footage-south-china-sea-clash-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

This was literally the only thing in his life that had happened, to where it changed him, and it just crushed him.\u201d On a horse farm in northern Virginia, surrounded by sprawling fields and stables, the family gathers at their younger sister Adrianne\u2019s house - something they\u2019ve done a lot in the three months since their father took his own life after falling victim to a so-called \u201cpig butchering\u201d scam. The scams \u2013 mostly run out of Southeast Asia - are given that name because they involve \u201cfattening up\u201d victims before taking everything they have. The con artists behind them take on false online identities and spend months financially grooming their victims to get them to invest on fraudulent cryptocurrency websites. Dennis Jones, an avid runner and photographer, was adored by his children and grandchildren. Described as \u201ca bit of an activist\u201d by his family, the 82-year-old spent much of his retirement working with refugees and debating politics online. But in the last few months of his life he withdrew from his family and, having been divorced for years, befriended a woman going by the name Jessie on Facebook. The two had been talking online for months and built a close relationship. Eventually, Jessie convinced Dennis to invest in crypto. Dennis complied. Without ever meeting Jessie in person, he spent everything he had, and when he had nothing left, she demanded more. Until one day the money disappeared, leaving him in ruin. In early March, Dennis\u2019 children scheduled a meeting to help their father get back on his feet after the scam. The plan was for him to move in with Adrianne and her family. \u201cWe wanted him to know that he was going to be taken care of,\u201d Matt said. But the morning of the meeting none of them could reach Dennis. Matt drove to Dennis\u2019s apartment but he wasn\u2019t home, and all calls went straight to voicemail. They figured he must be out on one of his long runs. An hour later, police knocked on Matt\u2019s door to inform him that Dennis had taken his own life. Dennis was one of countless victims of a massive global criminal operation predominantly run by Chinese gangs who have built a multibillion-dollar scam industry in Southeast Asia. There, they\u2019ve assembled an army of scammers, many held against their will in guarded compounds and forced to con people all around the world out of their life savings. It\u2019s theft at a scale so large that investigators are now calling it a mass transfer of wealth from middle-class Americans to criminal gangs. Last year, the FBI estimates, pig butchering scams stole nearly $4 billion from tens of thousands of American victims, a 53% increase from the year before. While the crime takes place online, its real-world consequences are devastating. Law enforcement sources predict that losses will continue to grow in the next year, and as the criminals remain out of reach, money and lives will continue to be lost. \u2018Victims victimizing victims\u2019 Santa Clara county prosecutor Erin West has dedicated the last few years to fighting pig butchering scams. \u201cI\u2019ve been a prosecutor for over 25 years, I\u2019ve done all kinds of different types of crime. I spent nine years in sexual assault. And I\u2019ve never seen the absolute decimation of people that I\u2019ve seen as a result of pig butchering,\u201d she says. Being in the heart of the tech industry in California\u2019s Bay Area, Erin and her team were some of the first to begin investigating pig butchering scams. \u201cWe\u2019ve got victims victimizing victims and the only winners are Chinese gangsters,\u201d she says. Shawn Bradstreet, US Secret Service special agent in charge of the San Francisco field office, told CNN that some of the money stolen from American victims is spent on expanding the scam operations and the massive compounds that house them and other illicit activities. West and Bradstreet are part of a small group of US law enforcement agencies working to find ways to tackle a crime that largely takes place online and overseas. Social media is flooded with scammers hunting for victims, on WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn and, increasingly, dating apps such as Bumble and Tinder. \u201cThe unfortunate reality is that scammers may pull on the heartstrings on those looking for love or connection - on dating apps and on all online platforms,\u201d a spokesman for Match group, which owns Tinder, said in a statement. Match, Bumble, Facebook and Whatsapp parent company Meta told CNN they are working to prevent scammers from using their platforms, by flagging suspicious language and educating their users. In a statement to CNN a Bumble spokesperson said they have introduced AI to help identify spam, scam and fake profiles \u201caiming to take action before such profiles have the opportunity to interact with members.\u201d CNN has reached out to LinkedIn for comment. In May, a group of tech companies including cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase, Meta, Match group and the anti-scam charity organization GASO announced the \u201cTech Against Scams Coalition,\u201d acknowledging that scams \u201care a pervasive issue across the entire tech landscape.\u201d But West says that\u2019s not enough. She recently set up a task force called Operation Shamrock to bring together law enforcement, social media, crypto exchanges and traditional banks to tackle crypto scams. A 2023 CNN investigation revealed that many of the scammers are themselves victims of human trafficking. Lured to Southeast Asia with promises of white-collar jobs, they are instead trafficked into Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and other destinations. Since a 2021 military coup, Myanmar has become Asia\u2019s scam capital where criminals can operate freely under the cover of a bloody civil war. Today, city-sized compounds loom over the Myanmar side of the border with Thailand, with nothing but a dried-out river separating the two countries. Inside are what can only be described as scam factories \u2014 offices full of hundreds of slaves, working 16-hour days to befriend victims and convince them to invest in cryptocurrency on fake platforms that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges. Those kept inside tell stories of torture and abuse, of scammers who don\u2019t bring in enough money being beaten with electrical sticks and forced to do hundreds of squats as punishment. Rakesh, an Indian national, was trafficked to a compound called Gate 25 in Myanmar after applying for an IT job in Thailand in late 2022. There he signed a scamming contract under threat of execution, and was trained to scam. For 11 months he posed as \u201cKlara Semonov,\u201d a Russian investor based in Salt Lake City. To avoid gruesome punishments inflicted by his captors, he said he sent romantic messages to victims like Dennis to convince them to invest their money. \u201cSeventy to 80% fall for fake love,\u201d he said. Rakesh was eventually released in 2023 when his contract ended. He believes he was let go because he simply wasn\u2019t good enough at scamming. \u201cThey (were) treating us like slaves,\u201d he told CNN days after his release in 2023. Conveniently located on the border, the compounds use telecoms services from the Thai side. In November 2023 Thai Justice Minister Tawee Sodsong said they were working to cut off the compounds. Pachara Naripthaphan of the Thai National Broadcasting Transmissions Commission has since told CNN that in May they instructed all telecom operators to shut off wireless services in proximity to any areas bordering Myanmar, Laos or Cambodia. Despite that, their data shows that illicit activity has continued at a baseline level as criminals adjust to using other means of connecting to the internet such as Starlink. Even here on the border, where the physical distance is reduced to nothing but a narrow river, the criminals remain out of the reach of law enforcement, either locally or internationally. \u201cMany of these perpetrators are beyond my reach. And in order to establish deterrence, we need to prosecute some individuals who are running these operations in Southeast Asia,\u201d Santa Clara district attorney Jeff Rosen says. According to FBI data, out of nearly $5 billion dollars lost to cryptocurrency fraud in 2023, $3.96 billion was stolen in pig butchering scams. While Rosen\u2019s office and the Secret Service have had some success in retrieving millions of dollars in stolen funds, no American law enforcement agency has been able to arrest a single suspected scammer. \u2018Hard to believe\u2019 Carina, who asked CNN to only use her first name, met \u201cEvan\u201d on Bumble in May 2023. His photos showed a blond man with piercing blue eyes. He claimed to be Dutch and showed off his wealth \u2014 expensive cars and Rolexes, though none of that appealed to Carina, a chemistry PhD and triathlete. Their relationship moved fast. Right away he suggested they move their conversation to WhatsApp and delete the Bumble app to focus on getting to know each other. A few days later he started calling her \u201choney.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re doing that already?\u201d Carina asked, in a text conversation seen by CNN. Evan claimed he had made his money running a company with his uncle and investing in crypto. He told her she could pay off her student loans in a matter of months by investing. Carina was hesitant at first but eventually agreed to put in $1,000. He told her not to use the official app of the Kraken crypto platform, and instead sent her a link to a parallel website which they used to trade in the coming months. As their investments grew, so did their relationship. The two made plans for the future, romantic weekend getaways and family introductions, though they were yet to meet in person. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you before. Hard to believe I\u2019m falling for a man I have never seen or spoken to,\u201d Carina told him just a few weeks in. The first red flag emerged when Evan pressured Carina to enter an \u201cevent\u201d where she would have to invest $150,000 by the end of July to make extra profit. If she failed to reach the target, her account and money would be frozen. Scared to lose the money she had already put in, Carina panicked. She took out a high-interest loan and borrowed money from friends and family to meet the deadline. Despite all his purported wealth, Evan refused to help her, instead lying and telling her he was struggling to meet his target of $500,000 and needed her help, she said. At one point, Carina found herself consoling her scammer, telling him the money didn\u2019t matter as long as they loved each other. \u2018Major psychological stunt\u2019 After Dennis took his life, his adult children were left piecing together what happened by going through his Facebook messages. There, they learned for the first time what Dennis had been dealing with. \u201cI have been having dark thoughts about my life and it being over. Certainly it looks like my financial life is done,\u201d Dennis messaged his scammer in the months before his death. \u201cAnd the ultimate pain here is that I have betrayed family trust. This is unbearable,\u201d he writes in screenshots of their conversation seen by CNN. \u201cWhat\u2019s most heartbreaking is reading through these messages. He was talking about having signs of a nervous breakdown. And so these were all shared with the profile,\u201d Adrianne says. \u201cInstead of sharing with us,\u201d Matt adds. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing here is that these scammers overseas have figured out a way that they can get victims to trust them over their own families,\u201d West says. \u201cIt\u2019s a major psychological stunt that they\u2019re pulling on the rest of the world.\u201d Carina didn\u2019t tell her family about what had happened and the stress she was under until the very final moment. After hitting their event targets, Carina tried to withdraw some of her money, but was unable to do so, having violated platform rules by investing in the same account as Evan. After months of hiding it, Carina told her family, who suggested she speak to Kraken directly. The next morning she called Kraken customer services, who informed her there was no account under her name.  \u201cI realized I had been scammed at that point. And I broke down,\u201d Carina says. \u201cIt was all fake. It was a fake profile. It was a fake story. The amount of time that he spent grooming and getting to know me was incessant.\u201d Reading through their conversations a year later, Carina barely recognizes herself. \u201cIt\u2019s actually heartbreaking for me to see the state that I was in,\u201d she says. The emotional and financial entanglement had taken a toll on her, and she was left reeling from a breakup and bankruptcy at the same time. In the aftermath, Carina had to move back in with her mother. It will take her at least a decade to repay her debts. \u2018Playing on emotions\u2019 Their grief still raw, Adrianne and Matt are only now starting to understand what happened to their father. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t up against one person. It\u2019s a multibillion-dollar criminal organization with a playbook that\u2019s playing on the emotions \u2026 It was almost like he was brainwashed to some extent,\u201d Dennis\u2019 daughter Adrianne says. As the criminals\u2019 tactics continue to evolve and law enforcement struggles to find a way to stop them, there will be more victims in 2024, and more people like Matt and Adrianne, who suffer a loss far greater than money. \u201cHe died embarrassed, ashamed, financially devastated, heartbroken. And if sharing our story helps somebody else or another family, then it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Adrianne says.

The motto is a near-exact copy of the slogan adopted by former US President Donald Trump, who has previously heaped praise on Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Trump\u00a0hosted the Hungarian strongman at Mar-a-Lago\u00a0in March, and seemed to reference the pair staying in contact after he left White House in 2021, saying they \u201ckept in touch.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that\u2019s better, smarter or a better leader than Viktor Orb\u00e1n.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_style_mysterious-monolith-las-vegas-nevada-intl-hnk", "text": "Another \u201cmysterious\u201d monolith has been spotted. This time, on a Las Vegas hiking trail in Nevada, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD). \u201cWe see a lot of weird things when people go hiking like not being prepared for the weather, not bringing enough water \u2026 but check this out,\u201d the department wrote in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0on Tuesday showing images of a mirrored structure. \u201cHow did it get up there?\u201d The monolith was found over the weekend near Gass Peak north of Las Vegas, it added. The LVMPD did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. The pillar is reminiscent to ones popping up all over the world shortly after a 10-feet silver monolith was discovered in late 2020 by a helicopter crew flying over an Utah desert. Similar structures appeared on a\u00a0California mountaintop,\u00a0a forest in Romania,\u00a0and the\u00a0Isle of Wight\u00a0off England\u2019s south coast, to name a few. Sightings have largely slowed down since 2021, but this March, local builder Craig Muir in Powys County, Wales stumbled on one during a walk up a hill. He told the BBC that it seemed to be carefully planted. \u201cThere were no obvious tracks around it and one would think that something like that would cause a lot of mess,\u201d he said. As for the one found on the Las Vegas hiking trail, social media users claimed the monolith isn\u2019t actually new. \u201cAnyone who lives on the west side sees this weekly,\u201d read one comment under the LVMPD\u2019s Facebook post. \u201cYes! Been seeing this for years,\u201d wrote another in a reply, amid posts joking about aliens, pranks and that it could be a portal to other dimensions. \u201cObelisks have unknown power and purpose. I think it\u2019s man made but aliens are still among us. Keep your eyes open and cameras ready,\u201d wrote one user. Others assumed it was a work of art, something that\u2019s been speculated about previous monoliths. Gallerist David Zwirner in 2020 made the argument that the monolith in Utah was the work of the late minimalist sculptor John McCracken, and that it was somehow installed after his death in 2011. He later retracted the theory saying, \u201cWhen you look closely at the photos \u2026 you will see rivets and screws that are not consistent with how John wanted his work to be constructed. He was a perfectionist.\u201d Meanwhile, designer Tom Dunford claimed to the BBC in December 2020 that he\u00a0erected the monolith on the Isle of Wight, \u201cpurely for fun.\u201d \u201cWhen I saw the first one pop up (in Utah) I thought it was brilliant, the second one popped up and I had a text from a friend which said \u2018you\u2019re the man that can do this on the island,\u2019\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely fascinated in futuristic design, science and space. The actual idea sparked when I was walking back to the office and we had an old sheet of mirrored perspex.\u201d In Nevada, Las Vegas police used the opportunity to remind hikers heading out on the trails to be safe out there \u2014 bring plenty of food and water, a first aid kit, a light source, check the weather and tell people where you intend to go and when you expect to return. The LVMPD said it would leave internet sleuths to get \u201cto work on this mystery.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/style/mysterious-monolith-las-vegas-nevada-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_middleeast_hajj-deaths-mecca-extreme-heat-intl-latam", "text": "More than 300\u00a0people\u00a0have died and thousands have been treated for heatstroke while performing the annual Muslim Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca amid extreme temperatures of up to 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit). At least 165 Indonesians, 68 Jordanians, 35 Pakistanis, 35 Tunisians and 11 Iranians have died, according to authorities in each country. A further 22 Jordanians are hospitalized and 16 are still missing, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said. Dozens of Iranians have also been hospitalized due to heatstroke and other conditions, the Iranian Red Crescent said Wednesday, according to Iran\u2019s semi-official Tasnim news agency. The death toll is likely to rise, as Saudi Arabia and Egypt have yet to release official figures. Additionally, the governments are only aware of pilgrims who have registered and traveled to Mecca as part of their country\u2019s quota \u2013 more deaths are feared among unregistered pilgrims. The Saudi government said on Monday that more than 2,700 people had been treated for heatstroke. Meanwhile, hundreds of people have taken to social media to post about their loved ones being unaccounted for. More than\u00a01.8 million people\u00a0are taking part in this year\u2019s Hajj, one of the world\u2019s largest religious gatherings, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. While deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year\u2019s gathering is being held amid particularly high temperatures. Hajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom. On Monday, Saudi Arabia advised pilgrims against performing the \u201cstoning of the devil\u201d ritual between certain hours after temperatures reached an extreme 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit). Hajj officials have asked pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated amid the harsh conditions while the Saudi army has deployed more than 1,600 personnel with medical units specifically for heatstroke and 30 rapid response teams. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers are taking part. Performing Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life. The pilgrimage includes numerous detailed rituals including wearing a special garment that symbolizes human equality and unity before God, a circular, counter-clockwise procession around the cube-shaped Kaaba building, and the symbolic stoning of evil. A source of prestige and revenue The Hajj is a source of prestige for Saudi Arabia\u2019s king, who holds the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques as the guardian of Islam\u2019s holiest sites. But the pilgrimage is also a significant source of revenue for the Saudi economy. Soon after\u00a0King Salman bin Abdulaziz\u00a0took power in 2015, Saudi Arabia launched a\u00a0$21 billion project\u00a0to expand the Grand Mosque in Mecca to accommodate 300,000 additional worshippers. A year later, then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman identified the pilgrimage as a key component of a plan to\u00a0diversify the Saudi economy\u00a0by 2030. Experts say that with oil sales generating close to a billion dollars a day for the kingdom, the pilgrimage\u2019s economic benefit is marginal by comparison. But its great, untapped potential could bring significant riches to the kingdom in the long term. Pilgrimage revenues were forecast to average about\u00a0$30 billion a year\u00a0and create 100,000 jobs for Saudis when the kingdom attracted around 21 million worshippers annually during the 10-day Hajj as well as the yearlong Umrah pilgrimage, according to official data cited by Reuters.

{"id": "2024_06_18_world_nuclear-arsenals-strengthen-intl-latam", "text": "Nuclear-armed countries are strengthening their arsenals and several have made ready new nuclear-armed or nuclear-capable weapons systems amid rising geopolitical tensions, a new report has found. The nine nuclear states \u2013 the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel \u2013 have continued to modernize their weapons stockpiles, with China, for the first time, possibly deploying \u201ca small number of warheads on missiles during peacetime,\u201d the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)\u00a0said in a new report\u00a0published Monday. \u201cWhile the global total of nuclear warheads continues to fall as Cold War-era weapons are gradually dismantled, regrettably we continue to see year-on-year increases in the number of operational nuclear warheads,\u201d the institute\u2019s director Dan Smith said. \u201cThis trend seems likely to continue and probably accelerate in the coming years and is extremely concerning.\u201d In January 2024, the total global stockpile of warheads was estimated at 12,121, of which about 9,585 were in military stockpiles for potential use, according to SIPRI. The think tank estimates that 3,904 of those warheads were deployed with missiles and aircraft, or 60 more warheads than in January 2023. The majority of the deployed warheads, about 2,100, were kept \u201cin a state of high operational alert on ballistic missiles,\u201d SIPRI said. While nearly all of those warheads belonged to the US and Russia, for the first time China is also believed to have some warheads on high operational alert. Russia and the US together own nearly 90 percent of all nuclear weapons and the number of useable warheads they possessed in 2023 remained stable for the most part, according to the Swedish think tank. However, Russia is estimated to have deployed about 36 more warheads with operational forces than in January 2023. \u201cTransparency regarding nuclear forces has declined in both countries in the wake of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and debates around nuclear-sharing arrangements have increased in saliency,\u201d the Swedish think tank said. Russia and the US also possess more than 1,200 warheads each that have been previously retired from military service, and are gradually being dismantled, it said. The institute said despite \u201cpublic claims made in 2023\u201d that Russia had deployed nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory, \u201cthere is no conclusive visual evidence that the actual deployment of warheads has taken place.\u201d The size of China\u2019s nuclear arsenal is estimated to have increased from 410 warheads in January 2023 to 500 in January 2024, \u201cand it is expected to keep growing,\u201d according to SIPRI. \u201cChina is expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than any other country,\u201d said Hans M. Kristensen, associate senior fellow with SIPRI\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction Program. \u201cBut in nearly all of the nuclear-armed states there are either plans or a significant push to increase nuclear forces.\u201d China could potentially have as many intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) as Russia or the US by the end of the decade, but Beijing\u2019s stockpile of nuclear warheads is expected to remain much smaller compared to their stockpiles. North Korea\u2019s military nuclear program continues to be \u201ca central element of its national security strategy,\u201d and SIPRI estimates the hermit kingdom possesses about 50 warheads and enough fissile material to reach up to 90 warheads, numbers that represent \u201csignificant increases over the estimates for January 2023.\u201d In 2023, North Korea appeared to have carried out its first test of a short-range ballistic missile from a rudimentary silo and completed the development of at least two types of land-attack cruise missile (LACM) designed to deliver nuclear weapons, according to SIPRI. \u201cLike several other nuclear-armed states, North Korea is putting new emphasis on developing its arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons,\u201d said Matt Korda, Associate Researcher with SIPRI\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction Program. \u201cAccordingly, there is a growing concern that North Korea might intend to use these weapons very early in a conflict.\u201d Wars weaken diplomacy The Swedish think tank said the wars in Ukraine and Gaza have further weakened nuclear diplomacy on the global stage. In 2023 Russia suspended participation in the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (New START), the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty limiting Russian and US strategic nuclear forces, while in response the US also stopped sharing data. Moscow has continued to make threats involving the use of nuclear weapons in light of Western aid for Ukraine, and in May 2024 carried out tactical nuclear weapons drills close to the Ukrainian border, SIPRI said. \u201cWe have not seen nuclear weapons playing such a prominent role in international relations since the Cold War,\u201d said Wilfred Wan, the director of SIPRI\u2019s Weapons of Mass Destruction Program. \u201cIt is hard to believe that barely two years have passed since the leaders of the five largest nuclear-armed states jointly reaffirmed that \u2018a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought\u2019,\u201d he said. Furthermore, an agreement between Iran and the US in June 2023 \u201cseemed to temporarily de-escalate tensions between the two countries,\u201d but the start of the Israel\u2013Hamas war in October \u201cupended the agreement, with proxy attacks by Iran-backed groups on US forces in Iraq and Syria apparently ending Iranian\u2013US diplomatic efforts,\u201d SIPRI said. The Israel\u2013Hamas war also \u201cundermined efforts\u201d to engage Israel in the Conference on the Establishment of a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction, the think tank said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/world/nuclear-arsenals-strengthen-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_onboard-the-russian-warship-visiting-cuba", "text": "In twelve years of living in Cuba, I have waited in all kinds of lines. Lines to buy food, lines to pay bills, lines just because people were lining up for something maybe worth lining up for. But now I was in a line for something unexpected:\u00a0to\u00a0board\u00a0a Russian warship docked in Havana\u2019s harbor. When a Russian diplomat told me that starting on Thursday, the Admiral Gorshkov frigate would offer tours to the public for three days, I was somewhat skeptical. The Gorshkov is one of the most modern vessels in the Russian fleet, capable of firing hypersonic missiles that travel at more than 6,000 miles per hour. I had trouble imagining that\u00a0President Vladimir\u00a0Putin\u2019s prized\u00a0ship would be opened for anyone to see. When the Gorshkov arrived in Cuba\u00a0on Wednesday, it fired a deafening\u00a021-shot\u00a0salute.\u00a0The\u00a0Cubans answered with cannon fire from an 18th\u00a0century fortress overlooking the harbor that the Spanish had built to protect the city from pirates. With the frigate came a rescue tug, a fuel ship and the Kazan, an imposing nuclear-powered submarine. Cuba\u2019s Ministry of Defense said that none of the ships were carrying nuclear weapons and that they did not represent \u201ca threat to the region,\u201d clearly meaning the US, Cuba\u2019s neighbor 90 miles to the\u00a0north. But for many Cubans, the visit of the largest convoy of ships in years from their old Cold War ally seemed like a return to the past, particularly as Moscow and Washington increasingly spar over the war in Ukraine. \u201cI never thought I would see a Russian submarine so up close,\u201d said a Cuban man next to me as we waited in line in view of the four\u00a0vessels. We were standing outside the port terminal in Havana which,\u00a0just years earlier,\u00a0had been full\u00a0of\u00a0US cruise ships, until then-President Donald Trump banned their visits to the island\u00a0in 2019. Even though a line had formed, it was not clear if any of us waiting there were going to get aboard. An hour passed in the broiling Cuban sun. \u201cWe are roasting out here,\u201d a woman carrying a small baby next to me said. Cubans are champion line-waiters and I worried that I would have nothing to show for my interlude outside the port other than a worsening sunburn. Finally, a Cuban Navy official in a sparkling white uniform came out to speak to us, resting his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou can go aboard but need to leave any sharp objects like knives, scissors or hair clippers behind,\u201d he said. Two plainclothes\u00a0state\u00a0security officers began to run everyone\u2019s\u00a0identity card numbers through a database on their phones. I handed my\u00a0carn\u00e9,\u00a0or\u00a0ID card,\u00a0that lists my birthplace in the US to one of the officers who appeared too young to shave. He looked at my\u00a0carn\u00e9\u00a0and turned to his older colleague for advice. \u201cAre we letting foreign residents on board?\u201d\u00a0he asked. The older officer,\u00a0who was wearing a New York Yankee\u2019s baseball cap,\u00a0nodded and then ran my card information through the database. \u201cYou can go ahead,\u201d he said. Inside the port, past officials manning a metal detector, Russian sailors in dark blue unforms waited to take a group of about\u00a020\u00a0of us aboard the Gorshkov. In front of the ship, the sailors had posted a sign in English that declared the Gorshkov\u2019s \u201cmain purpose\u201d was \u201ccombat operations against enemy surface ships and submarines.\u201d The Russian sailors spoke more English than Spanish and I occasionally translated to help the other members of our group, who were\u00a0all\u00a0Cuban. We were told we could film and everyone immediately took out their smartphones to snap videos and selfies. We started out on the ship\u2019s massive helicopter pad and then walked through the ship to the bow. Every few feet a Russian sailor stood keeping watch. At the front of the ship, one of the sailors\u00a0showed me an anti-rocket system\u00a0to be used\u00a0in the unlikely event we came under attack. I asked about the massive cannon and the sailor replied that it could fire shells a distance of 23 kilometers,\u00a0or about 15 miles. A level up, where there appeared to be sensitive communications equipment, a Russian soldier in tactical gear with an assault rifle at his side looked down at us. Just off the bow we could see an unobstructed view of the Kazan, the 430-foot long submarine that stretched out into the harbor. I noticed one of the Russian sailors taking in the blue skies and calm waters around us. \u201cCuba good?\u201d I ask him. \u201cCuba good,\u201d he laughs in reply and gives me a thumbs up. The war in Ukraine has\u00a0severely\u00a0degraded the Russian fleet and once again pitted the US and Russia on opposite sides of a bloody conflict. For a Russian sailor, Cuba could be as good as it gets these days. I disembarked the Russian warship in Havana feeling that the Cold War did not seem like such a distant memory, when I saw an alert flash across my phone. It was an announcement that the Pentagon had just dispatched its own nuclear powered attack submarine\u00a0to the other side of the island:\u00a0the US Navy Base in Guantanamo\u00a0Bay,\u00a0Cuba, slightly more than 500 miles away from the where the Russian ships are docked.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/americas/onboard-the-russian-warship-visiting-cuba/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-arrests", "text": "Turks and Caicos is revising part of its firearms law that recently caused legal trouble for several Americans carrying ammunition into the British Overseas Territory, House of Assembly member Edwin Astwood said in a statement\u00a0Friday. The revision comes weeks after a bipartisan US congressional delegation traveled to the islands asking for charges to be dropped for five Americans whom they said \u201cinadvertently\u201d had ammunition in their luggage. It is a crime to bring firearms or ammunition into the territory without prior permission from police. The amendment passed by the House of Assembly on June 14 clarifies that in sentencing for firearms-related offenses, courts have the discretion to impose either a fine, a custodial sentence, or a mixture of both in exceptional circumstances, the statement read. Previously, the law mandated courts to impose both a fine and a prison sentence of 12 years, although it allowed reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d \u201cThe amendment was introduced to address concerns about the rigidity of the previous sentencing framework, which mandated both imprisonment and financial penalties for all firearms offenses, regardless of the specific context or severity. This often resulted in disproportionately harsh sentences that did not always fit the nature of the crime or the circumstances of the offender,\u201d Astwood said. The mandatory minimum has not changed from 12 years, according to Sheena C. Mair, a lawyer for Sharitta Shinese Grier, an American awaiting trial.\u00a0The only change is if the court finds exceptional circumstances allowing the departure from the mandatory minimum of 12 years, they can impose a custodial sentence or a fine or both. Bryan Hagerich, one of the five Americans\u00a0arrested\u00a0for carrying ammunition, is\u00a0back\u00a0in the\u00a0United States\u00a0after receiving a suspended 52-week sentence and a $6,700 fine.\u00a0Hagerich\u00a0was allowed to leave the\u00a0territory\u00a0and return to the US once he paid the fine, his attorney Oliver Smith said. Tyler Wenrich\u00a0previously pleaded guilty to similar charges and\u00a0was sentenced to time served\u00a0and issued a $9,000 fine, according to court records. Ryan\u00a0Tyler\u00a0Watson, another American awaiting his fate after being charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition,\u00a0is expected to be sentenced Friday, a little\u00a0under a month\u00a0after he pleaded guilty. Michael Lee Evans, a Texan in his 70s, who pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9mm rounds of ammunition,\u00a0was scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday \u2013 though it is unclear based on court records if the sentencing happened. CNN has reached out to his attorney for more information. Grier, a Florida mother, said she had no idea that two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. She was released on bail but can\u2019t leave the island until her case concludes and must report to a local police station weekly,\u00a0WFTV\u00a0reported. Grier is expected to appear in court to plead guilty on June 25, her lawyer said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/americas/turks-and-caicos-ammunition-arrests/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_tech_apple-openai-partnership", "text": "When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attended Apple\u2019s annual developer conference this week, he walked the campus, mingling with current and former executives, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Nearly an hour later, the iPhone maker announced a much-rumored partnership with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT technology to devices later this year. But Altman, who has emerged as the poster child for generative AI in the 18 months since the launch of ChatGPT, was not featured in Apple\u2019s formal presentation, neither in person or via livestream. Nor did he join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives in a private press event about privacy and security and the partnership between the two companies. \u201cI was not surprised Sam Altman did not appear on stage,\u201d said Ben Wood, an analyst at market research firm CCS Insight in an interview with CNN. \u201cApple had to manage the message carefully. OpenAI is merely the vehicle to address broader AI-powered inquiries that are not core to the Apple experience. Having him in the livestream would have only created an unnecessary level of confusion.\u201d Earlier this week, Apple showed off a handful of AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall \u2013 the majority of which are fueled by the company\u2019s own proprietary technology, called Apple Intelligence. The company will offer OpenAI\u2019s viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity, usually only when Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry. The move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continues to face concerns from researchers, industry experts and government officials around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more. The deal also comes at a time when the industry is moving quickly, and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to engage with the technology responsibly. Apple hopes that a big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales as the device has languished without a major upgrade for years and users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices as a result. An uncertain economic environment is also weighing on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was recently passed by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. In the 60 hours after Apple\u2019s Monday event, however, the company\u2019s stock price (AAPL) rose by as much as 10%, boosting Apple\u2019s market capitalization by more than $300 billion, rocketing past Nvidia and putting Apple back in contention with Microsoft for largest market value. The timing is further noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the latest buzzy technology. \u201cApple needed to deliver an AI story and Apple Intelligence should help placate nervous investors and reassure them that Apple is keeping pace with its rivals,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe partnership with ChatGPT is a major development which beefs up Apple\u2019s AI offerings, and new features like a significantly improved Siri will be welcome to users.\u201d But the partnership could also open Apple up to some vulnerability, as it has no control over OpenAI\u2019s models or what it does with user inputs. Apple alignment with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could also cause some challenges down the road. A limited partnership Although Apple has been working on its own AI program for years, a partnership with OpenAI marks a way for it to fill in the competitive gaps. When a user has a question beyond Siri\u2019s scope, ChatGPT can step in. In the demo following the keynote, Apple showed CNN how someone could upload a picture of vegetables at a farmer\u2019s market and ask what they could make for dinner. Siri may suggest that the question is better suited for ChatGPT, and provide the user with a prompt to give consent to use the service. Apple using ChatGPT as a complimentary service could potentially cut down on risks associated with the company. It\u2019s also very possible Apple could partner with other AI companies in the future too, such as Google\u2019s Gemini or more niche providers with certain expertise, such as in healthcare. \u201cI think Apple will take a pragmatic approach to the OpenAI partnership,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf Apple finds that the relationship with OpenAI starts to affect the overall user experience or worse, create challenges around security and data integrity, it might look to add further guardrails, or find other ways to deliver AI-powered content.\u201d A focus on privacy and security Apple has been vocal about how it intends to keep user data private and secure when using its own proprietary technology, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone and inputs will be kept away from a far-off server cloud. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up,\u201d he added. Apple said it will not share any personal user information with OpenAI, so inquiries made through ChatGPT won\u2019t be linked to an Apple user\u2019s account. And the repeated consent prompt to require users to opt into using ChatGPT with Siri is noteworthy too; each time Siri wants to kick over a question to ChatGPT, it\u2019ll ask for permission first. Wood believes the consent prompts and other guardrails that Apple is implementing \u201creflect its nervousness.\u201d Meanwhile, Reece Hayden, a principal analyst at ABI Research, told CNN that Apple\u2019s approach is smart because it provides customers with a choice of how to deal with their data. \u201cBy providing a phased approach that blends ChatGPT and native capabilities, users will worry less about the partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cApple can also continue to highlight their own AI capabilities and mitigate some of the risks of being associated with OpenAI, which remains in a state of flux.\u201d Industry concerns Companies like OpenAI have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but many experts, researchers and AI employees believe they should be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures. Just last week, a group of OpenAI insiders demanded that artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about the concerns over the technology they\u2019re building. So it came as no surprise when some industry watchers, including Elon Musk, were quick to react to Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI. In a post to X Monday, Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies \u2014 which include Tesla, SpaceX and X, among others \u2014 if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans. If Apple \u201cintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,\u201d Musk said that would constitute \u201can unacceptable security violation.\u201d Although concerns over how employees are using AI models is a topic of worldwide discussion at the moment across many industries, Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said Musk\u2019s reaction is a bit misdirected and the topic is not specific to iPhones. \u201cAny employee with a smartphone should follow company policies and not enter any private information into the open domain of ChatGPT,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not specific to the iPhone \u2026 or Tesla.\u201d Andrew Cornwall, senior analyst at Forrester, told CNN he thinks it\u2019s unlikely that Apple users will become loyal to ChatGPT, as many people won\u2019t use the service unless the iPhone maker can\u2019t provide an appropriate response. \u201cWhen users do query ChatGPT, Apple will track the prompts and gather metrics to improve its own models,\u201d he said. \u201cApple may switch providers or even use more than one third party \u2014 until it has mastered its own model. At that point, Apple will shut the garden gate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/tech/apple-openai-partnership/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

Jailed for most of the past two decades, Mohammadi was sentenced to a further stretch in prison by authorities who found her guilty of carrying out \u201cpropaganda activities against the regime,\u201d Mostafa Nili, her lawyer, announced on social media. According to Nili, the Iranian regime cited statements Mohammadi made concerning Iranian student and journalist Dina Ghalibaf, who was arrested in April after she publicly claimed to have been sexually assaulted by members of Iran\u2019s morality police. The authorities also cited a letter Mohammadi wrote calling on Iranians to boycott parliamentary elections back in February and the activist\u2019s correspondence with Swedish and Norwegian parliaments. In the past three years, Mohammadi has undergone six trials in revolutionary and criminal courts, resulting\u00a0in a total sentence of 13 years and three months in prison, 154 lashes, exile, and four months of street cleaning, Nili said. Her sentence was most recently extended in January, when she was handed an additional 15 months in prison after being charged with \u201cspreading propaganda\u201d against the Islamic Republic regime, her family said. But incarceration has not impeded Mohammadi\u2019s activism: The 52-year-old recently published a letter calling for an end to the war in Gaza. In the letter, Mohammadi condemned an Israeli strike on a refugee camp in Rafah that killed over 45 Palestinians.

{"id": "2024_06_20_middleeast_israel-gaza-intelligence-accountability-analysis-intl-cmd", "text": "The anger across the streets of Israel has reached a new crescendo, with tens of thousands joining protests billed as a \u201cweek of disruption.\u201d Anti-government demonstrators have blocked major highways, staged walkouts, and called for a general strike. The protesters have not one but several demands: a hostage deal, new elections, military conscription for ultra-Orthodox Jews, more attention to residents of the north and more. Across Israel, signs on buildings and highways call for \u201cElections Now!\u201d and declare alongside pictures of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, \u201cYou are the leader; you are to blame.\u201d But underneath them all lies\u00a0one question which continues to echo across Israel eight months after October 7: How could the most advanced military in the region,\u00a0with its vaunted intelligence apparatus,\u00a0have failed so completely in foreseeing the Hamas terror attack? Calls for a state commission of inquiry into the security and intelligence failures that led to October 7 have grown continually louder, with the Israeli public, opposition lawmakers, the parents of slain and captive Israel Defense Forces (IDF) field observers, and the attorney general demanding an investigation into the deadliest single event in the country\u2019s history. Analysts say it\u2019s not likely to happen under Netanyahu,\u00a0however. And if it does, it may not yield the answers for which the country is searching, even as more reports come out about\u00a0what Israel knew in advance. On Monday, Israel\u2019s public broadcaster, Kan 11, added\u00a0to the growing mountain of evidence that the country\u2019s leadership could have\u00a0\u2013\u00a0or, at the very least, should have\u00a0\u2013\u00a0known an attack was possible. Kan 11 detailed a document from Unit 8200, the IDF\u2019s premier intelligence gathering division, about Hamas\u2019 plans to attack military facilities and communities, and to take between 200 and 250 hostages. The document was dated September 19, 2023, less than three weeks before the October 7 attack. It was especially startling in its accuracy on one particular point: Hamas took 250 hostages. The latest allegations add weight to reports in November from the New York Times and Haaretz newspapers that military intelligence had information\u00a0about Hamas plans to overwhelm Israel\u2019s fortifications around Gaza, allowing\u00a0militants to stream into southern Israel. In December, State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman announced he would open an investigation into intelligence failures before the October 7 Hamas attack. Months later, struggling to get cooperation from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and the Israeli military, Englman wrote in a letter to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and the IDF chief of staff that his duty was \u201cto carry out a comprehensive audit of the greatest failure in the country\u2019s history.\u201d But this week, Israel\u2019s High Court put the investigation on hold after reviewing classified arguments from security agencies \u2013 prompting an exasperated Englman to ask if his teams should \u201cput a up a sign \u2018we\u2019re on a break, will be back in two years\u2019?\u201d Separately, the IDF launched a series of internal investigations earlier this year into the failures leading up to October 7, followed by more limited examinations of individual battles on the day of the attacks. These probes would allow Israel to learn from its failures, even in an ongoing war. The first results are expected to be published in the coming weeks. What\u2019s missing is Israel\u2019s most powerful investigative\u00a0tool\u00a0- a state commission of inquiry - stymied by Netanyahu and his allies, who have tried to delay it until after the war. A state commission of inquiry is an independent body with broad powers, including the ability to compel witnesses to testify. But the primary means of launching such a commission is a government decision, and this government has made clear it\u2019s not anywhere on their\u00a0current\u00a0agenda.\u00a0 Raanan Sulitzeanu-Kenan, a professor of public policy at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, says\u00a0\u201cthe likelihood of an inquiry is very, very low.\u201d \u201cOver 17 years of Netanyahu governments, we had zero number of inquiries,\u201d Sulitzeanu-Kenan says. Historically, Israel has had a public inquiry roughly every two years, he says, but not under its present and longest-serving leader. The purchase of German submarines and surface vessels sparked an inquiry in 2022, but only during Netanyahu\u2019s 18-month spell out of office. \u201cAlthough it is very clear that one should be appointed, the political likelihood is almost zero under the current government,\u201d says Sulitzeanu-Kenan. \u201cOnce you appoint a public inquiry, you send at least an implicit message that something wrong has happened.\u201d In June, Israel\u2019s attorney general said that a commission of inquiry was the \u201cmost appropriate legal means\u201d to investigate the circumstances leading up to the October 7 attack. According to Gali Baharav-Miara, the inquiry could also supersede investigations from \u201cinternational tribunals,\u201d a reference to the International Court of Justice, which is probing Israel for potential war crimes committed during its war in Gaza. But Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet secretary responded that the country was \u201cin the midst of an intense war.\u201d \u201cThe time is not yet ripe to investigate all the events of the war and what preceded it,\u201d wrote Yossi Fuchs in response to Baharav-Miara. State commissions of inquiry can also take a tremendous amount of time, especially if there are questions of systemic failure mixed with issues of personal responsibility, said Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem-based think tank. \u201cWhen you intertwine all (of) them together, you probably might end up with nothing,\u201d Plesner said. The most likely means of understanding the failures of October 7 was by dissecting it into smaller and more manageable issues, he said, like separating intelligence failures from those of operational doctrine. \u201cGiven the complexity of the situation, the political interests involved, and the age of polarization that we live in, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re ever going to have one recognized answer to this question,\u201d said Plesner. Netanyahu told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash in November he would answer \u201call the questions that are required\u201d and \u201cthis whole question will be addressed after the war.\u201d His position has hardly shifted since, marked by\u00a0the denial of\u00a0any responsibility for the failures of October 7. The\u00a0refusal\u00a0of Israel\u2019s self-styled \u201cMr. Security\u201d to take the blame stands in stark contrast to the IDF, where senior officers have resigned over the failure to stop the worst terror attack in the country\u2019s history. Major General Aharon Haliva, who was the commander of the IDF\u2019s military intelligence, quietly announced in April that he would be stepping down. In the days after October 7, he admitted there was an \u201cintelligence failure\u201d in not detecting plans for the attack. Haliva became the first top official to\u00a0accept\u00a0responsibility\u00a0for shortcomings, but not the last. In June, the head of the IDF\u2019s Gaza division, Brig. Gen. Avi Rosenfeld, also said he would resign. In a public letter, he said: \u201cEveryone has to take responsibility for their part.\u201d It is widely expected that other senior military officials will also step down on the conclusion of the IDF\u2019s campaign in Gaza. Former IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot, a member of Israel\u2019s war cabinet until his resignation\u00a0earlier this month, said everyone in a position of leadership needed to step down, including those in \u201c(the IDF\u2019s) Southern Command, the Military Intelligence Directorate, the IDF Chief of Staff, the head of the Shin Bet, the Defense Minister, the Prime Minister.\u201d Eisenkot told Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news: \u201cThe failure is so great that none of them can stay in office.\u201d But with no clear end in sight to the war, that accountability is likely to be a long time coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-intelligence-accountability-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_19_style_ro-kwon-exhibit-novel-queer-stories", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Queer love, BDSM sex, identity crises and religious trauma \u2014 they\u2019re not the topics Korean American author R. O. Kwon was raised with; nor are they likely the subjects her family wishes she would write about, she noted wryly. But as she grew into (some of) them, so did they grow into her work: In two novels \u2014 and \u201cKink,\u201d an anthology she co-edited with her fellow author Garth Greenwell \u2014 the Seoul-born, San Francisco-based author has infused her books\u2019 characters and narratives with these themes, in many cases drawn from her own life. Kwon is the first to admit that anxiety relating to the process of writing and self-inquiry plagues her, but such deliberation has not extended to self-censorship in her sexually charged, adventurous protagonists, who are often stuck between the life they think they should live and the life they could. \u201cI have had to learn how to manage my profound anxiety writing \u2014 or, in some cases, not manage very well,\u201d she told CNN in a video interview. \u201cParticularly, the anxiety I feel around writing a book that has so much to do with physical longing. As a Korean woman and as an ex-Catholic\u2026 it feels very dangerous to my body to give any hint in public that I\u2019ve ever had sex. I kept having to walk toward what I was afraid of writing, and to write it.\u201d In \u201cExhibit,\u201d a literary labor of some 9 years, Kwon\u2019s character Jin Han quickly becomes besotted with the mysterious ballerina Lidija, after a chance meeting at a party she\u2019d been attending with her husband, Phillip. In Lidija, Jin finds a twin spirit \u2014 rebellious, artistic and reckless \u2014 and the two begin a sexual, sensory relationship amid struggles in Jin\u2019s marriage. (Phillip has been pressuring Jin to start a family, despite their once mutual desire to remain childless.) \u201cThe book explores what you risk to explore your core desires,\u201d said Kwon. \u201c\u2018Exhibit\u2019 is very interested in varieties of desires \u2014 ambition, the desire to belong, food\u00a0 and sex.\u201d Indulging such desires is the antithesis of the puritanical beliefs inherent in Kwon\u2019s religious upbringing, she explained; the female protagonists in both \u201cExhibit\u201d and her debut novel, \u201cThe Incendiaries,\u201d are likewise plagued with guilt, shame and anxiety over their bodily cravings. Her own loss of faith was like a bankruptcy, Kwon remembered. \u201cI don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve recovered, and I don\u2019t expect to recover,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve come to understand that for some people, there are kinds of grief that don\u2019t ever really end. I think, maybe, I will grieve God with intensity for the rest of my life\u2026 The grief is what I have left of the love I had.\u201d The incisive mining of these inner conflicts and identity crises \u2014 how to exist in a society that expects you to be a God-fearing, family-oriented woman, when such labels no longer apply \u2014 is a throughline fearlessly explored by Kwon across her novels, journalistic work and in her personal life. Kwon is married to her first boyfriend, a man she met in college, and admits many readers will (wrongly) assume that, in \u201cExhibit,\u201d Jin and Phillip are thinly-veiled representations of Kwon and her husband \u2014 who, rather, enjoy a monogamous relationship she describes as \u201cvery loving.\u201d \u201cThe book centers a queer Korean American artist, which I am,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cPeople in my life might think I\u2019ve had an affair with a queer Korean American ballerina. My friend joked that, \u2018Who wouldn\u2019t want to have an affair with a glamorous ballerina?\u2019\u201d Kwon\u2019s own queer sexuality blossomed late. She came out as bisexual to her closest friends, and later on social media, in 2018. In an essay she shared on the subject a year later, she wrote that, \u201cIn part because of my upbringing, it took until years after college for me to understand who and what I\u2019m drawn to, and that my attraction to some people \u2014 including women \u2014 can go beyond the limits of platonic connection.\u201d \u201cI only started talking about being queer in 2018, after \u2018The Incendiaries\u2019 came out,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t know anyone who was queer and \u2018out,\u2019 not until I went to college. So, it took a while for me to understand this \u2014 and that\u2019s quite common for people who grow up in Korean American families and communities. Queerness was largely seen as an exotic blight that affects other people.\u201d Tongue-in-cheek, Kwon said she rates her parents\u2019 response to her public outness as a B+. \u201cFor Korean Catholic immigrants, it wasn\u2019t the ideal response, but better than it could have been.\u201d \u201cThere aren\u2019t many Korean American writers who are queer in public,\u201d she continued. \u201cI thought I could add to this number, and that maybe I should if I could. Nobody should ever feel any pressure to be out, but I live in San Francisco and most of my friends are writers and artists. There\u2019s an abundance of queerness in my communities.\u201d Coming out as queer, then, and writing sexually-fuelled, kinky fiction, are Kwon\u2019s means of giving permission and validation to women, like herself, who haven\u2019t seen themselves represented in their communities, nor in art or media. \u201cI wanted to show a world of queer abundance, in which people being queer just is,\u201d said Kwon of \u201cExhibit,\u201d adding that she is writing primarily\u00a0for those who are prepared to hear her, engage with her and recognize themselves \u2014 or the possibility of themselves \u2014 in her work. \u201cEven though we are surrounded by rising fascism and the destabilizing rise of book bans targeting writers of color, queer and trans writers. I wanted to write a book suffused with queer joy and queer plenitude. I\u2019m intensely aware of how threatening it still can be for a lot of people.\u201d Indeed, an invisible threat \u2014 perhaps Kwon\u2019s own self-criticism and anxiety \u2014 lingers, however daring and sexually-charged her fiction is. \u201cPeople must imagine I\u2019m very liberated and yet, I feel so utterly restricted and inhabited in so many ways,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like such a private person in so many ways. But what I\u2019ve realised is that one doesn\u2019t have to feel liberated to do liberating things, to do things one is afraid of. I hope that\u2019s useful to other people.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/style/ro-kwon-exhibit-novel-queer-stories/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_middleeast_hezbollah-warns-cyprus-israel-gaza-war-explainer-intl", "text": "In a fiery speech Wednesday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah singled out nearby Cyprus, threatening to target the small Mediterranean island if it aids Israel in a potential war between the Lebanese militant group and Israel. \u201cCyprus will be part of this war too\u201d if it opens its airports and bases to Israeli forces, the leader of the Iran-backed militant group said in a televised speech Wednesday, a day after Israel warned that the prospect of \u201call-out war\u201d in Lebanon was \u201cgetting very close.\u201d Responding to the comments, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied being involved in the war. \u201cThe statements are not pleasant, but they do not correspond in any way to what is being attempted, to present an image that Cyprus is involved in the war operations. In no way whatsoever,\u201d he said, adding that lines of communication are open with the Lebanese and Iranian governments. While experts say war between Israel and Hezbollah remains\u00a0unlikely, the very mention of Cyprus adds a new dimension to the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. It risks drawing a European Union nation into a war that has already spread across the Middle East and puts the spotlight on Cyprus\u2019s ties with Israel. Here\u2019s what we know. Why is Cyprus\u2019 location important? An island in the Eastern Mediterranean located on a geopolitical fault line between the Middle East and southern Europe, Cyprus is geographically much closer to the conflicts in the Middle East than it is to European power centers. The island is twice the size of the US state of Delaware, and it is split into two parts: a Greek-speaking southern part known as the Republic of Cyprus, and a Turkish-speaking region known as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The island\u2019s divide reflects the rivalry between regional foes Greece and Turkey. Most of the international community only recognizes the sovereignty of the Greek part of Cyprus, and that was the nation Nasrallah\u2019s threats were directed at. The Republic of Cyprus is a member of the EU but not of the NATO defense alliance that obliges member nations to come to each other\u2019s defense in case of attack. It is home to\u00a0 around 920,000 people, with Nicosia as its capital. How close are Cyprus\u2019 ties with Israel? Diplomatic relations between Cyprus and Israel started in 1960, following the island\u2019s independence from British colonial rule, but Cyprus didn\u2019t open an embassy in Tel Aviv until 1994. Relations went sour in the 1980s and 1990s over issues including Israel\u2019s close ties with Turkey and the Arab-Israeli conflict, in which Cyprus sided with Arab states and supported Palestinian statehood. Ties bounced back in the late 1990s and 2000s, as Israel began turning to the Eastern Mediterranean for economic partnerships, especially after the discovery of natural gas in the region. Experts say Israel has also looked to Cyprus as a partner to thwart regional threats, particularly from Turkey and Iran-linked groups. Israel has in recent years used Cypriot territory to train its troops on possible war with Hezbollah. Cyprus\u2019 terrain is similar to that of Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said, according to Israeli media. In 2022, the IDF conducted a joint military drill with Cypriot forces. Some of the joint training focused on fighting multiple fronts and focusing on battling Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israeli media reported. Their latest exercises were conducted in May 2023 in Cyprus. What has Cyprus\u2019 role been in the Gaza war? Cyprus has been keen to dispel any suggestions that it is implicated in the Gaza war, noting its humanitarian efforts that helped bring some aid into Gaza. \u201cThe Republic of Cyprus is not part of the problem. The Republic of Cyprus is part of the solution,\u201d said Christodoulides, the president. \u201cAnd our role in this, as demonstrated, for example, through the humanitarian corridor, is recognized not only by the Arab world but by the international community as a whole.\u201d In March, Cyprus began allowing aid ships to sail from its ports as part of international efforts to create a humanitarian aid route via sea toward Gaza. The first maritime shipment to Gaza carried 200 tons of food, which equates to roughly 500,000 meals. An EU logistics hub was also set up in Cyprus to facilitate the flow of aid into Gaza. Nicosia has criticized some of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, especially those that have hampered the delivery of humanitarian aid. In April, it issued a joint statement with the UAE, condemning the deadly Israeli attack on the World Central Kitchen charity group that killed seven people. It has also repeatedly condemned Hamas for its October 7 attack on Israel. What is the likelihood of Cyprus getting more deeply involved? The island has previously been caught in the crossfire of regional conflicts, a reminder of its proximity to the volatile Middle East. In 2019, a suspected Russian-made missile exploded over the region of northern Cyprus. Cypriot officials believed the missile was linked to military operations in Syria, saying it landed less than 15 (24km) miles north of the capital Nicosia. A scenario in which Israel uses Cypriot bases for its military forces, which Hezbollah warned against, would \u201ceffectively expand Gaza war into the European Union,\u201d Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran analyst and editor of Amwaj.media, wrote on X. It would mean that an EU country is, for the first time, directly involved in an expanded Gaza war. Some experts say that the prospect of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict breaking out into an all- out war is unlikely, however, as neither side want such an escalation. \u201cHezbollah\u2019s release of drone footage of sensitive positions inside Israel is meant as a deterrent to Israel,\u201d Lina Khatib, associate fellow in the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN, referring to the 9-minute drone video released by Hezbollah on Tuesday, showing civilian and military locations in and around the Israeli city Haifa. \u201cIt is normal for both Israel and Hezbollah to have military plans in place for handling a potential escalation. But as things stand, neither Israel nor Hezbollah benefits from all-out war,\u201d Khatib said, adding that \u201cHezbollah knows that war with Israel would be devastating for Lebanon and that there is no popular appetite for such a scenario in the country.\u201d The Biden administration is also unlikely to let Israel fight a two-front war on its own, she said, adding that US involvement may pull in \u201cother Iran-backed actors as well as the potential for Iran itself to be targeted.\u201d \u201cThis is a high cost that Iran wants to avoid paying,\u201d she said. \u201cThe US also does not want to find itself in another Middle East quagmire, especially with presidential elections looming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/middleeast/hezbollah-warns-cyprus-israel-gaza-war-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_asia_taiwan-us-drones-sale-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "The United States has approved the $360 million sale of more than 1,000 small armed drones to Taiwan, as the self-ruled island claimed by China aims to strengthen its asymmetrical warfare abilities with an eye on successful tactics used on the battlefield in Ukraine. Taiwan will receive 720 Switchblade missiles and accompanying fire control systems worth $60.2 million, according to a release from the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) on Tuesday. The US will also provide Taiwan with up to\u00a0291 Altius 600M loitering munitions and supporting components with a price tag of $300 million, the DSCA said. The proposed sale comes as China increases military pressure on Taiwan, with extensive military exercises around it and almost daily warplane flights near the island. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims democratic Taiwan as its own, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to \u201creunify\u201d with the island, by force if necessary. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, Washington is legally required to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and it supplies Taipei with defensive weaponry. But the arms sales have drawn angry rebukes from Beijing. In a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue defense summit in Singapore earlier this month, Chinese Defense Minister Adm. Dong Jun slammed \u201cexternal interfering forces\u201d for selling arms and having \u201cillegal official contacts\u201d with Taiwan, in an apparent reference to the US. The Switchblade, which looks like a small fixed-wing drone, is an inexpensive lightweight precision-guided missile that can be launched from a variety of platforms within two minutes, stay aloft for 20 minutes and with a range of 30 kilometers (18.6 miles). Manufacturer AeroVironment says it has performed well\u00a0in Ukraine\u2019s defense of Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion. \u201cWe have been gratified by overwhelming user feedback and demand for additional systems,\u201d company CEO Wahid Nawabi said in an April post on AeroVironment\u2019s website. Meanwhile, the larger Altius 600M can carry \u201cmultiple seeker and warhead options\u201d while being launched from\u00a0land, air and sea platforms, manufacturer Anduril says on its website. Both drones can also be used for reconnaissance. In a statement Wednesday, Taiwan\u2019s presidential office thanked the US for its security commitments, adding this was the Biden administration\u2019s 15th weapons sale to the island since 2021. \u201cTaiwan will continue to strengthen our self-defense and asymmetric warfare capabilities to enhance our deterrence,\u201d presidential office spokeswoman Karen Kuo said. \u201cWe will firmly defend our constitutional system of democracy and freedom, and we will work with countries with similar ideals to safeguard the rules-based international order.\u201d The two systems will join a long backlog of weapons and munitions approved for Taiwan that have yet to be delivered. A June 3 accounting of US military sales to Taiwan shows more than $19.6 billion in weapons and ammo approved but yet to be delivered to the island\u2019s military, according to the Washington-based Cato Institute think tank.

{"id": "2024_06_18_asia_north-korea-russia-putin-visit-intl-hnk", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has landed in North Korea for a rare visit that signals the two countries\u2019 deepening alignment and Moscow\u2019s need to source weapons from Pyongyang to sustain its war on Ukraine. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un personally greeted Putin at the plane ramp as he arrived in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang in the early hours of Wednesday morning local time, video footage of his arrival showed. State media RIA reported that the two leaders talked animatedly with each other for several minutes before reaching their motorcade. The pair then rode together to the Kumsusan State Guest House where Putin will be staying, according to North Korean state media KCNA, and the two leaders \u201cexchanged their pent-up innermost thoughts and opened their minds to more surely develop (North Korea-Russia) relations in conformity with the common desire and will of the peoples of the two countries.\u201d After arriving at the guesthouse, they held a \u201cfriendly chat,\u201d KCNA added. The streets of Pyongyang were decked out with Russian flags and posters of Putin ahead of his first visit to the country since 2000. This week\u2019s visit is a rare overseas trip for Putin since he launched the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and a key moment for Kim, who has not hosted another world leader in his politically isolated country since the Covid-19 pandemic. Putin\u2019s visit will be closely watched across the world and is expected to cement further the burgeoning partnership between the two powers that is founded on their shared animosity toward the West and driven by Moscow\u2019s need for munitions for its war in Ukraine. Following his visit to North Korea, Putin is scheduled to travel to Hanoi in a display of Communist-governed Vietnam\u2019s ties to Russia that is likely to rankle the United States. Putin\u2019s trip to North Korea will have a \u201cvery eventful\u201d agenda, his aide Yuri Ushakov said during a press conference Monday. Both leaders plan to sign a new strategic partnership, Ushakov said. Ushakov insisted the agreement is not provocative or aimed against other countries, but is meant to ensure greater stability in northeast Asia. He said the new agreement will replace documents signed between Moscow and Pyongyang in 1961, 2000 and 2001. Satellite imagery from Planet Labs and Maxar Technologies showed preparations for a large parade in Pyongyang\u2019s central square. One image was of a grandstand being constructed on the eastern side of Kim Il Sung Square, the site where all major parades in North Korea are held. In an earlier image, taken on June 5, North Koreans can be seen practicing marching formations. US national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday the Biden administration wasn\u2019t \u201cconcerned about the trip\u201d itself, but added, \u201cWhat we are concerned about is the deepening relationship between these two countries.\u201d The US, South Korea and other countries have accused North Korea of providing substantial military aid to Russia\u2019s war effort in recent months, while observers have raised concerns that Moscow may be violating international sanctions to aid Pyongyang\u2019s development of its nascent military satellite program. Both countries have denied North Korean arms exports. Putin\u2019s trip reciprocates one Kim made last September, when the North Korean leader traveled in his armored train to Russia\u2019s far eastern region, for a visit that included stops at a factory that produces fighter jets and a rocket-launch facility. It also comes as tensions remain high on the Korean peninsula amid heightened international concern about the North Korean leader\u2019s intentions as he ramped up bellicose language and scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea. South Korea fired warning shots on Tuesday after North Korean soldiers working in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas briefly crossed into the South, according to South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, the second incident of its kind in the last two weeks. An \u2018advancing partnership\u2019 Kim last week hailed the future of the countries\u2019 \u201cmeaningful ties and close comradeship\u201d in a message to Putin commemorating Russia\u2019s national day on June 12. \u201cOur people give full support and solidarity to the successful work of the Russian army and people,\u201d Kim said, according to the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper. In an article for the same newspaper published early Tuesday local time, Putin thanked Pyongyang for showing \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and said the two countries were \u201cready to confront the ambition of the collective West.\u201d He said the two were \u201cactively advancing their multifaceted partnership\u201d and would \u201cdevelop alternative trade and mutual settlements mechanisms not controlled by the West, jointly oppose illegitimate unilateral restrictions, and shape the architecture of equal and indivisible security in Eurasia.\u201d The meeting comes just days after a summit of the Group of Seven (G7) developed economies in Italy attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where Western leaders reiterated their enduring support for Ukraine and agreed to use profits from frozen Russian assets to back a $50 billion loan to the war-torn country. It also follows a Kyiv-backed international peace summit over the weekend attended by more than 100 countries and organizations, which was meant to drum up support for Zelensky\u2019s vision for peace, which calls for a complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. Putin rebuffed those efforts a day ahead of the gathering by offering his own peace conditions, including the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from four partially occupied regions and that Kyiv withdraw its bid to join NATO \u2013 a position seen as nonstarter by Ukraine and its allies. Putin\u2019s visit to North Korea is widely viewed as an opportunity for him to seek to bolster Kim\u2019s support for his war \u2013 a goal that may be increasingly urgent as long-delayed American military aid for Ukraine comes online. Last month, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told American lawmakers the provision of North Korean munitions and missiles, as well as Iranian drones, had allowed Russian forces \u201cto get back up on their feet.\u201d Between August and February, Pyongyang shipped about 6,700 containers to Russia, which could accommodate more than 3 million rounds of 152 mm artillery shells or more than 500,000 rounds of 122 mm multiple rocket launchers, South Korea\u2019s defense ministry said earlier this year. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied such arms transfers, with a senior North Korean official last month calling such allegations an \u201cabsurd paradox.\u201d When asked about concerns that Russia is considering the transfer of sensitive technologies to Pyongyang in exchange for those goods, a Kremlin spokesperson last week said the countries\u2019 \u201cpotential for developing bilateral relations\u201d was \u201cprofound\u201d and \u201cshould not cause concern to anyone and should not and cannot be challenged by anyone.\u201d Putin on the world stage Putin last visited North Korea in 2000, his first year as president of Russia, where he met with Kim\u2019s predecessor and late father Kim Jong Il. His travel now to North Korea and then Vietnam comes as the Russian leader appears keen to re-establish himself on the global stage, chipping away at an image of isolation in the wake of his widely condemned invasion of Ukraine by drawing in like-minded partners. Last month Putin made a state visit to Beijing, where he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping made a sweeping affirmation of their shared opposition to what they see as a US-led world order. Moscow last week hosted foreign ministers from countries including China, Iran, South Africa and Brazil for a meeting of the BRICS group of major developing economies. US national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday called Putin\u2019s latest travel a \u201ccharm offensive\u201d following the leader\u2019s re-election. Putin won his fifth term earlier this year in a contest without true opposition. Putin\u2019s move to bolster North Korean ties has also been a boon for Kim, who remains unbowed by years of international sanctions over his illegal nuclear weapons program. The visit from a leader of a permanent member country of the United Nations Security Council will provide a signal to Kim\u2019s domestic audience of his global clout \u2013 and a chance to push for deeply needed economic and technological support from Moscow. Russia previously backed international sanctions and UN-backed investigations into North Korea\u2019s illegal weapons program, which includes tests of long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles that could in theory reach the US mainland. But Russia\u2019s apparent increasing reliance on North Korea and rising frictions with the West appear to have shifted that dynamic. In March, Moscow vetoed a UN resolution to renew independent monitoring of North Korea\u2019s violations of Security Council sanctions.

{"id": "2024_06_17_middleeast_netanyahu-disbands-israeli-war-cabinet-intl", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved his war cabinet, an Israeli official told CNN Monday, just over a week after opposition leader Benny Gantz withdrew from the body. Decision-making will now move back to the government\u2019s main security cabinet, the Israeli official said, claiming Netanyahu \u201cwill hold smaller forums on sensitive matters.\u201d The war cabinet, set up five days after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks against Israel on October 7, had five members: Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, opposition leader Benny Gantz, and two \u201cobservers,\u201d Ron Dermer and Gadi Eisenkot. But Gantz \u2013 seen as Netanyahu\u2019s most formidable political opponent \u2013 announced his \u201ccomplex and painful\u201d decision to withdraw from the cabinet last week, citing Netanyahu\u2019s failure to devise a strategy for the conflict in Gaza and the future governance of the Strip. \u201cNetanyahu prevents us from moving forward to a real victory [in Gaza],\u201d Gantz said June 9. He accused Netanyahu of putting his own personal political considerations ahead of a post-war strategy for the Gaza Strip, claiming that \u201cfateful strategic decisions are met with hesitancy and procrastination due to political considerations,\u201d and urged the prime minister to hold an election in the coming months. \u201cI call on Netanyahu: set an agreed election date. Do not let our people be torn apart,\u201d Gantz said. In April, Gantz called\u00a0for early elections\u00a0to be held as soon as September, ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, saying \u201cIsraeli society needs to renew its contract with its leadership.\u201d The month before, he had traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with US Vice President Kamala Harris in a trip not sanctioned by the Israeli government. Gantz often surpasses the prime minister in popularity, according to opinion polls.\u00a0A survey published Friday\u00a0by the Israeli Maariv newspaper showed support for Gantz at 42%, compared to 34% for Netanyahu. Gantz\u2019s resignation sparked calls from far-right members in Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, to join the war cabinet. Both men were earlier pointedly excluded from the cabinet at Gantz\u2019s behest. By dismantling the cabinet, Netanyahu may have avoided having to accede to Ben-Gvir\u2019s calls to join the cabinet, which could have further strained Israel\u2019s relations with the United States, or having to reject his demands, which could have angered the more extreme wing of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. Another interpretation is that without Gantz \u2013 and Eisenkot who also resigned \u2013 in it, there was no longer any point in keeping the war cabinet going. Instead, an Israeli official tells CNN, Netanyahu will in future hold smaller forums to discuss sensitive matters relating to the war with Hamas. It\u2019s unclear whether Ben-Gvir will be excluded from these as well. As National Security Minister, Ben-Gvir attends Israel\u2019s security cabinet alongside 12 other ministers, including Smotrich, Gallant and Foreign Minister Israel Katz. Both Ben-Gvir and Smotrich have urged that Israel sustain its assault on Gaza until Hamas is defeated completely, and threatened to topple Netanyahu\u2019s government if he accepts a peace proposal that was first publicly announced by US President Joe Biden last month. After the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Saturday announced a daily \u201ctactical pause\u201d of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed, Ben-Gvir condemned the decision. \u201cWhoever decided on a \u2018tactical pause\u2019 for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,\u201d he said. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday the dissolution of the war cabinet did not change the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cfundamental assessment\u201d of the war in Gaza, saying \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to have very direct and candid conversations\u201d with \u201cwhatever government is in place.\u201d He added that the US \u201cvery much\u201d welcomed the announcement of the \u201ctactical pause\u201d \u2013 but said the US would judge Israel \u201cby the results.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of humanitarian pauses, it\u2019s to the question of how much aid gets delivered. The pause ultimately is only a means to an end,\u201d he said. Aid groups are saying that no difference has yet been seen on the ground.

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, all of whom have important trading relationships with Russia as members of the BRICS economic group, attended the weekend meeting but did not agree to sign the joint statement. The document reaffirmed the signatories commitment to \u201crefraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all states, including Ukraine, within their internationally recognized borders.\u201d Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists at a news conference alongside the leaders of the European Union, Ghana, Canada, Chile and Switzerland that it was \u201cimportant that all participants of this summit support this Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity because there is will be no lasting peace without territorial integrity.\u201d More than 100 countries and organizations gathered at an idyllic lakeside resort near Lucerne to drum up support for the 10-point peace plan Zelensky first outlined late in 2022. That formula includes demands for a cessation of hostilities, the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian soil and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s pre-war borders with Russia \u2013 terms Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to ever agree to. Among the high-level dignitaries in attendance were the leaders of Argentina, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. US Vice President Kamala Harris was also in attendance and used the occasion to announce a $1.5 billion aid package that would go toward humanitarian expenditures and help Kyiv rebuilt its battered infrastructure. \u201cThis high level attendance shows one thing. The world cares deeply about the war provoked by Russia\u2019s aggression,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. Despite the strong showing among Western democracies, there had been questions ahead of the event as to just how much could be accomplished given that neither Russia nor China, whose increasingly close trading relationship with Moscow has helped the Kremlin survive Western sanctions, were attending. The communique published on Sunday said that signatories had struck several other agreements. Among them were the principle that Ukraine to should be allowed its own nuclear power plants \u2013 including the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant \u2013 and that the Kremlin refrain from both the use of and the threat of using nuclear weapons. The sides also said that all children and civilians that were unlawfully displaced must be returned to Ukraine. On Friday, the day before the summit was set to kick off,\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin restated the Kremlin\u2019s own peace plan, which calls for Ukrainian troops withdraw from four southern and eastern regions of Ukrainian territory that Moscow said it would annex in violation of international law and demands Kyiv abandon its bid to join\u00a0NATO. While Russian forces have made modest gains in two of the regions \u2013 Donetsk and Luhansk \u2013 in recent months, they are far from occupying all four, which include Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who traveled with Harris to Switzerland, told reporters at the summit that Putin\u2019s framework \u201cdefies basic morality.\u201d \u201cHe (Putin) said, not only does Ukraine have to give up the territory Russia currently occupies, but Ukraine has to leave additional sovereign Ukrainian territory before Russia will negotiate. And Ukraine must disarm so that is vulnerable to future Russian aggression down the road.

One Ukrainian squad commander,\u00a0Stanislav Buniatov, known as Osman,\u00a0described the situation in Vovchansk, east of Kharkiv and a few miles from the state border, as \u201cdifficult but controlled\u201d and said Russian troops are \u201csurrounded\u201d. \u201cOur guys are not losing their positions, occasionally conducting successful assaults, liberating positions and pushing the enemy back,\u201d Buniatov said in a post on Telegram on Sunday. Russian forces began coming across the border in numbers last month in a multi-pronged assault that the Kremlin said was designed to create a buffer zone that would prevent the Ukrainians from striking Russian cities such as Belgorod.

{"id": "travel_pagan-traditions-sweden-midsummer-festival", "text": "Perhaps you\u2019ve seen the viral YouTube clip of the Hollywood actress Alicia Vikander explaining to talk show host Jimmy Kimmel what Swedish Midsummer is all about (she even taught him the classic \u201cfrog dance,\u201d jumping around in sky-high stilettos). Or maybe you\u2019ve just heard that the summer solstice is kind of a big deal in Scandinavia. Well, it is. And while all of the Nordic nations, as well as some Eastern European ones, celebrate the longest day of the year in different ways, the Swedes do it best. Midsummer is the quintessential Swedish celebration and a highlight in the cultural calendar. For many, it\u2019s also a holiday synonymous with a certain amount of decadence and debauchery, whether or not that was how it was originally intended. In any case, it\u2019s a holiday Swedes look forward to, and often start planning for, months in advance. Typically, it\u2019s spent with friends and family at someone\u2019s summer house. (There can\u2019t be many countries with more summer cottages per capita than Sweden \u2013 owning a little red-painted house surrounded by fields, or by the coast, is something nearly every Swede who wasn\u2019t lucky enough to inherit one aspires to). The traditional Midsummer lunch is a highlight of the celebration, featuring a smorgasbord of pickled herring and dill-seasoned new potatoes, smoked and cured salmon, cheese quiches, meatballs and strawberry and whipped cream cake for dessert. It\u2019s all washed down with shots of snaps (Aquavit), which are knocked back while singing traditional snaps songs. But before sitting down to the Midsummer lunch, there is the obligatory dancing around the maypole. As per the centuries-old tradition, you must raise a maypole decorated with birch leaves and wildflowers, and dance around it while singing and holding hands. Except, that is, during \u201cThe Little Frogs\u201d dance, when you leap around like an amphibian and wave your hands around your head and bottom to illustrate that frogs have neither ears nor a tail while making quacking noises. It all makes perfect sense to the Swedes. As Vikander told Kimmel, \u201cEverybody between the ages of five and 95\u00a0in Sweden knows this dance and does it every year.\u201d Midsummer at the world\u2019s oldest open-air museum The Midsummer maypole tradition dates from the Middle Ages, while the summer solstice celebration can be traced to Norse pagan times, when the culture revolved around the mystical natural world. For centuries, Midsummer night was considered magical, a time when the divide between the physical and spiritual realms was blurred and plants took on potent healing powers and could be used for fortune telling. Young women would pick seven different kinds of wildflowers and place them under their pillows to dream of their future husbands, a tradition that is still popular today. Wearing a flower wreath in your hair is an age-old symbol of rebirth and fertility, and these were dried and kept throughout the year, sometimes used to infuse the Christmas bath to keep the family healthy throughout the long, cold winter. Equally, walking barefoot in the dewy grass on Midsummer morning \u2013 or, better still, rolling around in it naked \u2013 was a way to ensure good health. Midsummer Eve is always celebrated on a Friday between June 19 and 25. This year, it falls on June 21, but in many places around Sweden festivities are held during the whole Midsummer weekend. One such place is Skansen. The world\u2019s oldest open-air museum, this Stockholm tourist destination showcases the different regions of Sweden with houses and farmsteads from every part of the country. Here, solstice celebrations kick off mid-morning on Midsummer\u2019s Eve with wreath-making and a Midsummer market. At 11 a.m. everyone gathers to watch the maypole being raised, after which the dancing and games begin, to the irresistibly catchy sound of folk music performed by Skansen\u2019s musicians. The folk dancers, dressed in the colorful costumes of their respective provinces, lead the routines, including everyone\u2019s favorite, the frog dance. Given the number of international visitors, the MC runs through the program in both Swedish and English, ensuring everyone can join in. If you\u2019re more of a spectator, Skansen\u2019s folk dance troop also performs traditional peasant dances accompanied by fiddlers and key harpists throughout the day. For others, however, the highlight is the evening dance \u2013 a throwback to the kind of public dances that had their heyday in the 1950s and \u201860s, both in Sweden and the United States. Anette Bj\u00f6rlin, program officer at Skansen, explains that for many, Midsummer at Skansen is simply an unmissable event. \u201cLast year we had around 28,000 visitors on Midsummer Eve alone,\u201d she says. \u201cThe record is 35,000. People look forward to these celebrations all year. Families turn up first thing in the morning to take part in the child-friendly activities, and we then have a steady stream of people coming to enjoy the dances.\u201d Myths and legends Undeniably, Midsummer still instills a sense of wonder and awe, even if your average Swede no longer tends to roll around naked in the morning dew. Girls still pick wildflowers and place them under their pillows hoping to dream of their future spouses, though. Throughout history, people have turned to nature for medicinal purposes and to predict the future, but it\u2019s hard to know exactly how far back these traditions date, as there is a lack of written sources, says Kerstin Holm S\u00f6derkvist, heritage interpreter at Skansen. \u201cMany aspects of our celebrations can be traced back to medieval times, and it\u2019s possible that some even date back to the Vikings,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we can\u2019t know for sure. There are so many parallel narratives around Midsummer, not least because the church rebranded it as a Christian holiday celebrating John the Baptist instead of pagan beliefs.\u201d One myth she is keen to dispel is that the maypole is a pagan fertility symbol. \u201cI doubt it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely a German influence, like the Christmas tree.\u201d Midsummer is also very much a culinary celebration, as indicated by the aforementioned traditional lunch. \u201cIf we look at the Midsummer lunch through the lens of the traditional Swedish farming society, it\u2019s a welcome change after having to subsist on soup and oatmeal for months on end,\u201d Holm S\u00f6derkvist explains. \u201cFinally, we can look forward to feasting on freshly harvested, seasonal produce.\u201d Thankfully the Swedish diet has improved since the 1800s, and these days Midsummer primarily marks the start of the eagerly awaited vacation season. Most Swedes will take four or five weeks off work just in the summer (five weeks of annual leave is a statutory right). It\u2019s a time for rest and relaxation, for visiting friends and relatives around the country, and for pottering around your summer cottage, decorated with foliage and flowers for Midsummer. Holm S\u00f6derkvist is celebrating with friends at their summer house by a lake in the scenic central province of V\u00e4rmland, where they\u2019ll tuck into the traditional feast. Aside from connecting Swedes to their cultural history, she sees Midsummer as an important social event. \u201cIt\u2019s a very inclusive gathering, people of all ages and backgrounds can take part,\u201d she says. \u201cAnyone can bring a picnic hamper and head to a local park to join in the festivities.\u201d Summer solstice in London The park gatherings she is referring to are not restricted to Sweden. The summer solstice is a time of year when Swedes living abroad tend to get extra homesick and seek out celebrations in their adopted hometowns. In cities like London and New York, with sizable Swedish populations, Midsummer parties are popular events. What started as an impromptu gathering in London\u2019s Hyde Park has become an annual tradition, growing in size thanks to social media. Described as a \u201cflash mob picnic,\u201d the celebration tends to take place on a Saturday, i.e. Midsummer\u2019s Day rather than Eve, and is not a formally organized or ticketed event but still attracts hundreds, or even a few thousand people. Someone always puts up a small maypole, and the festivities go on until the park closes at midnight. For those who like to celebrate in style, the expat community LondonSwedes is hosting a gourmet dinner on Midsummer\u2019s Eve and a lunch on Midsummer\u2019s Day at the Swedish chef Niklas Ekstedt\u2019s restaurant, Ekstedt at The Yard, by the Great Scotland Yard Hotel. Expect flower garlands, live music and of course lots of snaps and singing. \u201cSwedes have a reputation for being a bit reserved, but at Midsummer, we let our hair down,\u201d says Charlotte \u00c5gren, the group\u2019s founder. \u201cThe snaps helps.\u201d To \u00c5gren, celebrating Midsummer is not just a way to keep a beloved tradition alive, but also a chance to showcase Swedish culture to her British and international friends. \u201cIt\u2019s such a happy occasion and one we\u2019re proud to invite our wider social circle to take part in,\u201d she says. \u201cI would say about a third of London revelers are people of all nationalities who just appreciate the tradition, and love a good party.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/pagan-traditions-sweden-midsummer-festival/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_middleeast_hagari-netanyahu-destroy-hamas-israel-intl", "text": "Israel\u2019s top military spokesman has said Hamas cannot be made to \u201cdisappear,\u201d casting doubt about whether the government\u2019s war aim of defeating the militant group can be achieved and drawing a sharp rebuke from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cThe idea that it is possible to destroy Hamas, to make Hamas vanish \u2014 that is throwing sand in the eyes of the public,\u201d Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Read Adm. Daniel Hagari said Wednesday in an interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 13. Hagari\u2019s comments prompted a terse response from Netanyahu\u2019s office, which said Israel\u2019s security cabinet \u201chas defined the destruction of Hamas\u2019 military and governing capabilities\u201d as one of the aims of its war in Gaza. \u201cThe IDF, of course, is committed to this,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said. The IDF later sought to clarify Hagari\u2019s remarks, confirming it is committed to the government\u2019s war goals and claiming that Hagari was only referring to Hamas \u201cas an ideology and as an idea.\u201d Despite the IDF\u2019s attempt to soften Hagari\u2019s remarks, cracks appear to be deepening between the Israeli government and its military. Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from members of his government and Israel\u2019s allies, including the United States, to devise a strategy for the post-war governance of Gaza after Israel\u2019s devastating bombardment of the isolated enclave. In response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks on Israel, when militants killed more than 1,200 people and took some 250 others hostage, Israel launched its war in Gaza with the primary goals of recovering the hostages, destroying Hamas\u2019 ability to govern there and ensuring another attack could not be launched from the Palestinian territory. But after eight months of war, and with the prospect of many more to come, Hagari\u2019s comments echoed the growing fears that Israel\u2019s military campaign may be unable to achieve those aims and that the group could remain a potent ideological force, despite Netanyahu\u2019s claim to have killed more than 14,000 Hamas fighters. CNN cannot independently verify that figure. \u201cTelling the public that there will be no terror in Gaza, no military operatives, no rockets and no armed men is a lie,\u201d Hagari said in a separate interview with CNN affiliate Kan 11. \u201cThere will be terror in Gaza. Hamas is an idea, deeply rooted in the hearts of the residents of Gaza.\u00a0To replace those who handle civil services and distribute or steal food, something else needs to be established. This is a decision for the political echelon, and the army will implement it.\u201d In a sign that Israel\u2019s cabinet may be tempering its initial war aims of destroying Hamas in its entirety, government spokesperson David Mencer said that eliminating Hamas\u2019 \u201cmilitary and government capabilities\u201d does not \u201cnecessarily mean\u201d killing every member of the group. Mencer told reporters Thursday that Hagari\u2019s comments had not harmed the war effort, but stressed it was the military\u2019s responsibility to carry out \u201cthe will of the elected government.\u201d During discussions about the US-backed ceasefire plan, Netanayhu also appeared to have retreated from his maximalist rhetoric at the war\u2019s outset. A statement issued last week \u2013 reportedly from the Prime Minister\u2019s office \u2013 said Israel will not end the war \u201cbefore achieving all its war objectives: destroying Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities, freeing all the hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn\u2019t pose a threat to Israel in the future.\u201d The statement did not reference Netanyahu\u2019s oft-repeated promise of total victory, nor the elimination of Hamas in full. Hagari\u2019s comments sparked the latest in a growing series of public disagreements between Israel\u2019s government and military. Last weekend, the IDF announced a daily \u201ctactical pause\u201d of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed \u2013 a decision that rankled Netanyahu, an Israeli official told CNN. Netanyahu contacted his military secretary and said the idea was unacceptable, but later backed down after being assured the fighting in Rafah would continue, according to the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The IDF\u2019s decision to implement tactical pauses also drew fierce criticism from the increasingly rancorous far-right wing of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said whoever made the decision \u201cis evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position.\u201d An IDF spokesperson later told CNN the decision for the \u201ctactical pause\u201d was approved by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. While Israel has had some success in returning those abducted on October 7 \u2013 both through a ceasefire-for-hostage deal in November and a daring rescue operation to retrieve four people earlier this month \u2013  hope that Israel will be able to return the hostages may also be dwindling. A senior Hamas official told CNN he has \u201cno idea\u201d how many of the 120 remaining hostages in Gaza are still alive, and that any deal to release them must include guarantees of a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/middleeast/hagari-netanyahu-destroy-hamas-israel-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_style_milan-menswear-spring-summer-2025", "text": "There are few things more synonymous with Italy in spring and summer than its beaches. From the Adriatic to the Amalfi Coast, its colorful \u201clidos\u201d (private beach clubs) are one of the country\u2019s most iconic exports. The Italian contingent of the Milan Fashion Week schedule seemed set on paying homage to its sunny shores during a weekend of Spring-Summer 2025 shows where a reoccurring theme of backstage mood boards was Italy\u2019s beloved \u201cal mare\u201d (the sea). At MSGM, where designer Massimo Giorgetti celebrated his brand\u2019s 15th\u00a0anniversary, outfits riffed on beach-resort signatures with sun-dyed stripes, shiny swim shorts, and cutout motifs of crabs, mermaids and dolphins reminiscent of childhood toys lost in the sand. Giorgetti, originally from the beach city of Rimini \u2014 famed of its 15km stretch of umbrella-lined sands \u2014 instead used an image of his adopted seaside home, 300 miles away on the Ligurian coast\u00a0as the main motif in the collection, a place where, he said, he draws inspiration from the evocative \u201cpines, agaves, and the scent of salt and resin.\u201d Remembering the Grand Tour At Dolce & Gabbana, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana naturally leaned into beaches frequented by the jet-set \u2014 the kind of people who arrive ashore by their yacht\u2019s tender \u2014 for its collection entitled \u201cItalian Beauty\u201d.\u00a0It was heavy on the raffia (seen on boxy jackets, shoes and satchels) and all-over coral embroidery that nodded to the twinkling keepsakes found in the \u2018goallerieas\u2019\u00a0\u00a0(jewelry stores) of Capri and Portofino that the Italians love to window-shop at sunset. \u201cSince the 19th century, the Grand Tour was a journey that had Italy as its destination, thus becoming one of the most iconic places to visit for summer holidays,\u201d relayed the designers\u00a0in show notes, adding that Italy\u2019s hotspots \u201cbecame places of pure aesthetics,\u201d a snapshot that they paid homage to with louche-cut silhouettes in luxe materials. Between the city and the beach At Gucci, where Sabato de Sarno revealed his sophomore menswear collection for the house, city-approved leather jackets and polo shirts mingled with icons of ocean culture. \u201cThis collection speaks of encounters \u2014 \u2018icontri\u2019 \u2014 between the city and the beach and among people who love life,\u201d said Napoli-born De Sarno. His sharp cuts were countered with a breezy sensibility reflected in repetitive dolphin and surfer prints that popped up on retro Cuban-collar shirts (the latter inspired by author William Finnegan\u2019s autobiography \u201cBarbarian Days, A Surfing Life\u201d). Elsewhere, toweling-style polo shirts in Neapolitan gelato shades were teamed with board shorts and rubber sea shoes \u2014 possibly de Sarno\u2019s first hype-item hit \u2014 which grounded the majority of looks. Despite what could have resulted in a presentation of derivative stereotypes, the Italians swerved gimmicks to deliver real clothes that have more to say than the popular but homogenized recent proliferation of \u201cquiet luxury\u201d collections. Against a divisive political and humanitarian backdrop, their homages to Italy\u2019s universally aspired-to dolce vita summers and throwbacks to what are now perceived as simpler times drew a collective optimism. Clothing that\u2019s both playful and useful Along similar lines, Prada looked to themes of youthful optimism, freedom and energy. For its collection, entitled \u201cCloser,\u201d the house looked to capture \u201cthe power of reality, in a world of the imaginary,\u201d\u00a0said the show notes, with closely cropped, deliberately creased shirting, off-kilter prismatic prints, and dropped-waist belts painted onto trousers in the style of tromp l\u2019oeil. Sweetly na\u00efve but at the same time reminding us that nothing is quite what meets the eye, it\u2019s easy to imagine this as a wardrobe that might find its way to the promenades of Rimini having been thrown in a hopeful ingenue\u2019s suitcase at the last minute for an invitation promising a good time. Miuccia Prada refuted it was a collection about escapism, \u201cactually, I propose something positive, I don\u2019t think we should escape from reality,\u201d she said backstage. Rather she and co-creative director Raf Simons wanted to create something \u201cplayful and useful\u201d chimed Simons. \u201cWe wanted to create clothes that have lived a life, that are alive in themselves,\u201d they relayed in the show notes. \u201cThere is a sense of spontaneity and optimism to these clothes \u2014 they reflect instinctive but deliberate choices, freedom.\u201d Celebrating a simple life The celebration of simple sensations and comfort in the familiar also popped up at JW Anderson, where designer Jonathan Anderson, who hails from Northern Ireland, sent summer knits depicting a child\u2019s drawing of quintessentially British \u201ctwo-up-two-down\u201d houses. At Moschino, where creative director Adrian Appiolaza debuted his first menswear collection, skirts came in postcard prints and blazers splashed with classic Italian tablescape scenes. \u201cEscaping the city, true individuals wear clothes that speak of the Italian countryside, of the wilds of\u00a0the jungle, and finally of a serenity \u2014 outer exploration, to find inner peace,\u201d said the brand. Fila+, headed up by Lev Tanju, staged a presentation that welcomed editors to a replica 1990s Italian home, with kids watching football in the living room, a nonna knitting a blanket in the Italian tricolor, and three men playing the card game Scopa around a kitchen table, all wearing tracksuits Tanju has reinvented from the 113-year-old Italian brand\u2019s illustrious archive. And at Fendi, Silvia Fendi based the collection on a picture of the Italian football manager wearing a Fendi suit that she found in the archive. A theme of reflective team spirit prevailed in sporty collegiate silhouettes featuring the Fendi crest comprising a squirrel, the Fendi stripe, and a Roman God. First used by previous creative director Karl Lagerfeld, it represents \u201cwho looks in two ways; one looks at the past and one looks at the future. And this is what Fendi is about, preserving techniques or but also experimenting,\u201d said Fendi backstage. Rooted in hopefulness\u00a0and experimentation, the Milan season was a collective celebration of dolce-vita.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/style/milan-menswear-spring-summer-2025/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_asia_vietnam-russia-putin-visit-intl-hnk", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi on Wednesday, fresh from a rare meeting in North Korea\u00a0with counterpart Kim Jong Un in which the two leaders agreed a new strategic partnership driven by Moscow\u2019s need for weapons for its war in Ukraine. Considered a pariah by the West, Putin is looking to boost economic ties with friendly countries and show that Western isolation is not having an impact. Communist-run Vietnam appears to be a natural choice with its foreign policy of non-alignment and close historical ties to Moscow, and few countries can successfully host the leaders of the United States, China and Russia with such fanfare as Vietnam. Putin\u2019s two-day visit to Vietnam has rankled the United States, with a spokesperson for the US Embassy in Hanoi reportedly criticizing the trip saying, \u201cno country should give Putin a platform to promote his war of aggression and otherwise allow him to normalize his atrocities,\u201d according to Reuters. The Russian leader met with Vietnamese leadership including Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and new President To Lam, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS, citing the Kremlin. Putin told Lam on Thursday that \u201cstrengthening a comprehensive strategic partnership with Vietnam is always one of our priorities,\u201d TASS reported. At the start of his talks with Lam, Putin invited him to Victory Day celebrations in Moscow next year. \u201cWe will be glad to welcome you to the celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War in Moscow,\u201d TASS quoted Putin as saying. Much like his visit to Pyongyang, Putin\u2019s trip to Hanoi could signal deepening relations between the two nations as the Russian leader looks to garner concrete support amid international sanctions over his grinding war in Ukraine. Ahead of the visit, Putin\u00a0thanked Vietnam for its \u201cbalanced position\u201d on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in an article for the Vietnamese Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, according to the Kremlin. \u201cWe are grateful to our Vietnamese friends for their balanced position on the Ukraine crisis and their desire to facilitate the search for practical ways to settle it peacefully. All of this is fully in line with the spirit and nature of our relations,\u201d\u00a0Putin\u00a0said. Vietnam\u2019s Ambassador to Russia Dang Minh Koi told the Vietnam News Agency that the state visit will strengthen Hanoi-Moscow ties, and be \u201can opportunity for the leaders of the two countries to discuss and propose concrete measures to boost bilateral trade and economic cooperation,\u201d TASS reported. A joint statement is expected to be adopted and numerous agreements announced on cooperation in sectors including \u201ctrade and economic, scientific, technological and humanitarian areas,\u201d according to Russian presidential foreign policy aide Yury\u00a0Ushakov, TASS reported. Vietnam\u2019s balancing act Moscow has been a major supplier of weapons to Vietnam since the Soviet era and analysts say arms and energy talks could feature on the agenda. The visit also showcases Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy balancing act, which like India, enables the\u00a0country to be on friendly terms with rival major powers including Russia, the United States and China \u2013 all vital trading partners. Last year, Vietnam hosted both Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden. That trip resulted in the US and Vietnam upgrading diplomatic ties to a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership,\u201d in a historic sign of improving relations between the former foes. The two nations have accelerated trade in recent years and the US is currently reviewing an upgrade to Vietnam\u2019s market economy status that would allow Hanoi to benefit from lower tariffs on goods imported into the US. Vietnam is center to US efforts to counter rising Chinese influence in the region and a key part of Washington\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy. Vietnam in turn is keen to benefit from American efforts to diversify supply chains outside of China as well as US concern over China\u2019s military build-up in the South China Sea. The two countries have built up their partnership just decades after fighting a devastating\u00a0war that decimated the country. \u201cFrom the Vietnamese perspective, Russia is still seen as an important partner with deep historical ties and important roles to play in Vietnam\u2019s defense and security policy,\u201d said Le Hong Hiep, senior fellow of the Vietnam Studies Program at\u00a0Singapore\u2019s ISEAS \u2013 Yusof Ishak Institute. But he said, \u201cVietnam is also careful not to be seen as being too close to Russia\u2026 The US and its allies play a much more significant role in Vietnam\u2019s security and economic development.\u201d While Vietnam may risk disappointing the US and its allies by hosting Putin, \u201cthe country is showing its partners that Vietnam will not sacrifice its ties with one power just to meet the expectations of others,\u201d said Le.\u00a0\u201cIt is not about taking sides. It\u2019s about maintaining its foreign policy of diversification and pursuing a strategy of autonomy.\u201d Putin faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. Vietnam and Russia are not members of the ICC. Putin\u2019s push for a new world order Vietnam was among several Southeast Asian countries that abstained from joining a global summit on Ukraine in Switzerland last week. But Western hopes of an isolated Russia appear to not be bearing out as Putin ramps up his outreach to friendly countries and efforts to establish a new global order in opposition to the West. In May, Putin met Xi in Beijing \u2013 his symbolic first overseas trip since starting a\u00a0new term as Russia\u2019s president \u2013 where the two leaders vowed to deepen their strategic partnership in opposition to the US. Now, Putin is visiting two of China\u2019s neighbors in what US national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday called a \u201ccharm offensive\u201d following the leader\u2019s re-election. Crucially, Moscow assumed the rotating presidency of the China and Russia-backed\u00a0BRICS economic group this year and will welcome member and observer nations to its southwestern city of Kazan in October. More than three dozen countries are seeking entry into the bloc and Russia will be the first member to oversee the body since it significantly\u00a0expanded its global footprint\u00a0at the start of the year, when Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Egypt formally joined. For Moscow and Beijing, the expansion is widely viewed as a drive to forge a new world order by turning the loose economic grouping into a geopolitical counterweight to the West \u2013 and Western institutions dominated by the US, such as the G7. Malaysia is the latest country preparing to join the group, according to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, as reported in Chinese media on Tuesday. Vietnam\u00a0has expressed interest in BRICS, with a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman saying in May \u201cwe pay attention to the process of the BRICS membership expansion,\u201d according to Vietnamese state media. Last week, Vietnam sent a delegation led by its Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs to attend the BRICS Foreign Ministers\u2019 Summit in Russia. Analysts say Russia is likely to get more out of the visit than Vietnam, and Hanoi may even suffer reputational damage by hosting Putin following his trip to North Korea. \u201cIf no substantive deals are made, the visit will mainly be symbolic and a means for Putin and Russia to show the world that Western sanctions against Russia are not working,\u201d said Le. \u201cThat symbolism is very important to Putin.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/asia/vietnam-russia-putin-visit-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

The disease is most prevalent in Africa, which accounts for 66% of cases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Nigeria bears the highest burden, where as many as 150,000 babies are born with sickle cell disease annually \u2013 the most of any country. Adekunle Gold first wrote of his woes with sickle cell disease in 2022 in his song \u201c5 Star.\u201d Now, he is readying himself for a long-term commitment to advocacy, announcing the establishment of the Adekunle Gold Foundation, which will focus on addressing the needs of children battling sickle cell disease on the African continent. Recently, the singer sat down with CNN\u2019s Larry Madowo for his first in-depth interview about living with sickle cell. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length. Larry Madowo: Why are you speaking up about sickle cell disease now and especially being very aggressive about this awareness? Adekunle Gold: I just really got the courage to come out and speak about it. You know, a lot of people can\u2019t share their stories like I can. I was writing the song \u201c5 Star\u201d and reflecting on my life, the journey, and how I\u2019m a miracle. I was reflecting on that song, and I thought, maybe it\u2019s time to learn my voice. People are dying, people are going through it. People can\u2019t afford basic things that they need to sustain their health, and if the international organizations are not doing anything about it, it\u2019s time to force their hands to do it. Larry Madowo: What challenges have you had to overcome while living with sickle cell? Adekunle Gold: I constantly put myself in situations that made me sick as a child. For example, doing strenuous activities as a child that I was not supposed to do and there were always consequences, you know? But I always knew that I didn\u2019t want this thing to define me. So, if it means that I need to exercise more, take my drugs, eat well, rest well, and take more water, then I need to do that always. Larry Madowo: Are there any memorable things that you\u2019ve come through during your advocacy work when people are not even aware of what they\u2019re facing? Adekunle Gold: Just speaking up about it on social, I realized that a lot of people are ignorant about it. This is something that I inherited, and you\u2019re trolling me for it. So, you realize people don\u2019t even know these things. I just need more people to be aware. Larry Madowo: What are some of the barriers to receiving proper care for sickle cell patients in West Africa? In Nigeria? Adekunle Gold: Listen, people don\u2019t have money, bro. The last outreach I did people came to Lagos to take drugs, to check their BP (blood pressure), to check their children all the way from Ilorin [300 kilometers away from Lagos]. And I\u2019m like, this is insane. We don\u2019t have facilities where you can just be in your place. Other countries like the UK and Canada have policies for sickle cell. Where it affects us the most, we don\u2019t have (accessible care). People can\u2019t afford to buy folic acid and folic acid is the smallest of things that you should be able to get. Larry Madowo: What do you hope to achieve by adding your voice to this, by speaking up publicly? Adekunle Gold: I want everybody to, first of all, be aware of it and know how to treat people that have it.\u00a0 I also want people to understand that it is important to check your genotype. Larry Madowo: You\u2019re the embodiment that you can live with sickle cell and have a full, healthy, and powerful life. Will you keep talking about this in your music and your public appearances with your shows? Adekunle Gold: I started the foundation, so you know it\u2019s real. It\u2019s game time from now on. So, I am constantly learning my voice, constantly doing outreach, and constantly fighting for it. I want the international community to pay attention just like they do to other diseases. Sickle cell is a big one. It affects my people the most, and I want the world to do something about it.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_06_20_europe_france-alleged-rape-anti-semitism-intl-latam", "text": "Allegations that three boys gang-raped a 12-year-old Jewish girl in northern France have triggered an outcry over surging antisemitism in the country, a key issue in the looming French parliamentary elections this month. Politicians from all sides have weighed in on the alleged attack, with French President Emmanual Macron condemning a \u201cscourge of antisemitism\u201d\u00a0that he said is\u00a0festering in French schools, and far-right leaders placing blame on the left for failing to take anti-semitism seriously enough. The Nanterre prosecutor\u2019s office announced Wednesday that it has launched an inquiry into the\u00a0alleged \u201caggravated rape\u201d of a minor, after receiving \u201creports from a 12-year-old girl\u201d\u00a0of the incident on June 15.  Three boys, aged 12 and 13, have been taken into custody, the prosecutor also said. Whether the girl was targeted for her religion is part of the probe, with two of the boys now being investigated for\u00a0aggravated gang rape of a minor, group violence against a minor for reasons of religion, death threats and insult for reasons of religion, according to the prosecutor\u2019s statement. The third boy\u00a0has been\u00a0placed under \u201cassisted witness\u201d status in relation to the alleged rape, the prosecutor added. The alleged attack took place as the girl tried to return home after meeting a friend. Two boys\u00a0approached her and attempted to block her path outside her house. After a third boy\u00a0arrived,\u00a0the group began to physically attack the girl, hurling antisemitic insults at her, BFMTV reported,\u00a0citing police sources. The girl received several death threats and one of the boys called her\u00a0a \u201cdirty Jew,\u201d according to the account reported by BFMTV. Antisemitic incidents have increased by 284% in France between 2022 and 2023, according to data from the French interior ministry. In 2023, antisemitic acts constituted 60% of all anti-religious acts, compared to 26% in 2022, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told the French Senate earlier this year. Growing fears of an antisemitism problem The incident has sparked an intense political debate on what politicians have described as a spiraling\u00a0antisemitism problem in France\u00a0linked to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. On Wednesday,\u00a0Jordan Bardella, the far-right firebrand hoping to score big wins for his National Rally party in the upcoming elections, pledged to tackle antisemitism if elected in three weeks\u2019 time. \u201cSince October 7, an atmosphere of anti-Semitism has spread and developed in an extremely worrying manner in our country, which we must combat,\u201d Bardella told reporters. Bardella\u2019s party colleague and far-right juggernaut, Marine Le Pen said in a post on X that the attack revolted members of her party, highlighting the uptick in antisemitic incidents across the country. Le Pen said the recent surge in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war reveals a worrying \u201cstigmatization\u201d of Jewish people which \u201ceveryone should be fully aware of\u201d when hitting the ballot boxes on June 30 and July 7. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal meanwhile described the incident as a \u201cdespicable\u201d and took direct aim at his left-wing political opponent, Jean-Luc Melenchon, whom he accused of previously downplaying the severity of antisemitism in France by describing it as a \u201cresidual\u201d issue. Politicians in France have a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to ensure that antisemitic rhetoric does not become \u201ctrivialized,\u201d Attal said in an interview with TF1 Info Wednesday, warning that if trivialized it can lead young people in particular to \u201cthe worst.\u201d Melenchon for his part said he was \u201chorrified by this rape,\u201d saying in a social media post that \u201cit put under a concerning spotlight the conditioning of criminal male behavior from a young age, and antisemitic racism.\u201d Voter anger over the issue appeared clear on Wednesday, as demonstrators gathered outside Paris\u2019s city hall on, according to reporting from BFMTV. Protesters carried placards with slogans such as \u201cRaped at 12 because she was Jewish,\u201d and \u201cAnti-Semitism is not residual,\u201d and listened to speeches from Jewish rights activists in attendance. \u201cAll light must be shed on the circumstances of this crime, including its anti-Semitic nature, if this is confirmed,\u201d the main Jewish interest group in France, the Conseil repr\u00e9sentatif des institutions juives de France (CRIF) said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/europe/france-alleged-rape-anti-semitism-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_tech_openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor", "text": "Victor Miller, 42, recently filed paperwork to run for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, but it wasn\u2019t exactly for him: He listed the name of a customized AI chatbot to appear on the ballot. He argued that the chatbot, named VIC \u2013 for \u201cvirtual integrated citizen\u201d \u2013 would use technology from artificial intelligence company OpenAI to make all political decisions and help govern the city. (VIC is not affiliated with a political party.) AI has \u201chelped me in my life personally \u2026 such as helping me with my resume,\u201d Miller told CNN. \u201cI think it could add a layer to help a town. I really want to see that happen.\u201d On Tuesday, however, OpenAI told CNN it shut down Miller\u2019s access to the tool that was being used to interact with and persuade voters. Using ChatGPT in this way, according to the company, is against its policies. AI is making politics even more complicated as government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use AI tools responsibly, and the tech is advancing faster than social, legal and regulatory guardrails. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken action against these uses of our technology for violating our policies against political campaigning,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told CNN. On its website, OpenAI states it prohibits \u201cengaging in political campaigning or lobbying, including generating campaign materials personalized to or targeted at specific demographics.\u201d Miller said he was motivated to create VIC after he was denied access to city records about policies and procedures because he made his request anonymously. \u201cIf I was able to ask AI and interact with this new intelligence, it would have known the law and I would have gotten the records,\u201d he said. The city did not respond to request for comment on the denial of records, but Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray told CNN in a statement that he is \u201cclosely\u201d monitoring Miller\u2019s bid for mayor. \u201cWyoming law is clear that, to run for office, one must be a \u2018qualified elector,\u2019 which necessitates being a real person,\u201d Gray said in the statement. \u201cTherefore, an AI bot is not a qualified elector.\u201d He also suggested the chatbot is essentially a fig leaf for a Miller candidacy. Gray said he wrote a letter to the Cheyenne municipal clerk raising his concerns about the bid. Although the public-facing version of VIC has been removed by OpenAI, Miller said it still works on his own ChatGPT account. He plans to bring it, along with a microphone, to a local Cheyenne library and give voters the opportunity to directly ask it questions via its voice-to-text feature. OpenAI told CNN it also took action against another candidate in the UK who was using its AI models to help campaign for Parliament. Steve Endacott, chairman of an AI company called Neural Voice, answers questions from voters via AI Steve, a chatbot, on his site. He is running as an independent. Endacott did not respond to a request for comment. His website offered a ChatGPT chatbot where voters were able to leave opinions and help create policies. If a voter asked the tool a question about AI Steve\u2019s policies and it didn\u2019t have an answer, it would conduct a search and create a policy suggestion. (While his website continues to operate, the tool is no longer powered by ChatGPT.) \u2018Gimmick is the right word\u2019 Although AI chatbots are getting smarter, some experts told CNN the technology should never substitute for human judgment in running any part of government. \u201cWhen it comes to AI now and what it will be like in the future, it should never be used to make automated decisions,\u201d said Jen Golbeck, a professor at the College of Information Sciences at the University of Maryland. \u201cAI has always been designed for decision support \u2013 it gives some data to help a human make decisions but is not set up to make decisions by itself.\u201d The emergence of AI political candidates also comes amid growing concerns about how the spread of misinformation could impact elections. Earlier this year, for example, a fake recording of a candidate in Slovakia saying he rigged the election went viral. Golbeck said, however, that there may be a place for AI in politics when it comes to helping with various tasks, such as answering forms from constituents or directing how to get problems solved. \u201cYou may be able to train a chatbot with all of the knowledge found in an office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the decision making should always be left to humans.\u201d David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, agreed, noting the people behind an AI candidacy are leaning into \u201ca cultural moment\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. \u201cGimmick is the right word for it,\u201d Karpf told CNN. \u201cChatGPT is not qualified to run your government.\u201d Karpf said he doesn\u2019t believe lawmakers need to make formal legislation around AI chatbots running for office because \u201cno one is going to vote for an AI chatbot to run a city.\u201d Karpf believes that the timing of these cases is noteworthy, too. \u201cWe have a very serious election coming up, and I don\u2019t mind levity in it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this is: We should laugh for a minute and get back to work.\u201d But Miller said he hopes the attention around his efforts inspires more AI candidates in the months ahead. \u201cI think this can expand beyond the mayor and Parliament, and [reach the whole] world,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/tech/openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2023_09_29_asia_south-china-sea-tensions-philippines-china-us-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Maritime disputes across the vast South China Sea have ratcheted up in recent years as an increasingly assertive China militarizes disputed islands and confronts its regional rivals over their competing claims in the strategically important and resource-rich waterway. Bracketed by China and several Southeast Asian nations, parts of the vital economic passage are claimed by multiple governments, with Beijing asserting ownership over almost all of the waterway in defiance of an international court ruling. Over the past two decades, China has occupied a number of obscure reefs and atolls far from its shoreline across the South China Sea, building up military installations, including runways and ports. Competing claimants, such as the Philippines, say such actions infringe on their sovereignty and violate maritime law. And the United States agrees, regularly sending its Navy destroyers on freedom of navigation operations close to contested islands, leading to fears that the South China Sea could become a flashpoint between the two superpowers. Here\u2019s what you should know.  Why does the South China Sea matter? The 1.3-million-square-mile waterway is vital to international trade, with an estimated third of global shipping worth trillions of dollars passing through each year.  It\u2019s also home to vast fertile fishing grounds upon which many lives and livelihoods depend. Much of its economic value remains untapped, however. According to the US Energy Information Agency, the waterway holds at least 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 11 billion barrels of oil. Who controls those resources and how they are exploited could have a huge impact on the environment. The South China Sea is home to hundreds of largely uninhabited islands and coral atolls and diverse wildlife at risk from climate change and marine pollution. Who claims what? Beijing claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan also hold competing claims.  In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling: Manila says Beijing continues to send its maritime militia to Mischief Reef and Scarborough Shoal in the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone. In the southern portion of the sea is the Spratly Island chain, which Beijing calls the Nansha islands. The archipelago consists of 100 islets and reefs of which 45 are occupied by China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam or the Philippines. In the northwestern part of the sea, the Paracels \u2013 known as the Xisha islands in China \u2013 have been controlled by Beijing since 1974 despite claims from Vietnam and Taiwan.  China\u2019s ruling Communist Party also claims self-governing Taiwan as its own territory, despite having never controlled it.   What does China\u2019s naval build up mean for the sea?  China has built the world\u2019s largest naval fleet, more than 340 warships, and until recently it has been regarded as a green-water navy, operating mostly near the country\u2019s shores. But Beijing\u2019s shipbuilding reveals blue-water ambitions. In recent years it has launched large guided-missile destroyers, amphibious assault ships and aircraft carriers with the ability to operate in the open ocean and project power thousands of miles from Beijing. In addition, Western marine security experts \u2013 along with the Philippines and the United States \u2013 claim China controls a maritime militia that is hundreds of vessels strong and acts as an unofficial \u2013 and officially deniable \u2013 force that Beijing uses to push its territorial claims both in the South China Sea and beyond.  The US is not a claimant to the South China Sea, but says the waters are crucial to its national interest of guaranteeing freedom of the seas worldwide.  The US Navy regularly conducts freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea, saying the US is \u201cdefending every nation\u2019s right to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.\u201d  Beijing denounces such operations as illegal. What has China built in the sea? Most of Beijing\u2019s military buildup is concentrated along the Spratly and Paracel island chains, where sustained land reclamation saw reefs being destroyed first and then built on.  Chinese vessels have been known to encircle various atolls and islets, sending dredgers to build artificial islands large enough to harbor tankers and warships.  \u201cOver the past decade, the PRC has added more than 3,200 acres of land to its seven occupied outposts in the Spratly Islands, which now feature airfields, berthing areas, and resupply facilities to support persistent PRC military and paramilitary presence in the region,\u201d US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Lindsey Ford told a House subcommittee earlier this week, referring to China by its official acronym, the People\u2019s Republic of China.  Beijing\u2019s military construction sped up in 2014 as it quietly began massive dredging operations on seven reefs in the Spratlys.  Since then, Beijing has constructed military bases on Subi Reef, Johnson Reef, Mischief Reef and Fiery Cross Reef, fortifying its claims on the chain, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.  Those facilities, according to Ford, are now bristling with some of China\u2019s most advanced weaponry, including stealth fighters.  \u201cSince early 2018, we have seen the PRC steadily equip its Spratly Island outposts \u2014 including Mischief Reef, Subi Reef, and Fiery Cross \u2014 with an increasing array of military capabilities, including advanced anti-ship cruise missiles, long-range surface-to-air missile systems, J-20 stealth fighter jets, laser and jamming equipment, and military radar and signals intelligence capabilities,\u201d she said in a prepared statement.  China installed exploratory oil rigs in the Paracels in 2014 that sparked anti-China riots in Vietnam, a competing claimant.  More recently, cruise ships have taken Chinese tourists to the militarized reefs.    Why are tensions rising again? Under President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr, the Philippines has taken increasingly assertive steps to protect its claim to shoals in the South China Sea, leading to several confrontations with Chinese vessels in waters off the Philippine islands.  They include standoffs between Chinese coast guard and what Manila says are shadowy Chinese maritime militia boats and tiny wooden Philippine fishing vessels; Chinese water cannons blocking the resupply of a shipwrecked Philippine military outpost; and a lone Filipino diver using a knife to sever a massive floating Chinese barrier. \u201cThese recent incidents in the past year shows that China has become increasingly aggressive and confident in its actions against smaller countries like the Philippines. They\u2019re beginning to cross certain lines,\u201d said Jay Batongbacal, a maritime expert at the University of the Philippines. The Philippine Coast Guard says it remains \u201ccommitted to upholding international law, safeguarding the welfare of Filipino fisherfolk, and protecting the rights of the Philippines in its territorial waters.\u201d China\u2019s Foreign Ministry has defended the behavior of its vessels in the waterway and said Beijing will \u201cfirmly safeguard\u201d what it views as its territorial sovereignty.   What are the global implications? Since taking office in 2022, Philippine President Marcos Jr. has taken a stronger stance over the South China Sea than his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, amid the wider power struggle that has been playing out in the region for years. The South China Sea is widely seen as a potential flashpoint for global conflict, and the recent confrontations between Manila and Beijing have raised concerns among Western observers of potentially developing into an international incident if China, a global power, decides to act more forcefully against the Philippines, a US treaty ally.  Washington and Manila are bound by a mutual defense treaty signed in 1951 that remains in force, stipulating that both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party.

When he learned the news, Dr. Yuval Bitton says he felt it was coming \u2013 and knew immediately who was behind it. \u201cI know the person who planned and conceived and initiated this criminal attack,\u201d Bitton told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour. \u201cI have known him since 1996 \u2013 not only him but the entire Hamas leadership in Gaza \u2013 and it was clear to me that this is what they were planning.\u201d Bitton\u00a0spent years\u00a0working as a\u00a0dentist\u00a0in Israel\u2019s Nafha Prison.\u00a0It was there he met \u201cthe person\u201d \u2013\u00a0Yahya Sinwar, a\u00a0Hamas militant convicted of murder who would go on to become the group\u2019s leader\u00a0in Gaza \u2013\u00a0saying he saved his life by helping diagnose a brain tumor. Bitton says he spent hundreds of hours conversing with Sinwar, providing him with rare insight into the mind of the top Hamas official. But his actions have left him tormented. Bitton blames\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0for the murder of his nephew, who was killed after Hamas militants raided his home\u00a0on October 7. In 2004,\u00a0Sinwar had come to\u00a0the prison\u2019s\u00a0clinic complaining of neck pain and losing his balance. \u201cWhen he explained to me what was happening to him, I diagnosed it as a stroke, and together with the general practitioner, we decided to take him to the hospital,\u201d Bitton said. \u201cHe arrived at the hospital, the diagnosis was that he had an abscess in the brain and he was operated on that day, thus saving his life because if it had exploded, he would have died.\u201d Sinwar was appointed leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip in 2017. Born in the Khan Younis refugee camp in southern Gaza in 1962,\u00a0to a family displaced during the Arab-Israeli war,\u00a0he joined Hamas in the late 1980s. In 1989, he was sentenced to four life sentences in Israel for the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers. After being freed in 2011 as part of a prisoner swap, he returned to Gaza where he began his rise in the militant organization, becoming notorious for the violent treatment he would dole out on suspected collaborators. Israel\u00a0has publicly\u00a0accused\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0of being\u00a0the \u201cmastermind\u201d behind Hamas\u2019 terror attack\u00a0against Israel\u00a0on October 7\u00a0\u2013\u00a0though experts say he is likely one of several \u2013 making him one of the key targets of its war in Gaza. The attack was the deadliest assault in Israel\u2019s history. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and also took some 250 people hostage into Gaza. Following his recovery, Sinwar told Bitton that he owed him his life \u2013 a sentiment he repeated when he was released in the 2011 prisoner swap, which saw Sinwar and more than 1,000 other Palestinians freed for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. \u201cHe also told me that on the day he was released in [Gilad] Shalit\u2019s deal in 2011, that he owed me his life, and one day he will repay it.\u201d But years later that connection meant nothing. \u201cAnd as you understand, he made up for it on October 7 in that he was also directly responsible for the murder of my nephew in Kibbutz Nir Oz,\u201d said Bitton. Nir\u00a0Oz\u00a0was one of several kibbutzim that bore the brunt of Hamas\u2019 attack on October 7, with many residents murdered or taken hostage. Bitton said his nephew, Tamir, was \u201cseriously injured\u201d trying to fight off the attackers. \u201cThere were only five of them, they didn\u2019t really stand a chance, and he was kidnapped while he was still seriously injured, unconscious, and died after a few hours in Gaza.\u201d A close connection Bitton\u00a0\u2013 who later joined Israeli intelligence \u2013\u00a0came to know\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0well during his time in prison,\u00a0spending\u00a0\u201chundreds of hours\u201d\u00a0talking to him. Sinwar, Bitton says, believes Jewish people have \u201cno place\u201d on \u201cMuslim lands.\u201d Bitton therefore saw it as \u201conly a matter of time and timing that they [Hamas] will act against us and try to expel us from the place where we live.\u201d Despite eight months of Israeli fighting in Gaza, which has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, Sinwar remains at large, and thought to be sheltering somewhere in the territory. Asked for his assessment of Sinwar\u2019s mindset, Bitton says the Hamas leader is mainly concerned with staying in power. He believes\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0would be \u201cwilling to sacrifice even 100,000 Palestinians in order to ensure the survival of his rule.\u201d \u201cHe is willing to pay with the lives of militants, Hamas members, civilians. He doesn\u2019t care.\u201d With this in mind, Bitton believes that Israel made a mistake by not creating an alternative to Hamas\u2019s rule, which could have undermined Sinwar\u2019s power. Bitton says that Sinwar still \u201cfeels he is in a powerful position.\u201d \u201cHe is running the negotiations while still operating from within Gaza, and still controls the areas from which the IDF evacuates, he also controls the humanitarian aid, and therefore he feels strong and won\u2019t sign an agreement to release the hostages unless the IDF withdraws from Gaza and the fighting ends.\u201d Sinwar spent his more than two decades in prison studying his enemy, including learning Hebrew. It is a lesson Israel should have taken too, says Bitton, who believes the government and intelligence service \u201cdid not know and learn Hamas well enough.\u201d \u201cOur attitude towards Hamas was arrogant. We dismissed Hamas. And Hamas said everything it intended to do, but we didn\u2019t want to listen.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/middleeast/israeli-dentist-hamas-yahya-sinwar-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

The National Weather Service warned people in the South and Midwest planning to celebrate dads outdoors on Sunday to stay cool amid a major heat risk, with high temperatures into the 90s in some areas. The intense heat wave won\u2019t stop there. An expansive and exceptionally strong heat dome will build Sunday over the East and stretch into the Midwest and Great Lakes over the next few days, with the heat expected to persist through the week. Heat domes trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. The final Sunday of spring will be a scorcher in the Plains and Midwest, where temperatures will reach the mid- to upper 90s, according to the Weather Prediction Center. People living across the Great Lakes region can expect temperatures in the upper 80s and low 90s. The Mississippi River Valley will be slammed with the worst of Sunday\u2019s sweltering conditions, with large portions of both states facing a Level 3 \u2013 or major \u2013 risk of heat-related impacts. The National Weather Service office in St. Louis encouraged residents to take extra precautions Sunday for its hottest day of the year. \u201cIt will feel like 100-105 during the afternoon hours. We aren\u2019t used to this kind of heat yet,\u201d forecasters wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Sunday\u2019s unrelenting heat will be felt across states including Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to the weather service. Some smaller pockets of Level 4 \u2013 or extreme \u2013 heat will be felt in a few locations such as Atlanta, where Sunday afternoon temperatures could reach 94 degrees by the afternoon. Millions will face heat-related health risks as conditions reach extreme levels into this week, according to a scale from the National Weather Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heat is the\u00a0deadliest form of weather\u00a0in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. Persistent heat could break records this week The extreme temperatures and uncomfortable heat will seep into the larger cities of the Midwest and Northeast by the start of the workweek. On Monday, Chicago temperatures could hit 94 degrees with the heat index at 97 degrees, according to forecasters at Chicago\u2019s weather service office. The high temperatures for the Upper Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions will soar into the mid- and upper 90s on Monday, with the possibility of tying or breaking numerous records, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The potential for record-shattering heat will last across the Ohio Valley and the Northeast through Friday, with some areas hitting heat indices of 105 degrees, the Weather Prediction Center said. A Level 3 heat risk is expected to affect large portions of states including Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio on Monday, according to the weather service. Meanwhile, much of the southern half of Iowa faces an extreme heat risk on Monday. Weather service forecasters in Des Moines, Iowa, warned of high heat and humidity through Tuesday as temperatures push into the 90s and heat index values hit near-triple digits. \u201cMorning lows will be just as impressive, as temperatures remain in the mid- to even upper 70s,\u201d the Weather Prediction Center said. \u201cThe combination of heat, humidity and little overnight relief will bring potentially widespread, significant heat-related impacts to anyone without adequate hydration or reliable cooling,\u201d according to the center. In Detroit, where daytime temperatures are expected to hit the high 90s, the city\u2019s urban core won\u2019t see much relief after dark, where weather service forecasters say overnight lows will only dip to the 70s this week.

It\u2019s not the only area of tropical concern looming large this week as a predicted hyperactive hurricane season kicks into gear. The system threatening the southwestern Gulf Coast has been designated Potential Tropical Cyclone One by the National Hurricane Center as it tries to get organized in the Gulf of Mexico. It will unload torrential rainfall and considerably ramp up the flood threat, not just in the US, but also in parts of Mexico and Central America. As the name suggests, Potential Tropical Cyclone One isn\u2019t quite a tropical storm yet, but is expected to become one and poses a threat to the areas in the tropical storm warning over the next 48 hours. The system had 40 mph winds Tuesday morning \u2013 strong enough that if it does develop a coherent circulation, it would be named Tropical Storm Alberto. It\u2019s forecast to by late Tuesday or Wednesday before approaching the northern coast of Mexico on Wednesday night. The system\u2019s strength will be limited by its short time over water, but it\u2019s main threat of significant rain and flooding will not: multiple days of gushing rainfall for parts of Central America, southern Mexico\u00a0and the US western Gulf Coast. Heavy rain was already ongoing Monday in parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras as the gyre churned. Double-digit rainfall totals are possible in these areas by Thursday. Rain is needed desperately in parts of Mexico and Central America that are bone-dry after weeks of unrelenting heat. But day after day of heavy rain will quickly overwhelm parched soils unable to absorb water as fast as it falls, resulting in dangerous flooding. Deep tropical moisture was also fueling storms as far north as the US\u2019s western Gulf Coast. Double-digit rainfall totals are likely in portions of coastal and southern Texas by the weekend, while other portions of the Gulf Coast could pick up several inches through midweek. A level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place for the Texas coast Tuesday and much of South Texas on Wednesday. By Wednesday, the air over the Gulf Coast will be loaded up with \u201cincredible amounts of moisture\u201d which could \u201ceasily\u201d produce flash flooding, the Weather Prediction Center warned Monday. Heavy rain isn\u2019t the most welcome sight along some parts of the US Gulf Coast. June has been drier after a drenching spring, but the soil and area rivers are still holding on to plenty of water in eastern Texas and western Louisiana. Another tropical threat could take shape Another tropical threat is stirring in the Atlantic as development gets underway in the Gulf of Mexico. An area of showers and thunderstorms a few hundred miles east of the Bahamas could be the starting point for a potential tropical system later this week. Right now, the National Hurricane Center gives it a low chance of developing into a tropical system. Multiple atmospheric factors must align for the area of stormy weather to get its act together, but the opportunity for development exists over the next few days as it slowly pushes westward. If something tropical does develop, it could approach the southeastern US by Thursday or Friday and be steered south of the heat dome roasting areas farther north. It\u2019s unclear exactly which areas could be impacted, but anywhere from Florida to the Carolinas should keep a close eye on the forecast as it comes into focus in the coming days. Drenching rain could soak parts of the Southeast coast and rough seas are possible from the Bahamas to the mid-Atlantic coasts regardless of development.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/weather/hurricane-season-gulf-coast-flooding/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}

In recent weeks, the intensity of cross-border attacks between the two has increased, raising concerns over the prospect of a full-blown war. Those prospects took a turn for the worse Tuesday, when Hezbollah flaunted a 9-minute video filmed by a drone showing civilian and military locations in and around one of Israel\u2019s largest cities, Haifa. The video prompted Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz to warn of an \u201call-out war\u201d in which \u201cHezbollah will be destroyed, and Lebanon severely beaten.\u201d On Wednesday, Nassrallah celebrated the video as evidence of its growing ability to gather intelligence. \u201cThe enemy knows that no place in the entire (state) is safe from our missiles, and it won\u2019t be arbitrary. Everything will be deliberately targeted,\u201d Nasrallah said in his speech. \u201cWe have long hours of footage of Haifa, of the outskirts of Haifa, and what comes after Haifa, and after after Haifa,\u201d Nasrallah said, in an apparent reference to a Hezbollah slogan from the 2006 war with Israel, when the group\u2019s rockets hit Haifa for the first time. In response to the threat by Nasrallah, Cyprus\u2019 President Nikos Christodoulides said the island was in \u201cno way involved in the war conflicts.\u201d \u201cThe Republic of Cyprus is not part of the problem. The Republic of Cyprus is part of the solution,\u201d Christodoulides said. \u201cAnd our role in this, as demonstrated, for example, through the humanitarian corridor, is recognized not only by the Arab world but by the international community as a whole.\u201d What the drone footage shows Parts of the Hezbollah footage, filmed in the daytime, claimed to show Krayot, a cluster of \u201chighly populated\u201d residential cities north of the Israeli city of Haifa and 28 km (17 miles) south of the Lebanese border, along with malls and high rises. Other parts claimed to show a military complex near Haifa belonging to Israeli weapons manufacturer Rafael \u2013 including Iron Dome batteries, missile storage sites and radar sites \u2013 and military boats, ships and oil storage depots in the port of Haifa.  CNN analysis has geolocated the video to a number of locations around Haifa. Those locations include a number of sensitive areas, including at least two military installations: a base in northern Haifa and the port of Haifa. The drone also flew over the oil tanks that sit north of Haifa, the Haifa airport and several residential areas. CNN also analyzed the shadows in the videos, which indicate the drone mission over Haifa lasted multiple hours, or took place over multiple days. The analysis shows parts of the video have been sped up. Weapons expert Wim Zwijnenburg, project leader for humanitarian disarmament at the Dutch peace organization PAX, told CNN that a drone visible in the footage appears to be \u201can Iranian-origin model of a Qasaf-2k, possibly manufactured locally.\u201d \u2018Psychological terror\u2019 The mayor of Haifa, Yona Yahav, has described the video as \u201cpsychological terror\u201d and demanded a protection plan for his city, criticizing IDF commanders for not having visited Haifa since the October 7 Hamas attack. \u201cI demand that the government present a plan for the massive defense of Haifa and find a military solution to eliminate the threat posed from the north,\u201d Yahav told Israeli radio station\u00a0Reshet Bet. Hezbollah has claimed the video was the \u201cfirst episode,\u201d suggesting more videos would surface from deep inside Israeli territory. A Hezbollah lawmaker in the Lebanese parliament who referenced the video in a social media post has also suggested more is to come. \u201cThis is what the party [Hezbollah] announced and you saw, but what is hidden is greater and greater and greater! Haifa and beyond, beyond, and beyond Haifa,\u201d Ibrahim Mousawi said in the post. His message appears to be a reference to a phrase coined by Nasrallah during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, when he said the militant group would fire rockets at Haifa \u201cand beyond Haifa\u201d. However, Israeli government spokesman David Mencer called the drone video the usual \u201cmischief making propaganda\u201d and said \u201cwe know precisely how to deal with [Hezbollah] one way or the other \u2013 diplomatically or through military means.\u201d Israeli military increasing readiness Israel has been preparing for the possibility that diplomatic efforts to reduce hostilities with Hezbollah could fail. The release of the footage comes as Israel\u2019s military says it has \u201capproved and validated\u201d operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon and made decisions on increasing the readiness of troops in the field. The plans were approved by the commanding officer of the Northern Command and the head of the Operations Directorate during a joint situational assessment to prepare for the continuation of combat, the IDF said in a statement. The approval of the operational plans does not mean a war between Israel and Hezbollah is imminent \u2013 but it does signal that Israel intends to be ready for such a scenario. In response to the Hezbollah video, the IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said Wednesday that the Israeli military was \u201cpreparing and coming up with solutions to deal with these and other capabilities. \u201cWe have many more forces in the IDF that are engaged in an offensive against Hezbollah,\u201d Halevi said in a conversation with Israeli troops at an aerial defense battery along Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon. \u201cI believe the enemy knows only a little about the capabilities we have and will face them, when necessary, at the right time,\u201d Halevi added. Hezbollah has fired more than 5,000 rockets, missiles and drones at northern Israel since October 7, claiming that its attacks are in solidarity with the Palestinian people. Hezbollah has said in the past that it will only stop firing on Israel if Israel stops the war in Gaza. For its part, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Lebanon and evacuated approximately 60,000 residents from the northern border. More than 90,000 Lebanese have also fled their homes in the area. The US has sought a diplomatic off-ramp to avoid a wider war that could spread to the region, sending special envoy Amos Hochstein to Israel and Lebanon this week to try to ease tensions. Israel and Hezbollah exchanged more cross-border fire on Wednesday in the latest round of hostilities on the combative border, a day after the visit by the Biden aide ended. Hezbollah revealed that four of its fighters from southern Lebanon were killed without specifying when or how they died. The Iran-backed group also announced it had targeted Metula and Kryat Shmona in northern Israel with drones. Videos shared by Lebanese media close to Hezbollah showed plumes of smoke rising from the southern Lebanese village of Burghalia after an Israeli strike, with more strikes on other Lebanese villages including Mais Al-Jabal, Talat Al-Awaida, Al-Khiyam and Hula, according to the state-run news agency NNA.

{"id": "2024_06_19_asia_japan-nintendo-new-zelda-announcement-intl-hnk", "text": "Nintendo has dropped a fresh surprise for fans \u2013 a new Zelda title where gamers will finally be able to play the titular princess from the legendary fantasy series. Nintendo has racked up over 140 million sales of Zelda since the first edition title hit the shelves in 1986, making it one of the most successful franchises in gaming history and\u00a0delighting generations of fans across multiple consoles. The new game, \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom,\u201d will release on the Switch console on September 26, according to a statement from Nintendo. The many iterations of the games usually revolve around the heroic elf Link, who spends most of his adventures trying to save Princess Zelda who, more often than not, has been kidnapped or mysteriously disappeared. But this latest release will be female-led. \u201cThis time around Link has vanished. Now it\u2019s up to Princess Zelda to step into the protagonist\u2019s role,\u201d Eiji Aonuma, producer of the Zelda series, said in a video released by Nintendo. Gameplay footage released by Nintendo shows \u201cEchoes of Wisdom\u201d looks similar in both style and substance to 2019\u2019s \u201cLink\u2019s Awakening,\u201d the top-down perspective puzzle-based platformer that boasted a cute cartoon design and was itself a reboot of the Game Boy classic from 1993. Zelda teams up with Tri, a mysterious fairy, and together they use magical powers to create echoes, what Nintendo describes as \u201cimitations of things found in the environment.\u201d \u201cRecreate those echoes whenever you like to solve puzzles and defeat enemies,\u201d Nintendo said in its announcement. \u201cUse echoes of water blocks to reach new heights, make bridges out of old beds, throw rocks at foes \u2013 or find your own creative combination of echoes to do things your way,\u201d the company said. The Zelda franchise has long been lauded for entertaining puzzle solving and ground-breaking gameplay that encourages players to both explore at leisure and tackle problems in different ways. Open world gaming has become a major feature of more recent titles with 2017\u2019s \u201cBreath of the Wild\u201d becoming one of Nintendo\u2019s most successful and critically acclaimed titles. The follow-up to that game, last year\u2019s \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d sold 10 million copies in just three days. The release of a new Zelda game is the second surprise announcement Nintendo has dropped in recent weeks. In early May, Nintendo\u2019s president Shuntaro Furukawa\u00a0said the company plans to release a follow-up to its popular Switch console by March 2025. The announcement was welcome news to fans who have been salivating for years over the prospect of a potential successor to the 7-year-old Switch.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/asia/japan-nintendo-new-zelda-announcement-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_style_lagos-fashion-lgbtq-inclusivity", "text": "Since its inception in 2011,\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week has been a twice-yearly highlight of the African fashion calendar, a multi-day\u00a0showcase attracting the continent\u2019s top design\u00a0houses, big name sponsors, as well as an international audience. In a deeply religious and conservative Nigeria,\u00a0where\u00a0LGBTQ\u00a0people suffer extremely high\u00a0levels of homophobia, intolerance, and even violence,\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week quickly established itself as an inclusive space for marginalized communities and unconventional brands to be seen and heard. For more than a decade, Nigerian label Orange Culture has staged catwalk shows featuring male models in skirts, makeup, or wearing ribbons down the runway as a way of provoking conversations about how fashion can be used to break down gender norms. Maxivive \u2014\u00a0which\u00a0describes\u00a0itself\u00a0as \u201ca\u00a0Lagos-based fashion organization founded\u2026 on ideas of nonconformity and the subversion of norms\u201d \u2014\u00a0has\u00a0also made waves showcasing graphic, gender-bending pieces addressing issues around sexuality and identity over consecutive seasons. Over the past few years however, members of the\u00a0LGBTQ community\u00a0in Nigeria say\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week\u2019s inclusive stance has come under pressure amidst a growing culture of hostility towards non-binary and gay people in the country. In 2014, despite widespread international condemnation, Nigeria \u2014 Africa\u2019s most populous nation \u2014\u00a0adopted the SSMPA law (Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act)\u00a0which bans gay marriage, same-sex relationships and membership of gay rights groups with punishments including a prison term of up to 14 years for those convicted. Gay\u00a0rights\u00a0activists say these sentiments are filtering down into what was one of Nigeria\u2019s most open-minded industries: Fashion. Kayode Timileyin is the founder of Queercity Media and Production, one of the leading non- governmental\u00a0queer organizations in Nigeria as well as being the festival manager for\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Pride, a week-long celebration in June to commemorate Pride month in Nigeria. \u201cThere is a history of anti-queerness when it comes to fashion week in Nigeria,\u201d he told CNN. Activists point to the city\u2019s Spring-Summer 2022 showcase, featuring the late Fola Francis \u2014 the first-ever transgender person\u00a0to be cast by labels to model on the city\u2019s catwalk.\u00a0 Francis tragically drowned in December 2023. While her debut was hailed as a watershed moment in both African fashion and for the queer community at large (she walked twice, for labels Cute-Saint and Fruch\u00e9), it also sparked controversy. At the time, Francis said she faced a public backlash from some sections of Nigerian society\u00a0and pointed out that despite her boundary-breaking appearances, no images of her were posted on\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week\u2019s social media accounts.\u00a0In\u00a0an interview with digital LGBTQ magazine Xtra\u00a0shortly after the event in November 2022, Francis said \u201cI heard the\u00a0Lagos Fashion Week\u2019s team decided not to post any of my pictures from the runway or include (them) in any press releases. Why am I not surprised?\u201d (The magazine said they approached\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week at the time, who did not respond to their requests for comment.) After casting non-binary models to walk on its catwalk during the Spring-Summer 2023 shows, subversive fashion house Maxivive had its show cancelled by organizers just days before it was meant to go ahead. While brand founder Papa Oyeyemi told CNN he would prefer not to talk about the cancellation, discussion within the industry centered around the presentation having been deemed \u201ctoo gay\u201d by organizers. \u201cFor the presentation to get cancelled at the last minute was very disheartening,\u201d one non-binary model booked to walk for Maxivive told CNN (they wished to remain anonymous for their safety). \u201cQueer people exist in Nigeria and fashion is meant to be expressive, not restrictive.\u201d Tosin Ogundadegbe, a Lagos-based fashion stylist\u00a0known as \u201cThe Style Infidel\u201d on social\u00a0media said that the fashion industry in Nigeria still has a long way to go when it comes to\u00a0inclusivity. \u201cThe traditional fashion schedule suffers from (a lack of) inclusivity on the runway \u2014 we only see representation of marginalized communities at private shows.\u201d Finding the freedom to be who you are Indeed, amid what\u2019s perceived as a growing pressure for organizers to adhere to anti-gay laws and increasingly divisive politics around gender, sexuality and inclusivity in Nigeria, an increasing number of fashion labels have chosen to show \u201coff-schedule\u201d via \u201cunderground\u201d private presentations where they feel they can be more free to embody the ethos of their brands, rather than in the glare of\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week. From labels such as\u00a0Tzar Studios,\u00a0a \u201cvisually provocative contemporary menswear brand\u2026 inspired by the ethos of the metrosexual man,\u201d to\u00a0ready-to-wear brand\u00a0Weiz Dhurm Franklyn, these\u00a0clandestine, \u201cinvite only\u201d shows are curated by designers who keep locations discreet and hand-pick trusted journalists, influencers, celebrities and fashion industry figures to sit in the audience. Udiahgebi, a fashion brand known for its androgynous pieces, has successfully hosted private shows in this way. The house\u00a0cast five non-binary models to walk in its first-ever runway show in 2022 to a positive reception, brand creative director Chiemerie Udiahgebi Ugwoke told CNN. \u201cThe feedback after my show was\u00a0alarmingly good,\u201d they wrote over email. \u201cI was not expecting positive reviews from the attendees because\u2026 I took gender-neutral clothes (featuring see-through fabrics, animal prints and cut-outs) and played with them in a way I felt was more likely to attract negative reviews\u00a0considering the society we live in.\u201d Aso Nigeria, another androgynous and inclusive fashion label, cast Fola Francis in both its\u00a0private runway show in December 2022\u00a0and a fashion advertising campaign released in February 2024.\u00a0Brand founder\u00a0Aanuoluwa Ajide-Daniels told CNN that including a trans woman was \u201cessential to the idea of the brand, and something that will be seen throughout the lifespan of Aso.\u201d \u201cI see fashion as art, it is meant to start a conversation and also provoke thought,\u201d said Kayode Timileyin. \u201cHowever, over the years, (Lagos) Fashion Week continues to hush down and limit these conversations.\u201d\u00a0While championing an inclusive future for the artists and fashion designers of Africa cannot solely be done behind closed doors; for now, many designers believe it is the only \u2014 and an essential \u2014 way to be able to freely express who they are.

{"id": "2024_06_18_china_north-korea-russia-putin-kim-visit-ukraine-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "As Russian President Vladimir Putin makes his first visit to North Korea in more than two decades, his focus is widely seen to be on securing ongoing support from the hermit nation for his grinding war in Ukraine. Putin ramped up his outreach to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year as his weapons stockpiles dwindled \u2013 and munitions and missiles have flowed from the country to Russia since a landmark summit between the two leaders in September, multiple governments say, even as both Pyongyang and Moscow deny the transfers. But while the leaders\u2019 meeting in the globally isolated, Soviet-style capital of Pyongyang provides an opportunity for the two autocrats to discuss how to expand that cooperation, observers say it will have consequences far beyond the battlefield in Ukraine. Putin\u2019s arrival in Pyongyang in the early hours of Wednesday local time for the two-day visit marks a significant step forward for a partnership founded on shared hostility to the West and its allies \u2013 one that empowers both leaders and deepens global fault lines. The two are expected to ink a new strategic partnership agreement, with Putin saying ahead of the visit that they would \u201cshape the architecture of equal and indivisible security in Eurasia,\u201d according to the Kremlin. \u201cThe relationship is not just about necessity,\u201d said Edward Howell, a lecturer in politics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who focuses on the Korean Peninsula. \u201cWe are seeing the two states forge an increasingly concerted united front and alignment against the United States and the West.\u201d These divisions were only underscored by the timing of the visit, which comes on the heels of Putin\u2019s meeting with close ally Chinese leader Xi Jinping last month and after democratic leaders from the Group of Seven (G7) used a summit in Italy to again show their solidarity against Moscow\u2019s war. It also comes as North Korea has railed against growing security cooperation between the US and its allies South Korea and Japan, raising concerns with its escalated rhetoric and ongoing tests to bolster an extensive illegal weapons program. It remains publicly unknown just what Pyongyang is receiving in return for its support for Russia\u2019s war. But governments from Seoul to Washington will be watching closely for signs of how far the warring Russian leader, who in the past supported international controls on North Korea\u2019s illegal weapons program, is willing to go to back Kim\u2019s bellicose regime. What do Russia and North Korea want from each other? In the months after Kim rode his armored train through the country\u2019s Far East region for a landmark September summit with Putin, North Korean munitions appeared to pour into Russia \u2013 and be fired in its assault on Ukraine. Russia has received more than 10,000 shipping containers \u2013 the equivalent of 260,000 metric tons of munitions or munitions-related material \u2013 from North Korea since September, according to a US statement in February. Russian forces have also launched at least 10 North Korea-made missiles on Ukraine since September, a US official also said in March. The weapons may be of lesser quality than Russia\u2019s own, but have helped Russia replenish its dwindling stockpiles and keep pace with the weapons support Ukraine is receiving from the West, observers say. The arrangement may also enable North Korea to gain real-world intel on the functioning of its weaponry and help it ramp up exports more broadly. In an article published in North Korea state media ahead of the visit, Putin thanked Pyongyang for showing \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and said the two countries were \u201cready to confront the ambition of the collective West.\u201d Putin is widely seen as set to use his visit, which Kim invited him to make last September, to secure ongoing support. Less is known about exactly what compensation Pyongyang has received so far in return. South Korean officials have said the North is receiving shipments of food and other necessities from Russia, and there is no shortage of needs for the sanctions-strapped economy, which in addition to food lacks fuel and raw materials \u2013 but also seeks to advance its space, missile and nuclear programs. Putin signaled a willingness to assist North Korea in developing its space and satellite program during their September meeting, which took place, fittingly, at a rocket launch facility. There have since been signs that such assistance has taken place, including the successful launch of North Korea\u2019s first military reconnaissance satellite the \u201cMalligyong-1\u201d weeks after the visit, following two failed attempts. Such satellites can help North Korea improve its ground-based military capabilities, for example enabling it to more accurately target opponents\u2019 forces with its own missiles.  United Nations member states are barred from directly or indirectly aiding North Korea\u2019s missile programs as well as engaging in arms transfers with Pyongyang. But Kim is also eyeing access to know-how for a range of Russian advanced weaponry, experts say, as well as technology linked to uranium enrichment, reactor designs or nuclear propulsion for submarines. The North Korean leader sees his weapons programs as essential to the survival of his regime, according to analysts. \u201cKim Jong Un will be interested in asking the world from Russia, whether he\u2019ll get that or not is another question,\u201d said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow in the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington. It\u2019s unlikely that Putin would be \u201ctoo eager to necessarily initiate cooperation on those issues (nuclear related technologies) when there\u2019s a long list of less sensitive technologies that the Russians can part with\u201d like improving radar or surface-to-air missile systems, he said. When asked last week about Western concerns that Russia is considering the transfer of sensitive technologies to Pyongyang, a Kremlin spokesperson said the countries\u2019 \u201cpotential for developing bilateral relations\u201d was \u201cprofound\u201d and \u201cshould not cause concern to anyone and should not and cannot be challenged by anyone.\u201d \u2018A tragic world\u2019 However, any support from Putin \u2013 a leader of a UN Security Council permanent member state \u2013 is a significant boon for Kim, who is deeply isolated on the world stage. For Putin, too, the visit is an opportunity to send a signal, or a threat, that Russia is not alone. \u201cPutin is highlighting that Russia has friends \u2013 and is propagating the idea that the war is not winnable for Ukraine because Russia will not run out of weapons,\u201d said John Erath, senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation non-profit in Washington. The Russian leader may also see the relationship with Kim as a way to raise the specter of nuclear war, exploiting \u201cUS and South Korean concerns about North Korea,\u201d so that \u201cUkraine\u2019s friends will compel it to seek a negotiated \u2018solution\u2019 on Russia\u2019s terms,\u201d Erath added. Putin laid out his peace conditions on Friday ahead of a Ukraine-backed international peace summit over the weekend that Russia did not attend. They included the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from four partially occupied regions \u2013 a position seen as nonstarter by Kyiv and its allies. And in his letter published in North Korea state media ahead of the visit, Putin framed the two countries as both facing down what he called US efforts to impose a \u201cneocolonialist dictatorship\u201d over the world. Observers agree that Putin is unlikely at this point to directly help North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, as neither Putin nor his close partner Xi want to see nuclear confrontation in the region. But it\u2019s also become clear that growing North Korea-Russia ties, as well as the widening chasm between Russia, China and the West, is impacting international efforts to control North Korea\u2019s weapons program. Russia in March vetoed a UN resolution to renew an independent panel of experts investigating the country\u2019s violations of Security Council sanctions. China abstained from the vote. Both countries in recent years have blocked movement in the council related to North Korea as they grew skeptical of US-backed sanctions. Deepening divisions today contrast collaboration in recent decades between Russia, China and the US, according to former US Ambassador to Russia and National Security Council official Michael McFaul. He pointed to his experiences during the former US President Barack Obama administration working on nonproliferation efforts related to North Korea and Iran. \u201c(Then) we were cooperating with the Russians on both of these fronts \u2026 we were meeting, we had the same objectives \u2026 and the Chinese were with us on lockstep on both of those accounts,\u201d McFaul said in a podcast last month hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. \u201cNow look at where we\u2019re at today, completely the opposite \u2026 we\u2019re not cooperating at all on either of those accounts \u2026 that is a brand-new world and a tragic world.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/china/north-korea-russia-putin-kim-visit-ukraine-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_sport_serbia-slovenia-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "The Football Association of Serbia has written to the UEFA Secretary General following a chant\u00a0reportedly\u00a0heard at a European Championships \u2013 Euro 2024 \u2013 match between Croatia and Albania on Wednesday in Hamburg. In the letter to UEFA\u00a0General Secretary\u00a0Theodore Theodoridis\u00a0on Thursday, the assocation describes it as \u201cshameful\u00a0joint chanting by fans of both national teams, which was directed against the Serbian\u00a0nation as a whole.\u201d The chant, the\u00a0Serbian\u00a0association said, was \u201ckill, kill, kill the Serb.\u201d The General Secretary of the Football Association of Serbia, Jovan \u0160urbatovi\u0107, also threatened to pull the Serbia team out of the tournament, according\u00a0to Serbia state broadcaster Radio Television of Serbia (RTS/PTC)\u00a0in comments published on Wednesday evening. \u201cWhat\u00a0happened is scandalous and we will ask UEFA for sanctions, even if it means not continuing the competition,\u201d\u00a0\u0160urbatovi\u0107 said, according to RTS. On Thursday, UEFA said it had appointed an inspector \u201cto conduct an investigation regarding potential racist and/or discriminatory conduct by supporters\u201d during Croatia\u2019s game against Albania. Serbia played its second Group C match in Euro 2024 against Slovenia earlier on Thursday, drawing 1-1 to keep alive its chances of qualifying for Euro 2024\u2019s knockout stages.\u00a0Albania and Croatia drew 2-2 in their match Wednesday. Animosity between Croatian and Albanian fans towards Serbia stems from the 1990s and the Balkan conflicts and are generally seen as being ethnic and political grievances. The issues\u00a0include a\u00a0focus around the issue of Kosovo, a former\u00a0autonomous province of Serbia but has majority ethnic Albanians. In the letter posted online by the Football Association of Serbia it asked UEFA, the governing\u00a0body of European football, to \u201cpunish those responsible\u201d for their actions and reminded the organization \u201cthat this kind of rampage, hatred and racism represent everything that your organization is fighting against.\u201d The letter also details the exact time the chant was\u00a0reportedly\u00a0heard \u2013 the 58th\u00a0minute \u2013 and accused an\u00a0unnamed\u00a0Albanian player of using a megaphone after the game\u00a0of \u201cinflaming\u201d the crowd\u00a0using the same chant. The Croatian Football Federation told CNN that, as far as it was aware, its fans were not involved in any racist or discriminatory chants during the match against Albania, and said it was not mentioned in the UEFA delegate\u2019s report. CNN has contacted the Albanian soccer federation for comment on the Football Association of Serbia\u2019s\u00a0letter. On Thursday, UEFA also said it was also investigating the \u201calleged inappropriate behaviour\u201d of Albania\u2019s forward Mirlind Daku. It did not specify if this was the player Serbia referred to in its letter. Since the beginning of the tournament last week, the Serbian and Albanian soccer associations have each been fined by UEFA for fan incidents. UEFA said they have fined the Albanian Football Association\u00a0for four incidents at their opening match versus Italy \u2013 lighting\u00a0off fireworks, throwing objects, pitch invasion and \u201ctransmitting provocative messages not fit for a sports event.\u201d In total, Albania was fined\u00a037,375 euros (approximately $40,000)\u00a0for the incidents. Following Serbia\u2019s 1-0 loss to England on Sunday,\u00a0the Kosovar Football Association submitted a request to UEFA for a banner and chants\u00a0reportedly\u00a0sung by\u00a0Serbian\u00a0fans\u00a0at its match.\u00a0The statement called the chants \u201cchauvinistic and racist.\u201d UEFA has fined Serbia for fans\u00a0\u201ctransmitting a provocative message not fit for a sports event\u201d and throwing of objects. Both of which resulted in a\u00a0total 14,500 euro (approximately $15,500)\u00a0fine. Serbia vs. Slovenia Serbia scored a dramatic stoppage-time equalizer to draw 1-1 against Slovenia on Thursday, a result which keeps its Euro 2024 dreams very much alive. Luka Jovi\u0107\u2019s header in the 95th minute of the match sparked frenzied scenes inside Munich\u2019s Allianz Arena, a goal which also denied Slovenia its first ever win at a European Championships. \u017dan Karni\u010dnik had seemingly won the game for Slovenia after his second-half strike, but Serbia kept playing until securing its dramatic equalizer in the very last passage of play. The result means Serbia sits bottom of Group C on one point, with Slovenia in second with two points.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/sport/serbia-slovenia-euro-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_asia_us-condemns-china-scs-collision-philippines-intl-hnk", "text": "The United States on Monday condemned China over a collision with the Philippines in the disputed South China Sea, the latest in a series of increasingly fraught confrontations that have raised the potential of a flashpoint for global conflict in the vital waterway. A Chinese vessel and a Philippine supply ship collided near Second Thomas Shoal in the contested\u00a0Spratly Islands early Monday, according to statements from both nations, which blamed each other for the incident. China\u2019s Coast Guard said it took measures including \u201cwarnings and interceptions, boarding inspections and forced evictions\u201d against the Philippine vessels. China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims. In a post on X, Washington\u2019s ambassador to Manila MaryKay Carlson said the US condemned China\u2019s \u201caggressive, dangerous maneuvers,\u201d which \u201ccaused bodily injury\u201d and \u201cdamaged Philippine vessels.\u201d Neither the Philippines nor China reported injuries or damage from the collision, which comes just weeks after Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr. warned that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the South China Sea would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war. Marcos has sought closer ties with the US, which\u00a0has repeatedly stressed Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad commitment\u201d to a 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines that stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party. The incident Monday is the latest in a string of recent confrontations between Manila and Beijing that have raised concerns among Western observers of potentially developing into an international incident if China, a global power, decides to act more forcefully against the Philippines. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Monday the \u201cUnited States stands with its ally the Philippines and condemns the escalatory and irresponsible actions\u201d by China. Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell on Monday discussed the collision with Philippine Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Maria Theresa Lazaro. China had \u201cobstructed the Philippines from executing a lawful maritime operation in the South China Sea, interfering with the Philippines\u2019 freedom of navigation,\u201d Campbell said, according to a State Department readout. The latest incident marks the first run-in between the two countries since a new law in China took effect Saturday to authorize its coast guard to seize foreign ships and detain crews suspected of trespassing for up to 60 days without trial. The Chinese coast guard on Monday said a Philippine supply ship \u201cignored China\u2019s repeated solemn warnings\u201d and \u201cdeliberately and dangerously\u201d approached a Chinese vessel in \u201can unprofessional manner,\u201d resulting in a collision. \u201cThe Philippines is entirely responsible for this,\u201d the coast guard said in a statement, a charge rejected by the Philippine military as \u201cdeceptive and misleading.\u201d Instead, Philippine authorities accused Chinese ships of \u201cdangerous maneuvers\u201d that included \u201cramming and towing\u201d of Philippines vessels. In a statement on X, Philippine army spokesperson Col. Francel Margareth Padilla said the \u201cmain issue remains to be the illegal presence and actions of Chinese vessels within the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone, which infringes on our sovereignty and sovereign rights.\u201d \u2018Dangerous and reckless behavior\u2019 In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its territorial claims in the strategically important and resource-rich waterway. Over the past year China Coast Guard ships \u2013 reinforced by maritime militia boats \u2013 have been involved in multiple clashes that have damaged Philippine ships and seen Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. Known as Ayungin Shoal in the Philippines and Ren\u2019ai Jiao in China, Second Thomas Shoal is a submerged teardrop-shaped reef\u00a0located about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the Philippine island of Palawan. It lies in the Spratly Islands, a mostly uninhabited archipelago where oil and gas reserves have been found, and which is claimed by China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. The Philippine ship was on a mission Monday to supply its soldiers stationed on the BRP Sierra Madre, a rusting US-built Philippine Navy landing craft that was run aground deliberately in 1999, with a national flag hoisted on board, to assert the Philippines\u2019 territorial claims over Second Thomas Shoal. China Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu\u00a0on Monday accused a supply ship and two rubber boats from the Philippines of \u201cillegally\u201d delivering supplies to the stranded warship. \u201cWe once again warn the Philippines: Any form of infringement and provocation is futile. The Chinese Coast Guard is on full alert and ready to resolutely safeguard national territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,\u201d Gan said in a statement. In a departure from past confrontations with China when his team were quick to issue statements and visuals, Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela provided no comment to CNN on the collision. The Armed Forces of the Philippines also declined to give details of the latest run-in. Instead, Philippine officials made broad statements denouncing China\u2019s actions. \u201cChina\u2019s dangerous and reckless behavior in the West Philippine Sea shall be resisted by the (Armed Forces of the Philippines.) Their behavior contravenes their statements of good faith and decency,\u201d said Philippine Defense Minister Gilberto C. Teodoro, Jr. \u201cWe will exert our utmost in order to fulfill our sworn mandate to protect our territorial integrity, sovereignty, and sovereign rights. It should now be clear to the international community that China\u2019s actions are the true obstacles to peace and stability in the South China Sea.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/asia/us-condemns-china-scs-collision-philippines-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_siro-one-zaabeel-dubai-hotel-wellness-tech-spc", "text": "Stepping into SIRO\u2019s \u201crecovery lab\u201d is more like walking through a space station than a spa. There are cryogenic chambers, touchless vibroacoustic therapy beds, and an MRI-like infrared capsule that looks clinical rather than calming. \u201cThe industry is evolving,\u201d says Desmond Cawley, hotel manager at SIRO, One Za\u2019abeel. It styles itself as Dubai\u2019s \u201cfirst fitness hotel,\u201d catering to professional athletes and their fitness-focused lifestyles, and was designed in consultation with AC Milan football club, Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty and boxer Ramla Ali. Its 2,000-square-foot gym is packed with state-of-the-art equipment that can track and analyze performance, smart scales and body composition analysis tools, and an app that helps guests customize their stay, from nutrition to training. Meanwhile, rooms feature alarm clocks linked to the guest\u2019s circadian rhythms, and anti-gravity rocking chairs; and in the recovery lab, treatments are less about relaxation and more about muscle recovery. \u201cAn example of that is the cryotherapy: great for (reducing) inflammation and kickstarting your metabolism,\u201d says Cawley, adding that people generally need to have experience with ice baths before trying the cryo-chamber, which is cooled to a crisp minus 85\u00b0C (minus 121 Fahrenheit). Another \u201ccool piece of space-age technology\u201d is the MLX i3Dome, which uses \u201cfar infrared technology for muscle soreness,\u201d says Cawley. This kind of light therapy treatment has its roots in NASA\u2019s experimentation with red light therapy in the 1990s to boost plant growth in space and help heal wounds in astronauts. Since then, it\u2019s been explored for a range of uses, including most recently, skincare. While the \u201cdome\u201d acts as a sauna, a light therapy helmet provides a touchless facial, using red light for collagen production, green light for an antibacterial cleanse, and blue light for \u201cproblem skin\u201d such as eczema, psoriasis, or acne. These are specialized therapies, rarely found outside of boutique clinics \u2014 and certainly not in most hotels, which even in the five-star category, have often treated fitness and health as an \u201cafterthought,\u201d says Cawley. But wellness is now a global, multi-trillion-dollar industry that brands like SIRO (and its parent company Kerzner International) are integrating into the foundations of their hospitality concept. Its Dubai location is just the beginning: SIRO, Boka Place in Montenegro will open later this year, and three more locations are already in the works. \u201cEveryone has a unique physiology, different wellness goals, aspirations,\u201d says Cawley. \u201cEverything (we do) is about optimizing performance, mitigating recovery times to get the individual back to doing what they love, whether that\u2019s on the football pitch, on the tennis court, or the gym.\u201d From \u2018Goopy\u2019 wellness to billionaire biohacking This tech-centric version of wellness is a marked departure from the \u201cGoopy decade\u201d of yoga, crystals and green juice detoxes, says Beth McGroarty, research director at the Global Wellness Institute. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s been popularized by the billionaire tech bros who are chasing, in some cases, $2-million-a-year regimes to try to fight death,\u201d says McGroarty of the \u201csuper medical, very high-tech, very complex\u201d hard care trend that is emerging. Known as \u201cbiohacking,\u201d the trend includes longevity clinics and weight loss drugs like Ozempic as people try to lower their biological age. One factor driving this trend is the pandemic: not only did it necessitate the need for \u201ctouchless\u201d treatments, it also drove a desire for more scientific health solutions, says McGroarty. But high-tech doesn\u2019t always equal scientific. \u201cSome of it feels quasi-scientific,\u201d McGroarty says, pointing to nutrient-boost IV drips, which have very little evidence to support their efficacy outside of a doctor-prescribed, hospital setting. \u201cSometimes I think there\u2019s a little bit of science-washing going on,\u201d she adds. SIRO isn\u2019t alone in targeting athletic travelers with high-tech therapies: fitness club group Equinox launched its high-tech flagship hotel in New York City in 2019, and is planning to open 33 properties over the next decade. Established medical-wellness retreats SHA Wellness and Clinique La Prairie are both expanding beyond their European flagships, with the latter opening an \u201curban longevity hub\u201d at One&Only One Za\u2019abeel, just a few floors above SIRO in Dubai. And at home, people might not be using cryogenic chambers every night, but data-led wellness is fast becoming the norm. Most smartwatches are now capable of gathering medical-grade information about your heart rate, sleep patterns, and blood oxygen, and these wearables \u201care only going to keep getting more sophisticated\u201d and sleeker, like the Oura ring, a discreet tracker that looks like jewelry, says McGroarty. With the increased accessibility of generative artificial intelligence, McGroarty sees even more potential for smart diagnostics \u2014 but adds that there\u2019s a need to create boundaries and evaluate where it\u2019s useful. \u201cWe underestimate the stress and anxiety of being constantly connected \u2014 to work, to news, to bad information, to social media,\u201d she adds. Hard care vs. \u2018radical simplicity\u2019 But not everyone is on board with this high-tech approach to wellness. While \u201chard care\u201d has been a growing space in wellness, so has \u201csoft care.\u201d In a rejection of the past decade of ultra-optimized, super-commodified wellness routines, McGroarty sees more people \u2014 specifically Gen-Z and Millennial women \u2014 adopting \u201csuper lo-fi, low-key wellness,\u201d that prioritizes social experiences and emotional well-being, such as \u201cbed rotting\u201d and \u201chot girl walks.\u201d \u201cPeople are maxed out spending on wellness and they want radical simplicity,\u201d she adds. Even at SIRO, with all its cutting-edge tech, Cawley has observed a surge of interest in mindfulness activities like meditation. \u201cHistorically, on group exercise timetables, there was a lot more strength or cardiovascular conditioning classes. Now you see more mindfulness classes, like yoga and sound healing,\u201d he says. Of course, at SIRO, there\u2019s even a high-tech alternative to this: \u201cvibroacoustic therapy,\u201d the sci-fi equivalent of a gong bath. Lying on a massage table with a waterbed in the center, guests wear noise-canceling headphones and listen to the carefully orchestrated sounds of waves crashing against a backdrop of hypnotic synth music. The waterbed vibrates with the sound, supposedly releasing stress in the body, and SIRO says it\u2019s designed for those experiencing sleep problems, stress, depression or anxiety. Tech to help you disconnect might seem excessive, but for SIRO, the integration of health data is the future of wellness, providing guests with a data-driven, personalized wellness program. \u201cWe want to utilize technology as an enabler, as opposed to a distraction,\u201d says Cawley.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/siro-one-zaabeel-dubai-hotel-wellness-tech-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_middleeast_israel-plans-tactical-pause-gaza-what-we-know-mime-intl", "text": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has announced a \u201ctactical pause\u201d of military activities along a road in southern Gaza that has been designated for humanitarian aid deliveries every day for 11 hours. The announcement comes as the strip\u2019s population of more than 2 million grapples with humanitarian conditions that the United Nations has described as \u201cunspeakable.\u201d The war, which began on October 7 in the wake of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people and captured 250 hostages, is now in its ninth month with no indication of a ceasefire-hostage deal in the immediate future. The fighting has killed more than 37,000 people so far in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the enclave. On Saturday, eight Israeli soldiers were killed in southern Gaza in one of the deadliest single incidents since the war began. More than 300 IDF soldiers have died to date. The \u201cpause,\u201d which the IDF announced Sunday but COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for approving aid into Gaza, said came into effect on Saturday, raised questions about what it means for the conflict and for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Human rights groups have described health concerns \u201cbeyond crisis levels\u201d\u00a0for Palestinians in the enclave, with over 75% of the population displaced, according to the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). Israel\u2019s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. The announcement also appeared to have deepened existing political rifts in the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unhappy when he first heard about it, according to one official. Here\u2019s what we know. What did Israel announce? The IDF announced that a \u201clocal, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes\u201d will take place every day from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. local time until further notice. The pause began Saturday, the IDF said, and is meant to allow trucks to move from the Kerem Shalom Crossing, the main entry point for incoming aid to southern Gaza, up the Salah al-Din Road and northwards. The IDF has designated a specific route for aid trucks to take, which starts from Kerem Shalom to Al Bayuk neighborhood and onto the European Hospital in Khan Younis. The route will be run in coordination with international organizations, the IDF said, as part of efforts to increase volumes of aid reaching Gaza. Soon after announcing the move, the IDF said \u201cthe fighting in Rafah continues,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no change\u201d in the country\u2019s policy on aid into the strip. In response to a question by CNN\u2019s Paula Hancocks during a briefing to international media in Kerem Shalom on Monday, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that \u201csometimes when you say a tactical pause, people might think that we\u2019re stopping the fighting in Gaza.\u201d \u201cWe should\u2019ve clarified better that we are fighting in Gaza, that we are fighting in Rafah and we created this safe pass, in those hours, to make sure the distribution (of aid) is ongoing,\u201d Hagari said. What will it mean in practice? The IDF said the \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d is meant to help the UN collect and distribute aid at its crossings, where Israel has said aid is\u00a0piling up. COGAT said on Sunday that there are 1,000 humanitarian aid trucks on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom crossing waiting to be collected and distributed. Georgios Petropoulos, head of the UN humanitarian affairs (UNOCHA) suboffice in Gaza, told CNN on Monday the pause \u201cwas not a new thing on the ground,\u201d and that there are a number of issues preventing aid workers from reaching parts of the Palestinian enclave. These include the fighting between Israel and Hamas, but also the danger that exists on travel routes as many parts of Gaza battle a state of lawlessness \u2013 where there is \u201ca lack of any police or rule of law,\u201d Petropoulos said. The pause is \u201csimply a packaging of an announcement reflecting what we have been doing here in Gaza for over a week,\u201d Petropoulos told CNN, adding that \u201cthat road was being used by the UN to move goods for days.\u201d When roads are dangerous, aid trucks cannot travel up them, he said. \u201cThe war between Hamas and Israel is not the only issue we have on the ground.\u201d It is unclear how effective the pause will be, as the IDF has previously designated other routes as safe paths for aid, only for aid convoys to be struck. In April, the deadly Israeli attack that killed seven aid workers from the non-profit World Central Kitchen (WCK) in Gaza hit what the team said was a \u201cdeconflicted zone\u201d in coordination with the Israeli military. Aid groups are saying that no difference has yet been seen on the ground. \u201cWe have not seen any improvements thus far,\u201d said Scott Anderson, director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza, stressing that \u201cthe law and order environment in Gaza is not enabling the efficient delivery of aid.\u201d The spokesperson for the UN Children\u2019s Fund, James Elder, warned the pause could not replace a ceasefire. \u201cI just don\u2019t know unfortunately (how long the pause will last), this is a question for the occupying power, for Israel and its military.\u201d What\u2019s the aid situation like in Gaza now? The more than eight-month long humanitarian crisis in Gaza is spiraling. Thousands have died in the besieged enclave, according to the health ministry there, and more than half the population has been internally displaced. Gazans are facing desperate levels of hunger, with more than 50,000 children in need of treatment for acute malnutrition, UNRWA said. Hospitals are in ruins, medical supplies are scarce and humanitarian access remains limited, the UN agency added. According to UNRWA\u2019s data, 60 trucks entered Gaza on June 12, the last batch of vehicles the UN agency has recorded. Land crossings, which aid groups say are the most effective way of getting aid into Gaza, remain limited. Out of five land crossings, only two have been open for aid trucks recently. Those are the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom and Western Erez crossings. A humanitarian pier\u00a0constructed by the US military off the coast of Gaza has also shuttered due to heavy seas, hampering maritime aid delivery. The Government Media Office (GMO) in Gaza has denied that a \u201ctactical pause\u201d is now in effect in the southern Gaza Strip. \u201cTalking about a tactical cessation of the war is an Israeli lie,\u201d the GMO said in a statement Sunday. \u201cWe are still demanding the opening of the Rafah crossing to meet the needs of the population, especially in the northern Gaza Strip.\u201d What has the Israeli government said? It is unclear who took the decision for the pause, as several senior Israeli officials seemed to have been kept in the dark ahead of the announcement. This includes the prime minister, who initially disowned the pause. According to one Israeli official, Netanyahu has raised the question of who ordered it and was unhappy when he first heard about it. The prime minister then contacted his military secretary and said the idea was unacceptable until he was assured the fighting in Rafah would continue, said the official who spoke to CNN on Sunday and requested anonymity. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir also condemned the pause. \u201cWhoever decided on a \u2018tactical pause\u2019 for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,\u201d he said. These disagreements, which burst out into the open across statements and in Israeli media, have only deepened rifts in the country\u2019s government. An IDF spokesman said Monday the pause had been approved by Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant. He said this kind of decision would first be made by COGAT and the Southern Command, and then go up the chain of command for approval, depending on the situation. When asked if this kind of decision would need approval from the Israeli government or cabinet, the spokesperson said, \u201cthis kind of decision does not necessarily need to be approved by the cabinet, and it was approved by the minister of defense.\u201d In an earlier statement Monday the IDF had said the decision was made by the military, not by the Israeli government. The announcement of the pause came \u201cafter the request of the political echelon of the IDF in recent weeks to allow the introduction of aid, and to announce this to the world,\u201d the military told CNN in a statement. The pause is meant to meet the demands of the International Court of Justice regarding Gaza aid deliveries ahead of a court hearing by the end of June, it added. The pause is \u201cintended for the hearing\u2026 at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where Israel will have to prove that it did not violate the order it issued regarding the fighting in Rafah,\u201d which prevented a court order to stop the war, the IDF said. The ICJ is investigating a case brought by Pretoria against Israel in which South Africa accuses Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians during the war. In May, it ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation in Rafah, saying the court considers the humanitarian situation in the southern city to be classified as \u201cdisastrous.\u201d Israeli officials condemned the ICJ\u2019s ruling.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/middleeast/israel-plans-tactical-pause-gaza-what-we-know-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/21/2024", "section": "world"}}
