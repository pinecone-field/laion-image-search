{"id": "2024_04_17_style_copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl", "text": "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire that tore through Copenhagen\u2019s famous stock exchange building, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_world_iran-begins-days-of-funeral-ceremonies-for-president-raisi-as-investigators-probe-helicopter-crash", "text": "The body of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has arrived in Tehran as part of funeral ceremonies scheduled to run over several days, according to state-run news agency IRNA. A video broadcast by state media shows the presidential plane arriving at Tehran\u2019s Mehrabad airport, carrying Raisi\u2019s coffin. Government and military officials lined a red carpet, and many could be seen publicly weeping as a military escort carried the coffin. According to images published by state media, a seat on the presidential plane was left empty, covered only in black cloth and a picture of Raisi laid on it. Raisi, a 63-year-old ultraconservative cleric who had once been seen as a potential successor to current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, died in a helicopter crash alongside other high-ranking officials, including the country\u2019s foreign minister, on Sunday morning. His death leaves the Islamic Republic\u2019s hardline establishment facing an uncertain future as it navigates\u00a0rising regional\u00a0tensions and domestic\u00a0discontent. Tuesday began with\u00a0funeral prayers and a procession in the northwestern city of Tabriz, the largest city in the mountainous northwestern region of Iran where the chopper crashed. Images released by state media showed large crowds dressed in black lining Martyr\u2019s Square and surrounding streets in the rain as a large truck, adorned with flowers and draped in the Iranian flag, drove through the crowds carrying the coffins of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and the others killed in Sunday\u2019s helicopter crash. In a speech in Tabriz on Tuesday, Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi said Raisi and Amir-Abdollahian \u201cset a model for brave service and diplomacy,\u201d pointing to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. \u201cWho can forget Raisi\u2019s heartfelt speeches in defense of Gaza?\u201d Vahidi said, IRNA reported. The bodies of the victims will then be transferred to the holy Shiite city of Qom, where many of the clerics who make up Iran\u2019s theocratic elite are trained, for prayers scheduled at the Fatima Masumeh shrine. On Wednesday, large ceremonies are planned in Tehran\u2019s Grand Mosallah\u00a0Mosque. Mansouri announced a public holiday and the closure of offices all over the country that day so that processions can take place. Raisi\u2019s body will then be moved to the historic Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad where Ayatollah Khamenei will conduct prayers, according to Mehr News. There is no indication what might have caused the crash \u2013 and why so many senior Iranian government officials were traveling in a single, decades-old helicopter. In the first moments after Raisi\u2019s helicopter lost contact on Sunday night, Turkey said it monitored whether or not the aircraft gave a \u201csignal,\u201d but\u00a0was unable to detect anything. \u201cWe immediately contacted the Iranian side. They also contacted us, but unfortunately it was seen that the signal system was either turned off or the helicopter did not have the signal system,\u201d said Turkish Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu, according to Turkish state broadcaster TRT. It was not clear whether he was referring to the helicopter\u2019s transponder, which the vast majority of aircraft are usually equipped with. When asked whether there was a possibility of sabotage, Uraloglu said that it was too early to comment on this issue, and said initial indications looked like an accident due to foggy weather. On Monday, Iranian media reported that the country\u2019s military chief had appointed a commission to investigate the cause of the crash, which includes military and technical experts. A high-ranking delegation will go to the crash site in Eastern Azerbaijan, according to Iran\u2019s Tasnim news agency. Autocratic partners hail a lost \u2018friend\u2019 The loss of Raisi \u2014 a conservative hardliner and protege Ayatollah Khamenei \u2014 is expected to sow further uncertainty in a country already buckling under significant economic and political strain, with tensions with nearby Israel at a dangerous high. His death triggered both domestic and international reactions \u2013 with several of Iran\u2019s autocratic partners sending both condolences and effusive praise. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese leader Xi Jinping and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un all released statements praising Raisi\u2019s legacy and hailing him as a \u201cfriend.\u201d In his message Kim described Raisi as \u201can outstanding statesman and a close friend of the (North Korean) people,\u201d adding that the leader had \u201cmade a great contribution to the cause of the Iranian people for safeguarding the sovereignty, development and interests of their country,\u201d according to North Korean state media KCNA. Xi, whose government last year played a role in brokering a landmark rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia, hailed Raisi\u2019s \u201cimportant contributions to maintaining Iran\u2019s security and stability and promoting national development and prosperity.\u201d \u201cRaisi\u2019s tragic death is a great loss to the Iranian people, and the Chinese people also lost a good friend,\u201d Xi said in a statement released by Chinese state media, adding that the two countries would continue to \u201cconsolidate and deepen\u201d their strategic partnership. Putin, who is believed by the US to be\u00a0receiving support\u00a0from Iran for his war in Ukraine, called the Iranian leader an \u201coutstanding politician\u201d and a \u201ctrue friend of Russia.\u201d Raisi made \u201can invaluable personal contribution\u201d to the development of the countries\u2019 relations, Putin\u2019s statement released by the Kremlin said. The comments come as observers have pointed to a loose but growing coordination of interests between Iran, China, North Korea and Russia over their shared animosity toward a global system they see as dominated by the US and its values. Inside Iran, where many of the country\u2019s restive youth population have grown tired of rule by conservative clerics, Raisi had a much more polarizing legacy. He was widely seen as a figure in which the Iranian\u00a0hardline establishment had heavily invested in. But he also brutally quashed a youth-led uprising over repressive laws, such as the compulsory hijab, and continued to stamp out dissent in its aftermath.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/world/iran-begins-days-of-funeral-ceremonies-for-president-raisi-as-investigators-probe-helicopter-crash/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_17_europe_ukraine-satellite-images-crimea-belbek-jets-destroyed-intl-hnk", "text": "Satellite images exclusively obtained by CNN show three destroyed Russian jets and damaged buildings at Belbek airbase in occupied port city of Sevastopol on Wednesday. The hardware losses come after two days of attacks by the Ukrainians\u00a0on Sevastopol in Crimea,\u00a0which was\u00a0illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. In images taken by US real-time space-based intelligence company\u00a0BlackSky and space technology firm Maxar, two jets can be seen burned out on the main flight line at Belbek, in addition to a third parked on a protective embankment. The satellite images also show a destroyed building nearby and another which has taken significant damage. Mikhail Razvozhaev, the Russian-appointed governor of Sevastopol, said on Telegram Friday that the Russians \u201csuccessfully repelled a massive enemy attack on Sevastopol.\u201d Razvozhaev said \u201cdozens\u201d of unmanned aerial vehicles and \u201cmore than five sea drones were destroyed.\u201d\u00a0The city suffered a partial power outage due to drone debris falling on a power substation, he added. The attack is the second time Belbek was targeted by the Ukrainians in the last 48 hours. When questioned about a possible Ukrainian strike on Belbek, Dmytro Pletenchuk, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian army\u2019s South, said on Thursday, \u201cWe cannot announce any details at this time because there is no verified information at this time.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian military for an update. An insurgent Ukrainian group in Crimea, Atesh, claimed on Telegram after the second strike that an artillery warehouse at Belbek airfield was damaged. \u201cSignificant damage to the airfield infrastructure as a result of secondary detonation was also recorded,\u201d it said. But none of the satellite images seen by CNN showed any signs that a missile or artillery weapons warehouse was hit, or that secondary detonations occurred. While Moscow appears to have the upper hand in its ground campaign more recently, Kyiv\u2019s forces have enjoyed sustained successes targeting Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, in either missile strikes or sea drone attacks. In March, Ukraine says it hit two Russian naval vessels, along with a communications center and several other facilities belonging to the Black Sea Fleet, in a huge overnight attack. Ukraine\u00a0said the vessels hit were two amphibious landing ships, the Yamal and the Azov. More than 20 Russian naval vessels have now been disabled or destroyed, a third of the entire fleet. Though Ukraine has virtually no navy of its own,\u00a0technological innovation, audacity and Russian incompetence have given it the upper hand in much of the Black Sea. In October last year, satellite imagery indicated that\u00a0Russia\u00a0relocated some of its naval ships away from Sevastopol after a series of Ukrainian attacks. Russia advances in Ukraine The attack at Belbek comes as Russia makes advances in northeastern Ukraine,\u00a0prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u00a0to\u00a0postpone his participation in all international events\u00a0in\u00a0the coming days as his troops defend against the surprise offensive\u00a0in the Kharkiv region. The offensive is the most serious\u00a0cross-border ground assault\u00a0since Ukraine recaptured the Kharkiv region in the late summer of 2022. It\u00a0comes as Ukrainians struggle with thinly stretched forces, artillery and inadequate air defenses as it awaits much-needed ammunition and weapons pledged as part of a long-delayed $2 billion US military financing package. Russian forces have taken control of more than nine villages close to the border since the start of Moscow\u2019s push. The town of Vovchansk, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Kharkiv,\u00a0Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, is the scene of some of the most intense battles. However, NATO believes Russian troops don\u2019t have the numbers necessary for a \u201cstrategic\u201d breakthrough in\u00a0Kharkiv, a senior commander of the military alliance said on Thursday. Gen. Christopher Cavoli, Supreme Allied Commander Europe, told a press conference in Brussels that while the Russians have the \u201cability to make local advances,\u201d they \u201cdon\u2019t have the skill and the capability to do it, to operate at the scale necessary to exploit any breakthrough to strategic advantage.\u201d Zelensky met with senior military officials in Kharkiv earlier on Thursday. He described an \u201cextremely difficult\u201d outlook for Kyiv\u2019s troops on the ground, where \u201cwe are strengthening our units.\u201d It comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin met Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing on Thursday and the two pledged to deepen their strategic partnership in a stark show of their\u00a0growing alignment. Russia\u2019s economy has become increasingly reliant\u00a0on China since Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and a sweeping joint\u00a0statement laid out their countries\u2019 alignment on a host of issues including energy, trade, security, and geopolitics with specific references to Ukraine.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/europe/ukraine-satellite-images-crimea-belbek-jets-destroyed-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_21_world_stonehenge-moon-lunar-standstill-scn", "text": "To those gathering over the centuries at Stonehenge \u2014 the imposing prehistoric monument that has dominated Salisbury plain in southwest England for some 4,500 years \u2014 it was likely clear how the sun could have informed its design. The central axis of the stone circle was, and still is, aligned with the sunrise at midsummer and sunset at midwinter, the stones dramatically framing the rising and setting sun when days were at their longest and shortest. But do Stonehenge and potentially other megalithic monuments around the world also align with the moon? The idea that Stonehenge was linked in some way to the moon gained ground in the 1960s. However, the concept hadn\u2019t been systematically explored, said Clive Ruggles, professor emeritus of archaeoastronomy in the school of archaeology and ancient history at the University of Leicester. This summer, archaeologists are using a little-known lunar phenomenon that happens every 18.6 years to investigate as part of their work in understanding why Stonehenge was built. Lunar standstill Like the sun, the moon rises in the east and set in the west. However, moonrise and moonset move from north to south and back again in the space of a month.\u00a0The northern and southern extremes also change over a period of about 18 and a half years. The lunar standstill is when the northernmost and southernmost moonrise and moonset are farthest apart. \u201cThe moon rise changes every day and if you track this for a month you\u2019d notice there is a northern and a southern limit beyond which the moon never rises (or sets),\u201d said Fabio Silva, senior lecturer in archaeological modeling at Bournemouth University via email. \u201cIf you were to look at these limits over 19 years you\u2019d notice them change like an accordion: they expand up to a maximum limit (the major lunar standstill) and then start contracting up to a minimum limit (the minor lunar standstill).\u201d This major lunar standstill is due to happen in January 2025, but from now until mid-2025, the moon may appear, to a casual observer, to be unusually low and high in the night sky during the lunar month. \u201cIf you\u2019re in one of those 19 years, then from time to time, you will see the moon rising or setting much further north or south than it does most times. In the years in between you never see it there,\u201d Ruggles said. Despite the phenomenon\u2019s name, the moon isn\u2019t actually standing still during this period, he said. \u201cWhat is standing still is these limits, and the moment of that happening is in January next year,\u201d Ruggles added. \u201cBut for about a year either side, if you happen to catch the moon rise at the right time, you\u2019re going to see the moon rising exceptionally low (in the sky).\u201d Stonehenge is made of two types of stone: larger sarsen stones and smaller bluestones that form two concentric circles. Ruggles said that Stonehenge\u2019s station stones, which form a rectangle around the circle, roughly align with the moon\u2019s extreme positions during the lunar standstill. How this lunar alignment was achieved, whether it was by design and its potential purpose are topics of debate that the team wants to investigate. Probing Stonehenge\u2019s celestial connections While there are no written documents that shed light on Stonehenge\u2019s meaning and significance, archaeologists have long believed its solar alignments were intentional. Such alignments have been identified in many places around the world and would have been relatively easy for ancient builders to identify, given that knowledge of the sun\u2019s yearly cycle and its connection to the seasons would have been essential to livelihood. However, it\u2019s much more difficult to say whether Stonehenge really has a connection to the lunar standstill. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can say definitively, but for me, there are some bits of evidence that made me think that it was deliberate,\u201d Ruggles said. One clue was the fact that archaeologists have found cremated human remains clustered in the southeast, near where the southernmost moonrise will take place. \u201cI think there there\u2019s a possibility that they were aware of that direction of the moon and then that became some sort of sacred direction,\u201d Ruggles said. Since April, Ruggles and Silva, along with colleagues from Bournemouth University, the University of Oxford and English Heritage, the organization that manages the site, have been documenting the moonrise and moonset at key moments when the moon is in alignment with the station stones. The moon was expected to align with the station stone rectangle twice a month from about February 2024 to November 2025, Silva said. \u201cThis will happen at different times of day and night around the year, with the moon being at the right place on different phases each month,\u201d Silva said in a news release in April. The team wants to understand what patterns of light and shadow the moon creates at Stonehenge and whether they might have held meaning to the people who built and used the monument. Other monuments with possible lunar link Stonehenge isn\u2019t the only megalithic monument potentially linked to the lunar standstill. In the United States, Erica Ellingson, emeritus professor of astrophysics at the University of Colorado Boulder, is investigating lunar alignments at Chimney Rock, a rocky ridge about 1,000 feet above a valley floor in Colorado. The landmark features two large pillar-like rocks that frame the horizon. Between the years 900 and 1150, ancestors of the Pueblo people built multi-storied buildings and ritual spaces on this difficult-to-access high place, with its dramatic view, Ellington said, and it remains an important site to the 26 Native American groups that have traditional or cultural ties to the area. \u201cThe extraordinary view of the sky between the twin pinnacles suggests an astronomical connection, but the gap is slightly too far north for the Sun to ever shine through it. The Moon, however, can be seen to rise there when it is close to its most extreme northern position, during the major lunar standstill season,\u201d she said via email. Further evidence of moon-watching comes from tree-ring dating of wooden beams in the nearby ancient buildings, which indicates their construction is linked with the dates of lunar standstills nearly 1,000 years ago, she added. The Calanais Standing Stones, situated on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland and erected before Stonehenge, may also have a link with the lunar standstill, Ruggles said. Bradley Schaefer, professor emeritus in the department of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University, said he was deeply skeptical that ancient people were aware of the lunar standstill and built monuments aligned with it. More likely, he suggested, it was a coincidence. \u201cEvery ancient site has dozens-to-hundreds of potential sightlines, and one-or-more will always point somewhere near to one of the 8 standstill directions,\u201d he said via email. The lunar standstill is hard for a casual observer of the moon to recognize, he added, and is only really visible in detailed data on observations of the moonrise and moonset. While the shift in the moon\u2019s position is subtle and historical records documenting the lunar standstill are rare and difficult to interpret, Ellington said she thinks the link is plausible because many ancient people watched the sky very closely. \u201cA moon-watcher would have seen the moon start to rise or set outside of these limits, moving farther and farther out of bounds as the major lunar standstill approached,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/world/stonehenge-moon-lunar-standstill-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

However, Polesia, a large wetland region that borders Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, remains a stronghold for the species. On March 1, 2022, a week after Russia invaded Ukraine, the first of 21 tagged greater spotted eagles crossed into Ukraine on its usual migration, according to researchers from the UK and Estonia. \u201cWhen the conflict started in February 2022, we were kind of watching things unfold on the news like everyone else, but sitting there also with the feeling that we know our birds are about to pass through that area and wondering what that might mean for them,\u201d lead study author Charlie Russell, a conservation scientist and ornithologist who is studying for his PhD at the UK\u2019s University of East Anglia, told CNN Tuesday. Using conflict data and GPS tracking, the researchers quantified the impact of the conflict on the migratory behaviour of 19 eagles who were passing though Ukraine northward to breeding grounds in southern Belarus between March and April 2022. The study authors found that the eagles diverted significantly from their usual flight path when compared to pre-conflict migrations between 2019 and 2021, with the eagles flying further and less directly to breeding grounds. While the researchers did not have direct observational evidence to determine the stimuli the birds could respond to, they thought noise and light from military activities could have affected their behavior. The deviations were found to be greater at areas where the route of migration coincided with more military activity, but it differed for each bird due to varying exposures and responses to conflict, according to the researchers. Due to greater deviations, the birds had to travel further and their migrations also took longer to complete. Females, for example, spent an average of 246 hours travelling to breeding grounds, rather than the pre-conflict time of around 193 hours, according to the study. The eagles travelled 85 kilometers (53 miles) further on average and, in an extreme case, one bird flew an extra 250 kilometers (155 miles) further compared to previous years, Russell said. Males were found to travel more slowly, averaging a speed of around 7.66 meters (25 feet) per second, rather than the pre-conflict average of around 9.75 meters (32 feet) per second. The researchers observed no difference in migration performance and deviation patterns outside of Ukraine, according to the study. Potential breeding risk The other significant finding was that the birds were making less stopovers than in previous years. Stopover sites are essential places for the eagles to get food, water, rest and refuel, and shelter from poor weather during their long journeys, according to researchers. While 18 tracked individuals \u2013 90% of the tracked eagles \u2013 made stopovers in Ukraine while migrating between 2018 and 2021, only six made stopovers in 2022. In the years before the conflict, 11 of the eagles used common stopover sites in Ukrainian Polesia, but these sites were not used at all in 2022. \u201cThe combination of these two things, having to fly forever and expend more energy, and the reduced ability to recover that energy, is something that we think will have had sublethal fitness costs, which might have carried over into the breeding period that year,\u201d Russell added. Reduced fitness and the delayed onset of breeding due to spending more time recovering from the journey could reduce breeding success, which is already relatively low in the population, as well as impact chick provisioning and the fledgling date of young birds, according to the study. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to understand the different stresses that the environment is facing as a result of conflict so that in a post-conflict setting, we can better support not just greater spotted eagles but the wider ecosystems as well to recover,\u201d Russell said. \u201cWe know very little about the impacts of human conflicts on wildlife, particularly when it comes to migratory species, so this study plugs an important knowledge gap,\u201d professor Nathalie Pettorelli, an applied ecologist and senior research fellow at the Zoological Society of London, told CNN Tuesday. Pettorelli, who was not involved in the study, added that understanding what affects the eagles\u2019 survival is \u201ckey\u201d to ensuring they have a future. \u201cMore broadly, human conflicts are on the rise globally, stressing the need for more research on the impacts of conflicts on biodiversity and, where possible, for the development of effective mitigation policies,\u201d Pettorelli said. Ukraine accused Russia of \u201cecocide\u201d after suffering an environmental catastrophe in July due to the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in the south of the country that led to more than 100 people being killed, as well as the destruction of farmland and nature reserves. Russell said the war in Ukraine is \u201creally raising the profile of some of the environmental issues caused by conflict. And it\u2019s not just in Ukraine. This is something that\u2019ll be happening to different extents at other conflict zones as well.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/world/russia-ukraine-war-migrating-eagles-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

In the state of Tabasco, where temperatures are forecast this week to surpass 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit), local media have reported up to 85 deaths, while local authorities have confirmed the trend without providing a death toll. In a statement over the weekend, Tabasco\u2019s Civil Protection agency attributed the monkeys\u2019 deaths to dehydration. A source from the agency told Reuters on Monday that monkeys have been confirmed dead in three municipalities of the state. In a forest outside Camalcalco, Tabasco, volunteers collected the corpses of mantled howler monkeys that died from high temperatures, before placing buckets of water and fruit to try to stave off more deaths. The mantled howler monkey is classified as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. \u201cIt is because the heat is so strong. I\u2019ve been visiting the states for a long time and I have never felt it as much as now,\u201d Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who comes from Tabasco, said on Monday when asked about the monkey deaths. \u201cSo, yes, we have to care for the animals and yes we are going to do it,\u201d he said in his regular news conference. Later on Monday, Mexico\u2019s environment ministry said in a statement that it was coordinating efforts to address the monkeys\u2019 deaths, which it attributed to several possible reasons, including \u201cheat stroke, dehydration, malnutrition or the spraying of crops with toxic agro-chemicals.\u201d The country has been grappling with soaring and deadly temperatures for weeks. Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported a preliminary count of 26 people who have died from heat-related causes between the start of Mexico\u2019s heat season on March 17 and May 11.

{"id": "2024_05_22_sport_cristiano-ronaldo-portugal-euro-2024-squad-spt-intl", "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo is set to play in his 11th international tournament for Portugal later this year, after the 39-year-old was named in his nation\u2019s squad for Euro 2024. The five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner plays outside of Europe\u2019s main top-five leagues, currently plying his trade for Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr, but Portugal manager Roberto Martinez said the forward\u2019s experience and eye for goal would be an important asset for the team. \u201cCristiano? It\u2019s better to talk about the data. He\u2019s a player who\u2019s scored 42 goals in 41 games for his club,\u201d Martinez told reporters, per Reuters, when explaining the decision to pick Ronaldo. \u201cThat shows his continuity and physical ability to always be fit, as well as the quality he has in front of goal, which we really like and need.\u201d The veteran striker made his first tournament appearance 20 years ago at Euro 2004, when host Portugal was beaten by Greece in the final. He went on to lead Portugal to victory at Euro 2016, his only major trophy at international level, though he had to be substituted in the first half of the final after picking up an injury.  Ronaldo was also part of Portugal\u2019s UEFA Nations League triumph in 2019. Ronaldo has played 206 times for his country \u2013 he\u2019s the most capped player in men\u2019s international soccer \u2013 and has scored a record 128 goals, 10 of which came during the Euro 2024 qualifying campaign. It seemed as though Ronaldo might have made his last appearance in a major international tournament at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The striker was dropped from the starting lineup during the group stages by then manager Fernando Santos, as Portugal looked to be planning for life after Ronaldo. But after a change of management and some good form for Al-Nassr, the forward will have another chance to add to his legacy in what will be a record-extending sixth European Championship appearance. Ronaldo has also appeared at five World Cups. He will also have the chance to become the oldest man to play and score at a European Championships, according to UEFA. He is already the competition\u2019s record goalscorer, with 14 goals in the finals. However, Ronaldo will not be the oldest player in the Portugal squad. That title belongs to 41-year-old defender Pepe, who has impressed for Porto this season. The veteran defender, who also helped his country win the European Championship in 2016, has made 38 club appearances this year, producing some astounding performances in Porto\u2019s run to the Champions League round of 16. Pepe, who has made 136 appearances for Portugal, also helped Porto finish third in the league and will play Sporting Lisbon in the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal final on May 26. \u201cPepe\u2019s role in the dressing room is important, the way he represents the national team shirt,\u201d Martinez told reporters. \u201cHis communication, his positioning mean that, when he\u2019s fit, he\u2019s a very important player.\u201d Portugal will play Turkey, Georgia and Czech Republic in Group F at Euro 2024.

{"id": "2024_05_21_europe_depardieu-paparazzi-harrys-bar-rome-intl-latam", "text": "In a scene reminiscent of La Dolce Vita era, French actor Gerard Depardieu has been accused of attacking celebrity photographer Rino Barillari outside Harry\u2019s Bar on the famed Via Veneto in Rome. Depardieu was dining at an outdoor table with a female companion and two other people around 2 p.m. local time on Tuesday when Barillari \u2013 known as \u201cthe king\u201d in Roman press circles \u2013 apparently snapped the diners, according to Italian media reports. Exactly what happened next is a matter of dispute, though both sides say they have filed police reports known locally as denouncements. Barillari, age 79, said Depardieu\u2019s partner Magda Vavrusova jumped up and started punching him before Depardieu joined the fight, according to Barillari\u2019s lawyer, as cited in several Italian media outlets including the Messaggero newspaper where Barillari works. Police confirmed to CNN that \u201ca local photographer\u201d had filed a complaint around an incident at Harry\u2019s Bar on Tuesday, but did not divulge the names of those involved. Piero Lepore, the owner of Harry\u2019s Bar in Rome, confirmed to CNN that the incident happened, but did not cast blame. Barillari often captures celebrities dining at the establishment, which is famous for appearing in the 1960 Federico Fellini film \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d \u2013 whose photographer character Paparazzo is reputed to have inspired the term \u201cpaparazzi.\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen fisticuffs here in two decades. This sort of thing never happens here,\u201d Lepore told CNN by telephone. \u201cWe are used to celebrities and we are used to paparazzi \u2013 they can\u2019t survive without each other. But we are no longer used to these fights.\u201d When asked for details, he said that because there was now a denouncement by Barillari, he could not comment. \u201cI gave my testimony to the police. I can\u2019t say any more.\u201d Barillari was taken to hospital by ambulance, according to Lepore. Magda Vavrusova\u2019s lawyer, Delphine Meillet,\u00a0said in a statement to CNN that it was Barillari who had pushed Vavrusova. Meillet told the Adnkronos news agency that Vavrusova filed a denouncement with Rome police stating: \u201cThe photographer pushed me, touching my torso and chest with his arm. At this moment in which I present the complaint I still feel pain, it was very violent.\u201d Meillet told the news agency that Vavrusova was also in the hospital, though calls to the University Policlinico Umberto did not confirm her as a patient. Meillet also told the news outlet that in fact Depardieu had run to intervene after the photographer attacked his companion and \u201cslipped and fell on him.\u201d CNN has also reached out to Depardieu\u2019s lawyer for comment. A spokesperson for Rome police said they are currently looking for surveillance footage from the area. Barillari got his start as a celebrity paparazzi when he was just 16 years old by delivering photos he had taken of celebrities at the Trevi Fountain to various news outlets, according to his biography. He has been to the emergency room 200 times after being attacked by his subjects, he said in a documentary to mark his 70th birthday nine years ago. He went on to become Rome\u2019s most infamous paparazzi, publishing several books of his images which have included popes, presidents and stars like Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Liz Taylor and Frank Sinatra, according to his bio. He has suffered 82 broken cameras, 11 broken ribs and a broken femur after photographing a local celebrity allegedly beating up his girlfriend in Piazza Navona, where he lives and keeps a photo studio. Depardieu\u2019s run-in with Barillari comes after the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office told CNN last month that the French actor \u2013 known for his roles in films like \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Man in the Iron Mask\u201d and \u201cLife of Pi\u201d \u2013 would face trial in October over allegations of sexual assault said to have taken place during the shooting of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d in 2021. The actor is also being formally investigated on suspicion of rape and sexual assault allegedly committed in August 2018 against actress Charlotte Arnould, the prosecutor\u2019s office said. The French actor has denied all the rape and sexual assault  accusations.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/europe/depardieu-paparazzi-harrys-bar-rome-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_middleeast_iran-president-helicopter-crash-sanctions-intl", "text": "Even before Iran\u2019s army chief Mohammad Bagheri ordered an investigation into the helicopter crash that cost the Islamic Republic the lives of two of its top politicians, blame was being laid at America\u2019s door. The body of President Ebrahim Raisi was being carefully carried from the crash site as former Foreign Minister Javad Zarif acidly told Iran\u2019s state TV that, \u201cOne of the causes of this heart-breaking incident is the United States, which by sanctioning the sale of the aviation industry to Iran caused the martyrdom of the president and his companions. The US\u2019s crime will be recorded in the minds of the Iranian people and history.\u201d US officials quickly dismissed the allegations as \u201cbaseless.\u201d There are many reasons the aging American-made, Vietnam war-era Bell 212 helicopter may have crashed. Poor maintenance or human error in the dense fog are among them. Turkish Transport Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu has said it is too soon to comment on the cause of the crash, but initial indications suggested it was an accident due to foggy weather. But why did Iran risk both president and foreign minister on the same helicopter, when there were three used that day to carry the delegation to the dam opening on the border with Azerbaijan? When Raisi \u2013 accompanied by his Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, the provincial governor Malek Rahmati, and the influential Imam of Friday prayers in Tabriz, Mohammed Ali Alehashem \u2013 got out of the helicopter at the Qiz Ghal\u2019e dam Sunday morning visibility was good. The sun was shining as Raisi shook hands with his Azeri counterpart Ilham Aliyav at their border on the bridge over the calm waters of the Aras river in the middle of the dam. The day had got off to an apparently good start. Previously frosty relations between the two nations appeared to be warming. On the route picked by the flight crew for their journey to the regional center of Tabriz, where the president\u2019s plane was waiting, the weather was worsening. Although seasonal rains had been diminishing another weather front was moving in. Cold and wet. Fog was thickening around the rugged, remote and unforgiving 1,800 meter (5,900 feet) peaks on the direct flight path. So question one, why fly through the mountains when a detour around the range or to another destination might have been safer? The next question might be, knowing the weather was bad and having three helicopters on the journey, why put both president and foreign minister in the same aircraft? The crash, also revealed Iran\u2019s lack of readiness to deal with a calamity of this nature. There seemed to be no shortage of manpower, but they were hamstrung, lacking adequate technology. In the middle of the night while hundreds, if not thousands, of medics, mountaineers, soldiers, police and even the elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, scoured the steep mountain peaks and deep ravines it was Turkish drone AKINCI, flying loops above the clouds, that first located traces of the helicopter. For a nation that makes, uses, and exports long-range killer drones to countries like Russia for its war in Ukraine, and non-state actors like Iraqi militia and Yemen\u2019s Houthis \u2013 who are currently holding global maritime trade to ransom targeting ships in the Red Sea \u2013 they didn\u2019t appear to have a simple surveillance drone capable of the job. Shortly before AKINCI began etching its systematic surveillance pattern in the night sky Iran had also asked Turkey and Russia for night vision capable helicopters. By implication, if they had them, they couldn\u2019t get them there fast enough. This night, of apparently vital importance to Iran and its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s military prowess \u2013 projected through its axis of proxies in the Middle East and its ally Russia \u2013 seemed hollow. Former Foreign Minister Zarif would want the world to believe Iran\u2019s technological core has been hollowed out by US sanctions, but that allegation too is tainted by hubris. If, as he claims, the president\u2019s helicopter were victim to a paucity of quality spare parts due to US sanctions, why risk the life of the president and the foreign minister in an aircraft considered potentially unreliable. What other air transport possibilities were there, and if there were none that begs the same question, doubly so. Iran\u2019s presidents are not idle, they need to go places. Planning for better options could have been made a bigger priority. Did hubris among the president\u2019s staff or in the upper echelons of the military chose to trust to chance. According to Zarif, maintenance of the Bell 212 was a predictable problem. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time hubris hollowed out logic, but it is certainly the most tragic for those involved. The implicit irony is that Raisi himself was an architect of Iran\u2019s aura of power, only to find it was vacuous when he needed it most.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/middleeast/iran-president-helicopter-crash-sanctions-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_earthranger-track-wildlife-kenya-spc", "text": "It\u2019s early morning in Sera Community Conservancy in Northern Kenya and sunlight beats down across this expansive semi-arid landscape. Birds calling and boots crunching are the only sounds for miles as a team led by Kenyan wildlife veterinarian Dr. Mukami Ruoro-Oundo carefully tracks white rhinos \u2014 the first of their kind to be found here in Samburu County. Once common in the area, by the early 1990s Northern Kenya\u2019s rhino population was decimated by poaching. But the country\u2019s black rhino population has more than doubled since 1989, and by December 2022 there were 1,900 black rhinos and white rhinos in total, according to Kenya Wildlife Services. Sera Conservancy has championed the country\u2019s community-led rhino conservation efforts. In 2015 it established East Africa\u2019s first community rhino sanctuary with the introduction of 10 critically endangered black rhinos. Today, that number has grown to 21 black rhinos which freely roam across 107 square kilometers (41 square miles) of designated sanctuary land, and in February 2024, they were joined by four white rhinos from the nearby Lewa Conservancy. As she searches on foot, Dr. Ruoro-Oundo spots two of the female white rhinos. One, called Sarah, looks heavily pregnant but as the vet creeps closer she notices something is very wrong. Mindful of not encroaching too long on the rhinos\u2019 territory and reluctant to intervene unnecessarily, she opts for a different approach; through a conservation technology tool called EarthRanger she can monitor Sarah\u2019s movements in real time from a distance.\u00a0 Prior to translocation, each of the four white rhinos was fitted with a GPS tag in its horns and ears, which sends a real-time location to remote devices like mobile phones, or to the conservancy\u2019s operations center, where Dr. Ruoro-Oundo is able to monitor Sarah\u2019s location and movements. As EarthRanger\u2019s co-founder Jake Wall tells CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s exactly like a \u2018Find my Friends\u2019 for rhino.\u201d Sparse internet connectivity means Dr. Ruoro-Oundo cannot get a clear signal from Sarah\u2019s transmitter but thankfully Sarah is not alone; a female rhino named Arot has never left her side and through Arot\u2019s transmitter Dr. Ruoro-Oundo can see that Sarah has barely moved in hours, suggesting her condition is deteriorating. By using a drone to take photos of her, the team is able to confirm that Sarah urgently needs help. \u201cWe noticed she has a fecal impaction, it was quite huge and had made the rectal and vulvar area swollen,\u201d says Dr. Ruoro-Oundo. \u201cShe\u2019s in a lot of pain because she could not put down her tail, and you could see she was a bit sluggish, she really wanted to spend her time lying down. So in such a case we really need to intervene for her comfort, to relieve her of the distress and the pain.\u201d An emergency intervention is immediately put into action, led by Kenya Wildlife Services and Sera Conservancy\u2019s management and rangers. Air, ground and additional veterinary support are mobilized within hours \u2014 potentially saving not only Sarah\u2019s life but that of her unborn calf too. For Dr. Ruoro-Oundo, the key to safeguarding Kenya\u2019s wildlife is a balance between community and technology. \u201cI think you cannot separate technology from conservation in the future,\u201d she says.\u201d The human element can never be removed, but technology will always come to assist where we cannot reach.\u201d A global effort Now used in 70 countries, EarthRanger\u2019s story started in Kenya when co-founder Wall was researching elephants there. \u201cIn about 2012, we had a real crisis with poaching in Kenya, so we wanted a way that we could pick up on elephants that were getting killed, and the sign for us was that the collar stopped moving for more than about five or six hours, which is the longest sort of period that an elephant rests for,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I wrote the algorithm that could work out whether an elephant had stopped moving or not, and then (the collar) would send an SMS if it had. So that was kind of the beginning.\u201d He adds that the system has evolved quite significantly since then, and Sarah is one of 9,000 animals \u2014 including elephants, lions, giraffe, tortoises, sea turtles and 1,200 rhinos \u2014 that EarthRanger is currently tracking in Kenya alone. Wall says the system can integrate data from more than 100 different devices \u2014 \u201canything from elephant trackers to ear tags for rhino, to collars for lions, tail tags (for giraffes), devices that glue onto the shell of a turtle.\u201d It can also receive information from sources such as vehicle trackers, satellites, and remote sensing alerts for things like deforestation and fire. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling it all into one platform, where it can be readily visualized, analyzed and then acted upon,\u201d Wall adds. \u201cAnd all of that\u2019s giving the operators and managers a bird\u2019s eye view of the situation as it\u2019s happening, with real-time tools.\u201d According to the EarthRanger, all of these devices are designed to be lightweight, durable and inconspicuous ensuring they don\u2019t impact on the animals\u2019 natural behavior or cause them discomfort. For rhinos, Dr. Ruoro-Oundo says that attaching a tracker is the equivalent sensation of a human getting their ears pierced.

{"id": "travel_africas-richest-man-needs-35-visas", "text": "Even Africa\u2019s wealthiest man has trouble traveling in his own continent. Despite doing business in multiple countries, Nigerian-born Aliko Dangote complains he faces far more hurdles crossing Africa than visitors with European passports ever do. \u201cAs an investor, as someone who wants to make Africa great, I have to apply for 35 different visas on my passport,\u201d Dangote told the recent Africa CEO Forum in Kigali. \u201cI really don\u2019t have the time to go and drop off my passport in embassies to get a visa,\u201d he said to laughter from the audience. The 67-year-old entrepreneur\u2019s visa woes have reignited a fresh firestorm about the frustrations of traveling within Africa for Africans. It\u2019s even more infuriating for many Africans that European passports from former colonial masters have more visa-free access in Africa than many African passports. It\u2019s a point Dangote made powerfully in Kigali, when he turned to the French executive next to him and deadpanned: \u201cI can assure you that Patrick (Pouyann\u00e9, CEO of Total Energies) doesn\u2019t need 35 visas on a French passport, which means you have freer movement than myself in Africa.\u201d Dangote commended Rwanda, which eliminated visas for all African nationals in 2023. Benin, The Gambia and Seychelles also offer visa-free access to all Africans. But many African countries still require visas from other Africans and the experience is fraught with discrimination, hostility and sky-high fees. \u2018Humiliating experience\u2019 Nigerian travel filmmaker Tayo Aina says he was forced to give a stool sample in front of an Ethiopian immigration officer, to confirm he hadn\u2019t ingested any drugs, when he landed in Addis Ababa in April 2021. \u201cIt was my most humiliating experience traveling within Africa,\u201d he told CNN by phone from London. He has also been detained at airports in Kenya and South Africa because of his Nigerian passport. This year, Aina announced that he bought a passport from the Caribbean country of St Kitts and Nevis for $150,000 so he can travel more freely. \u201cSometimes you go to a country, and it is no longer visa-on-arrival. There are cases where people get deported when they land because they changed the policy mid-flight,\u201d the 31-year-old YouTuber says. The African Union has said one of its goals is to remove \u201crestrictions on Africans\u2019 ability to travel, work and live within their own continent by transforming restrictive laws and promoting visa-free travel\u201d but implementation has been slow. Free movement within the continent is a critical part of the African Continental Free Trade Area, but action hasn\u2019t followed the commitments. The fear of permanent migration is one of the reasons why African nations don\u2019t make it easy for other Africans to visit, migration researcher Alan Hirsch told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear in richer African countries that people from poorer nations might be looking for a way to permanently move there,\u201d he explains. \u201cA lot of Africans cross borders informally and we don\u2019t have a real record of that. Some countries fear people applying for asylum and then disappearing under the radar.\u201d The retired University of Cape Town professor runs a program on migration at the New South Institute think tank in Johannesburg. He says the integrity of passport and visa systems especially in poorer African countries has also held back Africans\u2019 mobility. \u201cPeople have found illegal ways of obtaining passports, for example someone pretending to be Burundian without actually being from that country.\u201d Fresh bottlenecks While Africans can move relatively freely within their regions, traveling further away is still challenging. Travelers from East African Community countries don\u2019t need a visa within the block and most parts of Southern and West Africa are open to nationals from the respective regions. But even what looks like progress can introduce some fresh bottlenecks. A Nigerian visa on arrival used to be $25 for Kenyan passport holders. But after changes to the application process, Kenyans now have to apply for a Nigerian e-visa in advance, at a cost of $215. Kenyan President William Ruto famously promised to eliminate visas for everybody traveling to the East African nation. He introduced an Electronic Travel Authorization instead but the application process is similar to that of a visa. It costs $30 without processing fees and approval may take several days. Many visa applications require an application form, bank statements, flight and hotel bookings. Applicants are often rejected for incomplete documentation or for unclear reasons. \u201cSouth Africa held my passport for almost five months,\u201d the Nigerian content creator Tayo says. His new St Kitts passport allows him to go to more African countries than his Nigerian passport.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/africas-richest-man-needs-35-visas/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

Years later, he says he heard his voice narrating a YouTube video and then on a podcast \u2014 even though he had never recorded either of them. Now, Lehrman, along with fellow voice actor Linnea Sage, is suing AI firm Lovo for allegedly commissioning them for voice projects under false pretenses in order to create and sell AI-generated versions of their voices. The Berkeley, California based tech company advertises AI-generated voice technology to be used in marketing, education and product demos. Lehrman and Sage are suing Lovo and seeking class action status to include other people \u201cwhose voices and/or identities were stolen and used,\u201d according to the complaint filed Thursday in the Southern District Court of New York. The complaint was first reported by the New York Times. The voice actors\u2019 lawsuit is just the latest in a recent string of legal actions brought against various tech companies by creatives, writers and artists who say their work was used without their permission to train AI systems that could ultimately compete with them. Such lawsuits have added to a growing wave of concerns over how the training of AI models, which requires huge swaths of data, could run afoul of copyright and intellectual property laws. \u201cImplicit in LOVO\u2019s offerings to its customers is that each voice-over actor has agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms and conditions for customers to be able to access that actor\u2019s voice,\u201d the complaint states. But for Lehrman and Sage and any others \u201cwho have not agreed to LOVO\u2019s terms, the continued unauthorized use of Plaintiffs\u2019 voices is theft of service and misappropriation.\u201d Lovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. In May 2020, Lehrman says he received a request for voice-over narrative services on the gig work website Fiverr from an account called \u201cUser25199087.\u201d When he asked what the voice sample was for, he was told it would be used \u201cfor academic research purposes only\u201d and that \u201cthe scripts would not be used for anything else,\u201d according to the complaint. He was paid $1,200 for the job, the complaint states. Two years later, Lehrman came across a YouTube video that sounded as if it had his voice narrating it, although he\u2019d never been involved in its creation, the complaint states. Then in June 2023, Lehrman claims he heard his voice being used on a podcast about the dangers of AI technologies. Similarly, Sage was offered a job on Fiverr in 2019 producing \u201ctest scripts for radio ads\u201d that she was told would \u201cnot be disclosed externally,\u201d according to the complaint. She was paid $400. Sage says she later also discovered her voice in a YouTube video: a recording of a Lovo investor presentation demonstrating its technology. Lehrman and Sage allege that the people who contacted them on Fiverr were Lovo employees who misrepresented what their voice samples would be used for and later sold or raised money on the back of the AI-version of their voices. \u201cTo be clear, the product that customers purchase from LOVO is stolen property. They are voices stolen by LOVO and marketed by LOVO under false pretenses,\u201d the complaint states. The actors are seeking more than $5 million in damages, as well as a court order blocking Lovo from continuing the alleged use of their voices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/voice-actors-ai-lawsuit-lovo/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

Macron was leaving Paris on Tuesday night and will \u201cset up a mission\u201d in the French territory, government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot told a press conference, without giving further details. He will be accompanied by Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin, Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, and Overseas Minister Marie Gu\u00e9venoux, Darmanin told the National Assembly. New Caledonia has been roiled by riots sparked by electoral changes from the national government. The unrest has killed at least six people, and has left a trail of burned cars and looted shops, with road barricades restricting access to medicine and food. The violence is the latest outburst of political tensions that have simmered for years and pitted the island\u2019s largely pro-independence indigenous Kanak communities \u2013\u00a0who have long chafed against rule by Paris \u2013 against French inhabitants opposed to breaking ties with their motherland. Macron\u2019s visit comes as Australia and New Zealand deploy government planes to evacuate their nationals from New Caledonia and as hundreds more French security personnel have been deployed to assist in the unrest. France\u2019s High Commission of New Caledonia said Tuesday the airport remains closed for commercial flights until May 25. Thevenot said Tuesday that 1,000 more members of French security forces have arrived in New Caledonia to support the 1,700 personnel already on the island. Darmanin also told the French legislature the number of police and gendarmes in New Caledonia would soon reach 3,000. Also speaking to France\u2019s National Assembly, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said Tuesday \u201cthe situation is starting to improve.\u201d Protests began May 13 involving mostly young people, in response to the tabling of a vote in the French parliament proposing changes to New Caledonia\u2019s constitution that would give greater voting rights to French residents living on the islands. On Tuesday, legislators voted overwhelmingly in favor of the change. The proposed changes to the constitution add thousands of extra voters to New Caledonia\u2019s electoral rolls, which have not been updated since the late 1990s. Pro-independence groups say the changes are an attempt by France to consolidate its rule over the archipelago. Supporters of the change say voter rolls will better reflect the current population. Lying in the South Pacific with Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu for neighbors, New Caledonia is a semiautonomous French territory \u2014 one of a dozen scattered throughout the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Ocean. Colonial France took control of New Caledonia in 1853. White settlement followed and the indigenous Kanak people were longtime victims of harsh segregation policies.

Microsoft employees, mostly involved with cloud computing, were recently offered the opportunity to work in the United States, Australia or Ireland, among other countries, state-run outlet The Paper said in a report Wednesday, citing an unnamed source. \u201cProviding internal opportunities is a regular part of managing our global business. As part of this process, we shared an optional internal transfer opportunity with a subset of employees,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. It did not specify the number of workers who had received the offer. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Microsoft asked as many as 800 employees, mostly engineers with Chinese nationality working on cloud computing and AI, to consider relocating. The Journal, which cited unnamed sources, reported last year that the Biden administration was preparing to restrict Chinese firms\u2019 access to US cloud services.

She\u2019s a business mogul in every sense: Aside from a prolific music career, she\u2019s launched successful brands including her cosmetics empire Fenty Beauty \u2013 worth an estimated $2.8 billion according to Forbes \u2013 and her lingerie label Savage X Fenty. Her latest move in China to promote makeup products is something of a masterclass in how to tap into its lucrative \u2013 mostly online \u2013 Gen Z market. On Tuesday night, the chart-topping singer attended a Fenty Beauty pop-up held at a Shanghai photography museum, \u201cservin\u2019 face\u201d according to brand\u2019s Instagram, and \u201cjianbing\u201d \u2013 a popular Chinese breakfast crepe that costs about a dollar. Dressed in a head-to-toe black ensemble, Rihanna cracked an egg, spread yolk, sprinkled scallions, brushed sauce and placed a crunchy cracker onto the savory street food favorite, made on a glittery food cart. Influential makeup bloggers invited to attend captured the spectacle and Chinese social media sprung to life. \u201cShe makes crepes but not her new album,\u201d joked one user on Douyin, China\u2019s TikTok, while another wrote on Weibo, \u201cShe\u2019s so good at it, it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s her first time.\u201d Rihanna is already a beloved star in China, recently appearing on April\u2019s Vogue China cover. She has been viewed as appreciating Chinese culture, famously wearing a glorious golden yellow creation by master couturier Guo Pei to 2015\u2019s China-themed Met Gala. And the decision to serve up jianbing was a savvy move \u2013 one that embraced the star\u2019s moniker among Chinese fans and displayed knowledge of her audience. In 2011, Chinese fans dubbed her the \u201cQueen of Shandong,\u201d after her hit \u201cWe Found Love\u201d was phonetically translated to \u201cweifang de ai\u201d \u2013 meaning love of Weifang, a city in eastern China\u2019s Shandong province. Jianbing is believed to have originated from the same province more than 2,000 years ago and for many in China, the 36-year-old\u2019s turn at making the humble crepe was a full circle moment, with one viral comment on Weibo reading \u201cshe\u2019s certified her own Chinese nickname\u201d with the act. The jianbing buzz only added to the chatter online about the singer\u2019s appearance earlier in the day on Douyin, where she hosted three livestream sessions showcasing Fenty Beauty lip glosses, blushes and other products. Rihanna then became the number one trending topic on Weibo, with the hashtag #RihannasfirstlivestreaminChina viewed over 81 million times. Another hashtag, #RihannashowsupinShanghai was viewed over 75 million times. Besides being a video app, Douyin is a major platform for online shopping \u2013 with products and discounts displayed on-screen during livestreams and purchases just a swipe or a click away. In 2022, there were more than 460 million livestreaming e-commerce users in mainland China, according to the Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, a body affiliated with Beijing\u2019s commerce ministry. Other foreign luxury brands have already hosted their own livestream sessions, including Gucci, Dior and Louis Vuitton. China is now the world\u2019s second largest beauty market. Rihanna\u2019s appearance was part of the platform\u2019s wider \u201c618\u201d (or June 18) campaign, one of China\u2019s most important online shopping events after Singles Day in November, that sees widespread promotions starting nearly a month ahead. While Fenty Beauty products have been available in the country since 2019, the brand announced this March that it would be expanding its presence via Sephora stores on the mainland. In 2017, the brand launched with an unprecedented 40 shades of foundation and has since added more.

{"id": "2024_05_22_sport_aaron-rodgers-rfk-jr-vp-presidential-nfl-spt-intl", "text": "Aaron Rodgers said on Tuesday that he chose to continue his NFL playing career rather than becoming Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s running mate in the US presidential race. CNN previously reported Kennedy had met with Rodgers about the possibility of joining Kennedy\u2019s campaign. Kennedy ultimately named Silicon Valley attorney and entrepreneur Nicole Shanahan as his vice-presidential pick. \u201cThere were really two options. Retire and be his VP or keep playing. I wanted to keep playing,\u201d the 40-year-old Rodgers told reporters as the New York Jets quarterback spoke for the first time about the potential choice he had to make when it came to switching the pigskin for the podium. CNN has reached out to the Kennedy campaign for comment. Rodgers is entering his second season with the Jets after missing almost the entirety of his first campaign in New York having ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four snaps into his debut. Although he returned to the practice field towards the end of last season, Rodgers never returned to NFL action in the 2024 season. The Jets have begun their offseason program, beginning with organized team practice activities (OTA) which Rodgers has been a full participant in. \u201cIt\u2019s just about the mental part,\u201d said Rodgers as he ramps up his return from injury, four months ahead of the new season. \u201cThese practices have been nice the last couple of days. Feel what it\u2019s like to be out there, to be moving around, to not be thinking about it and see how I respond the next day. This is the last part,\u201d he added. \u201cThe strength is good, the movement is good, just the confidence to do everything.\u201d Jets head coach Robert Saleh told reporters that Rodgers has no restrictions during practice sessions, and the four-time MVP says that he feels like he \u201ccan do anything\u201d right now. \u201cI can run at top speed. It\u2019s just, in those moments, the reactions coming naturally.\u201d After Rodgers\u2019 injury in the opening game of the 2023 season, the Jets endured a disappointing season as a result of turbulent quarterback play and underwhelming offensive performances. But with Rodgers back in the line-up, expectations are high ahead of the new season. \u201cWell, I think if I don\u2019t do what I\u2019m capable of doing, then we\u2019re all probably gonna be out of here (next season),\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI like that kind of pressure, though. \u201cI know it\u2019s a tough market to play in; it\u2019s not for everybody. Relish that opportunity. That\u2019s the way the NFL is. \u201cAs you get older in the league, if you do not perform, they\u2019re going to get rid of you or bring in the next guy to take over. It happened in Green Bay, and I\u2019m a few years older than I was back then. I expect to play at a high level, I expect us to be productive and competitive, and all that stuff to take care of itself.\u201d The Jets open the 2024 season on the road against the San Francisco 49ers, the defending NFC champions, on Monday Night Football on September 9.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/sport/aaron-rodgers-rfk-jr-vp-presidential-nfl-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_asia_lai-chingte-taiwan-president-inauguration-intl-hnk", "text": "Taiwan President Lai Ching-te called on Beijing to cease its intimidation of the democratic island after he was was sworn in as president Monday, marking the start of a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has championed democracy in the face of years of growing threats\u00a0from authoritarian China. Lai, 64, a former doctor and vice president, was inaugurated alongside new Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, who recently served as Taiwan\u2019s top envoy to the United States. Both leaders and their party are openly loathed by Beijing for championing Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says the self-ruling democracy is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary. Lai used his 30-minute inaugural speech to broadcast a message of peace and declare that a \u201cglorious era of Taiwan\u2019s democracy has arrived,\u201d describing the island as an \u201cimportant link\u201d in a \u201cglobal chain of democracies,\u201d while reiterating a determination to defend its sovereignty. \u201cThe future of the Republic of China Taiwan will be decided by its 23 million people. The future we decide is not just the future of our nation, but the future of the world,\u201d Lai said, using the formal name for Taiwan. Lai takes up the mantle from his DPP predecessor Tsai Ing-wen, who bolstered the island\u2019s international standing and recognition during her eight years in office. Tsai, Taiwan\u2019s first female president, was unable to stand again because of term limits. Lai emerged victorious over rivals in the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party and the Taiwan People\u2019s Party in a January election, which was fought over a mixture of livelihood issues as well as the thorny question of how to deal with its giant one-party state neighbor, China, which under leader Xi Jinping has grown more powerful and bellicose. Then, voters shrugged off warnings from Beijing that the DPP\u2019s re-election would increase the risk of conflict. The DPP holds the view that Taiwan is a de facto sovereign nation that should bolster defenses against China\u2019s threats and deepen relations with democratic countries. In his inaugural address, Lai called on China \u201cto cease their political and military intimidation against Taiwan, share with Taiwan the global responsibility of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait as well as the greater region, and ensure the world is free from the fear of war.\u201d A soft-spoken political veteran, Lai hails from a more radical wing of the DPP, and was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence \u2013 a red line for Beijing. Though his views have tempered since then, China never forgave him for his comments from six years ago, in which he described himself as a \u201cpractical worker for Taiwan independence.\u201d Lai has now said he favors the current status quo, proclaiming that \u201cTaiwan is already an independent sovereign country\u201d so there is \u201cno plan or need\u201d to declare independence, in a deliberately nuanced stance that mimics the one held by outgoing Tsai. When asked about Lai\u2019s inauguration in a regular briefing Monday, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said \u201cTaiwan independence is a dead end. No matter what pretext or banner one uses, promoting Taiwan independence and secession is doomed to fail.\u201d Lai\u2019s inauguration ceremony was attended by national leaders from a handful of countries with which Taiwan still maintains formal diplomatic ties, several former American officials, and lawmakers from other countries, according to Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In a statement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken offered his congratulations to Lai and \u201cthe Taiwan people for once again demonstrating the strength of their robust and resilient democratic system.\u201d \u201cWe look forward to working with President Lai and across Taiwan\u2019s political spectrum to advance our shared interests and values, deepen our longstanding unofficial relationship, and maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d Blinken said. Frictions with Beijing Lai takes office during a particularly contentious period between Taiwan and China, which in recent years has ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on the self-governing democracy as Taiwan\u2019s leaders tightened informal ties with Washington. In his inaugural address, Lai said he hoped China would \u201cface the reality of the Republic of China\u2019s existence, respect the choices of the people of Taiwan,\u201d and \u201cengage in cooperation with the legal government chosen by Taiwan\u2019s people.\u201d He called for the resumption of tourism on a reciprocal basis and enrollment of degree students in Taiwanese institutions as steps to \u201cpursue peace and mutual prosperity.\u201d But the new president also warned against harboring delusions, even as Taiwan pursues \u201cthe ideals of peace.\u201d \u201cSo long as China refuses to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, all of us in Taiwan ought to understand, that even if we accept the entirety of China\u2019s position and give up our sovereignty, China\u2019s ambition to annex Taiwan will not simply disappear,\u201d Lai said. Beijing has sought to portray Lai as inciting conflict, repeatedly framing the elections earlier this year as a choice between \u201cpeace and war.\u201d On Monday, China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office reiterated that rhetoric, slamming \u201cthe leader of the Taiwan region\u201d as \u201csending dangerous signals of seeking independence, provocations and undermining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\u201d Xi has placed \u201creunification\u201d with Taiwan as a key part of his goal to achieve China\u2019s \u201cnatural rejuvenation.\u201d But under the strongarm tactics of his more than one decade in power, Taiwan\u2019s public has shifted determinedly away from China. Less than 10% now support an immediate or eventual unification, and less than 3% identify primarily as Chinese. The majority of Taiwanese want to maintain the current status quo and show no desire to be ruled by Beijing. Beijing has cut official contact with Taipei since Tsai took office. Unlike the opposition KMT, Tsai and the DPP refused to endorse the so-called \u201c1992 consensus\u201d that both Taiwan and the mainland belong to \u201cone China,\u201d but with different interpretations of what that means. Beijing, which deems the tacit agreement a precondition for dialogue. Official communication between Beijing and Taipei\u00a0is unlikely to resume as Lai takes office \u2013 with China repeatedly rebuking his offer for talks and denouncing him as a dangerous separatist. Lai is also set to face challenges \u2013 and scrutiny \u2013 in pushing through his agenda for Taiwan in parliament during his term. Unlike his predecessor, Lai will not have a parliamentary majority in the next four years. In January\u2019s election, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party only won 51 out of 113 seats.

Millions in the region must remain weather aware Monday and Tuesday after powerful storms battered parts of the region Sunday with damaging tornadoes, baseball-sized hail and winds up to 100 mph. At least 13 tornadoes were reported across Kansas, Colorado and Oklahoma on Sunday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Two tornadoes struck Oklahoma, one of which triggered a rare tornado emergency in Custer City and damaged 10 to 15 homes in Custer County and another hit the western portions of Oklahoma City. Two people were injured in Blaine County, Oklahoma, when their mobile home was destroyed and a local nursing home also reported damage, according to state and county officials. Custer County also reported two people with injuries, the state emergency management office said. Wind gusts as strong as 100 mph and baseball-sized hail knocked out power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses in Kansas Sunday night. More than 30,000 homes and businesses remained without power Monday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. Significant storm damage in Harvey County, Kansas \u2013 about 25 miles north of Wichita \u2013 prompted a local disaster declaration, the county said on X Sunday night. Additional dangerous storms Monday, Tuesday Severe thunderstorms will bubble to life later Monday afternoon or early Monday evening in parts of Colorado and Wyoming and track east through the night to impact Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota. Any storm could deliver damaging winds, hail and even a tornado. Some of the strongest storms could fire up in parts of northeastern Colorado and western Nebraska where a Level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Though not directly in the storm\u2019s bullseye, cities including Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit, Minneapolis and St. Louis are also at risk of severe weather. Severe thunderstorm risks will expand Tuesday across a large portion of the central US from Texas to the Midwest and Great Lakes. More than 16 million people in the Midwest are under a Level 3 of 5 or greater risk of severe thunderstorms Tuesday. Tuesday\u2019s storms could produce a significant swath of damaging wind gusts, along with large hail and EF2 or stronger tornadoes. Widespread, \u201cintense\u201d damaging wind gusts are most likely late Tuesday within the Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms area including southern Iowa and northwestern Illinois, according to the SPC. Tornadoes, some of which could be strong, are possible in much of Iowa. Smaller parts of Wisconsin, Illinois and Missouri could also face dangerous tornadoes. Sweltering heat\u00a0in Houston amid days-long outages Houston area residents who are still picking up the pieces from Thursday\u2019s storms will contend with a much different danger: sweltering heat. Winds up to 100 mph and a tornado in Harris County killed at least eight people, damaged skyscrapers, toppled trees, downed critical power infrastructure, caused a sewage spill and made roads impassable. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could hit triple-digits this week, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. Power remains out for more than 200,000 homes and business across Harris County as of Monday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us. With increasingly high heat and humidity, those residents will have to cope with heat indices from the 90s Monday into the 100s Tuesday and Wednesday without air conditioning. Authorities have warned restoring power to all customers could take weeks. \u201cWidespread power outages continue across the Houston metro area.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_europe_vovchansk-evacuation-ukraine-russia-intl-latam", "text": "In a recurring nightmare, horrors usually repeat themselves. For the Ukrainian border town of Vovchansk, they\u2019re getting worse. Every street seems aflame. The shelling is constant. Torn up tanks and Humvees litter its streets. Small arms fire can be heard as Russian forces inch forwards. Locals in the town lived through occupation and liberation for seven grueling months in 2022. But now they bear the brunt of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s race to grab as much land as he can before Ukraine eventually feels the benefit of US weapons arriving. Moscow on Friday launched its most surprising operation since the initial invasion, crossing Ukraine\u2019s northern border, in a repeat attempt to push south towards the country\u2019s second most-populous city. The devastating weight of the offensive has torn Vovchansk up. The Russian military claims the action has left close to a dozen villages under its control. Most consequentially, Kyiv is now scrambling to send forces from other over-stretched frontlines where Russia is also seeing progress, to stop Moscow\u2019s guns getting in range of Kharkiv city proper. In Vovchansk, the onslaught means that one local man Mykola, his wife, and his 85-year-old mother are for the first time leaving behind the house they built and lived in for 40 years. They were one of 35 groups of residents who called the Ukrainian authorities Thursday and asked to be rescued before Russian troops \u2013\u00a0now just a few hundred meters to the north \u2013 reach their door front. The sounds of artillery shells echoes off the cinderblock walls as a young police officer pulls up outside their house. Mykola walks out, trips on rubble in his yard, and curses. \u201cHop in!\u201d says the police officer, Maksim, as he hustles the family and their few possessions toward the car. He\u2019s been driving into the town continuously since Russia\u2019s advance, shuttling people out. He moves fast. The smell of burning homes hangs in the air, and smoke clogs out the sunlight \u2013 the remnants of the artillery shells that rain down on houses day and night. Mykola and his wife grab plastic bags of eggs, and shuffle across their vegetable patch. The airstrikes last night were just too much, they admit. Less than five minutes later, they\u2019re away, dodging the potholes and rubble that litter the street. At a roundabout on the edge of town, an aging Soviet-era fighter jet, once a proud display of military prowess past, has been knocked off its pedestal. They swerve between the charred body and turret of a Ukrainian tank that\u2019s been blown apart \u2013 recently enough that its ammunition spills out onto the street, untouched. Fifteen minutes down the road, they pull into a gas station. With a wide smile, 85-year-old Maria walks haltingly to an awaiting police van. \u201cIt\u2019s not scary,\u201d she says of the shelling. \u201cI just don\u2019t want it.\u201d Her family admits she is hard of hearing, and so the intensity of the bombardment may not have impacted her as much. Yet she still had reached her limit. She sits next to her former neighbor, Inna. \u201cAt night, they dropped so many aerial bombs,\u201d she says. \u201cHorrible.\u201d Friends of theirs, who now volunteer to extract residents, tried to reach them the previous day but had to turn back. \u201cThey were shooting close to us. Firing at everything,\u201d said Inna. Harrowing memories of Russian control They recall their months under Russian occupation in 2022 \u2013 living under the military control of a country they had for decades lived amicably with, mere kilometers away from them across the border. Mykola\u2019s wife said of the occupation: \u201cIt was alright. They didn\u2019t touch us. They did touch other residents.\u201d Yet Inna recalls how the Russians sought out Ukrainian soldiers who had fought against Russian forces and their proxies in the first phase of the war in 2014. \u201cThey mostly tortured the boys who served. We have a factory there, where they had a prison. The Russians held our boys there.\u201d \u00a0There has been widespread reporting of mistreatment of Ukrainian civilians under Russian occupation, allegations the Kremlin has typically dismissed as fake. As soon as they\u2019ve dropped the residents off, the police set off again for Vovchansk. Just past the town entrance, they pull off into a line of trees. Sitting at a picnic table, they examine a map and assess which of the three rescue calls they can answer. Only one group of people requesting their help is accessible, they assess. Yet their debate is interrupted by a low whining noise. Is it a drone? They peer from beneath the tree cover upwards.\u00a0 The noise comes and goes. But then a drone is spotted \u2013 one of three. A larger one that hovers, and two other smaller devices that race around. The two policemen point their weapons at the sky. \u201cOver us!\u00a0 Look!\u201d one says. \u201cShould I f*** it up?\u201d he asks a colleague. \u201cWhat if it is ours?\u201d he replies. If the police open fire, they may actually draw the attention of the drone on them. The wait is nerve-shredding. The noise grows. The police and the CNN crew can only hope they are either obscured by the trees, or considered not an important enough target for the Russian drone. It does appear fixated on something else nearby. But then the noise grows louder. It is time to leave.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/europe/vovchansk-evacuation-ukraine-russia-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_middleeast_israel-netanyahu-interview-icc-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied allegations that he was starving Palestinians in Gaza as a method of war in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday, saying an arrest warrant application currently under review in the International Criminal Court (ICC) is based on a \u201cpack of lies.\u201d ICC prosecutor Karim Khan announced Monday that he had requested arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders and two Israeli politicians \u2013 Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant \u2013 on allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks in Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. Khan said the accusations against Netanyahu and Gallant include \u201ccausing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict.\u201d Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu called Khan a \u201crogue prosecutor that has put false charges and created false symmetries that are both dangerous and false\u201d and insisted that Israel has been allowing food and medical aid to enter Gaza, where aid groups say that the blockaded Palestinian enclave is currently at risk of famine. Israel has allowed 20,000 trucks of aid into Gaza, Netanyahu said \u2013 a fraction of what would have entered in the same period under normal times. Israel\u2019s ongoing siege of Gaza, following Hamas\u2019 October 7 terror attacks, has reached its seventh month and left more than 34,000 people dead. Serious questions about the Israeli military\u2019s long-term strategy have been raised both inside and outside of Israel after the Israeli military sent troops back into areas of northern Gaza, an area it had previously declared clear of Hamas. Last week, Israel\u2019s defense chief Gallant\u00a0called on Netanyahu\u00a0to publicly rule out Israeli governance over the Gaza Strip and to lay out his\u00a0post-war plans for civilian rule in Gaza, warning that he opposes Israeli rule in the Palestinian enclave. When Netanyahu was asked by Tapper if he would rule out the Israeli occupation of Gaza, the Israeli politician said that \u201cresettling\u201d the Palestinian territory was out of the question. \u201cYou mean resettling Gaza? Yeah. It was never in the cards, and I said so openly [and] some of my constituents are not happy about it, but that\u2019s my position.\u201d The prime minister also reaffirmed his commitment to eradicating Hamas, which governs Gaza, before considering demilitarizing the Strip, in the interview. With more than 100 hostages still believed to be held in Gaza, pressure has been growing for a deal that would see hostages released in exchange for a ceasefire. But when asked about public polling showing that a majority of Israelis believe freeing hostages is a higher priority than military action, Netanyahu said you could not have one without the other. \u201cMilitary action that we take against Hamas is in fact the way to get these hostages because without military pressure, basically, without, you know, squeezing them, Hamas is not going to give up anything,\u201d he told Tapper. Netanyahu is deeply unpopular in Israel, where he is also facing an ongoing corruption trial. Critics have accused the Prime Minister of being beholden to members of his far-right coalition and prolonging the war to maintain his grip on power. Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu rejected accusations that he avoids Israeli media in favor of international press, saying he has done up to 20 press conferences with Israeli journalists. \u201cThat\u2019s simply not true,\u201d he said. \u201cI speak to them and I speak to you and I welcome the opportunity to tell the truth and dispel the lies in both in both mediums.\u201d \u2018No equivalence\u2019 The ICC\u2019s application for warrants over the war in Gaza marked the first time the international court has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, but the court\u00a0has said that it\u00a0has\u00a0jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court\u2019s founding principles in 2015. A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan\u2019s application for the arrest warrants. An ICC warrant would compel more than 100 member-nations of the court to arrest Netanyahu if he traveled in their territory. France was among the countries that have supported the ICC decision alongside international rights groups. Human rights organization Amnesty International has\u00a0hailed the arrest warrant request as a\u00a0\u201ccrucial step towards justice.\u201d But Israel\u2019s allies have roundly condemned\u00a0Khan\u2019s\u00a0move, with US President Joe Biden calling it \u201coutrageous.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThere is no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas,\u201d\u00a0Biden said.\u00a0\u00a0Several US lawmakers have threatened to levy sanctions against the ICC, and\u00a0Secretary of State Antony\u00a0Blinken\u00a0has said\u00a0he is open to legislative action against the court. The\u00a0Biden administration said earlier this month\u00a0that\u00a0it is \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0in ways that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with international humanitarian law \u2013 but\u00a0stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law. Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu likened himself to President Franklin Roosevelt, claiming the arrest warrants were like putting Nazi leader Adolf Hitler on the docks alongside the American wartime president who oversaw the US\u2019s mobilization\u00a0during World War\u00a0II. Khan previously told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour that he had received international pressure over his investigation of Israel. \u201cThis court is built for Africa and for thugs like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,\u201d Khan described one senior leader telling him. This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-interview-icc-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_weather_iowa-tornado-damage-storm-forecast-wednesday", "text": "The destructive tornado that ravaged the town of Greenfield, Iowa, on Tuesday has left four dead and at least 35 injured, the Iowa State Patrol said in a Wednesday evening\u00a0news release. Authorities are not releasing the names of the deceased at this time pending next of kin notification. In addition to the fatalities reported in Greenfield, at least one other person was killed as storms passed through nearby Adams County, local officials said earlier. The Iowa State Patrol said the number of those injured from the Greenfield twister \u201cis likely higher, but these numbers reflect only those patients treated for their injuries at designated alternate care sites.\u201d At least 14 patients were taken to medical facilities outside of the county, the release added. The tornado that carved through Greenfield \u2013 about 50 miles southwest of Des Moines \u2013 is estimated to be at least an EF3. More than 100 first responders were combing through the wreckage of the town Wednesday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said. The city\u2019s hospital sustained damage and some patients were moved to other facilities in surrounding areas. At least four medical airlift flights occurred. A \u201cmakeshift hospital\u201d was set up in the city\u2019s lumberyard Tuesday right after the tornado tracked out of the area, State Rep. Ray Sorensen said Wednesday. Sorensen lives in the area and assisted with recovery efforts in the immediate aftermath. \u201cWe pulled a guy from the rubble and put him on a little makeshift stretcher that we made for him on the back of a truck,\u201d Sorensen recalled. The damage to the city is immense. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows homes and other structures have been obliterated and the community is blanketed with heaps of debris, tossed cars and uprooted trees. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific,\u201d Reynolds said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe until you can actually see the devastation.\u201d As search and rescue efforts continue in the devastated community, there remains another widespread threat for storms to the east. At least 18 tornadoes were reported in Iowa Tuesday \u2013 part of a torrent of storms that have left widespread power outages, structural damage and flooding across the US this week. Tornado reports have skyrocketed well-above average in recent weeks as the typically busiest period of severe weather season unfolds. The more than 800 tornadoes reported so far this year make it one of the most active years for twisters on record. More than 50,000 homes and businesses are in the dark across Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us. More outages are anticipated as storms roll through the East. Wednesday\u2019s severe thunderstorm threat is slightly less intense than Tuesday\u2019s, but dangerous storms remain possible. Damaging winds, hail and some tornadoes could occur along a sprawling 1,500-mile expanse from Texas to western Vermont. Energetic storms rumbled to life Wednesday morning in parts of Oklahoma. Additional thunderstorms will fire up throughout the day and likely reach peak in strength in parts of the southern Plains and Mississippi Valley during the afternoon and evening. Severe storms also fired up from the Ohio Valley through the Northeast Wednesday afternoon. These storms could be slightly less organized and widespread than those in the South, but damaging wind gusts and hail are possible. The tornado threat is very limited in this area. Cities including Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee, St. Louis, Memphis, Cleveland, Tulsa and Columbus, Ohio, should be storm-aware. Some Iowa neighborhoods left in ruins Reynolds issued a disaster emergency proclamation Tuesday for 15 counties as a potent line of thunderstorms tore through the state. Greenfield and other parts of western Iowa bore the brunt of the storms\u2019 catastrophic impacts. A tornado also toppled a hulking wind turbine just south of Greenfield in Prescott, Iowa, and more than two dozen homes were damaged or destroyed in Montgomery County, including some \u201ccritical public facilities,\u201d emergency management officials said. No injuries have been reported but damage assessments are still ongoing. But Greenfield is the epicenter of Tuesday\u2019s event. \u201cThere is basically nothing left,\u201d Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday. Valerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, pleaded with God to protect her home and her family before she rode out the storm in her basement, she told KCCI. \u201cI was in the furnace room and then I heard (the storm) like a train,\u201d she said, describing insulation flying off of basement windows. \u201cI heard it, and I knew it was hitting.\u201d Warrior said the scale of damage is devastating to see, but she is confident residents will pull each other through the crisis. \u201cThey\u2019ll get through it. You already see people out helping each other, working together. And that\u2019s what they do, people come together when a tragedy happens. People come together to support and encourage each other.\u201d Fighting back tears, Warrior looked out the rubble strewn across her neighborhood and tried to crack a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jessica Jordan, Sara Smart, Amy Simonson, Andy Rose and Brad Parks contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/weather/iowa-tornado-damage-storm-forecast-wednesday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

Another civilian was also\u00a0killed\u00a0during the shooting, which took place on May 15, the\u00a0Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office said, as intense battles between Ukrainian and Russian forces for control of the border town continue. Russia has ramped up its offensive\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Kharkiv region\u00a0in\u00a0recent weeks, launching its most surprising operation\u00a0in\u00a0more than two years of war on May 10, when\u00a0Russian\u00a0forces\u00a0crossed the\u00a0border\u00a0and subsequently took control of close to a dozen villages. The 70-year-old husband told prosecutors the situation in Vovchansk had become unbearable because of the heavy fighting, so he found a wheelchair for his wife who was experiencing health issues, and the two left their home in the early hours of the night. What followed adds to the repeating horrors that residents in the town and battlefield areas face daily, as Russia continues its push to claim control of more Ukrainian land. Husband shared details of the shooting The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office said the husband, who \u201cmiraculously survived\u201d the shooting in Vovchansk, shared the painful details of the harrowing ordeal. The man said there was heavy shelling around 2 a.m. local time, and he told his wife they should evacuate, according to the\u00a0investigation. Another resident of the embattled\u00a0town joined them. \u201cThe man found a\u00a0wheelchair\u00a0and put his wife\u00a0in\u00a0it because she had been having problems with her legs for a long time. The three of them set off\u00a0in\u00a0the direction of Kharkiv,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office said. \u201cWhen the civilians were near the local hospital, the occupiers opened fire on them. The man who joined the couple and the\u00a0woman\u00a0died on the spot.\u201d The Russian military had opened fire on the evacuees from a five-story building, the husband told prosecutors. \u201cThe wheelchair got stuck, I was pulling it by the handles,\u201d he told prosecutors. \u201cI leaned down and there was a machine gun burst,\u201d he said. \u201cI immediately shouted, what are you doing, we are civilians.\u201d Then\u00a0he said he\u00a0turned around and saw that his wife and the other resident were killed. He started screaming and didn\u2019t know how to proceed. He started pushing the\u00a0wheelchair\u00a0towards the hospital where he knew there were emergency personnel. A man at the hospital shouted at him, urging him to leave the body of his wife and come\u00a0inside the building. But the man continued moving further with the body of his wife towards a flooded bridge, where he realized the two had to part ways. \u201cShe stayed in the wheelchair,\u201d the man told prosecutors.

{"id": "2024_05_22_uk_uk-early-elections-sunak-conservatives-intl", "text": "UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a snap general election for July\u00a04 in a statement outside Downing Street on Wednesday evening, as his Conservative Party faces an uphill struggle to extend its 14 years in power. Sunak said\u00a0outside Downing Street\u00a0that he had informed King Charles III of the rare summer poll, firing the starting gun on a\u00a0six-week\u00a0campaign that is almost universally expected to conclude in the demise of his Conservative government. Soaked by a downpour as he spoke, Sunak said: \u201cNow is the moment for Britain to choose its future.\u201d He also attacked his opponents, saying that by voting for the Labour Party, Britain would \u201crisk going back to square one.\u201d But he admitted: \u201cI cannot and will not claim that we have got everything right.\u201d Sunak was required to hold a vote by January 2025, and had long resisted calls to be specific about his plans. But a fall in inflation rates, announced earlier Wednesday, provided the backdrop for his announcement. The move\u00a0will be welcomed by the buoyant Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, which is soaring in the opinion polls and has sought to present itself as a reformed and moderate group that is ready for power. In the wake of the announcement, Buckingham Palace said the British royal family would postpone engagements \u201cwhich may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign.\u201d The King and Queen\u2019s D-Day memorial engagements in June are expected to go ahead as scheduled. In his speech, Sunak sought to paint external factors such as Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine as the context to Britain\u2019s economic struggles, saying the two factors combined represented \u201cthe most challenging times since the Second World War.\u201d But he battled heavy rain that soaked his suit in just minutes, and he was almost drowned out by a loudspeaker outside the Downing Street gates, through which a protester blared D:Ream\u2019s \u201cThings Can Only Get Better,\u201d the theme song of Labour\u2019s big election win in 1997. Starmer was quick to respond to Sunak\u2019s announcement. Speaking at an indoor news conference, the opposition leader said: \u201cTonight the prime minister has finally announced the next general election.\u201d He framed the vote as a \u201cchance to change for the better \u2013 your future, your community, your country.\u201d \u201cIt will feel like a long campaign, I\u2019m sure of that, but no matter what else is said and done, that opportunity for change is what this election is about,\u201d he said. Current polling is dire for Sunak; Labour begins the campaign around 20 points up on average, with the Tories often closer to third-party challengers such as Reform and the Liberal Democrats than they are to Labour. When converted to a projection of seats in parliament, those figures indicate either a comfortable Labour win or a potential electoral wipeout for the Conservatives. Sunak will hope that a shrewd campaign could result in a spectacular upset for Labour and extend a period of Tory rule which began in 2010 and has overseen austerity economics, Brexit, the Covid pandemic and a cost of living crisis. He is the fifth Tory leader to serve during that time, taking over from the ill-fated Liz Truss, whose disastrous term imploded just six weeks after it began and exacerbated the financial woes crippling the United Kingdom. Sunak\u2019s party will likely put his efforts to tackle illegal migration at the center of his campaign; a recent move to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda finally became law last month, and the first flights could potentially leave during the campaign. But Labour will seek to highlight the government\u2019s struggles to ease soaring prices, the state of Britain\u2019s over-stretched healthcare service, and the sleaze scandals that have tanked the Tories\u2019 reputation among a large swath of British voters. Smaller parties could upend the designs of the two dominant groups, even if it is virtually impossible for them to return a government. The new, anti-migration Reform Party and the centrist Liberal Democrats will look to challenge Sunak in some of his party\u2019s historical strongholds, complicating his efforts to hold power. North of the border, the pro-independence Scottish National Party will hope to hold off a Labour challenge and regain its dominance in Scotland\u2019s politics despite a rocky period and the recent ascension of its third leader in 15 months. The Conservatives under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a healthy majority in the last UK-wide vote, in December 2019, pledging to push through Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union \u2013 an issue that had transfixed politics in the country for more than three years. But Johnson\u2019s premiership collapsed after a string of scandals, paving the way for his then-finance minister Sunak to emerge as a frontrunner for the leadership. Adding to the sense that the Conservatives are nearing the end of their time in power, dozens of Tory MPs \u2014 including former cabinet ministers and ex-Prime Minister Theresa May \u2014 announced they would not seek re-election. But recent election and referendum campaigns have proved volatile, and Tories still publicly hopeful of success have pointed to mixed levels of enthusiasm for Labour\u2019s offering. The vote will take place on\u00a0Thursday July 4\u00a0in all of the UK\u2019s 650 parliamentary constituencies,\u00a0and counting will occur overnight, with the two main parties seeking to cross the 326 mark needed for a majority. A government will be formed as soon as that mark is crossed, and take charge immediately, pending the symbolic approval of King Charles III.

{"id": "2024_05_16_uk_uk-sex-education-gender-schools-rishi-sunak-gbr-intl", "text": "As a general election inches closer into view, the embittered debates circulating inside British politics have entered a new arena: the classroom. New guidance unveiled by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak\u2019s government on Thursday seeks to overhaul the way sex education and gender identity is taught in England\u2019s schools, a significant intervention into a delicate topic that appeared suddenly on the front pages of Britain\u2019s newspapers a day before the announcement. The government says the revised guidance, which came amid pressure from a handful of its lawmakers, provides clarity on a complex topic, emphasizing facts over what it calls \u201ccontested views\u201d about gender identity. But critics of the plans \u2013 among them a swath of teachers and teaching union leaders \u2013 say the move is a politicized attempt to appeal to a narrow cohort of voters the government is in danger of losing, months before a general election. And they arrived amid what most see as the death throes of Sunak\u2019s flailing government, which has for months seized upon and discarded a number of divisive topics in the hopes of reversing a stubborn polling deficit. Pepe Di\u2019lasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders and a headteacher at a school in northern England, told CNN the plans were, in his view, driven by \u201ca political agenda at the front of a campaign season.\u201d \u201cWhen the first time you hear about those is in a headline on a tabloid newspaper, then that doesn\u2019t reassure you that the right research is taking place, and that the right level of integrity is behind the decision-making,\u201d Di\u2019lasio said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is young people, and their health and wellbeing, and their care and guidance, being used as a political football.\u201d \u2018Utterly disgraceful\u2019 The new draft guidance from the government, published Thursday, takes aim at the way sex and relationships are taught to English children in both primary and secondary schools. Those lessons have been compulsory at schools in England since 2020, but the government says it reviewed how they are taught after \u201creports of pupils being taught inappropriate content\u201d in some schools. Under the new approach, children can\u2019t be taught sex education before the age of nine, while \u201cexplicit discussion of sexual activity\u201d will be delayed until children are 13. Gender identity, or the fact that people can change gender, is meanwhile \u201chighly contested and should not be taught\u201d at all, according to the Department of Education. The government said that teaching what it calls the \u201ctheory\u201d of gender identity \u201ccould prompt some children to start to question their gender when they may not have done so otherwise\u201d \u2013 a suggestion that has been angrily contested by LGBTQ+ rights groups. \u201cIt is hard to see how rigid limits on what can be discussed and when would be in the best interests of young people \u2013 and this may even risk them seeking information from less reliable sources,\u201d Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said in a statement. Referring to the parts of the guidance that target the teaching of transgender issues, Di\u2019lasio told CNN that teachers should be allowed to discuss societal issues of the day with students, rather than have those conversations restricted. Sam Freedman, a senior adviser to the Ark education charity and a senior fellow at the Institute for Government think tank, added on X: \u201cIsn\u2019t something being highly contested a good reason to talk about it in schools - acknowledging that it is highly contested and explaining why?\u201d The plans will be subject to a nine-week consultation period, which will conclude before the start of Britain\u2019s next school year. But the uncertain timing of a general election \u2013 due by January, and expected in the second half of the year \u2013 muddies the waters further as to when, or if, the guidance will ever be implemented. And, as with many of the government\u2019s recent announcements, its unveiling was accompanied by a string of combative language that played into the \u201cculture war\u201d topics the Conservatives have increasingly sought to thrust into the national discourse. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan wrote in The Sun newspaper that \u201cteachers are there to teach children facts, not push the agendas of \u00adcampaign groups.\u201d \u201cNever again will young girls be taught they might be that \u00adlittle bit happier if they were a boy,\u201d she added. Transgender rights have been the target of heavy-handed rhetoric from the government for several months, as Sunak looks to goad his opponent, Labour leader Keir Starmer, away from debates about the economy and healthcare, and toward issues surrounding identity. Those efforts ultimately sparked huge controversy when Sunak made a transgender jibe toward Starmer in Parliament in February, while the mother of Brianna Ghey, a 16-year-old transgender girl who was murdered last year, watched from the public gallery. \u201cOne does wonder whether (the guidance) is connected to the fact that we\u2019re moving into a general election, and it is purely being used to gain votes of a particular section of society,\u201d Di\u2019lasio said. \u201cIt is utterly disgraceful that once again this government has decided to engage in private briefings and media leaks simply to grab headlines,\u201d Whiteman, the head teachers\u2019 union boss, added. \u201cThe children and young people of this country deserve better.\u201d Asked by the BBC on Thursday how widespread \u201cinappropriate\u201d teaching on gender identity was, Keegan admitted: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s widespread \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t know, because it\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve gone and done a particular survey of.\u201d Sunak will hope this week\u2019s headlines can add ammunition to his effort to portray himself as a defender of \u201ccommon sense,\u201d a catch-all term that the prime minister frequently uses as he scrambles to maintain the support of socially conservative voters. But education specialists worry that school pupils have become the latest victim of that push. Di\u2019lasio told CNN that the guidance marked a departure from the way new instructions have historically been passed down to schools. \u201cYou may not have agreed with all of them over time, but there was always some evidence behind them. There was always some research behind them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when a political ideology comes into it, it becomes more difficult for the whole of the education world to move behind it,\u201d he added. \u201cMy worry is that if we\u2019re not careful, there will be young people that are not cared for and not educated in the way we want them to be.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/uk/uk-sex-education-gender-schools-rishi-sunak-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_middleeast_israel-idf-hostage-video-hamas-intl", "text": "Families of seven female Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas during the October 7 attacks have released graphic footage of their abduction as they pile pressure on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure their release. The video shows the women \u2014 all Israel Defense Forces (IDF) personnel \u2014 lined up against a wall, their hands bound. The faces of some of the women are bruised and bloodied. The footage was previously released by Hamas, according to the Hostages Families Forum. The campaigning group obtained it from the IDF, which had previously edited the video to exclude the most disturbing scenes. \u201cEvery new testimony about what happened to the hostages echoes the same tragic truth \u2013 we must bring them all back home, now,\u201d the Hostage Families Forum said in a press release Wednesday. The\u00a0women were\u00a0kidnapped during a Hamas raid on Israel\u2019s Nahal Oz military base, near the northern Gaza Strip, as part of the militant group\u2019s attacks on Israel that left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 250 captured and taken hostage in the enclave. Following the attack,\u00a0Israel\u00a0launched a war in Gaza that has killed\u00a0more than 35,000 Palestinians\u00a0over the past seven months, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. The\u00a0kidnapped\u00a0women were working as IDF observers, a role that involves monitoring Israel\u2019s border security. Video of the ordeal has been made public as pressure mounts on Netanyahu to secure the release of the Israelis still held by Hamas,\u00a0which his government has made a key goal of the Gaza offensive. Numerous attempts to strike a hostage-for-ceasefire deal with Hamas have faltered in recent months, infuriating those in Israel campaigning for the return of the captives. \u201cThe State of Israel cannot accept a reality where its citizens constantly feel their lives are threatened and suffer from unrelenting fear and anxiety,\u201d the Hostages Families Forum\u00a0said\u00a0as it publicized the video on Wednesday. \u201cWith each passing day, it becomes more challenging to bring the hostages back home \u2013 the living for rehabilitation and the murdered for proper burial. The Israeli government must not waste another moment; it must return to the negotiating table today!\u201d Netanyahu\u00a0said Wednesday he is \u201chorrified by the video showing the abduction of our dear field observers.\u201d He said Israel will \u201ccontinue doing everything to bring them home\u201d and the \u201ccruelty of Hamas terrorists only enhances my determination to fight forcefully until the destruction of Hamas, to ensure that what we\u2019ve seen this evening will not happen ever again.\u201d War cabinet minister Benny Gantz said when he first watched the video it made his \u201cstomach turn.\u201d However, Gantz said, \u201cthe responsibility of leaders is not only to look reality in the eye \u2013 it is to create a different reality even when it comes to difficult decisions. And that is our responsibility.\u201d \u2018For the world to see\u2019 One of the women shown in the video, Ori Megidish, was\u00a0rescued by the IDF in a special operation\u00a023 days after being taken. Another, Noa Marciano, an IDF Corporal, was\u00a0killed while in Gaza\u00a0and her body was returned to Israel in November. But five of the seven \u2014 Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Daniela Gilboa, and Naama Levy \u2014 remain in captivity, more than seven months after being taken across the border. The mother of Naama Levy told CNN on Wednesday that bringing them home is not\u00a0a top priority of the Israeli government, saying some members of the government did not even watch the video. \u201cMinisters and\u00a0members of the government were asked to watch a version of this video in their meetings, and some of them refused and said we want to sleep OK at night,\u201d Ayelet Levy Shachar said, adding, \u201cSo if this is the reaction when it\u2019s their duty to watch these materials, this is their job, so they can make correct decisions, then we think that we should put it out there for our citizens, for the world to see.\u201d More than 100 hostages were freed during a release deal in November, but the IDF believes there are still around 130 people being held in Gaza. Efforts to reach a deal that would pause the war in Gaza and allow the release of hostages have repeatedly been dashed. Earlier this month, Hamas said Israel\u2019s rejection of a ceasefire plan submitted by mediators at negotiations in Cairo had sent hostage release talks back to \u201csquare one.\u201d The statement came a day after the latest round of Gaza truce and hostage deal talks ended in Cairo, without a deal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/middleeast/israel-idf-hostage-video-hamas-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_middleeast_amal-clooney-icc-arrest-warrant-israel-hamas-gaza-intl-latam", "text": "Human rights attorney Amal Clooney is among a group of legal experts who advised the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor to seek arrest warrants against the top leaders of Israel and Hamas. The panel was convened by the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan and tasked to review the evidence and legal analysis underpinning his application for warrants against three Hamas leaders and two Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It issued a detailed legal report on Monday, which said the panel found \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the individuals named in the arrest warrants have committed war crimes or crimes against humanity. Clooney, who has represented victims of mass atrocities, faced online criticism prior to her announcement for not speaking about Israel\u2019s siege on Gaza. In a statement shared on her Clooney Foundation for Justice website on Monday, she explained how she had found herself advising Khan. \u201cMore than four months ago, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court asked me to assist him with evaluating evidence of suspected war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israel and Gaza,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI agreed and joined a panel of international legal experts to undertake this task.\u201d She said the panel\u2019s findings were \u201cunanimous\u201d despite their diverse backgrounds. \u201cI served on this panel because I believe in the rule of law and the need to protect civilian lives. The law that protects civilians in war was developed more than 100 years ago and it applies in every country in the world regardless of the reasons for a conflict,\u201d Clooney said in the statement. The eight-person legal panel consisted of renowned legal experts, including Theodor Meron, former President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and Lord Justice Fulford, a former ICC judge. They \u201cunanimously determined\u201d that the court had jurisdiction over crimes committed in Palestinian territories and by Palestinian nationals, Clooney\u2019s statement wrote. The panel also was unanimous in concluding that \u201cHamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, including hostage-taking, murder and crimes of sexual violence.\u201d Clooney\u2019s statement added there was also \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d Netanyahu and \u201cIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity including starvation as a method of warfare, murder, persecution and extermination.\u201d A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan\u2019s application for the arrest warrants. Both Hamas and Israeli politicians condemned the arrest warrants, with Netanyahu calling it a \u201ctravesty of justice\u201d and an \u201coutrageous decision\u201d that \u201ccreates a twisted and false moral equivalence between the leaders of Israel and the henchmen of Hamas.\u201d The application for warrants marks the first time the ICC has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. Israel and the US are not members of the ICC. However, the ICC claims to have jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court\u2019s founding principles in 2015. The Biden administration on Monday forcefully denounced the ICC\u2019s move, with President Joe Biden saying in a statement: \u201cWhatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence \u2013 none \u2013 between Israel and Hamas.\u201d Clooney, who is a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers in London and an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School, is married to the actor George Clooney. Alongside her husband, she co-founded the Clooney Foundation for Justice, which gives free legal support to victims of abuses of power, according to its website. She has represented Yazidi victims of genocide \u201cin the only three genocide cases against ISIS members in the world,\u201d according to the website.

At 44, the multifaceted, award-winning Nigerian artist has transformed her dreams into reality. On May 10, her much-anticipated debut film, \u201cWater & Garri,\u201d hit Prime Video, marking her leap into acting. Executive produced by Savage and directed by her long-time music video director Meji Alabi, \u201cWater & Garri\u201d is a collaboration between Everything Savage, Unbound Studios, and JM Films. The concept was born from Savage\u2019s idea to create a visual album for her 2021 EP of the same name. Because of that, it \u201cinitially it was only supposed to be like a short film,\u201d Savage said, \u201cand then it grew on its own and took its own identity.\u201d Written by Comfort Emmanuel, the film is set in a fictional town on the Cape Coast of Ghana and follows a determined fashion designer named Aisha (Savage) who returns to her hometown due to a family tragedy after a decade in the US. However, upon her return home, she finds her once familiar surroundings altered by escalating violence and heightened tensions. As she reconnects with her family, old friends, and a former flame, Aisha must confront her past and face the guilt of what she left behind \u2013 an experience Savage says drew parallels to her own life. \u201cWe both felt like we had to go somewhere to chase our dreams,\u201d said Savage, who spent two weeks in intensive training in London to prepare for the role of Aisha. \u201cIt was just to break me out of my shell, to break me out of Tiwa Savage and just empty me out \u2013 and then just allow me to be or embody like a whole different character,\u201d she added. Experimenting with a new sound As the production of the film pressed forward, Savage didn\u2019t only shed her superstar persona, she moved on from the initial musical inspiration for the film, instead opting to create an original soundtrack for the movie. \u201cIt was supposed to include the first five songs on the EP; by the time we finished filming, it just took on a whole different identity, and we just created a whole new soundtrack,\u201d the singer explained. The album served as a platform for Savage to push her vocal boundaries and delve into new musical genres. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been boxed to a certain sound because I\u2019ve done it for over 10 years,\u201d Savage said. The 10-song soundtrack included collaborations with French Nigerian singer Asa on the folk song \u201cEmotions,\u201d\u00a0American gospel artist Zacardi Cortez on \u201cI Need You,\u201d and Richard Bona & The Cavemen on the jazz track \u201cWater & Garri.\u201d \u201cCreating the soundtrack allowed me to explore those different genres, and I think I didn\u2019t feel like I would have been able to do that as Tiwa Savage,\u201d she said. \u201c(So) I was able to explore those pockets of my talent.\u201d \u00a0 The singer admits she has always loved Jazz, R&B, and gospel music, but after acting in \u201cWater & Garri\u201d and performing the soundtrack, she says has discovered how much she has grown as an artist and feels encouraged to be limitless in her creativity. \u201cI\u2019m not limiting myself to the sound that people know me for; I\u2019ve definitely grown even in a performance \u2013 like I used to have a lot of dances and do routines,\u201d the singer-turned-actress explained. \u201cNow I think I\u2019m more about vocal delivery,\u201d she added. \u201cGoing forward from that \u2026 I feel like I can do anything.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/africa/tiwa-savage-water-and-garri-nigeria-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_asia_north-korea-propaganda-song-ban-intl-hnk", "text": "A North Korean propaganda song extolling Kim Jong Un as \u201ca great leader and a friendly parent\u201d has gone viral on TikTok, with mashups and dances racking up millions of views, leading to South Korea banning the tune due to \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d Seoul\u2019s media regulator on Monday announced it was blocking access to versions of \u201cFriendly Father,\u201d the\u00a0cheery propaganda hit that became\u00a0an unlikely social media sensation. The song\u00a0was\u00a0unveiled in April during a nighttime concert to mark the completion of a housing project in the capital Pyongyang, according to North Korean\u00a0state-run Korean Central News Agency. Its lyrics praise\u00a0Kim \u2013 the third-generation leader of one of the world\u2019s most autocratic nations \u2013 as \u201ca great leader and a friendly parent,\u201d and the music video depicts North Koreans enthusiastically belting out the orchestral song proclaiming that Kim \u201ctakes care of us with affection.\u201d While North Korean propaganda is nothing new, the difference this time is that \u201cFriendly Father\u201d was posted on TikTok \u2013 whose owner is Chinese internet giant ByteDance. The song went viral after content creators around the world used it to make their own edits of the music video adding dances and\u00a0unserious captions to their own short one-minute clips on the platform, garnering over 2 million views. But it wasn\u2019t necessarily a propaganda coup for Pyongyang. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Gen Z suddenly declaring allegiance for the regime,\u201d said Alexandra Leonzini, a Cambridge University scholar conducting research on North Korean music. \u201cThey\u2019re laughing at the regime not with the regime.\u201d Nonetheless, South Korean security officials came down on the parodies. The Korea Communications Standards Commission decided to block 29 videos of the song, following a request from Seoul\u2019s National Intelligence Service. But some versions of the song on YouTube were still accessible to users in South Korea as of Wednesday. \u201cThe video is typical content linked to psychological warfare against South Korea, as it was posted on a channel operated to connect with the outside world and mainly focused on unilaterally idolizing and glorifying Kim,\u201d the regulator said in a statement. The ban was not a surprise, as the country\u2019s National Security Act blocks access to North Korean government websites and media, restricting exposure to Kim\u2019s autocratic regime and penalizing behaviors promoting its authoritarian and nuclear-armed neighbor. More than 90% of the reclusive state\u2019s propaganda songs are about idolizing its leader and \u201cFriendly Father\u201d is no different, said Ha Seung-hee, visiting professor of North Korea studies at Dongguk University. But it does show an improvement in production values, and could signal a new propaganda strategy for the country. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s music videos used to show nature and scenery, like something you\u2019d see at a karaoke with subtitles\u2026 but now, it\u2019s changed,\u201d Ha said, adding that \u201cFriendly Father\u201d appears to have used better choreography and video editing. \u201cNorth Korea didn\u2019t intend it, but whether it was the algorithm or something else, the video got attention and once Pyongyang learns that it is effective, it can make new content in this method,\u201d Ha said. North and South Korea have been cut off from each other since the Korean War in 1953 ended with an armistice. The two sides are still technically at war, but both governments have long sought the goal of one day reunifying, and still view each other as hostile. Millions of North Koreans live in impoverished conditions under totalitarian dictatorship, which has continued for over seven decades spanning three generations of the Kim dynasty. The regime controls everything from food rations, access to education and assignment of jobs, and people are often put into grueling work camps.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/asia/north-korea-propaganda-song-ban-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_climate_supreme-court-epa-biden-trump", "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency threw down a gauntlet on climate this spring, pushing carmakers toward electric vehicles, cracking down on natural gas leaks and forcing power plants to get their planet-warming pollution under control. The new rules could prevent billions of tons of climate pollution from entering the atmosphere from America\u2019s dirtiest industries \u2013 pollution that is rapidly warming the planet, spurring record heatwaves and supercharging storms. But only if they can survive the nation\u2019s highest court. The 6-3 conservative Supreme Court majority is casting a long shadow over the EPA\u2019s agenda, with a \u201chair trigger\u201d on cases involving the agency, longtime environmental attorney and Harvard Law School professor Richard Lazarus told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s no question there\u2019s high skepticism that many of the justices harbor about EPA\u2019s rules and regulations,\u201d he added.\u201d Over the last three years, the EPA has tried to Supreme Court-proof its rules, hewing as close to the law as it can get. The agency\u2019s authority to regulate greenhouse gases from power plants was curbed \u2013 but not taken away entirely \u2013 in a 2022 case. Speaking to environmental journalists at a conference in April, EPA administrator Michael Regan said his staff is \u201cvery attentive\u201d to how the Supreme Court \u201cis responding.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re trying to now design more robust rules in response to the environment that we\u2019re in,\u201d Regan added. EPA is being exceedingly careful with all its language, aware that even its media releases may be picked apart by legal opponents. The news releases and Regan\u2019s remarks the agency released to announce four recent actions on the power sector were crafted in a way to avoid stirring the legal pot and not overstep EPA\u2019s authority, a source familiar with the process told CNN \u2013 a remarkable example of the intense scrutiny the agency is under. The EPA is already facing legal challenges on nearly every major rule it has enacted, largely from Republican states and the fossil fuel industry. Now it is facing likely challenges from the same cast of characters on the EV and power plant regulations, in which any Supreme Court action could have global repercussions: The US is the world\u2019s second-largest polluter behind China, and the EPA is the main agency setting and enforcing rules of the road for its dirtiest industries. The EPA is attempting to thread the smallest of needles: write lasting regulations in a way that will survive a Supreme Court that multiple legal experts described as \u201chostile.\u201d The agency is \u201ctrying to avoid anything remotely novel,\u201d Lazarus said. \u201cThey do no one any favor if they pass a rule that flies in the face of what the court has said and then the rule after three or four years is invalidated.\u201d The court\u2019s conservatives vs. EPA Legal experts view the court\u2019s 6-person conservative majority as divided into two camps on environmental issues: three justices who are seen as reliable votes against the EPA, and three who \u2013 while not necessarily swing votes \u2013 are more of a question mark. Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch make up the reliable anti-EPA wing of the bench, experts say. \u201cThose are the three who you count on to be the most hostile to regulation, and Gorsuch and Alito in particular, about environmental regulation,\u201d David Doniger, a senior federal strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told CNN. \u201cAlito \u2013 you can hear it in the way he writes opinions, you can hear it in his questions,\u201d Lazarus said. \u201cIn arguments he is skeptical, often mocking, of the environmental position.\u201d Thomas\u2019s position, based on deep skepticism of federal authority and deep beliefs in states\u2019 rights, is another staunch anti-EPA vote, if not with as much open derision as Alito. Then there\u2019s Gorsuch, the son of Reagan-appointed EPA administrator Anne Gorsuch, who oversaw a period of anti-environmental regulations during her tenure before being forced to resign. Now, Justice Gorsuch is angling to blow up the federal regulatory process as we know it. He is widely seen as a lead advocate for overturning a 1984 decision known as the Chevron deference \u2013 a legal test that gives federal agencies wide latitude to put forth regulations and compels courts to defer to agencies in many cases. The court\u2019s three remaining conservatives \u2013 Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 certainly aren\u2019t friends of EPA, but the level of their opposition isn\u2019t as clear-cut. Roberts wrote an opinion in 2022\u2019s West Virginia v. EPA case preserving the agency\u2019s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, however more narrowly. And environmental attorneys are intrigued by Barrett, who has had some tough questions for EPA\u2019s challengers during recent Supreme Court arguments. Justice Brett Kavanaugh stands out the most among the group. Kavanaugh\u2019s background is steeped in regulations and administrative law from a stint on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the court that hears challenges on federal regulations. But environmental law experts don\u2019t view Kavanaugh as hardline as Alito or Gorsuch, citing his notable departure from the conservative wing on the court\u2019s decision in the 2023 case Sackett v. EPA, in which the court stripped the Clean Water Act of much of its power. \u201cHe\u2019s got some animus towards environmental regulation, but it doesn\u2019t run as consistent and deep,\u201d said Doniger. \u201cHe\u2019s unpredictable, but he\u2019s not completely ungettable.\u201d The coming legal challenges The EPA is now facing headwinds from all directions. One legal challenge to the agency\u2019s rules on car pollution\u00a0has been tossed by the DC Circuit, while another is still pending. Red states most recently filed a separate challenge to the agency\u2019s pollution rules for heavy-duty trucks. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that the EPA can use its authority to regulate greenhouse gases. But the court has overturned years of precedent before, including on blockbuster issues like abortion. Even if the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t fully overturn its 2007 ruling, its conservative majority is steadily eroding the EPA\u2019s ability to regulate pollution, legal experts told CNN. \u201cI think we\u2019re operating in a world where there\u2019s a majority of the court that is skeptical of the power of EPA to regulate greenhouse gases, even though the court has decided that question,\u201d said Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and a former high-ranking Biden administration transportation official. \u201cIn two different instances, the court has viewed (the EPA\u2019s) power as narrow, even though it exists. Then the question is, how narrow is narrow?\u201d While the EPA and other agencies face an existential threat from the Chevron decision this summer, conservatives are attacking from another angle \u2013 using an obscure legal premise known as major questions doctrine to further poke holes in the agency\u2019s authority. The major questions doctrine, revived during West Virginia v. EPA, says agencies can\u2019t regulate on something that Congress hasn\u2019t given them explicit authority to do. Major questions is being used \u201cmore aggressively than it has in the past,\u201d Carlson said, adding she thinks it is a larger threat to the EPA than Chevron. Major questions, if used often and effectively to attack the EPA and other agencies, could render them useless because it argues they cannot operate without Congress passing laws explicitly giving them approval to do things. And given extreme political polarization, things often move at a glacial pace in Congress. There is one glimmer of hope for the EPA; Congress recently passed a major climate bill, doling out hundreds of billions in tax credits to get American to buy cleaner cars, give enormous tax incentives to companies to capture power, oil companies to tighten methane leaks. That gives the agency the recent Congressional direction the Supreme Court has said it so badly needs, some experts said. \u201cCongress has freshly legislated,\u201d said Doniger. \u201cYou can\u2019t get much clearer than that.\u201d In addition to pouring billions of subsidies into clean energy projects and EVs, Democrats also used the Inflation Reduction Act to explicitly update language in the Clean Air Act \u2013 labeling planet-warming greenhouse gases as one of the forms of pollution covered by the law. However, legal experts CNN spoke to were split on how effective those protections would be under the eyes of the courts. Some, like Doniger, were optimistic it could be an effective shield. \u201cThe court is saying we want to see Congress clear indication of what it wants to do, and we also disfavor old laws,\u201d Doniger said. \u201cHere you have a 2022 law.\u201d Lazarus is more skeptical the court will be persuaded by the fact that Congress is \u201cjust giving money\u201d and that the IRA amendment to the Clean Air Act has \u201climited reach.\u201d \u201cWe have increasing problems and new things require congressional intention, and Congress has basically stopped making laws,\u201d Lazarus said. EPA \u201ccan\u2019t afford to wait to Congress gets its act together.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/climate/supreme-court-epa-biden-trump/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

Police are investigating the \u201cunexplained death\u201d of Matthew Trickett, 37, whose body was found by a member of the public in the park in Maidenhead, Berkshire, west of London, on Sunday, Thames Valley police said in a statement. Trickett had appeared alongside two other suspects at Westminster Magistrates\u2019 Court on May 13, charged with national security offences. All three were granted bail. \u201cTrickett was on court bail, awaiting court proceedings, which required him to register at a police station regularly,\u201d the police said.  In a statement, Trickett\u2019s family told British newspaper The Times: \u201cWe\u2019re mourning the loss of a much-loved son, brother and family man.\u201d The Chinese Embassy in the UK and Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive John Lee have both condemned and rejected the accusations. Relations between Hong Kong and its former colonial ruler Britain have soured in recent years following mass pro-democracy protests in the Chinese city in 2019 and 2020. The British government has criticized Hong Kong\u2019s Beijing-backed crackdown on almost all opposition in the years following the protests, while Hong Kong authorities have bristled at Britain providing a safe haven for pro-democracy leaders sought by the Hong Kong police. The charges against the three men allege that between December 20, 2023, and May 2, 2024, they agreed to undertake information gathering, surveillance and acts of deception that were likely to materially assist a foreign intelligence service, according to PA media. Police also alleged that on May 1, the three forced entry into a UK residential address, according to PA. While all three were granted bail, they were barred from traveling internationally with District Judge Louisa Cieciora saying they must abide by a night time curfew and report weekly to their local police station. In a recent press conference, Lee said one of the men charged was the office manager of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in London but did not directly address a question over whether it was involved in surveillance of Hong Kong dissidents in the UK. Lee, the city\u2019s former security chief, said that Hong Kong\u2019s Economic and Trade Office exists to facilitate cultural and economic interactions with people and businesses in the UK and that \u201cAny attempt to make unwarranted accusations against the Hong Kong government is unacceptable.\u201d Additional reporting by Lucas Lilieholm, Chris Lau and Jerome Taylor in Hong Kong", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/asia/briton-accused-spying-hong-kong-dead-in-park-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_africa_south-africa-elections-explained-intl", "text": "South Africans go to the polls on May 29 for what will likely be the most pivotal general election since the end of apartheid. Polls show the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party could lose its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led the party to power in 1994. While polling can be challenging in South Africa, most analysts believe that the ANC faces its stiffest challenge yet with a population deeply frustrated by the country\u2019s direction. This is the seventh general election South Africa has held since the end of white minority rule 30 years ago. A record 27.79 million people are registered to vote \u2013 the highest number to date, according to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC.) The slide in popularity mirrors the challenges of liberation movements that have transitioned into governing parties across the continent. What could happen? If support for the ANC drops below 50% for the first time, the party will be forced to enter into a coalition government. A loss of a simple majority would put significant pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa within his party, as he promised a \u201cnew dawn\u201d when he took over leadership in 2018 from disgraced former president Jacob Zuma. Support for the ANC has been on a slow downward trend over the decades but at the last election in 2019 it dropped below 60% for the first time, with the party earning 57.50% of the vote. What\u2019s gone wrong for the ANC? South Africans have a lot to grumble about. Violent crime is on the rise. Murder is at a 20-year high; with someone killed in the country roughly every 20 minutes, according to the most recent quarterly police crime statistics. Many have lost faith in the police as part of a larger breakdown in trust in government. The Rainbow Nation has the highest sustained rate of unemployment in the world \u2013 and it\u2019s growing.Meanwhile, rolling electricity blackouts, water outages, a crisis in education, and a lack of service delivery all weigh on the population. But high on the list of issues are the allegations of corruption and mismanagement that continue to damage the ANC. When Ramaphosa \u2013 Mandela\u2019s favorite to succeed him as leader \u2013 replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma as president, he pledged \u201cto work very hard not to disappoint the people of South Africa.\u201d But in 2022, Ramaphosa was himself forced to deny stealing money. \u201cCorruption has wounded our democracy and shaken people\u2019s faith in our institutions,\u201d he admitted in a November speech. \u201cIf corruption is not arrested, the greatest damage will not be in the funds stolen, the jobs lost, or the services not delivered. The greatest damage will be to the belief in democracy itself,\u201d he added. This year South Africa received its lowest score on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index. The index scores countries from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). South Africa received 41 \u2013 worse than China and Cuba at 42. What are the other key parties? The country\u2019s main opposition party, the centrist Democratic Alliance (DA), is led by John Steenhuisen and is seen by many as a party for White South Africans. For this election, the DA has formed a coalition bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. If the polls are to be believed, the ANC may have to make the choice between forming a coalition with the Zuma-backed party \u2013 uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) \u2013 and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) or the DA. Steenhuisen, for his part, has not ruled out going into coalition with the ANC if it were to keep the EFF and MK out of government. The EFF is a populist far-left party led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema. It began as a splinter party of the ANC and espouses expropriation of land without compensation and sweeping state nationalism. The EFF has shown support for the MK party and Malema recently said that he intends to \u201cgive the EFF vote to the ANC\u201d if it doesn\u2019t get 50% \u2013 on the condition that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, becomes Minister of Finance. Steenhuisen has described an ANC-EFF-MK pact as a \u201cdoomsday coalition.\u201d Talking of Zuma\u2026 The former president continues to be a thorn in Ramaphosa\u2019s side. After a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court after failing to appear before a corruption inquiry, the 82-year-old is now the leader of the MK party \u2013 and was up until this week top of their parliamentary list. The country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled Monday he is not eligible to run for parliament\u00a0until five years have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. The unanimous ruling capped months-long speculation and legal wrangling on whether he could stand for the country\u2019s top legislative body. His party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Zuma had been campaigning against what he perceives as Ramaphosa\u2019s failures and disillusioned ANC voters were lapping it up, according to polls. An April poll by the Johannesburg-based Social Research Foundation poll found the ANC may get 37% of the vote, while MK may garner 13%. However, the most recent polling from the same foundation puts support for the MK party at 10.5% and\u00a0the ANC at 44.8% on Monday.\u00a0This suggests the ANC may be winning back support and may only need a small coalition partner.

{"id": "2024_05_21_uk_us-embassy-london-congestion-fees-scli-intl", "text": "The US embassy in London is refusing to pay more than $18.6 million in charges from unpaid congestion fees, according to Transport for London (TfL), which oversees the city\u2019s vast transport network. The congestion charge was introduced in 2003 in order to stem traffic and pollution in central London. Drivers within the congestion charge zone are required to pay a $19 daily charge between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays and 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. on weekends. TfL says it will pursue all unpaid fees and said in a statement it is even \u201cpushing for the matter to be taken up at the International Court of Justice.\u201d The US embassy has declined to pay up and is claiming diplomatic immunity from the fines. \u201cIn accordance with international law as reflected in the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, our position is that the Congestion Charge is a tax from which diplomatic missions are exempt,\u201d\u00a0a US embassy spokesperson said. \u201cOur long-standing position is shared by many other diplomatic missions in London,\u201d the spokesperson added. However, TfL is insisting that in agreement with the UK government, London\u2019s congestion charge constitutes a service and not tax. \u201cThis means that diplomats are not exempt from paying it.\u201d It has also politely declared there to be a \u201cstubborn minority\u201d of embassies that do not pay the charge, despite \u201crepresentations through diplomatic channels,\u201d and posted a lengthy list of offenders. As of December 31, 2023, a total of 161 embassies, high commissions and consulates owed more than $182 million combined in unpaid congestion charge fees, according to TfL data. According to TfL\u2019s figures, the Japanese embassy owes the second highest amount from unpaid congestion charge fees, at around $12.8 million.  This not the first time a dispute has emerged over whether the US embassy should pay the charge. In July 2005, the embassy issued a diplomatic note, claiming the charge \u201cis a tax that cannot be lawfully imposed on the U.S. Government, its diplomatic and consular personnel, or its military force.\u201d While the embassy initially paid the charge, it stopped doing so on July 12, 2005, declaring the charge to be \u201cin tension\u201d with \u201cduties owed to foreign missions and diplomats.\u201d In 2020, then UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said British officials held \u201cmeetings with a number of diplomatic missions and international organisations\u201d to press for \u201cpayment of outstanding fines and debt,\u201d including \u201cunpaid congestion charge\u201d fees. The Japanese embassy told CNN \u201cthe Government of Japan is of the view that the charge corresponds to neither \u2018dues and taxes\u2026 such as represent payment for specific services rendered\u2019 nor \u2018charges levied for specific services rendered\u2019, as stipulated in the relevant international conventions, and therefore the Embassy, its diplomatic agents and their family members should be exempt from the charge.\u201d The UK Foreign Office said that diplomats are expected to pay the charge, adding that they believe there are no legal grounds for diplomatic exemptions.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/uk/us-embassy-london-congestion-fees-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_tech_damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system", "text": "A pair of recent ransomware attacks crippled computer systems at two major American health care firms, disrupting patient care and exposing fundamental weaknesses in the US health care system\u2019s defenses against hackers. In both cases, federal officials and private cyber experts scrambled to try to limit the damage and get computers back online. But the cascading effects from the hacks, with ambulances diverted from hospitals and pharmacies unable to process insurance, has underscored for some US lawmakers, senior Biden administration officials and policy experts that the health care system is ill-prepared for the ripple effects of a cyberattack and needs new security regulations. Health care lags other industries such as big financial institutions and energy providers when it comes to IT security, according to some experts. \u201cIndustry has successfully demanded voluntary cybersecurity for years \u2014 and this is what we get,\u201d Joshua Corman, a cybersecurity expert who has focused on the health sector for years, told CNN. Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the finance committee, told CNN that \u201cevery new devastating hack hammers home the need for mandatory cybersecurity standards in the health care sector, particularly when it comes to the largest companies that millions of patients depend on for care and medicine.\u201d Without action, the senator said, \u201cpatients\u2019 access to care and their personal health information will be compromised and ransomed by hackers over and over again.\u201d In 2023, 46 hospital systems in the US, comprising 141 hospitals, were impacted by ransomware,\u00a0according\u00a0to a tally from cybersecurity firm Emsisoft.\u00a0That\u2019s up from 25 hospital systems hit by ransomware in 2022, according to the firm. The two ransomware attacks hit different nerves of the health care system. In February, cybercriminals broke into an unsecured computer server used by Change Healthcare, an insurance billing giant that processes about 15 billion health care transactions annually. The hack cut off health care providers from billions of dollars of revenue, snarled service at pharmacies across the US and\u00a0may have compromised\u00a0the personal data of a third of Americans. In early May, cybercriminals used a different type of ransomware in an attack on Ascension, a St. Louis-based nonprofit network that includes 140 hospitals and 40 senior living facilities in 19 states. The hack\u00a0forced\u00a0the health network to divert ambulances from some hospitals. The Biden administration is preparing to issue minimum cybersecurity requirements for US hospitals, senior White House cyber official Anne Neuberger confirmed this month. The details of that proposal have yet to be finalized. But the American Hospital Association, which represents hospitals across the United States, opposes the proposal, saying it would effectively re-victimize victims of cyberattacks by imposing penalties after they are hacked. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services previously said\u00a0they are willing to use a number of measures,\u00a0including\u00a0imposing\u00a0monetary fines, to both force and encourage health care organizations to better secure their systems. Momentum is also growing on Capitol Hill to force health care organizations to meet basic cybersecurity standards. A bill\u00a0introduced\u00a0in March by Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, would allow \u201cadvanced and accelerated\u201d Medicare payments to be sent to hacked health care providers as long as those providers and their contractors meet minimum cybersecurity standards. An unhealthy situation The ransomware attacks on Change Healthcare and Ascension have spotlighted the health sector\u2019s cybersecurity weakness like no other events before it, experts told CNN. And even if there are new regulatory requirements for cybersecurity, the sector \u201cwill continue to struggle from such attacks if the business of providing\u00a0healthcare remains financially fraught [and forces] leaders to prioritize only revenue generating investments,\u201d Carter Groome, chief executive of cybersecurity firm First Health Advisory, told CNN. The Change Healthcare ransomware attack, in particular, has brought fresh attention from policymakers and experts on what many see as the over-consolidation of the US health care industry. If hackers can defeat security measures at one company, millions of patients who rely on that health network can be affected. \u201cUS healthcare is in a death spiral,\u201d said Corman, who co-founded I am the Cavalry, a volunteer group that focuses on cybersecurity for resource-poor organizations in the health sector, among others. \u201cDistressed hospitals get acquired into too-big-to-fail conglomerates. Ransoms cause distress for the little ones, and multi-week, multi-state outages for the ones \u2018saved\u2019 by the big ones.\u201d Any new cybersecurity regulations should be strong enough to force meaningful improvements in the sector\u2019s cybersecurity, Corman argued. \u2018Yes. cybersecurity is costly,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we can clearly see\u2026 neglect is more costly.\u201d Change Healthcare\u2019s parent firm, UnitedHealth Group, owns a significant portion of the US health care market. The company, which reported $371 billion in revenue last year, handles one in three American patient records,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Hospital Association. Optum, a UnitedHealth subsidiary, employs about 90,000 physicians. \u201cYour revenues are bigger than some countries\u2019 GDP,\u201d Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican,\u00a0told\u00a0UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty in a Senate hearing this month.\u00a0\u201cAnd how in heaven\u2019s name did you not have the necessary redundancies so that you did not experience this attack and find yourself so vulnerable?\u201d The Justice Department has been pursuing an antitrust investigation into UnitedHealth Group, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in February. More broadly, the Justice Department last week\u00a0announced\u00a0a\u00a0task force to examine \u201chealth care monopolies and collusion\u201d that will guide the department\u2019s approach to \u201ccivil and criminal enforcement in health care markets,\u201d where warranted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/tech/damaging-hacks-expose-the-weak-underbelly-of-americas-health-care-system/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_world_sun-magnetic-field-scn", "text": "The sun has a powerful magnetic field that creates sunspots on the star\u2019s surface and unleashes solar storms such as the one that bathed much of the planet in beautiful auroras this month. But exactly how that magnetic field is generated inside the sun is a puzzle that has vexed astronomers for centuries, going back to the time of Italian astronomer Galileo, who made the first observations of sunspots in the early 1600s, and noticed how they varied over time. Researchers behind an interdisciplinary study have put forth a new theory in a report published Wednesday in the journal Nature. In contrast to previous research that assumed the sun\u2019s magnetic field originates from deep within the celestial body, they suspect the the source is much closer to the surface. The model developed by the team could help scientists better understand the 11-year solar cycle and improve the forecasting of space weather, which can disrupt GPS and communication satellites as well as dazzle night sky watchers with auroras. \u201cThis work proposes a new hypothesis for how the sun\u2019s magnetic field is generated that better matches solar observations, and, we hope, could be used to make better predictions of solar activity,\u201d said Daniel Lecoanet, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at Northwestern University\u2019s McCormick School of Engineering and a member of the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics. \u201cWe want to forecast if the next solar cycle will be particularly strong, or maybe weaker than normal. The previous models (assuming the solar magnetic field is generated deep within the Sun) have not been able to make accurate forecasts or (determine) if\u00a0the next solar cycle will be strong or weak,\u201d he added. Sunspots help scientists track the sun\u2019s activity. They are the origin point for the explosive flares and ejection events that release light, solar material and energy into space. The recent solar storm is evidence of the sun approaching \u201csolar maximum\u201d \u2014 the point in its 11-year cycle when there is the highest number of sunspots. \u201cBecause we think the number of sunspots tracks with the strength of the magnetic field within the Sun, we think the 11-year sunspot cycle is reflecting a cycle in the strength of the Sun\u2019s interior magnetic field,\u201d Lecoanet said. Modeling the sun\u2019s magnetic field It\u2019s difficult to see the sun\u2019s magnetic field lines, which loop through the solar atmosphere to form a complicated web of magnetic structures far more complex than Earth\u2019s magnetic field. To better grasp how the sun\u2019s magnetic field works, scientists turn to mathematical models. In a scientific first, the model that Lecoanet and his colleagues developed accounted for a phenomenon called torsional oscillation \u2014 magnetically driven flows of gas and plasma within and around the sun that contribute to sunspot formation. In some areas, the rotation of this solar feature speeds up or slows down, while in others it remains steady. Like the 11-year solar magnetic cycle, torsional oscillations also experience an 11-year cycle. \u201cSolar observations have given us a good idea for how material moves around inside of the Sun. For our supercomputing calculations, we solved equations to determine how the magnetic field changes within the Sun due to the observed motions,\u201d Lecoanet said. \u201cNo one had done this calculation before because no one knew how to efficiently perform the calculation,\u201d he added. The group\u2019s calculations showed that magnetic fields can be generated about 20,000 miles (32,100 kilometers) below the sun\u2019s surface \u2014 far closer to the surface than had previously been assumed. Other models had suggested it was much deeper \u2014 around 130,000 miles (209,200 kilometers). \u201cOur new hypothesis provides a natural explanation for the torsional oscillations that is missing from previous models,\u201d Lecoanet said. \u2018Astrophysical enigma\u2019 An important breakthrough was developing new numerical algorithms for running the calculations, Lecoanet said. The paper\u2019s lead author Geoff Vasil, a professor at the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, came up with the idea about 20 years ago, Lecoanet said, but it took over 10 years to develop the algorithms and required a powerful NASA supercomputer to conduct the simulations. \u201cWe have used around 15 million CPU-hours for this investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means that if I had tried to run the calculations on my laptop, it would have taken me about 450 years.\u201d In a commentary published alongside the study, Ellen Zweibel, a professor of astronomy and physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the initial results were intriguing and would help inform future models and research. She was not involved in the study. Zweibel said the team had added \u201ca provocative ingredient to the theoretical mix that could prove key to unravelling this astrophysical enigma.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/world/sun-magnetic-field-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_india_indian-teen-allegedly-kills-two-while-drunk-driving-as-punishment-he-was-told-to-write-an-essay", "text": "Anger is growing in India after a teenager who allegedly killed two people while drunk driving was ordered to write an essay as punishment, with many demanding a harsher penalty and accusing the judiciary of leniency. The 17-year-old boy was allegedly speeding in a Porsche in the city of Pune\u00a0on Sunday when the vehicle hit a motorcycle, killing two people, according to Maharashtra state\u2019s deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The minor was taken into custody and later presented to the Juvenile Justice Board, where he was released on bail and given 15 days of community service. He was also asked to write an essay about road safety, Fadnavis said. \u201cThe outrage grew after this. According to police, the boy is 17 years and 8 months. This is a heinous crime,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday, pointing to the 2015 changes to India\u2019s juvenile laws, which allow children above 16 to be tried as adults if they allegedly commit a \u201cheinous\u201d crime. \u201cThis was a surprising order passed (by the Juvenile Justice Board),\u201d Fadnavis said. CNN has attempted to contact the alleged driver\u2019s lawyer, Prashant Patil, for comment. Fadnavis added that Pune police are investigating the minor for alleged culpable homicide not amounting to murder. They have also asked the Juvenile Court to review its bail order, he said. CCTV video, purportedly filmed moments before the crash, shows a white Porsche speeding down a busy main road. People can be seen rushing to the scene of the crash, which is not pictured in the video that was shared widely on social media and broadcast on local news channels. The minor\u2019s father has been arrested for allegedly allowing his son to drive despite being underage, according to Pune Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar. The legal driving age in India is 18. Three people who served the minor liquor have also been arrested, Kumar added. \u201cWe have adopted the most stringent possible approach, and we shall do whatever is at our command to ensure that the two young lives that were lost get justice, and the accused gets duly punished,\u201d he said. The incident has dominated headlines in India and sparked widespread anger, with many taking to social media to condemn the boy\u2019s bail conditions. Suresh Koshta, whose 24-year-old daughter was killed in the crash, urged authorities to take tougher action against the alleged driver. \u201cIt was wrong (to allow the minor to drive),\u201d he told reporters outside his home, while fighting back tears. \u201cOne needs to know how to drive first.\u201d Rahul Gandhi, the leader of India\u2019s main opposition, the Indian National Congress, questioned whether a bus or taxi driver would be given the same punishment. \u201cIf a 16-17-year-old son of a wealthy household, driving a Porsche under the influence, is caught, he is asked to write an essay,\u201d Gandhi said in a video posted to X. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t essays assigned to truck drivers or bus drivers?\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time a court\u2019s verdict has been scrutinized in this manner. In 2015, Bollywood superstar\u00a0Salman Khan, who was facing a lengthy prison sentence for a fatal hit-and-run, got a reprieve when the Bombay High Court tossed out his conviction for lack of evidence, causing widespread outrage. \u201cOn basis of evidences produced by the prosecution, the appellant cannot be convicted, no matter how differently the common man thinks,\u201d the court said. The hit-and-run incident took place outside a Mumbai bakery in September 2002, with prosecutors saying Khan ran over five sleeping men after losing control of his vehicle. He was returning from a bar after a night of drinking, they said. The actor said he wasn\u2019t the driver.

A male suspect entered the building early Friday morning and threw what appeared to be a Molotov cocktail, the local mayor said. The man climbed on top of a trash bin and got to the second floor of the synagogue,\u00a0then threw the projectile into the building causing a fire, Rouen mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol told journalists at the scene. \u201cHe was [quickly] brought down by security forces before trying to wrestle with them. He then tried to assault security forces with a knife, a long knife,\u201d the mayor said, adding it was then when security forces opened fired and killed the suspect. No one was hurt during the attempted attack, according to Mayer-Rossignol. Police arrived very quickly, partially because they saw the suspect on security cameras, he said.

{"id": "2024_05_17_tech_ai-high-school", "text": "At Princeton High School, students are trying to combat the rapid decline of indigenous languages with some unlikely help: a furry, wide-eyed stuffed animal named Che\u2019w. But Che\u2019w isn\u2019t a standard plush toy. He\u2019s a wildly intelligent generative AI robot that speaks Mam, a Mayan language spoken in the western highlands of Guatemala and Mexico and by a small population of the school\u2019s students.\u00a0The language is currently at risk of extinction, according to UNESCO; the students hope Che\u2019w can help change that. At a time when some high schools are restricting the use of AI in the classroom, others, like Princeton High School, are leaning into it. In the short 18 months since the launch of viral chatbot ChatGPT, generative AI has emerged as a revolutionary technology in the field of artificial intelligence. Its capabilities have impressed both users and experts with its ability to perform a range of tasks, from generating creative content, essays and games to conducting mathematical equations, summarizing complicated concepts and more. All that is already reshaping various parts of our lives, including education. But the technology has leaped ahead far faster, in many cases, than schools\u2019 understanding of how to use it. And with new products out this week from Google\u2019s XYZ initiative and OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4o, many teachers and districts realize they cannot avoid the subject. Dr. Joy Barnes-Johnson, the science administrator for PHS, said the school is \u201ctrying to embrace AI\u201d as much as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a tool, just like a pencil is technology that helps communication.\u201d She said the school will host an AI summit this summer with its teachers and administrators to have a conversation about how generative AI should or shouldn\u2019t be used in the classroom. \u201cIn the beginning of the school year, we talked about how AI is the world we\u2019re in now and we have a responsibility to prepare kids for the world they will inherit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea is that it will help people connect and learn, so we [as teachers] have to not be afraid of it.\u201d Proceeding with caution When ChatGPT launched in November 2022, teachers worried that the tool, which can generate convincing responses and essays in response to user prompts, could make it easier for students to cheat on assignments. Some also worried ChatGPT and similar tools could be used to spread inaccurate information. Not long after its launch, New York City public schools became one of the first school districts to ban students and teachers from using ChatGPT on the district\u2019s networks and devices. Other schools reacted similarly in the weeks and months that followed, including the Los Angeles Unified School District and Seattle Public Schools, which blocked access to ChatGPT on their networks. Some of these districts have evolved their policies over time. The LAUSD, for example, has since launched a chatbot named \u201cEd\u201d to act as a student advisor, with the ability to inform parents about information ranging from children\u2019s test results to their school attendance. Many schools also continue to grapple with how to best approach the technology inside the classroom. \u201cThere is acceptance by educators, but we\u2019re still seeing a lot of caution,\u201d said Noel Candelaria, the secretary-treasurer of the National Education Association who is leading the charge around the union\u2019s AI policy. \u201cThe challenge is there isn\u2019t a lot of guidance on the district level, so the concern educators have is that it\u2019s being something done to them, instead of with them.\u201d He added: \u201cThere are also major concerns around data confidentiality and where data is being pulled from.\u201d Candelaria told CNN that educators feel strongly that they want their voice to influence how it can be applied to schools. The NEA is developing a task force with educators across the country to address many of these issues. Beyond generative AI Some high schools around the country are\u00a0trying to teach students how to use other forms of artificial intelligence for a greater good. At one prestigious public school in New York City, Stuyvesant High School, students created an app for the blind that uses artificial intelligence and tactile feedback to help people detect threats and navigate obstacles.  Similarly, at STEM School Highlands Ranch in Colorado, a team of students developed an AI-powered\u00a0wildlife detection system called Project Deer to help cut down on car crashes. Although researchers have tried to combat such accidents before, studies have shown wildlife don\u2019t consistently react to any one stimulus. So the students instead derived an AI-based predictive solution to alert the driver to an imminent threat on the road. Using four $5 infrared detection sensors placed on vehicles, the students developed a system for\u00a0AI to scan the surroundings and emit a high-pitched sound when an animal\u2019s body heat is detected, a signal that may help to scare the animal away. The school, which was the\u00a0Colorado State Winner in Samsung\u2019s annual Solve for Tomorrow competition, said it is partnering with the University of Colorado in Boulder this summer to help boost its success rate. The Solve for Tomorrow contest featured more than 1,000 schools submitting STEM-based solutions to real-world problems. Samsung told CNN there was a \u201cdefinite uptick in\u201d submitted AI-powered innovations this year compared to previous years. Computer science teacher Tylor Chacon told CNN the group\u2019s big vision is to one day have the technology regulated or adopted by the state for greater use. School administration has told teachers to help create rubrics or lesson plans, Chacon told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019ve been encouraged to embrace it and look into ways we can use it to maximize our own job effectiveness and ease the burden on us,\u201d he said. It\u2019s an increasingly common trend among teachers to use AI tools to create assignments, quizzes, polls, videos and interactives for classroom use. Some are even turning to AI tools and platforms \u2014 such as ChatGPT, Writable, Grammarly and EssayGrader \u2014 to assist with grading papers or writing feedback, a practice that is also raising ethical considerations. Saving a language, learning the future Still, as schools continue to weigh the benefits or disadvantages to teaching and using artificial intelligence, some teachers and administrators feel strongly that it\u2019s the future. At Princeton High, a group of about 14 students met during school hours for months to build out Che\u2019w\u2019s conversational capabilities, drawn from artificial intelligence neural networks that are trained to recognize patterns, solve problems and understand words, sentences and phrases from spoken and written language. Che\u2019w, which translates to \u201cstar\u201d in Mam, was trained to understand the language by the students so it can serve as a personal tutor. The robot is also trained to speak Spanish and English. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t lose patience or get sick of talking to them,\u201d said Mark Eastburn, Princeton High School\u2019s science, research and engineering teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s taking [AI] off the screen and putting it onto a physical structure that looks like a friend that can help you do whatever you need to do.\u201d In April, the students were one of the top three National Winners at the Samsung Solve For Tomorrow\u2019s competition. AI is now a part of students\u2019 lives, Eastburn said. \u201cAnd it will be there when they\u2019re in college and also in their careers,\u201d he added, \u201cso they might as well learn and use it in appropriate ways in high school, if not even earlier.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/17/tech/ai-high-school/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

It\u2019s the first indication some top brass at the Louisville Metro Police Department believe the charges against Scheffler should be reduced. The 27-year-old golfer was attempting to drive to the PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club at about 6 a.m. on May 17 when he came to the scene of a fatal crash. He injured a police officer who was directing traffic and was then detained and arrested, according to police. Scheffler was charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer, along with lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, according to Jefferson County court records. He was released from jail and returned to the golf course for his tee time in the second round of the major tournament. In a statement last week, Scheffler said he proceeded as directed and \u201cthere was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do.\u201d Scheffler\u2019s attorney, Steven Romines, told CNN in a statement Friday he plans to plead not guilty to the charges. During a recent meeting, multiple Louisville police officials discussed the charges against Scheffler,\u00a0and the group\u00a0agreed\u00a0that the felony charge seems excessive given the details of the case, according to the source with firsthand knowledge of the meeting. It is unclear whether they have discussed those opinions with the county attorney prosecuting the case\u00a0and how that may ultimately affect the charging decision. \u201cAs we have stated previously, no decisions have been made regarding the prosecution of the case involving Mr. Scheffler,\u201d said Josh Abner, a spokesperson for the Jefferson County Attorney\u2019s office. \u201cWe continue to gather information and will review and proceed accordingly.\u201d Police to hold Thursday news conference Louisville police will hold a news conference Thursday to address the case and are expected to release additional video of the arrest from a traffic pole camera. It is unclear if the initial encounter between Scheffler and the detective was captured on video. Police will investigate whether Det. Bryan Gillis, whose body camera was not turned on, followed department protocols during the incident, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cI think that\u2019s critically important that we do that, not just in high profile events like took place on Friday, but on a regular basis,\u201d Greenberg added. \u201cAnd if policies are not being followed, there will be transparency about that. There will be action taken.\u201d O\u2019Connell\u2019s office is facing growing pressure from other local officials to reassess the charges against Scheffler. Louisville Councilmember Anthony Piagentini, who represents the district where Scheffler was arrested, told CNN he believes the case is being overcharged. \u201cI think the charges should either be dropped entirely or at least be dropped down to a very, very tiny misdemeanor,\u201d Piagentini said. \u201cI don\u2019t know every piece of evidence, but I know enough to say the officer was trying to do his job, Mr. Scheffler was trying to do his job, and an unfortunate circumstance happened.\u201d Piagentini said he found it strange O\u2019Connell showed up to court Monday to argue against delaying the arraignment, which Romines requested because of a scheduling issue the attorney was facing. \u201cThat\u2019s such a minor procedural detail,\u201d Piagentini said, adding that O\u2019Connell typically would have a different member of his team argue such a motion in court. \u201cHis actions have indicated he\u2019s treating this case differently, and he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d CNN also has reached out to the Louisville Metro Police Department for comment. Scheffler is scheduled to play Thursday in the Charles Schwab Challenge, in Fort Worth, Texas. He has a 1:45 p.m. ET tee time.

{"id": "2024_05_18_weather_houston-storms-power-severe-weather-south", "text": "As officials assess the damage from destructive storms in the Houston area that killed at least seven people and knocked out power amid rising temperatures, residents in the Southeast and Gulf Coast face a severe weather threat through Saturday that could bring another round of excessive rainfall and severe thunderstorms. A complex of storms with winds up to 100 mph and a tornado left a trail of destruction Thursday across the Houston area that damaged multiple skyscrapers, caused a sewage spill and triggered power outages that could stretch on for weeks amid soaring temperatures. At least four people died from the storm in Houston, including two killed by fallen trees and a third who died in a crane accident, Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said Thursday. Another three storm deaths were reported in Harris County on Friday evening. One man collapsed while trying to move a downed electrical pole, and a woman died after lightning struck the trailer she was inside and sparked a fire, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a post on X. Gonzalez said another victim who had lost power reportedly went out to his truck to plug in his oxygen tank and was found unresponsive Friday morning. \u201cHeartbreaking! My condolences go out to the families that lost a loved one during yesterday\u2019s severe weather event,\u201d Gonzalez said. The damaging storms will be followed by high temperatures in the 90s through the weekend and beyond while many are without air conditioning. Over 366,000 customers in Harris County remain without power Saturday evening following the line of storms, down from a peak of more than 900,000, according to PowerOutage.us. Authorities have warned that restoring power to all customers will be a lengthy process. CenterPoint Energy \u2013 the primary electrical provider in the area \u2013 said the storm system caused \u201cextensive damage to the company\u2019s transmission and distribution electric systems.\u201d Thousands of workers are being deployed to help with restoration efforts, the company said. More than 376,000\u00a0of its customers have been affected and power was restored to more than 259,000\u00a0customers in the last 24 hours as of Saturday night, the company said on its website. \u201cCenterPoint Energy is working to have restorations substantially complete to customers who are available to receive service by end of day Wednesday,\u201d CenterPoint Energy said. \u201cHardest hit areas of our territory include: Bellaire, Cypress, Baytown, Greenspoint, Humble and Spring Branch.\u201d The rainfall, combined with high winds and power outages, also resulted in the spillage of more than 100,000 gallons of domestic wastewater, otherwise known as sanitary sewage. The spillage occurred in three separate locations across the city, but Houston Public Works assured residents that drinking water from the City of Houston remains safe. With burgeoning heat, the City of Houston opened cooling centers for residents on Friday, officials said in a news release. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could hit triple-digits by next week, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. \u201cThe weather pattern is shifting into a hot and dry pattern starting on Saturday, so it is going to be important to have a way to stay cool,\u201d the National Weather Service warned on Friday. Houston Mayor John Whitmire, who signed a local state of disaster declaration for the city on Friday, toured the downtown area and said the \u201cdevastation is significant.\u201d \u201cWe urge everyone to stay away from the area for your safety and to allow public works personnel to do their vital jobs,\u201d Whitmire said. The weather service classified the line of severe storms that moved through Texas and Louisiana Thursday as a derecho, a potentially destructive weather event characterized by widespread wind damage associated with a long-lived line of thunderstorms. Derechos have consistent wind gusts of 58 mph or greater along a path of at least 400 miles, along with several well-separated wind gusts of greater than 75 mph. The determination was made based on the path\u2019s length and intensity. More flash floods and damaging wind gusts possible Saturday Excessive rainfall and severe thunderstorm chances will persist across parts of the Southeast through Saturday, the National Weather Service said. From the Southeast to the north-central Gulf of Mexico, newly developing thunderstorms will bring the potential for more flash flooding and damaging wind gusts on Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. A slight level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms has been issued across parts of the Southeast into the Carolinas on Saturday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cIsolated to scattered severe thunderstorms appear possible across portions of the Southeast and Carolinas on Saturday, and parts of the Upper Midwest,\u201d the center said. \u201cDamaging winds should be the main threat, but occasional severe hail and a tornado or two may also occur.\u201d A slight level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall has also been issued for part of the northern Gulf Coast Saturday due to the threat of flash, urban and riverine flooding, the weather service said. Heavy rain is also forecast to continue into Saturday across the Mid-Atlantic and central Appalachians, where scattered instances of flash flooding could occur. On Sunday, thunderstorms are expected to form over the central High Plains and spread east in the evening. The greatest chances for severe weather are across parts of Nebraska and Kansas, with a slight level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms issued by the Storm Prediction Center. \u201cLarge hail and damaging gusts will be the main hazards, though a tornado or two also will be possible,\u201d the center said. By the end of the weekend, thunderstorm chances will diminish for most of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, the weather service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/18/weather/houston-storms-power-severe-weather-south/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_europe_ukraine-russia-lyptsi-kharkiv-intl", "text": "There are some towns that\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0can just never afford to lose, and Lyptsi is one of them. But the grip\u00a0the\u00a0nation\u00a0keeps is tenuous:\u00a0The streets are aflame from an airstrike moments earlier when we race in, under\u00a0the\u00a0cover of darkness. Night affords them the only\u00a0respite\u00a0from drone assault; the hours before we arrive have seen the town hit eight\u00a0times. Yet the soldiers of the 13th Khartiia National Guard have to endure, as the stakes here are huge. Russia\u2019s relentless onslaught has a key goal:\u00a0If they take Lyptsi, then they can position artillery within range of Ukraine\u2019s second city, Kharkiv, 20 minutes down the road. Down in a bunker, Oleksandr, a commander, looks at one of his many drone feeds. \u201cYou saw yourself how everything is burning. It is like that every night.\u201d His men were among the first to tackle Russia\u2019s new advance into Kharkiv region nearly two weeks ago. He says they are fighting trained professional\u00a0soldiers. \u201cWe can see it from their equipment and tactics,\u201d\u00a0he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not sending just anyone into the assaults.\u201d His stare lengthens when asked about what fortifications were in place before the surprise Russian attack. \u201cNothing was prepared here. Nothing. Just nothing. All the positions are being built by the hands of infantry.\u201d Outside, the night is shaken by more blasts. \u201cThree weeks ago the civilians were living a peaceful life here. Rebuilding, everything was\u00a0all right,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now most of the houses are ruined.\u201d As we leave, a loud drone buzzes overhead, close by. Our escort does not flinch or run. I ask if the drone is friendly. \u201cHow the f*** should I know?\u201d\u00a0he replies, tugging on a cigarette. All around the city of Kharkiv, home to an estimated million civilians, Ukrainian forces are trying to hold back a persistent Russian assault from multiple angles. Over a week reporting in the villages around the city, CNN saw Ukrainian units holding their positions at great peril and risk, and sometimes using aged and scant artillery to fend off a much better equipped Russian force, able to thwart their most basic\u00a0maneuvers\u00a0with huge numbers of drones. At one position closer to the Russian border, the 92nd Assault Brigade showed CNN a Russian artillery gun, captured in the first days of the war, from which they are now firing French mortar shells. The gun was partially hidden by a wire net, aimed\u00a0at providing\u00a0some protection from an attack drone. Yet above, an\u00a0unidentified scout drone began to hover, forcing the unit to run into a bunker. Another unit\u00a0is\u00a0forced to use a Soviet artillery gun made in the 1940s. Hidden in dense foliage, its metal is rusty in parts, limiting how often it can be fired. Artun, their commander, uses newer Polish shells, but now only fires 10\u00a0a day, when in the autumn it was\u00a0100. Drones are \u201ca big problem,\u201d\u00a0Artun\u00a0says. \u201cI have shrapnel in me as a keepsake,\u201d he adds, referring to the remnants of a Russian Lancet drone still in his hand and stomach, which\u00a0the surgeons could not remove. \u201cBut there are certain actions that can save you from drones.\u201d One of them springs into life: an alert from a $30 frequency scanner on his webbing. It has picked up the approach of another Orlan drone, sending Artun into the bunker. He looks out into the sky above, and sees it pass overhead. He commands a diverse unit, epitomizing the manpower challenges Ukraine is facing in its third year of war. Some, like him, are wounded infantrymen, put on the guns further back from the front. Others are older,\u00a0while\u00a0one of his team is on his first day in artillery. For nearly two years,\u00a0Kharkiv\u00a0thought the threat from its neighbour had passed. A lightning Russian retreat in late 2022 left Kharkiv region peaceful and the launchpad for Ukrainian attacks across the border into Russia proper. Attacks persisted\u00a0in the distance\u00a0however,\u00a0keeping the city\u2019s residents awake through violently loud nights, now amplified by the threat of Russian artillery edging closer. Flares, anti-aircraft fire,\u00a0and blasts regularly punctuate the enforced blackout, as Russian drones, rockets and airstrikes hit targets in the dark. On Wednesday, city officials reported an attack on a gas station, which left four people in hospital.\u00a0On Sunday, two missiles struck a lakeside resort in Cherkaska Lozova, outside the city\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a horrifying attack on a civilian target which also used a \u201cdouble-tap\u201d tactic, in which a second missile hit 10\u00a0minutes after the first, injuring first responders. A few hours after\u00a0Sunday\u2019s\u00a0blasts, rescue workers clambered over the ruins of a waterside terrace,\u00a0retrieving\u00a0two bodies from the seven who died in the attack. One was a woman,\u00a0seven\u00a0months pregnant. Another was only found later, their body fragments in the wreckage. As police combed the eviscerated terrace on the lake for evidence, another air alert sounded, causing half the workers to flee for cover, and some to carry on, almost oblivious.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/europe/ukraine-russia-lyptsi-kharkiv-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_middleeast_ebrahim-raisi-dies-succession-what-is-next-explainer-mime-intl", "text": "Once seen as a likely successor to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, President Ebrahim Raisi has died in office, leaving the Islamic Republic\u2019s hardline establishment facing an uncertain future. An ultraconservative president, 63-year-old Raisi was killed Sunday, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other high-ranking officials, in a helicopter crash in Iran\u2019s remote northwest. Their death comes at a delicate time for a country that faces unprecedented challenges at home and from abroad. The Islamic Republic\u2019s economy remains crippled by American sanctions, its young population is becoming growingly restive, and the country faces increasingly belligerent adversaries in the Middle East and beyond. Raisi\u2019s death will \u201ctrigger elections at a time when the IRI (Islamic Republic of Iran) is at the nadir of its legitimacy and zenith of its exclusionary policies,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at the International Crisis Group think tank, said on X. Here\u2019s what comes next. Who steps in as president? Power has now been transferred to Mohammad Mokhber, who had served as Raisi\u2019s vice president and was on Monday approved as acting president by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the final arbiter of domestic and foreign affairs in the Islamic Republic. Not as well known as Raisi, Mokhber is \u201canother administrator,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson. \u201cHe is close to the IRGC, close to the levers of power,\u201d Vakil said, adding that he is likely to present a model of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in the coming days. But the country must, by law, hold elections within the next 50 days. On Monday, Iranian state news IRNA said Iran\u2019s presidential\u00a0elections will take place Friday, June 28. Candidates can register from May 30 to June 3, and campaigning will run from June 12 until the morning of June 27, it added. Experts say that the elections are likely to be hastily organized, with poor voter participation. In March, Iran recorded its lowest electoral turnout since the Islamic Republic\u2019s founding in 1979, despite government efforts to rally voters ahead of the ballot. That vote \u2014 for seats in the parliament, or Majles, and the 88-member Assembly of Experts, which is tasked with picking the Supreme Leader \u2014 brought in mostly hardline politicians. \u201cThe population has by and large lost faith in the idea that change can come through the ballot box,\u201d Trita Parsi, co-founder and Executive Vice President of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in Washington, DC, wrote Sunday on X. The March election also barred more moderate politicians from running \u2014 including former President Hassan Rouhani, once a regime stalwart \u2014 tightening the small circle of hardliners to continue the Supreme Leader\u2019s conservative rule after he dies. \u201cReal alternatives to Iran\u2019s hardliners have simply not been allowed to stand for office in the last few elections,\u201d Parsi said on X, adding that \u201cthose alternatives have in the eyes of the majority of the population lost credibility anyways, due to the failure to deliver change.\u201d Until the Supreme Leader is replaced, however, little change is expected to follow Raisi\u2019s death, particularly on foreign policy. \u201cIt is really the Supreme Leader and the Revolutionary Guards who make the final decisions, and even in the region mostly implement Iran\u2019s regional policy,\u201d Vaez said, adding that \u201coverall we will see more continuity than change.\u201d What are the longer-term implications of Raisi\u2019s death? Raisi\u2019s death has raised questions about who will eventually succeed Iran\u2019s 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the most powerful man in the country. The Iranian clerical establishment had invested heavily in Raisi during his presidency, seeing him as a potential successor to Khamenei. Observers say he had been groomed to be elevated to the Supreme Leader\u2019s position. Raisi\u2019s death will create \u201ca succession crisis in Iran,\u201d Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on X. The late president upheld some of the regime\u2019s most hardline policies, quashing the 2022 mass protests that sought to challenge repressive laws, such as the compulsory hijab. According to the constitution, the 88-member Assembly of Experts picks the successor to the Supreme Leader after his death. Members of the Assembly itself are, however, pre-vetted by Iran\u2019s Guardian Council, a powerful 12-member body charged with overseeing elections and legislation. The Assembly of Experts has become increasingly hardline over the years. In the March vote, Raisi was re-elected to the assembly, and the Guardian Council barred Rouhani from contesting a seat. While there are procedures to selecting the Supreme Leader, discussions about successions are always \u201cvery opaque,\u201d Vakil said, adding that they take place \u201cwithin a very close circle of individuals.\u201d Some have pointed to the incumbent Supreme Leader\u2019s son Mojtaba Khamenei, a midlevel cleric, as a potential contender for the top post, but that would be a shift from the principles of the Islamic Republic, which overthrew a repressive monarchy in 1970 and has prided itself for shaking off hereditary rule. Allowing Mojtaba to replace his father may, however, spur theories that Raisi\u2019s death was not accidental, Sadjadpour said. Raisi\u2019s rivals are also likely to try to fill the vacuum he leaves, Vaez said. \u201c(This) definitely throws all the plans that offices of the Supreme Leader probably had out the window,\u201d Vaez told CNN\u2019s Paula Newton. He added, however, that Iran has no shortage of political actors who are \u201csubservient and belong to the old guard of the Islamic Republic\u201d who can replace Raisi. How will it impact Iran\u2019s foreign relations? Raisi and Amir-Abdollahian oversaw a turnaround in Iran\u2019s relations with its Arab neighbors, helping normalized relations with longtime foe Saudi Arabia,\u00a0with China\u2019s assistance. But they also saw the Islamic Republic initiate a large-scale direct attack on Israel for the first time,\u00a0after a suspected Israeli attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria. That prompted Israel to launch an unprecedented retaliation, bringing the shadow war between the two nations out into the open. Experts say that Raisi\u2019s death is unlikely to have an impact on the regime\u2019s foreign policy, which is almost exclusively the domain of the Supreme Leader. Iran\u2019s foreign policy is decided by the Supreme National Security Council and can be vetoed by the Supreme Leader, Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran expert and editor of the Amwaj.media news outlet, told CNN\u2019s Anderson. \u201cWe will see continuity in terms of how Iran approaches the regional files, collaboration with regional allies.\u201d He added that a similar trajectory is likely to be seen on the nuclear program. Could the upcoming presidential election bring change to Iran? Some experts say that the election presents an opportunity for the regime to bring back sidelined moderates. While Khamenei is likely to maintain conservative rule, he \u201chas always emphasized voter turnout as a litmus test of the legitimacy of the system,\u201d Shabani said. \u201cThat election can be a watershed moment for Iran.\u201d Raisi came to power in elections that many Iranians saw as a foregone conclusion. With moderate candidates squeezed out, voter turnout was extremely low,\u00a0highlighting the regime\u2019s waning legitimacy. \u201cIf the Supreme Leader chooses to use these early elections as a watershed moment to open up the political space, to get people to vote again, that could be a massive gamechanger,\u201d Shabani said, adding that this would also impact succession to the Supreme Leader. What are the funeral plans? Multi-day funeral ceremonies for Raisi will begin on Tuesday in Tabriz and continue in Qom, Tehran and Mashhad, according to Mohsen Mansouri, the head of the funeral planning committee and and Iran\u2019s vice president of executive affairs. Speaking to\u00a0state television\u00a0on Monday, Mansouri said funeral prayers will begin in the northwestern city of Tabriz at 9:30 a.m. local time on Tuesday. There will be a procession from the Tabriz Martyr\u2019s Square to the Tabriz Mosallah (prayer hall). Later on Tuesday, the bodies of the victims of the helicopter crash will be transferred to the holy Shiite city of Qom, where funeral prayers will take place at 4:30 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) outside the Fatima Masumeh Shrine. Afterwards, on Tuesday evening, the bodies will be transferred to Tehran\u2019s Grand Mosallah Mosque, according to Mansouri. On Wednesday, large ceremonies are planned in Tehran at the Grand Mosallah. One or two other ceremonies will be announced later, according to Mansouri. On Thursday morning, funeral prayers will begin in Birjand, South Khorasan province, where Raisi served as the Supreme Leader\u2019s representative. Later on Thursday, Raisi\u2019s body will be transferred to the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad where Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will conduct prayers over Raisi\u2019s body, according to Mehr news. On Thursday night, Raisi\u2019s body will be buried in Mashhad, according to Mansouri. Mansouri also announced the closure of offices on Wednesday all over the country, and said the governors in the provinces where processions will take place can declare public holidays on Wednesday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/middleeast/ebrahim-raisi-dies-succession-what-is-next-explainer-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

Alex Dinkla told CNN. \u201cSadly, we can confirm that there have been fatalities with this tornado,\u201d Dinkla said during a news conference later Tuesday evening. He did not provide additional details on the deaths. Residents have also been injured, Dinkla said, and a local hospital also sustained tornado damage. Patients were transported for their injuries to nearby hospitals, the sergeant said. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows the destructive path of the tornado that ripped through Greenfield. Decimated homes and flattened structures, piles of debris, damaged cars and countless toppled trees can be seen in the footage. \u201cThere is basically nothing left,\u201d Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cIt went right through Greenfield.\u201d Another storm-related death occurred in Adams County, Iowa, about 90 miles southwest of Des Moines, the county medical examiner Lisa Brown told CNN. Brown was unable to give additional details on the death, but said it was due to a tornado. The potent line of thunderstorms that developed Tuesday afternoon prompted a rare \u201cpotentially dangerous situation\u201d tornado watch for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois from the Storm Prediction Center. The special kind of tornado watch is only issued when there\u2019s unusually high confidence in the potential of multiple long-lived and EF2 or stronger tornadoes. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds authorized a proclamation of disaster emergency for 15 counties due to the storm outbreak, saying it will allow state resources \u201cto respond to and recover from the effects of the severe weather,\u201d in a news release. Reynolds also announced she will visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning to assess damage from the severe weather, saying in a statement: \u201cI\u00a0am committed to providing the full resources of the state to support the\u00a0response and recovery effort.\u201d Over 30,000 customers were out of power in Iowa as of 10:30 p.m Tuesday, according to Poweroutage.us. Tornadoes are one of the many serious hazards expected with Tuesday\u2019s severe thunderstorm outbreak, according to the SPC. Destructive, hurricane-strength wind gusts up to 90 mph and softball-size hail are also likely. More than 25 million people across the region are under a Level 3 of 5 or Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms Tuesday, the SPC said. The biggest area of concern for widespread, hazardous impacts centers on much of Iowa, northwest Illinois, southwest Wisconsin and northern Missouri. Chicago, Milwaukee and other population centers are also at risk of damaging storms. The Des Moines International Airport temporarily closed late Tuesday afternoon as dangerous storms headed into Des Moines, prompting\u00a0tornado warnings. The city remains in the bull\u2019s-eye of the strongest storms and potential tornadoes. \u201cTwo tornado warnings for the Des Moines metro with both warnings having observed tornadoes. Seek shelter,\u201d the National Weather Service office there said at 4:45 p.m. local time. Emergency management officials in Montgomery County, Iowa, confirmed \u201cmultiple tornadoes\u201d occurred within the county Tuesday afternoon, and no injuries have been reported thus far. Officials are currently working on clearing roads to access affected properties. \u201cDamage assessments will be ongoing this evening and tomorrow,\u201d the agency said. Flash flooding triggered by heavy rainfall also poses a threat for parts of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Nebraska, where flood and tornado watches are in effect Tuesday afternoon. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are possible with some places eyeing totals of up to 5 inches. Storms are expected to reach their peak strength in the Midwest through the afternoon and carry into Tuesday night. Powerful storms pushed through parts of the Midwest Tuesday morning and unloaded damaging hurricane-force winds and flooding rainfall. Parts of Omaha were plunged underwater Tuesday morning as 3 to 6 inches of rain deluged eastern Nebraska. Multiple water rescues unfolded in the city, the Omaha Fire Department said on X. Additional severe thunderstorms are expected to develop on Wednesday in a 1,500 mile stretch from Texas to western New York. Any storm could unload damaging winds and hail. A few tornadoes are also possible on Wednesday, mainly from Texas to Kentucky. Rounds of severe storms have been making their way across the US over the past week, including a devastating storm that struck Houston on Thursday, leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without power amid unseasonable heat. Dangerous heat in Houston amid power outages High temperatures in Houston will push into the 90s each afternoon for much of the week as a large number of residents remain without power due to destructive storms on Thursday. Severe storms unleashed a tornado and 100 mph winds last week on Harris County, which includes Houston, and sent sheets of rain and large debris whipping through the air as people took cover inside cars, grocery stores and hotel lobbies. The violent conditions killed at least eight people, ripped out skyscraper windows, downed critical power infrastructure, caused a sewage spill and made roads impassable. Electricity has yet to be restored for more than 140,000 homes and businesses in Harris County as of Tuesday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. While authorities had previously warned that power restoration could take weeks, the area\u2019s power utility has promised an earlier timeline. Power restoration will be \u201csubstantially complete\u201d in Harris County by Wednesday evening, power provider CenterPoint Energy said in a Monday news release. But heat will take a very concerning turn for anyone that remains without power after midweek. A dangerous heat wave is ramping up over south Texas this week and will reach the central Gulf Coast by the weekend. Some daily high temperature records could be broken. The worst heat is expected to begin over the weekend in the Houston area. Memorial Day could be the hottest day of the year so far in the city, according to the National Weather Service. \u201cRecord or near-record warm overnight temperatures will provide little to no relief to those without adequate or reliable cooling,\u201d the National Weather Service warns. Heat is the deadliest form of extreme weather and poses a growing threat as human-driven climate change leads to longer and more intense periods of excessive heat. The heat index \u2013 a measurement of how hot the body actually feels \u2013 will climb into the upper 90s in the afternoons and occasionally reach 100 degrees for much of the work week. Heat index values from 105 to 110 degrees are possible over the weekend. Heat relief will finally arrive toward the end of the month.

{"id": "travel_air-turbulence-climate-getting-worse", "text": "Most of us have experienced turbulence while traveling: when your plane flies through clashing bodies of air moving at widely different speeds. Severe turbulence can put even the most seasoned flier on edge and make five minutes seem like an eternity. Usually it results in nothing more than a bumpy ride, but in the worst cases it can cause damage, injury and \u2013 in the case of Singapore Airlines flight SQ321 on May 21 - fatality. In nonfatal accidents, turbulence is the leading cause of injuries to flight attendants and passengers, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, and it\u2019s one of the most common airline accident types today, according to the US National Transportation Safety Board. It costs US airlines \u2013 due to injuries, delays and damages \u2013 up to $500 million per year, according to the National Center for Atmospheric Research. \u201cThere is a scale for measuring how strong turbulence is,\u201d Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading in the UK, told CNN in 2022. \u201cThere\u2019s light turbulence, which is a bit of strain against your seat belt, but food service can continue and you can probably walk around the cabin, maybe with some difficulty. \u201cThen there\u2019s moderate turbulence, a definite strain against seat belts, anything that\u2019s not secured will be dislodged, and walking is difficult; flight attendants are usually instructed to take their seats. \u201cThe worst kind is severe turbulence: This is stronger than gravity, so it can pin you to your seat and if you\u2019re not wearing your seat belt you\u2019ll be tossed around inside the cabin. This is the kind of turbulence that causes serious Injuries \u2013 it\u2019s been known to break bones, for example.\u201d Strikes fast and no visual clues About 65,000 aircraft suffer moderate turbulence every year in the US, and about 5,500 run into severe turbulence. These numbers, however, might be destined to grow. Williams believes that climate change is modifying turbulence, and started studying the subject in 2013. \u201cWe ran some computer simulations and found that severe turbulence could double or triple in the coming decades,\u201d he says. The findings, which were later confirmed by observations, highlight a type of turbulence called \u201cclear air turbulence,\u201d which isn\u2019t connected to any visual clues such as storms or clouds. Unlike regular turbulence, it hits suddenly and is hard to avoid. The Singapore Airlines flight of May 21 was not hit by clear air turbulence, but rapidly developing thunderstorms. According to the NTSB, between 2009 and 2018, the flight crew had no warning in about 28% of turbulence-related accidents. Williams\u2019 analysis predicts that clear-air turbulence will increase significantly around the globe by the period 2050-2080, in particular along the busiest flight routes, and the strongest type of turbulence will increase the most. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that flying will be less safe. \u201cPlanes are not going to start falling out of the sky, because aircraft are built to very high specification and they can withstand the worst turbulence they can ever expect to encounter, even in the future,\u201d says Williams. However, the average duration of turbulence will increase. \u201cTypically, on a transatlantic flight, you might expect 10 minutes of turbulence. I think that in a few decades this may increase to 20 minutes or to half an hour. The seat belt sign will be switched on a lot more, unfortunately for passengers.\u201d The seat belt sign is now switched on Keeping your seat belt fastened at all times while seated is the best way to minimize the risk of injury due to turbulence. Flight attendants, however, are more exposed to that risk than passengers and sustain approximately 80% of all turbulence-related injuries. \u201cWe\u2019re the most likely to get hurt because we\u2019re up working, pushing 300-pound carts, even when there\u2019s some sort of warning,\u201d Sara Nelson, a United flight attendant with more than two decades of experience and the president of the Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 flight attendants across 20 airlines, told CNN in 2022. \u201cWe have flight attendants who have been thrown into the ceiling and then back down several times, resulting in broken limbs. In the aisle, with unannounced turbulence, we had people who lost toes, or lost the ability to work, or sustained injuries that kept them off the job for years,\u201d she adds. The aviation industry is taking the problem very seriously, Nelson says, but the transition to sustainable fuel must accelerate to tackle the climate crisis, and some regulations need to change. For example, the ability for children under the age of two to fly on their parents\u2019 lap. \u201cThat is totally unsafe and our union has been calling for a seat for every person on board,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cNot only can a child be thrown around the cabin, but when they come down they can actually hurt someone else, too. When a child is born, you can\u2019t leave the hospital unless you have a properly installed car seat. The same standards must be applied to flying.\u201d Calls for stringent new rules The NTSB held a public meeting about turbulence in 2021, during which it offered the same recommendation, along with more stringent rules about fastening seat belts for both passengers and flight attendants when the aircraft is flying in the vicinity of thunderstorms and under 20,000 feet, as most injuries occur under these conditions. It also recommended to streamline the systems for collecting and sharing turbulence reports, because that information isn\u2019t traveling widely or promptly enough at the moment. While the effects of climate change on turbulence will take many years to become obvious, Nelson believes some worsening has already occurred. \u201cThis is of course anecdotal, but from Hurricane Katrina forward there seems to have been a pickup in the activity of turbulence, especially turbulence that comes with no warning,\u201d she says. Her worst ever turbulence experience occurred during a flight to Dallas, which was eventually diverted. \u201cWhen anything happens on the plane, the passengers look to us, to see if we look concerned,\u201d she adds. \u201cI was flying with a very good friend of mine and we were strapped in on the jump seats, facing the back of the aircraft \u2013 so there was a lavatory in front of us, instead of passengers. \u201cThank goodness, because we were clutching each other and we were getting thrown around in our seats so violently that it felt like our brains were getting scrambled. It went on for a very long time, but luckily we got safely on the ground,\u201d she says. \u201cTypically I\u2019m not scared of turbulence, because it\u2019s something that we\u2019re taught about in training and we know what to do to protect ourselves. But it is possible to have turbulence so bad and go on for so long that even knowing all of that, my friend and I were praying \u2013 and I have to say I was scared for my life.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/air-turbulence-climate-getting-worse/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_style_bmw-art-car-julie-mehretu", "text": "Over the past 50 years, artists including Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, Jenny Holzer and Robert Rauschenberg have been chosen by the luxury car company to use a BMW as their canvas, each adorning one of the famous BMW Art Cars in their signature style. Ethiopian American artist Julie Mehretu, known for her work in abstract painting, was chosen last year to create the company\u2019s newest \u2018Art Car.\u2019 Her artwork, painted on a BMW M Hybrid V8, was recently unveiled at the Pompidou Center in Paris and will be on the track at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race next month. The BMW M Hybrid V8, a plug-in hybrid, is a track-only racing car created to compete in the international endurance racing circuit. Designed and engineered in collaboration with the Italian race car manufacturer Dallara, it\u2019s low and wide with an enormous rear wing and a large vertical rudder. For the commission, which marks the 20th BMW Art Car, Mehretu chose to adapt one of her most famous works: The painting \u201cEverywhen,\u201d which is now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The painting \u2014 and the car \u2014 are covered in broad washes color cut through with broad black streaks and lines. \u201cIn the studio where I had the model of the BMW M Hybrid V8 I was just sitting in front of the painting and I thought: What would happen if this car seemed to go through that painting and becomes affected by it,\u201d Mehretu said in a statement. \u201cThe idea was to make a remix, a mash-up of the painting. I kept seeing that painting kind of dripping into the car.\u201d The first BMW Art Car was painted in 1975 by the American sculptor Alexander Calder after French racing driver Herv\u00e9 Poulain\u00a0brought the idea to BMW. Poulain drove the Calder-painted BMW 3.0 CSL at Le Mans that year. In 1977, Roy Lichtenstein covered a BMW 320 Group 5 in the graphic stripes and dots he was renowned for; Warhol painted a BMW M1 in 1979 with textured, pastel brushstrokes. The first woman to take on a BMW Art Car was South African artist Esther Mahlangu, who in 1991 painted a 525i sedan. In 1996, Holzer covered a BMW Le Mans race car in the words \u201cProtect Me From What I Want,\u201d among other provocative phrases. Mehretu\u2019s practice frequently draws inspiration from architecture and busy urban settings, featuring intricate juxtapositions of lines and shapes \u2014 inspired by technical drawings and building plans \u2014 and, sometimes, splashes of color or deep darkness. Her work has also addressed themes such as migration, colonialization and globalization. Critics often highlight the sense of humanity apparent in her innovative, abstract works. There\u2019s movement and complex emotion. Mehretu is best known for large-scale pieces, like an eighty-foot-long mural she created for the lobby of the Goldman Sachs building in Manhattan. It\u2019s busy and bright with colored shapes overlaying dark straight lines; the red, yellow, blue and green forms appear to be actively shooting out across the huge wall. Other works, like \u201cMogama (A Painting in 4 Parts),\u201d are grayer and more pensive but retain a soft, rippling sense of motion. She is represented by the Marian Goodman Gallery, which describes her body of work on its website as \u201ca dynamic visual articulation of contemporary experience, a depiction of social behavior and the psychogeography of space.\u201d \u201cMehretu\u2019s practice in painting, drawing and printmaking equally assert the role of art to provoke thought and reflection, and express the contemporary condition of the individual and society,\u201d the gallery added. Mehretu was born in 1970 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to an Ethiopian father and an American mother. Seven years later, the family moved to the United States to escape a brutal civil war then-raging in the country. In 1997, she earned a Masters of Fine Arts from the Rhode Island School of Design; she is currently based in New York. She has received widespread acclaim for her work, and prestigious awards including a MacArthur Fellowship in 2005 and, in 2015, a US Department of State Medal of Arts Award. She was unanimously selected for this project by a jury of prominent gallery and museum directors. Madeleine Grynsztejn, Pritzker Director at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and a member of that jury, described Mehretu as the \u201cperfect artist\u201d to take on the BMW Art Car in a statement released last June announcing her selection. \u201cFor years, Julie has painted speed and for a long time worked very successfully at scale,\u201d Grynsztejn said. \u201cTo merge her work with the shape and form of a speeding vehicle is really an alignment of perfection.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/style/bmw-art-car-julie-mehretu/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_style_tim-hetherington-photography-snap", "text": "At an outpost in Afghanistan\u2019s eastern Korengal Valley, in the midst of a heightened American military campaign against the Taliban, two soldiers appear to be fighting \u2014 each other. It\u2019s a play fight and the young man on the bottom has his comrade in a headlock, forcing a kiss on the cheek. The photograph, taken in 2008 by the late British photographer Tim Hetherington, is from a time when nearly a fifth of all combat in Afghanistan was taking place in the six-mile valley. In the long stretches of boredom that would arise when the enemy was nowhere to be found, the men had to find other things to do at their remote outpost. \u201cThese guys are tough, aggressive guys and when there wasn\u2019t any combat, they turned their aggression on each other \u2014 in a fraternal way,\u201d explained Sebastian Junger, a writer and journalist who first brought Hetherington to Afghanistan on an assignment for Vanity Fair magazine in 2007. Both Hetherington and Junger became \u201cenamoured with the opportunity to show the intimacy of a platoon in combat,\u201d Junger said in an interview via telephone. The pair went on to co-direct what would become the Oscar-nominated documentary \u201cRestrepo\u201d filmed over the course of the same platoon\u2019s deployment. Bobby, the soldier on the bottom of this image, is remembered by Junger as \u201cincredibly funny, extremely smart.\u201d On top is Cortez, \u201can incredibly sweet kid,\u201d said Junger, adding that he was \u201csort of the pretty boy in the platoon.\u201d The photograph is currently on display at London\u2019s Imperial War Museum (IWM), accompanied by an excerpt from Hetherington\u2019s journal written that same year: \u201cIn the end it has little to do with the war, and a lot to do with being men\u2026 Or in the case here, becoming men.\u201d The works form part of an exhibition called \u201cStoryteller: Photography by Tim Hetherington,\u201d which opened on the 13th anniversary of the photographer\u2019s death (he was killed by shrapnel while filming and photographing the Libyan Civil War in April 2011). Junger agrees with his friend\u2019s sentiment. \u201cOne of the things that place is very good at is turning children into men. And I think that\u2019s always been true of war.\u201d Young men in conflict \u201cThe experience of war was the only opportunity that men had in a society to express unconditional love for each other,\u201d is a quote that Hetherington often repeated, according to his friends. He first learned it from another friend, photographer James Brabazon while the pair waited with Liberian rebel forces who were going to attack the capital Monrovia, during the Liberian Civil War in 2003. It was Hetherington\u2019s first experience of combat. Brabazon first heard the saying from his grandfather, a British soldier who served in World War II. \u201cHe just clearly, really took it to heart,\u201d said Brabazon in a video interview with CNN. \u201cTim was really interested in the dynamics of young men\u2026 He was really interested in how young men related to one another, how they represented one another to each other, where those representations came from, how they were amplified and how they were perpetuated \u2014 particularly in conflict.\u201d In a remote outpost where society was \u201cstripped away,\u201d these bonds captured Hetherington\u2019s attention more than the war itself. \u201cI became much more interested in the inter-relationships between the soldiers and my own relationship to the soldiers than I was in the fighting,\u201d reads a quote from Hetherington in the exhibition.\u00a0\u201cMy examination of young men and violence, or of young men\u2026 It\u2019s as much a journey about my own identity as it is about those young soldiers,\u201d he wrote. Following his year in the Korengal, Hetherington published \u201cInfidel,\u201d a photography book of stills taken during his deployment with bits of commentary from himself and the US soldiers he was embedded with. One contributor is Cortez, one of the subjects of the photo, who wrote: \u201cI told them time and time again that if a grenade went off, I would actually throw myself on the grenade\u2026 Because I actually love my brothers. I mean, it is a brotherhood\u2026 I think any of them would do it for me also.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s very important that this work happened\u2019 The IWM, which holds the entire archive of Hetherington\u2019s work, worked with researchers and different communities to find out how they engaged with conflict photography. Greg Brockett, who curated the exhibition, was especially interested in how refugee communities would respond to Hetherington\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to say how people are going to respond\u2026 Because a lot of them have experienced war and conflict directly,\u201d he told CNN over a video interview.\u00a0\u201cWhat struck me was there was generally an overwhelming sense of people who felt it\u2019s very important that this work happened, and people were able to see the realities they experience.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m less interested in people taking away knowledge of Tim, I\u2019m more interested in people taking inspiration away from Tim,\u201d said Stephen Mayes, executive director of the Tim Hetherington Trust, who also spoke to CNN via video call. Hetherington was distinguished from other conflict photographers by his approach, which involved spending prolonged periods of time with his subjects. He often used film cameras and would speak to his subjects while photographing them. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t interested in photography in and of itself, for its own sake. He was interested in how that would allow him to access the lives of others,\u201d said Brabazon. \u2018It took a little bit from his soul\u2019 In this process, Hetherington worried about how photography could be extractive. \u201cHe wanted the process to be consensual and also to leave something in the community,\u201d added Brabazon, recounting a series of street photographs Hetherington took in Liberia where he would take photographs of people, keeping one Polaroid for himself and giving another to the subject. \u201cI think that was really important, because it allowed people to have agency in the work that was being created\u2026 It\u2019s about extending the courtesy of participation in the creation of the work to the subject themselves.\u201d Hetherington\u2019s friends reflect on the tragedy of his death in Libya, believing he was killed in his prime as a photographer \u2014 not only because of the images he produced, but because of his reflections on what it meant to capture conflict. Mayes mentions the old adage that making a picture takes a little piece of the subject\u2019s soul. \u201cTim thought, definitely, in his mind, he\u2019d sold his soul to the devil in a way, because he saw that in making every picture he made, it took a little bit from his soul.\u201d \u201cWhat did Tim want the effect of his work to be? That is a question which I don\u2019t think we will every really know the answer to, because he died in the process of working that out himself,\u201d Brabazon explained. In his final diary entry on April 19, 2011, Hetherington wrote about attending the funeral of a rebel fighter who was killed by a mortar. He wrote of the young men he met there: \u201cThey are grimily happy that we are here to help them. They feel that now the whole world can see.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/style/tim-hetherington-photography-snap/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_16_style_copenhagen-old-stock-exchange-fire-intl", "text": "A huge fire has engulfed Copenhagen\u2019s old stock exchange, one of the Danish capital\u2019s most famous landmarks, causing its spire to collapse as staff and citizens scrambled to rescue paintings and historic artefacts from the blaze. \u201cI cannot describe how upset I and my colleagues are,\u201d said a visibly moved Brian Mikkelsen, CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce, which owns and has offices in the 17th century building. \u201cIt is a huge disaster, because it is 400 years of cultural history that is in flames.\u201d Stunned commuters and onlookers watched as the raging fire could be seen swirling around the building\u2019s distinctive 56-meter spire - shaped as the tail of four entwined dragons - moments before it collapsed and fell into the street below. Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

The three European nations say their landmark decision is the best way to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, but it sparked swift condemnation from Israel, as its foreign minister ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors from those countries. Most of the world already recognizes Palestinian statehood. More than 140 out of 193 member states of the United Nations have made their recognition official.

It\u2019s in favor of co-existence.\u201d The announcement was welcomed by Palestinian officials. \u201cThis step reflects Spain\u2019s keenness to support the Palestinian people and their inalienable and legitimate rights to their land and homeland,\u201d the office of the president of the Palestinian Authority said in response to Madrid\u2019s decision, as reported by Palestinian news agency Wafa. Hamas, the militant group which governs Gaza, urged other countries to follow suit and \u201crecognize our legitimate national rights, support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence, and end the Zionist occupation of our land.\u201d But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said recognizing a Palestinian state would be a \u201creward for terror.\u201d \u201cThis will be a terror state, which will attempt to perpetrate the onslaught of October 7 time and again, and to that we shall not agree,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding, \u201cthis evil must not be given a state.\u201d As Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors to Spain, Norway and Ireland, he said, in a statement: \u201cI am sending a clear message today \u2014 Israel will not hold back against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security.\u201d \u201cAfter the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has seen, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state,\u201d Katz added. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza\u00a0on October 7\u00a0after militants led by Hamas killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israel has come under fierce criticism for its war. Earlier this month, a panel of independent UN experts condemned \u201cthe continued and systematic onslaught of violence committed against Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d The agency has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages taken by Hamas. Israeli attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza have since killed at least\u00a035,647\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a079,852\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures. Two-state solution All three European leaders stressed the importance of having Palestinian statehood in reaching a two-state solution in the Middle East, a decades-long goal that the international community has failed to achieve. Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister Martin said the decision came amid \u201cgrowing impatience\u201d with Israel\u2019s lack of political will for a two-state solution. \u201cThe integrity of that two-state solution has been undermined in recent years by the strategy of the Israeli government and, in particular, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has declared opposition to it,\u201d Martin told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest during a live interview. Meanwhile, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson that Israel was wrong to see recognizing Palestinian statehood as rewarding Hamas. \u201cWe are sending the opposite signal. We are supporting the Palestine authorities which spring out of the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] who renounce violence and who many decades ago promised to leave the violent struggle behind and work for peaceful settlement with Israel \u2014 a promise they have kept by the way,\u201d Eide said. Senior officials in the United States, a close ally of Israel, have insisted the only way to bring peace and stability to the region is through the creation of a Palestinian state with guarantees for Israel\u2019s security. Lawmakers in Israel have long rejected those calls. Reacting to the news on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesperson told CNN that US President Joe Biden \u201cis a strong supporter\u201d of a two-state solution. The spokesperson added, however: \u201cHe believes a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\u201d France, meanwhile, said that now is not the \u201cright time\u201d for it to join its European neighbors in recognizing a Palestinian state. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Stephane S\u00e9journe, added that such a decision is not merely a \u201csymbolic issue or a question of political positioning\u201d but rather a \u201cdiplomatic tool\u201d in the service of a two-state solution. Germany, another one of Israel\u2019s staunchest allies, also questioned the decision. Michael Roth, the chair of the parliament\u2019s\u00a0Foreign Affairs Committee, posted on X: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that the recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state is an appropriate measure after the horrific massacres (by) Hamas (on) October 7 last year.\u201d Qatar, a key mediator in stalled ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, said it hopes \u201cfor more countries to recognize the State of Palestine,\u201d according to a statement from the foreign ministry. The foreign ministry of Saudi Arabia, another regional actor, called on \u201cmore countries to swiftly take the same stance.\u201d Ireland has a long history of being openly supportive of the Palestinian cause, consistently criticizing Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank and Gaza before Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack in Israel. Since then, Israel\u2019s war in response has shredded huge parts of the Gaza Strip and drained critical supplies, exposing the entire population of more than 2.2 million people to the risk of famine. A source familiar with the matter told CNN the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently considering further diplomatic steps against the three countries. Steps under consideration include cancelling visits of officials from these countries to Israel and revoking visas from diplomats, which will limit their ability to visit areas in the West Bank under control of the Palestinian Authority, the source said. Another step under consideration by Israel is to reach out to the US to seek diplomatic support in providing clarification from Norway, Ireland and Spain on their intended decision, and to ask the US to try and convince other countries to not follow suit. Pressure on Israel The planned recognition adds pressure on Israel after seven months of fighting, according to H.A. Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies in London. \u201cFor individual Palestinians on the ground in the Occupied Territories, it\u2019s not going to mean anything at all in the short term, perhaps in the medium term,\u201d Hellyer told CNN. \u201cIt is obviously political recognition by states that don\u2019t have a presence on the ground.\u201d Hellyer added that Israel risks becoming an \u201cinternational pariah\u201d given that Western nations are now beginning to recognize a Palestinian state.  Israel captured Gaza from Egypt in the 1967 war, then withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005. The territory, home to some 2 million Palestinians, fell under Hamas\u2019 rule in 2007. After Hamas took control, Israel and Egypt imposed a strict siege on the territory, which is ongoing. Israel also maintains an air and naval blockade on Gaza. These severe restrictions have been fiercely criticized by international bodies, including Amnesty International,\u00a0who say\u00a0Israel has violated international law. The vast majority of the population in Gaza are descendants of 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were\u00a0forcibly expelled\u00a0from their homes during what Palestinians call\u00a0al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d of the 1948-49 war, in what is now Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/middleeast/palestinian-statehood-spain-norway-ireland-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_22_asia_taiwan-protest-parliament-reform-intl-hnk", "text": "Thousands of mostly young protesters surrounded Taiwan\u2019s legislature late into the night on Tuesday, protesting a push by opposition parties to subject the island\u2019s new leader and his administration to tighter scrutiny from a parliament controlled by lawmakers who favor closer ties to China. The protest marks a chaotic start to the presidency of Lai Ching-te, who was sworn in Monday after winning a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which champions Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty and is loathed by Beijing. It also illustrates  the challenges Lai\u2019s fledgling administration faces without a parliamentary majority, which is now controlled by two opposition parties, the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People\u2019s Party (TPP). Demonstrators are angered by what they see as the KMT and TPP\u2019s attempt to fast track a bill through the legislature, which would grant the parliament sweeping powers to impose greater oversight over the executive branch of government. Some protesters carried sunflowers, in a nod to the student-led protest movement in 2014 that saw hundreds of students occupying the legislature for weeks in protest against the KMT\u2019s controversial trade deal with China. Those protests were instrumental two years later in the electoral defeat of the KMT, which has since been unable to recapture the presidency. Under the proposed legislation, government officials could be fined or jailed under what critics say is a vaguely worded new criminal offense of \u201ccontempt of parliament,\u201d if they were found making false statements to the legislature. They could also be punished if they refused to answer questions or provide documents, or withheld information during hearings. Meanwhile, the president would be required to deliver an annual address to the parliament on key policy issues. Opponents say the proposals could force officials to disclose sensitive information to parliament \u2013 such as those relating to diplomacy and defense \u2013 or face criminal penalties. They believe this could potentially undermine the island\u2019s security. The DPP has also accused the opposition of trying to force through the bill without allocating sufficient time for policy deliberations. Meanwhile, the KMT and TPP argue the new laws are needed to improve government accountability and combat corruption, pointing to similar legislative checks and balances on executive powers around the world. They also accused the DPP of spreading disinformation and trying to paralyze the legislature. In a sign of the heated political divide, disagreements over the controversial reform bill erupted last Friday in a brawl on the parliamentary floor \u2013 a chaotic display that saw some lawmakers leaping over tables and pulling colleagues to the floor, with a few members taken to hospital. On Tuesday, as the parliament resumed its meeting to discuss the bill, protesters gathered outside the Legislative Yuan \u2013 Taiwan\u2019s unicameral parliament \u2013 from morning until midnight, braving downpours in the afternoon. Many joined after finishing school and work, with organizers claiming more than 30,000 participants. Some held up signs calling the legislative process a \u201cblack box\u201d and demanding the bill to be withdrawn. Others chanted: \u201cNo discussions, no democracy!\u201d Ricky Li, a 28-year-old office worker, said he was worried about the bill\u2019s vague wording and lack of consultation. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that it will open the door to power abuses by the legislators \u2026 What if legislators start using the newly acquired power to wage vendettas against their political opponents?\u201d he said, noting that the bill has not been sufficiently discussed and lacks transparency. \u201cGiven the current circumstances of cross-strait relations and that a new government just took office, the opposition\u2019s assault on Taiwan\u2019s democratic institutions and political foundation warrants our attention.\u201d Discussions on the bill are expected to resume in the legislature on Friday. Lai, 64, a former doctor and vice president, was inaugurated Monday alongside new Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, who recently served as Taiwan\u2019s top envoy to the United States. Both leaders and their party are openly loathed by Beijing for championing Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says the self-ruling democracy is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/asia/taiwan-protest-parliament-reform-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_villa-vie-odyssey-perpetual-cruise", "text": "Under a blazing blue sky in the legendary Harland & Wolff shipyard in Northern Ireland, where the Titanic was once built, the modestly sized Villa Vie Odyssey sits in dry dock, dwarfed by the huge 12-deck Caribbean party boat that looms beside it. But when it sets sail on May 30, after intense refurbishment and cosmetic work, this 31-year-old ship will be one of the hottest new innovations in the cruise industry. It will be one of only two residential cruise ships in operation \u2013 and its world tour will have successfully launched where others have very dramatically failed. Around 300 passengers \u2013 or \u201cresidents\u201d \u2013 will be on board to start the voyage from Belfast which will visit 425 ports in 147 countries across all seven continents, circumnavigating the globe every three-and-a-half years. For this is to be a cruise without end, where passengers can choose between pay-as-you-go and ownership options, spending as little as 35 days or the whole of their natural life on board, with the ship itself being replaced around every 15 years. 1,301 days of summer The relatively small size of the 924-capacity vessel means it\u2019s capable of docking in the heart of destinations, with port stays ranging from a leisurely two to seven days, rather than the typical \u201chit and run\u201d cruise ship approach. These long-term cruise residents do, after all, have all the time in the world. The global itinerary, broken down into 16 \u201csegments\u201d over 1,301 days, has been carefully designed so that it catches the spring-summer seasons in both the northern and summer hemisphere. Residents, if they so choose, may never feel the winter chill again. There\u2019s no commitment to stay on board for the full three and a half years, or to get off when that\u2019s over. Residents can pick and choose between segments as they like. South America is the most popular part and the transatlantic section the least, Villa Vie Residences CEO Mikael Petterson told the dry dock press tour Sunday. Learning from the past Takeup has been high. Of the 295 cabins available at launch, 270 have been sold, with some residents choosing to join later in the voyage. Petterson expects all cabins to be fully booked by the end of the Northern European segment, which ends in August, and more will be opened up during segment two, which is Greenland to Miami. \u201cWe have a significant amount of people that want to come and see the ship themselves before committing, for obvious reasons,\u201d says Petterson. It\u2019s been a long journey to this upcoming launch and this is not the first venture of its kind. In November 2023, Life at Sea Cruises canceled its three-year voyage shortly before departure, having not secured a ship, leaving passengers stranded and pursuing refunds of tens of thousands of dollars. Villa Vie was started by Petterson and other former members of the Life at Sea executive team who quit when the original team split in May 2022. He says they\u2019ve been able to learn from the mistakes of those who\u2019ve gone before. Conservative option The ship now known as Villa Vie Odyssey was constructed in 1993 and \u2013 as the 495-cabin MS Braemar \u2013 was purchased from Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines last year for $13 million. A further $12 million has been spent on the refurb and getting it fully recertified and up to standard. \u201cAt $25 million all in, it\u2019s less than half of what anyone else has been trying,\u201d says Pettersen. \u201cThe ship is much cheaper, the financing is in place, the equity\u2019s in place, the sales are more than twice what Life at Sea had, so we\u2019re just in a completely different position.\u201d The reason the team chose this conservatively sized and priced vessel is \u201cbecause we wanted to make sure we could pull it through,\u201d he says. \u201cThe challenge has all been with the technical and getting her from asleep to awake. We\u2019re largely there. We\u2019re moving onto the hotel and that\u2019s the easy bit,\u201d he laughs. The boat is wearing its age well and it\u2019s not all been an uphill struggle. In 2009, it was enlarged during a refurb, and was renovated again in 2019, with many of the public areas getting a stylish new face. \u201cA lot of these spaces were only in service for four months since they were last revitalized, so we haven\u2019t had to do anything to them,\u201d explains Pettersen. There are plans to keep updating spaces after launch, too \u2013 like a lived-in home rather than an off-the-peg hotel. Under $33,000 a year As the Odyssey, the ship will have eight decks, a wraparound promenade and an enlarged pool \u2013 combining the Braemar\u2019s two, so that passengers can swim laps. And when that feels too energetic, there are two Jacuzzis to lounge in. There will be three restaurants, five bars and lounges, a spa, a fitness center, a library and a medical center. Then there\u2019s the spacious business center with sea views, internet from Starlink and Viasat 3, and an \u201cinteractive culinary center\u201d for those missing the kitchen, as well as for cooking classes. There will also be a golf program with a simulator on board and outings to greens around the world. It\u2019s also surprisingly affordable, as round-the-world cruise experiences go. Over on megayacht The World \u2013 the other residential cruise ship \u2013 prices start at $2 million a year. But on Villa Vie Odyssey, an annual rental works out at less than $32,485, while a three-year stint will set you back $97,455. An inside cabin is $89 per person per day, outside cabins start at $119 per person per day, and balconies at $199. All food and soft drinks are included, plus alcohol at dinner, as well as Wi-Fi and medical visits (but not procedures or medicines). There\u2019ll also be 24/7 room service, weekly housekeeping and bi-weekly laundry service at no extra cost. Endless Horizons Meanwhile, buying entails paying outright for a cabin \u2013 starting at $99,000 for an internal one, $149,000 for an outdoor and $249,000 for a balcony. Owners must then pay monthly fees starting at $1,750 per person, $2,500 per person, or $4,000 per person respectively \u2013 or $21,000, $30,000 or $48,000 per year. Owners can then rent it out to other people themselves (for no charge) or through Villa Vie for a fee. Those buying a cabin will be guaranteed it for 15 years, which is the estimated life of the ship. And then there\u2019s the newly introduced Endless Horizons program, where residents make a one-time payment of \u200b\u200b$299,000 for lifetime access to a cabin, transferring ships when the cruise does. Prices are based on double occupancy. Solo travelers get discounts of 30% for an internal cabin, 20% for an outside one and 10% for a balcony. There are also a lot more solo travelers than one might expect on a typical vacation cruise \u2013 50% of this first takeup are single. In the under-40s range, there are a lot more single male travelers than female, but post-retirement age, there are more women. The average age of traveler is 58 and 80% are from the United States, with Canadians being the next biggest group. Floating community A few of them are on board during the dry dock tour, such as John and Melody Hennessee, flamboyantly coordinated in hats and vests. They\u2019ve made headlines around the world for selling their worldly goods to live on cruise ships for the rest of their lives, and they were there Sunday to plan out their triple-cabin with the team. As these are people\u2019s homes, there are generous customization options afforded to residents, with requests accommodated where possible. There are a small number of large suites available to the ritziest of passengers \u2013 the biggest has a price tag of $900,000. New Zealand couple Mark and Katrina Howard, in hard hats to get their first look at their home for the next three and a half years, have no problem with the downsizing requiring to fit their belongings into a two-person cabin. \u201cWe\u2019ve done motor-homing,\u201d says Katrina. As for cruise ships, \u201cwe met on one in 1994, out of Auckland,\u201d she says, and now \u201cwe\u2019ll be celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary on board\u201d Villa Vie Odyssey. It\u2019s just one of the many celebrations, landmark moments and life-changing events that are set to take place among this floating community of strangers who are about to become close and near-permanent neighbors. Whatever waves or storms lie ahead, the summer-led itinerary ensures the sun will largely be shining.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/villa-vie-odyssey-perpetual-cruise/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_americas_kenya-haiti-delegation-intl-latam", "text": "A delegation of Kenyan\u00a0\u201ccommand staff\u201d has arrived\u00a0in Haiti, according to a law enforcement source in the country, ahead of the long-delayed arrival of a Kenyan-led\u00a0multinational security support force\u00a0in\u00a0the Caribbean nation. The delegation is expected to assess this week whether equipment and facilities for the foreign police forces are ready \u2014 an assessment which will be decisive in determining a timeline for the deployment, a source with knowledge of the preparations told CNN. Members of the delegation are also expected to meet with US and United Nations officials in the country, sources said. The UN Security Council\u00a0last year\u00a0authorized a multinational mission to support Haiti\u2019s National Police in battling deadly gangs that have seized control of much of the capital Port-au-Prince. Despite strong support from the US and other regional powers, however, the mission has been mired in uncertainty and legal challenges for months. It was further delayed following the resignation of former Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry in March, until the creation of a transitional governing council. The council said Tuesday that it met with top Haitian police brass to discuss the multinational mission. \u201cHaiti, through the Haitian National Police, will have overall control of all aspects of the field mission,\u201d including the mission\u2019s composition, aims, rules of engagement and health precautions, it emphasized in a statement on X. Kenya is currently finalizing preparations for the mission, the country\u2019s principal secretary of foreign affairs\u00a0Korir Sing\u2019Oei said Sunday, citing the successful creation of the council and other institutions in Haiti as key conditions. \u201cIn view of that and in view of the decision of the courts in our republic essentially guiding how Kenya should be able to carry out this deployment, lots of reciprocal agreements were entered into between Kenya and Haiti, which facilitates Kenya\u2019s ability to deploy. And we are in the process \u2014 our government is in the process of finalizing preparation to deploy.\u201d The mission is scheduled to launch by the end of this month. A UN-managed trust fund for the mission currently contains $21 million, provided by Canada ($8.7 million), France ($3.2 million), Spain ($3 million) and the United States ($6 million). Personnel for the mission have been offered by the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Chad and Jamaica, in addition to Kenya. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday defended US funding for the mission in a Senate Foreign Relations hearing, warning that Haiti is \u201con the precipice of becoming an all-out failed state\u201d without international support. \u201cI understand some of the skepticism that exists about another mission in Haiti, but I think what we have going for us is this: first, a general revulsion of the people at the direction that the country has taken, including gangs that are dominating Port-au-Price and trying to undermine governance, a democratic trajectory that\u2019s been disrupted by failing to have a government that actually has a clear mandate and all of that has also had the effect of interrupting development assistance, other forms of assistance that people so desperately need,\u201d he said. Haiti\u2019s National Police have already \u201ctaken back control of the airport and other critical infrastructure,\u201d he added. \u201cIn fact, today, commercial flights resumed in Haiti, and we anticipate that American carriers will begin flying again in the days ahead.\u201d US President Joe Biden will welcome Kenyan President William\u00a0Ruto and first lady Rachel\u00a0Ruto\u00a0to the White House on Thursday, with Haiti high on the expected agenda.

{"id": "travel_what-its-really-like-to-live-in-antarctica-intl-hnk", "text": "A five-month-long slumber party. A college dorm. An introvert\u2019s hell. Those are just some of the words residents of Antarctica use to describe life in the world\u2019s coldest, most mysterious continent. In 1959, 12 countries including Chile, Japan, Australia and the United States \u2013 signed the Antarctic Treaty, pledging that the seventh continent would only be used \u201cfor peaceful purposes only.\u201d As a result, there are no military bases there, although military planes and ships can bring people and supplies. That means that only a few thousand humans can say that they have lived in Antarctica. And yet, despite bunking with strangers, taking 90-second showers and having zero privacy, there are intrepid travelers who believe all the challenges are worth it. Keri Nelson is one of them. The Minnesota native first went to the White Continent in 2007 to work as a janitor at McMurdo Base, one of the three US outposts there. Now a veteran of 16 Antarctica seasons, she has done stints at all three stations \u2013 in addition to McMurdo, the largest and most active, there are Amundsen-Scott Station at the geographic south pole, and Palmer Station, north of the Antarctic peninsula. \u201cIf I was going to describe it in musical form,\u201d Nelson says, \u201cI would say McMurdo was like gritty, dirty bluegrass and South Pole was like symphony music and Palmer is like really corny, fun pop music.\u201d Summer camp for grownups In the summer months from October to March there can be as many as 1,000 people at McMurdo Base, from scientists to carpenters to dishwashers. Many support staffers have multiple jobs. For example, Evan Townsend, creator of the Antarctica Flag, worked in the kitchen, tended bar and managed the craft room during his stint there. \u201cIt is an entire town,\u201d Keri Nelson says of McMurdo. \u201cYou could go whole seasons and never meet a lot of people there, and it\u2019s just very busy at those stations. It\u2019s just bustle, bustle, bustle all the time.\u201d That\u2019s due to McMurdo\u2019s size as the biggest base, but also due to the rotation of staff, since people will move between other stations or go out on expeditions and research trips throughout the season. While there are some modern amenities \u2013 a room for watching DVDs, a craft room, a gym \u2013 the clubhouse feel of the base offers lots of opportunities for socializing. Nelson has organized fashion shows complete with a runway and played music in the \u201cice bands\u201d that often form during a season. Thirty kilometers from McMurdo is New Zealand\u2019s Scott Base, and sometimes staffers will make the trip across Ross Island to visit their US counterparts \u2013 joining in on their jam sessions, book club meetings and movie marathons. Some staffers even volunteer to teach classes in yoga, languages or other interests. \u201cThat was my thing that I learned in Antarctica, hip hop dancing and Thai massage,\u201d says Chris Long. Long, who claims to be from \u201cthe most remote living family in New Zealand,\u201d has spent more of his life living off the grid than on it. As a 19-year-old, he took a last-minute gig working in the galley (kitchen) of a Russian ice breaker ship going to Antarctica. He \u201cabsolutely hated\u201d the job, but found his calling along the way. After those disastrous few months, during which the unforgiving waters of the Southern Ocean regularly sent the ship bobbing at 45-degree angles, Long redirected into a job managing logistics for the scientists at Scott Base and now works as support staff for travelers who visit Antarctica by ship. It\u2019s an unconventional life, spending half the year going back and forth across the notoriously chaotic waters of the Drake Passage to South America, but Long says he can\u2019t imagine any other way to be. The other side of the ice Laura Bullesbach doesn\u2019t see anything of her own experience in the stories of fashion shows and book clubs. Her own Antarctic season, which concluded in March 2024, was more serene. She was one of half-a-dozen people staffing the world\u2019s southernmost post office, UK-administered Port Lockroy. \u201cThe island is the size of a football field, so it\u2019s tiny. And you live in a hut together where there are basically two rooms,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any running water and therefore no showers, no proper flushing toilets, and you\u2019re always on top of each other. \u201cWhen I said goodbye at the airport to one of my colleagues, we hadn\u2019t been without each other since the end of October for longer than maybe what it takes to take a shower on a ship. You\u2019re close friends and you\u2019re roommates and you\u2019re colleagues and it\u2019s everything at once.\u201d One common misconception, Bullesbach says, is that life on the remote continent is boring. At Port Lockroy there were daily tasks that kept everybody busy, from basic life admin like taking turns cooking meals to more serious tasks like surveying the water for any plastic that may have washed up and keeping track of the island\u2019s penguin colony. Plus, there\u2019s an educational component. When private, scientific or commercial ships visited Port Lockroy, which is the first scientific base established by the UK in Antarctica, Bullesbach and other team members would go on board to give educational talks, sell souvenirs and pick up mail. But there were perks \u2013 they could often use the onboard showers and sometimes, there were fresh fruits and vegetables they could take back to the island to supplement their supply of tinned and dried foods. Competing for the opportunity to clean up puke Unless you\u2019re a scientist in a very specialized field, your best bet for living in Antarctica is by applying for a support role at one of the stations. Nelson was so gung-ho about going to the White Continent that she went to Denver to attend a McMurdo job fair. After initially being rejected for a job as a dishwasher, she emphasized her training as a registered nurse when applying to be a janitor. One of the interview questions, she says, was \u201cwhat\u2019s the grossest thing you\u2019ve ever cleaned up?\u201d It worked. Since that first stint as a cleaner, Nelson has held a variety of Antarctic jobs, eventually working her way up to station manager. The pay was low, but Nelson didn\u2019t care. She wanted the experience of living in Antarctica, and she notes that despite the small paychecks, all meals, room and board, and transport to and from the continent are covered. But landing an Antarctica job isn\u2019t just about having the right CV. Living in close quarters for long periods requires a certain kind of personality. \u201cYou can be an amazing engineer or scientist, but if you can\u2019t live in a small hut or a small station with three other people or maybe on a station with 40 other people for the summer, then you\u2019re no good for the job,\u201d says Long. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how good you are at the job. Being able to fit in with the team is the most important. You don\u2019t want to make enemies in that kind of environment.\u201d When Bullesbach reached the final round of interviews for the Port Lockroy jobs, she and other candidates went out to a rural area for what she calls a \u201cselection camp.\u201d There, applicants were put into different teams and given assignments like building a tent while blindfolded. The purpose was two-fold: to measure everyone\u2019s practical skills and abilities while also judging how well they could problem-solve and work with others. Another consideration for working \u201con the ice\u201d is what country you\u2019re from and if your country has a base in the Antarctic. Bullesbach is German, but she has the right to work in the UK, which made her eligible for the Port Lockroy job. However, if you\u2019re not a citizen of a country with an Antarctic program there are still some options to spend time in Antarctica, mostly by working in tourism. Once you get the Antarctica bug, Long and Nelson say, it\u2019s pretty hard to get rid of. Getting in the first time is difficult, but since so few people have Antarctica work experience it\u2019s easier to keep returning after multiple seasons. One member of Bullesbach\u2019s team, Clare Ballantyne, had a previous season at Port Lockroy under her belt and served as a mentor to some of the first-timers. \u201cMy expertise is living and working in the most uninhabitable places on Earth,\u201d Long says. \u201c[A resident] might be a scientist, very smart person, knows a whole lot about whatever their area of expertise is, but if you send them down to Antarctica, they\u2019re gonna die tomorrow. So you need someone who is good at looking after and training people to live in that environment.\u201d Planning for every eventuality It\u2019s one of the most common questions for someone about to move to Antarctica: what to pack? For Bullesbach, the answer was \u201cnot much.\u201d She and her colleagues were limited to two bags each. \u201cYou have three jumpers, two pairs of trousers, lots of socks, and then that\u2019s kind of enough,\u201d she says. \u201cThen we got to send a box down with some other personal stuff. Any kind of hygiene products we might need, we got to send down beforehand and then everyone brought one or two board games or stuff to keep us all entertained in the evenings.\u201d Those living at larger and more established camps have the benefit of using what previous residents have left behind. At McMurdo, Nelson says, there was a lending library of books and DVDs, plus gear, clothing and other odds and ends that one might find useful. There were also medical supplies, from basic bandages and gauze to more serious equipment like a defibrillator. Electronics have also been helpful when it comes to packing for the edge of the world. Bullesbach could just bring her fully stocked Kindle instead of physical books to save space and, thanks to solar panels, there was always enough power to keep it charged. There was internet access at Port Lockroy thanks to Starlink, but the team voted as a group not to use their phones during mealtimes. Long says he\u2019s also a minimalist. After some trial and error during his earlier seasons, he now has his packing routine down to a science. \u201cNow I have the gear that I like, so I don\u2019t need to take so many things. I have exactly the pair of salopettes that I like and the warm jacket that I like and the hat that I like. That way, the more you know your gear, the less that you have to think about yourself, the more you can do your job.\u201d Still, there are risks in choosing to live and work in, as Long puts it, the most uninhabitable place on earth. At larger camps like McMurdo, there are trained medical professionals on base who can do a wide variety of procedures. But if someone needs a more serious operation or an urgent treatment, the patient will need to wait for a ship or boat to take them to the closest city \u2013 which could take anywhere from two to 10 days. Long gives several examples of serious injuries that happened in Antarctica. In one case, he says a cruise ship vacationer fell on the ice and broke her arm. Luckily, the on-board doctor was able to put her arm in a cast, and the traveler continued the next two weeks of the trip as planned. In a more serious case, a Russian scientist \u2013 who was also a medical doctor \u2013 realized that his appendix had burst and performed emergency surgery on himself. \u201cHe knew what he was doing and so he knew he was going to die if he didn\u2019t. So he tried and he did it and lived,\u201d says Long. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do when there\u2019s no other option.\u201d Leaving the ice behind Antarctica can have a powerful spell on the people who visit. Both Nelson and Long say they can\u2019t imagine not spending time there, and Bullesbach was already applying for a second expedition the week after returning from her first. Meanwhile, Nelson has launched a podcast, Antarctica Did That For Me, to share her experiences. In a fast-paced globalized world where everyone is on their phones all the time, Antarctica offers a rare opportunity to live a different kind of life. However, climate change is already affecting the seventh continent, and not only by shrinking glaciers. More and more countries who weren\u2019t part of the initial Antarctic Treaty, namely China, are trying to lay claim to part of it as the planet warms. \u201c[Antarctica] is set aside by treaty right now for science and peace and projects that benefit humanity. It\u2019s one of the things I love personally about working in the program. It\u2019s why I\u2019m an Antarctica devotee,\u201d says Nelson. \u201cStuff just keeps being taken from Antarctica. Information, ice, resources like seals and whales and fish,\u201d Klaus Dodds, professor of Geopolitics at the University of London, told CNN in 2021. \u201cAntarctica\u2019s fragility, I think, represents the fragility of the wider world. I think the Antarctic represents, in essence, not just the idealism that the treaty represents, but it also represents the supreme contradictory nature of humanity more generally.\u201d Nelson says that Antarctica gives her a sense of peace that she can\u2019t replicate anywhere else. \u201cWhen I\u2019m there, I can feel exactly as tiny as I am in this universe, no smaller than I am in this universe, but no bigger.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/what-its-really-like-to-live-in-antarctica-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_16_uk_queen-camilla-royal-warrants-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "Queen Camilla\u00a0has granted her first royal warrants to seven companies, including Shane Connolly, the designer behind\u00a0the floral arrangements at\u00a0last year\u2019s Coronation\u00a0and the King and Queen\u2019s 2005 wedding, as well as the upmarket central London department store Fortnum & Mason. The seven companies chosen by Camilla are among 145 previously selected by King Charles III when he was Prince of Wales, which have now had their warrants renewed following his ascent to the throne. Royal warrants act as a stamp of approval to indicate the preferred goods and services used by the royal household and senior members of the royal family. So, if you want to know where Charles and Camilla go hat shopping or buy their wine or organic meat from, it\u2019s worth checking out which companies made the cut. The use of royal warrants can be traced back to medieval times when Henry II first granted a Royal Charter to the Weavers\u2019 Company, according to the Royal Warrants Holders Association. In the 15th century, the first official royal warrants were granted, including to the King\u2019s printer, William Caxton. Selected companies are given permission to use the royal coat of arms on their packaging, vehicles and advertising for five years. Today, the act of officially endorsing particular brands remains one of the last remaining powers of the British monarchy not influenced by Parliament. Brand finance expert David Haigh says that customers are willing to pay between 12% and 24% extra for brands that have a royal warrant, according to research carried out by his consultancy last year. \u201cThere is no doubt that once you get a royal warrant, it does make a difference, day-to-day on the street when people are buying your products and when it comes to the sale of a company,\u201d he told CNN. They can also benefit British companies on the international stage, Haigh added. \u201cThere are plenty of situations where British brands are forging ahead in places like America, the Middle East, China, and having a royal warrant definitely helps.\u201d Royal warrants are given to a wide range of individuals and companies in various sectors, from agriculture and conservation to office supplies and clothing. Other companies on the King and Queen\u2019s latest list include Wartski, a London-based jewelry business, Corgi Hosiery Ltd, a Welsh independent sock manufacturer, and Camel Valley, a vineyard in Cornwall trusted to make sparkling wines for the royals. \u201cHer Majesty has taken a keen interest in the development of English wines,\u201d said Bob Lindo, managing director of Camel Valley, adding that she has been \u201ca terrific source of encouragement and enthusiasm.\u201d \u201cTo now have been appointed as one of her first warrant holders is very special,\u201d he said. Getting the royal seal of approval takes several years and involves a tough application process. \u201cIf you have been offering your goods to one of the royal palaces that grant these things for more than five years continuously, you are eligible to apply,\u201d Haigh says. This year there was a \u201crigorous focus on acting for a sustainable future,\u201d according to Tom Athron, CEO of Fortnum & Mason, the luxury London-based food and drinks store which was granted one of Camilla\u2019s first royal warrants. Haigh has also noticed this shift towards good environmental practice. \u201cIt seems quite clear that if there are any [Environmental, Social and Governance] problems with the company, they will not get a royal warrant,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that actually creates a bit of a double whammy of benefit to those companies. If someone in the royal family uses your product, they like it and they think it\u2019s good, that\u2019s one thing. If on the other hand they are endorsing the fact that you have high standards of ESG, in the current world, that is worth its weight in gold.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/16/uk/queen-camilla-royal-warrants-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

The group includes Adam Hamawy \u2013 an American citizen and former combat\u00a0surgeon\u00a0\u2013 known for saving the life of US Senator Tammy Duckworth in Iraq 20 years ago. In a post on X, Duckworth said she was \u201cbeyond relieved that Dr. Hamawy \u2013 and his entire team \u2013 safely left Gaza today and that he will be able to see his family again soon.\u201d Hamawy previously turned down an evacuation offer, refusing to leave his non-US colleagues behind, who\u00a0weren\u2019t afforded the option to leave earlier. \u201cIt was only US citizens who could leave.

It was that simple,\u201d Hamawy told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic doctor concept for me as a US former service member that you don\u2019t leave your teammates behind. On leaving Gaza, Hamawy told CNN,\u00a0\u201cWe are glad that we are out and that we all left together. Our hearts are with the people who still have to endure and cannot leave.\u201d \u201cWe hope that medical relief is allowed to replace us soon and a permanent ceasefire puts an end to this nightmare.\u201d The evacuation was a multi-lateral effort involving Jordan and the US. Australian, Egyptian, Irish and Omani nationals were among the evacuees.\u00a0The team were told to follow a specific route to the\u00a0Kerem Shalom crossing and were taken by the Jordanian military to the King Hussein Bridge. On May 19, Hamawy wrote a letter to US President Joe Biden\u00a0detailing the realities on the ground. \u201cI have never in my career witnessed the level of atrocities and targeting of my medical colleagues as I have in Gaza.\u201d He\u00a0urged Biden and the international community to allow free passage for medical personnel into Gaza, adding: \u201cThe children of Palestine are not safe. Civilians, population centers, are not safe. We, as humanitarian workers, are not safe. You have the power to end the invasion of Rafah and Gaza now.\u201d The group were working with the Palestine American Medical Association under the umbrella of the World Health Organization at the European Hospital in northern Rafah. While the hospital wasn\u2019t ordered to evacuate, Hamawy was \u201coften awakened by a strike that [shook] the whole hospital.\u201d In his letter to Biden he added, \u201cWe are hearing bombs drop around us more frequently, amidst thousands of sheltering civilians. The streams of patients, mostly children, are rising faster than we can keep up with fewer medical staff.\u201d More than 35,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s seven-month military offensive, most of them women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. According to Hamawy, the European Hospital is \u201cthe last standing hospital that\u2019s functionating like a functional medical center.\u201d Many hospitals have been forced to evacuate and, \u201cthe ones before them have all been raided and destroyed.\u201d No medical team replaced the healthcare professionals who evacuated Tuesday, leaving the hospital with even fewer workers to look after patients with increasingly fewer resources.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/middleeast/european-hospital-gaza-medics-freed-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

Tyler Wenrich, a 31-year-old American, pleaded guilty to\u00a0two counts of ammunition possession during a court hearing on Tuesday morning, Dr. Angela Brooks, deputy director of public prosecutions in Turks and Caicos, told CNN. Wenrich is one of five Americans arrested in recent months in the British Overseas Territory, where carrying firearms is prohibited. The Americans carried the ammunition in their luggage \u201cinadvertently,\u201d according to American lawmakers, and now face up to a dozen years in prison. Wenrich\u2019s hearing comes on the heels of a push from a bipartisan group of US lawmakers who traveled to Turks and Caicos to press for their release \u2013 but encountered resistance from officials on the island, the lawmakers announced Monday. Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin led the trip, which also was attended by Democratic Sen. John Fetterman and GOP Reps. Guy Reschenthaler, Josh Brecheen, Michael Cloud and Bob Good. The lawmakers met with Turks and Caicos officials, including the governor, attorney general, minister of tourism and police leaders, the statement from Mullin\u2019s office said. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today,\u201d Mullin said in the statement. \u201cAt this point, well-intentioned American citizens are facing a dozen years in prison all for unknowingly having one or two bullets in their luggage.\u201d \u201cShould they receive a prison sentence, we will need to consider additional actions to safeguard American citizens,\u201d Mullin said. The other detained Americans have been identified as Sharitta Grier, 45; Michael Lee Evans, 72; Bryan Hagerich and Ryan Tyler Watson, 40. Each is accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to the chain of 40 islands in the tropical Atlantic Ocean southeast of the Bahamas. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Manu Raju Tuesday, Mullin said a sentencing hearing is scheduled for Hagerich on Friday. The judge in the case is set to hand down Wenrich\u2019s sentence on May 28, Brooks said. According to Brooks, an expedited application was submitted on behalf of Watson, who will also have a hearing on May 28. Bringing firearms or ammunition, including stray bullets, into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden,\u201d according to a statement from its government. People who violate the law face a minimum of 12 years in prison, the US Embassy in the Bahamas said in an April advisory.

Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss, 72, is accused of leading the plot, which would have led to him becoming Germany\u2019s head of state. The prince appeared at a specially erected high-security courtroom in Frankfurt alongside eight other defendants, including former judge Birgit Malsack-Winkemann, who was allegedly ready to become minister of justice. In total, nine ringleaders accused of treason are believed to have planned the resurrection of the German Reich, or empire, through violence, by storming the Bundestag, the national parliament, and kidnapping President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

The unanimous ruling capped months long speculation and legal wrangling on whether the former leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC), turned thorn in its side and public face of a rival party, would be able to stand for the country\u2019s top legislative body. Zuma was forced to resign as president in 2018 after a series of corruption scandals and internal infighting in the ANC. He was found guilty of contempt of court by the same constitutional court for his refusal to testify to an anti-corruption commission. It is that sentence that barred him from running, the court ruled on Monday. \u201c(Zuma) Is accordingly not eligible to be a member of and not qualified to stand for election to the national assembly until five years have elapsed since the completion of his sentence,\u201d read Justice Leona Theron. \u201cWe welcomed the judgement, and we think it is well reasoned.

Fico was conscious and able to speak on Thursday afternoon, according to his long-time ally and the Slovakian President-elect Peter Pellegrini who visited him in the hospital. He said the prime minister was still in serious condition after being\u00a0shot five times from a close range and undergoing surgery. The assassination attempt rocked the central\u00a0European country and sparked global condemnation. Slovakia\u2019s Interior Minister Mat\u00fa\u0161 \u0160utaj E\u0161tok said the suspect told law enforcement officers that his action was motivated by his disagreement with the government and its reforms. The 59-year-old populist leader, who returned to power last year and whose controversial policy changes have sparked protests in recent weeks, was attacked on Wednesday after an off-site government meeting in the town of Handlova. \u0160utaj E\u0161tok said the police was pursuing only one investigative theory \u2013 that the attack was politically motivated. He said that the suspect told law enforcement officers that he disagreed with Fico\u2019s policies and that he decided to act after the recent presidential election, which saw a Fico ally \u2013 Pellegrini \u2013 emerge as the winner. \u201cThe reasons (the suspect gave) were the decision to abolish the special prosecutor\u2019s office, the decision to stop supplying military assistance to Ukraine, the reform of public service broadcaster and the dismissal of the judicial council head,\u201d \u0160utaj E\u0161tok said. He said the suspect is not a member of any extremist group, calling him \u201ca lone wolf\u201d who had in the past attended anti-government protests.

Footage from the scene showed the injured prime minister being bundled into a vehicle by his staff, before it speeds away with him inside. Nobody else was injured in the attack. The alleged shooter has been identified by multiple local media outlets as a 71-year-old man from southern Slovakia.

Fico was first rushed into a local hospital and then airlifted to a major trauma center in the nearby city of Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, where he spent more than five hours in surgery, according to hospital officials. Officials said he was shot, among other places, in his stomach. Hospital director Miriam Lapun\u00edkov\u00e1 is said Thursday Fico was \u201cstabilized but in a very serious condition\u201d and that he would remain in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit. She added that the hospital had two surgical teams operating on the prime minister. On Thursday morning, the country\u2019s Defense Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Robert Kali\u0148\u00e1k said Fico\u2019s condition \u201chas been stabilized overnight, more steps are being taken to better his health. The situation is really serious.\u201d The assassination attempt sent shockwaves across the country. Kali\u0148\u00e1k and \u0160utaj E\u0161tok delivered an emotional news conference outside the hospital on Wednesday night, saying the leader was \u201cfighting for his life.\u201d Visibly shaken and sometimes struggling for words, the two ministers appeared in deep shock over the attack. Later in the news conference, both men struck a more combative tone, blaming the attack on the \u201chatred\u201d being spread by \u201csome people\u201d and the media. Divisive figure in divided country Fico is the most powerful lawmaker in Slovakia. Unlike the president, whose role is more ceremonial and has limited scope, the prime minister holds rank as the decision-making head of government. Slovaks have been deeply divided over the country\u2019s direction and position in the world since Fico\u2019s return to power last year. Supporters see Fico as a caring leader who has their interests at heart; critics say he is a populist whose pro-Russian leanings pose major risks for the country. Slovakia\u2019s defense and interior ministers blamed rising hate speech and division for the political atmosphere in the country, which they said led to the assassination attempt. As prime minister,\u00a0Fico made a major U-turn in Slovakia\u2019s foreign policy and its previously staunch support for Ukraine, pledging to end the country\u2019s military support for Kyiv and promising to block Ukraine\u2019s NATO ambitions. The government is also trying to shut down the public service broadcaster and replace it with a new national broadcaster that would be under tighter state control. The reforms have been extremely divisive and have led to months of largely peaceful protests. Fico previously served as Slovakia\u2019s prime minister for more than a decade, first between 2006 and 2010 and then again from 2012 to 2018.

{"id": "2024_05_21_asia_singapore-airlines-turbulence-passenger-intl-hnk", "text": "Passengers on a Singapore Airlines flight hit by severe turbulence on Tuesday described a sudden, dramatic drop as \u201call hell broke loose\u201d on board the Boeing airliner carrying 229 passengers and crew. At first, \u201cthe flight was perfectly normal,\u201d said passenger Andrew Davies, who was traveling to New Zealand for business. He described the flight as \u201cquite smooth \u2026 I don\u2019t remember any turbulence at all.\u201d Flight SQ321 was cruising at 37,000 feet from London to Singapore when flight tracking data shows the plane dropped sharply before climbing several hundred feet, then repeated the dip and ascent, for about a minute. Many passengers were having breakfast at the time of the incident. Then, about nine or 10 hours into the roughly 13-hour flight, he was watching a movie when he saw the seat belt sign light up \u2013 so he put his seat belt on. \u201cThank goodness I did because within moments of doing that, all hell broke loose,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d \u201cThe plane just felt like it dropped. It probably only lasted a few seconds, but I remember vividly seeing shoes and iPads and iPhones and cushions and blankets and cutlery and plates and cups flying through the air and crashing to the ceiling. The gentleman next to me had a cup of coffee, which went straight all over me and up to the ceiling,\u201d Davies said. Images from the plane afterward show the cabin in disarray, with papers, cups and water pitchers scattered on the floor, and ceiling panels and piping hanging loose. Davies was sitting toward the front of the plane and witnessed some of the injuries sustained by dozens of passengers \u2013 including Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old Briton who died on the flight. \u201cThat gentleman was sitting right behind me,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of people needed some help but we tended to this gentleman, and I helped carry him, get him out of the seat, and we laid him on the floor so that some medical professions could administer CPR.\u201d Kitchen was given CPR for about 20 minutes, said Davies. Meanwhile, he said, \u201cthere was so much screaming,\u201d and people\u2019s injuries were evident; when he turned around, he saw one passenger with \u201ca big gash in her head and blood pouring down her face,\u201d and another elderly passenger in \u201csevere shock.\u201d Another passenger, 28-year-old student Dzafran Azmir, told Reuters that the aircraft had begun \u201ctilting up\u201d and shaking. \u201cVery suddenly there was a very dramatic drop so everyone seated and not wearing a seatbelt was launched immediately into the ceiling,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cSome people hit their heads on the baggage cabins overhead and dented it, they hit the places where lights and masks are and broke straight through it.\u201d Azmir added that the whole thing was \u201creally, really quick \u2013 which is why I think nobody could really respond to it.\u201d People didn\u2019t have time to react, he said \u2013 there were passengers in the plane bathrooms and air crew still standing when the turbulence hit. The plane was diverted to Bangkok after the incident, which injured 104 of the passengers, according to an update at Wednesday lunchtime from the Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital, which treated many of the travelers. Those injured on the flight included citizens from Australia, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Spain, the United States and Ireland, the hospital said in an earlier update. Those needing medical assistance were sent to several hospitals in the Thai capital, while others were looked after at a clinic at the airport. Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital said 20 travelers remained in intensive care units on Wednesday. Josh Silverstone, one of the passengers on the Singapore Airlines flight, described feeling \u201chappy to be alive\u201d as he was leaving Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital on Wednesday evening. Speaking with journalists on his way out, the 24-year-old British citizen said he had suffered a cut on his eye and a chipped tooth in the turbulence. He also said that after the incident had taken place, he had let his mother know he was ok by purchasing an in-flight Wifi package\u00a0for the first time in his life. Silverstone described the aftermath of the emergency landing in Bangkok, saying he started vomiting,\u00a0which prompted him to look for medical care. According to Silverstone, there are still several passengers being treated at the hospital, many apparently with spinal injuries and in a much worse physical state than he is. Silverstone told journalists he was \u201cgoing to Bali to see my boys\u201d when the horror on SQ321 unfolded, but he still hopes to eventually get there. Of the 211 passengers and 18 crew on board the original flight, 143 were transported via a relief flight to Singapore, where they landed early Wednesday morning, according to Singapore Airlines CEO\u00a0Goh Choon Phong in a video message released on Facebook. The remaining 79 passengers and 6 crew members are still in Bangkok, including those receiving medical care, and their family members. Kittipong Kittikachorn, the general manager of the Bangkok airport, said on Tuesday that preliminary investigations suggest Kitchen had suffered from a heart condition, and that the autopsy process is ongoing. Several passengers\u00a0had broken arms, but the majority of injuries were cuts and bruises, he added. Goh, the CEO, extended his condolences to Kitchen\u2019s family and loved ones, saying the airline was \u201cdeeply saddened by this incident\u201d and was \u201cvery sorry for the traumatic experience\u201d that passengers endured. The airline is cooperating with authorities on the investigation, he added. Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Transport is investigating the incident, saying Tuesday it was in touch with its Thai counterparts and would be sending investigators to Bangkok. The US National Transportation Safety Board is also sending personnel to Singapore to help the investigation, including a representative of the board and four technical advisors.
