The accuser, economist Sarah Aneesah Hakh, told an online press conference held in the capital Georgetown that former Minister Nigel Dharamlall sexually assaulted her in 2020 and 2021. Hakh said the first alleged incident occurred during a business meeting when Dharamlall was Guyana\u2019s senior minister of regional development. \u201cThe fact that he is still in that party is mind boggling to me,\u201d Hakh said. Dharamlall, a Guyanese politician seen as a power broker in the country, was recently appointed to the executive committee of Guyana\u2019s ruling People\u2019s Progressive Party. He has been photographed recently with Guyanese President Irfaan Ali and Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo. Dharamlall rejected the allegations in a statement posted on his Facebook page, saying \u201cI wish to categorically and most vehemently deny each and every one of the allegations made.\u201d He accused Hakh of being on a \u201ccampaign to tarnish my reputation,\u201d claiming that \u201cher demeanor towards me changed fundamentally after I rebuffed her advances and spurned her attempts to engage in an intimate relationship.\u201d CNN has reached out to Dharamlall for comment and has contacted the office of Guyana President Irfaan Ali. Dharamlall resigned from Guyana\u2019s cabinet and parliament last year after an indigenous teenage girl accused him of rape in an unrelated incident, which he has denied. The girl later withdrew the claim according to officials and no charges were filed, President Ali said\u202fin a video statement\u202flast July. He emphasized at the time that his government had \u201callowed the system to work. We have not intervened; from day one,\u201d apparently referencing public criticism over how the girl\u2019s case was handled by authorities. Her withdrawal however was seen by some as a sign of government corruption, with the public speculating her family had been paid off. In a March statement, Guyanese women\u2019s rights group Red Thread criticized officials for failing the accuser. \u201cIt is of great concern that the public nature of this complaint, the powerful political status of the suspect, the discontinuance of the matter at this early stage and the haste with which this investigation was ended, will reinforce the perception of impunity, and inevitably discourage other victims of sexual violence from coming forward,\u201d it wrote. \u2018Violated against my will\u2019 Hakh, who was seen as a rising star in Guyana, said she was first assaulted by Dharamlall during what was supposed to be a meeting about her taking a role as a regional executive officer in September 2020. She alleged that Dharamlall took the then-25-year-old into his bedroom, disrobed and forcibly performed oral sex on her without her consent in the Anna Regina State House, a town on the country\u2019s coast. Hakh told reporters on Friday that she told Dharamlall to stop several times, saying she is a lesbian and \u201cthis is not something I came here expecting to do and can\u2019t offer anything.\u201d \u201cI was violated against my will by a man who exploited my situation and tried to entrap me in a compromising situation due to my future contract with the ministry,\u201d she said. Hakh also alleged that a second incident took place in 2021, in the Cummings Lodge neighborhood on the outskirts of Georgetown, when she says she met Dharamlall to discuss several grievances she had with the ministry of local government. During their meeting, Hakh alleges Dharamlall tried to remove her clothes. Hakh told CNN she didn\u2019t file a police report in 2020 or 2021 due to fears of police corruption and that she would be shunned publicly and within her family, which she says did business with Dharamlall. \u201cI knew I was going up against something that was dangerous and my whole strategy was that if I made a report that was preemptive, and it didn\u2019t go anywhere, I automatically had no credibility,\u201d she told the press conference on Friday, adding that she finally filed a police report on May 9. Hakh said she also filed cyberbullying charges against Dharamlall on May 8.\u202f CNN has contacted Guyanese police for comment. Hakh said she decided to go public with her allegation because \u201cI need to give victims the strength to know that they\u2019re not alone, and that there is no shame in what happened to them.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/americas/guyana-nigel-dharamlall-sexual-assault-allegations-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_13_sport_rose-zhang-founders-cup-korda-spt-intl", "text": "Rose Zhang surged to victory at the 2024 Cognizant Founders Cup on Sunday, as Nelly Korda fell short in her final two rounds to end her historic winning streak on the LPGA Tour. Zhang, 20, birdied four of her last five holes in her final round to finish two shots ahead of Sweden\u2019s Madelene Sagstr\u00f6m \u2013 with the duo finishing way ahead of the rest of the pack \u2013 at Upper Montclair Country Club. The American began Sunday a shot behind Sagstr\u00f6m, but produced some excellent, attacking golf to move ahead, maintain her lead and claim her second LPGA Tour victory. \u201cHonestly, today has been a roller coaster. I think from the start of the day, just coming out, it was raining, it was cold. I knew it was going to be a grind,\u201d Zhang, who finished 24-under par for the tournament, said afterwards. \u201cI think coming out I had those expectations of today I really have to find it in me to even play well, let alone win. \u201cAnd Madelene has been playing rock solid golf. She\u2019s been blowing away the field so just been trying to keep up. I think that was the mindset going in. I didn\u2019t have any expectations because I knew coming out here there was going to be a lot of golf to play. \u201cA lot of mistakes could have happened, can happen, and I just have to be able to take whatever I have out here. So that was the whole day. Starting from [hole] one, hit the pin and definitely did not expect that, but it was a nice little save. And going from there was able to hit some close. Gave me a little bit of momentum just in my own round.\u201d In June last year, Zhang became the first player in 72 years to win an LPGA tournament on her professional debut. She turned pro having become the most decorated player in the history of women\u2019s amateur golf, signing off by becoming the first women\u2019s golfer to ever win back-to-back individual NCAA national titles. Ever since her breakthrough victory at the Mizuho Americas Open last year, Zhang struggled to find consistency and that winning touch again. But the young star looked back to her best during the Founders Cup, putting in a complete performance in New Jersey as she carded rounds in the 60s in all four of her rounds; this was the first time she has done so since becoming an LPGA Tour member. Her statistics over the tournament highlighted her dominance, ranking first in most birdies, the most greens hit in regulation and the player who needed the fewest number of putts. After her victory on Sunday, Zhang spoke about the increased \u201cexpectations\u201d put on her \u201cto perform\u201d after what she did in her professional debut. \u201cSometimes, the noise did get to me a little bit, but I had such a good support group around me. I had people who really stuck in and told me to take it one at a time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy to come out here. Didn\u2019t have any expectation of having to win because I realize that it\u2019s all just noise, and I have to be able to work at it myself and try my best to put myself in positions like this. But no matter what happened this week, I would\u2019ve been very satisfied and it reignited my passion for the game once again.\u201d Sunday\u2019s result ended Korda\u2019s dramatic, historic winning run after she emerged victorious in five consecutive tournaments earlier this year and was aiming for a sixth in a row, which would have earned her the outright record, at the Founders. However, despite a strong start to the tournament, the world No. 1 faded away as it progressed, eventually finishing tied for seventh and 17 shots behind Zhang. Even though her win-streak came to an end, Korda fondly reflected on her run after her finish at the Founders. \u201cYeah, gosh, hasn\u2019t even sunk in. Probably maybe now \u2013 or maybe in like 10, 15 years \u2013 it\u2019ll sink in,\u201d the 25-year-old told reporters. \u201cHopefully, someone beats it one day. \u201cBut just to do that with all the competition out here is super, super rewarding with how much work that I\u2019ve put in. So I think to get a streak like that in any sport in general is amazing with the amount of talent that I feel like every athlete has in their sport. \u201cJust an amazing feeling and, hopefully, one day it\u2019ll sink in.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/sport/rose-zhang-founders-cup-korda-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_catalonia-elections-socialists-win-intl", "text": "Barcelona, Spain \u2014 Spain\u2019s Socialists won the biggest share of the vote in Sunday\u2019s Catalan elections, dealing a serious blow to more than a decade of separatist governance and the independence dreams still nursed by some in the wealthy northeastern region. The Socialists, led locally by Salvador Illa, had 42 seats in the 135-seat chamber with more than 99% of the vote counted, while hardline separatist party Junts was in second place with 35 seats, and the incumbent more moderate separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) had 20 seats. Spain\u2019s largest opposition party, the conservative People\u2019s Party, also had a good night, seeing the biggest increase since the last vote in 2021 from three seats to 15 on Sunday. Turnout for the vote was notably low at 58%. The result looks to be an existential threat for separatist governance in Catalonia which led a 2017 illegal independence referendum and declaration of independence that caused Spain\u2019s worst institutional crisis in more than 30 years but whose movement has lost energy and unity more recently. It also represents a vindication of Spain\u2019s Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s controversial bid to normalize relations with restive Catalonia, including issuing pardons for convictions over the independence drive and, more recently, a controversial amnesty including others still facing prosecution. Speaking as the voting count concluded, Illa hailed a \u201cnew era\u201d for the region. However, with no party holding a clear majority and deep ideological divisions between them, there remains the risk the vote will have to be repeated. The separatist parties combined of the ERC, Junts, far-left CUP and far-right Alianca Catalana, do not have the required 68 seats to be able to form a coalition government. Illa\u2019s Socialists will also need to forge an agreement - most likely with the ERC - but separatist parties until now have rejected any suggestion of helping the national ruling party govern in Catalonia. Illa might instead attempt to form an unorthodox alliance with not only far-left Sumar, its coalition partner in national government, but also the conservative People\u2019s Party and far-right Vox, with whom the socialists have long said they would not negotiate. On Sunday night, the ERC\u2019s leader Pere Aragones, Catalonia\u2019s outgoing president, told reporters that his party would move into opposition, effectively ruling out backing the Socialists. Junts\u2019 leader Carles Puigdemont said his party had performed well but turnout among separatist voters remained low and without a strong showing by the ERC, AC and CUP, his options were limited. He previously said that if he didn\u2019t win and the Socialists allied with the PP to lead the region he might withdraw his support from its minority national government - offered after inconclusive national elections in July, risking fresh instability on a national level. Political analyst and historian Joan Esculies said whatever came next, the night\u2019s headline was the tamping down of Catalan separatist sentiment: \u201cThe pro-independence movement has run out of ideas to convince or mobilize people as they did before.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/europe/catalonia-elections-socialists-win-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_china_china-covid-journalist-zhang-zhan-expected-release-intl-hnk", "text": "A Chinese citizen\u00a0journalist who has been behind bars for four years over her reporting on the initial Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan is due to be released Monday after serving her sentence, according to supporters and a court verdict. Zhang Zhan, a former lawyer, was one of the few independent Chinese journalists reporting in Wuhan after the metropolis of 11 million people went into a complete lockdown, offering a rare, unfiltered glimpse into the reality on the ground\u00a0as Chinese authorities imposed tight censorship on media coverage. She was detained in May 2020 and sentenced months later to four years in prison for \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble\u201d \u2013 a charge commonly used by the Chinese government to target dissidents and human rights activists. Zhang is due to finish her sentence on Monday, according to the court verdict on her case obtained and published by human rights groups. Supporters and rights groups have called on the Chinese government to free Zhang on schedule. \u201cSo far I have not received any confirmation that Zhang Zhan has left the prison and is home with her family. We are all still waiting,\u201d said Jane Wang, a UK-based advocate for the Free Zhang Zhan campaign. \u201cI understand that her parents and brother have been under enormous pressure and warned severely not to give media interviews. Friends\u2019 calls are also left without answers\u2026 these are extremely worrying signs,\u201d she added. Reporters Without Borders (RSF), which awarded Zhang its Press Freedom Award in 2021, called on \u201cthe international community to put pressure on the authorities to ensure her unconditional release on Monday,\u201d in a post on social platform X Friday. In early February 2020, just days after Wuhan went into lockdown, Zhang traveled some 400 miles from Shanghai to the central Chinese city to report on the spread of the virus and subsequent attempts to contain it, just as authorities tightened censorship on state-run and private Chinese media. For more than three months, she documented snippets of life under lockdown in Wuhan and the harsh reality faced by its residents, from overflowing hospitals to empty shops, as the world braced for the spread of the virus. She posted her observations, photos and videos on WeChat, Twitter and YouTube \u2013 the latter two of which are blocked in China. \u201cI can\u2019t find anything to say because everything is covered up. This is the problem this country is facing now: any opposing opinions from us might be (dismissed as) \u2018rumors,\u2019\u201d she said in a video two weeks after arriving in Wuhan, donning a face mask. \u201cEven our own voices are out of our control. They imprison us in the name of pandemic prevention and restrict our freedom\u2026If we cannot obtain the truth, if we cannot break their monopoly of the truth, the world will be meaningless to us.\u201d Her posts came to an abrupt stop in mid-May, and she was later revealed to have been detained by police and brought back to Shanghai. \u2018Continued harassment and surveillance\u2019 China\u2019s Foreign Ministry declined to confirm whether Zhang had been released from prison at a regular news conference on Monday afternoon. \u201cI don\u2019t know the relevant information, but what I can tell you is that China is a country governed by the rule of law. Anyone who violates the law should be punished by law,\u201d said ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin. \u201cAt the same time, China fully protects the legal rights of defendants and prisoners in accordance with the law,\u201d he added. Human rights advocates who have long worked on China say Zhang is likely to live under close surveillance from authorities even if she does walk out of prison. \u201cWhile Zhang is released from prison, it won\u2019t mean she will be free,\u201d said Yaqiu Wang, research director for China at advocacy group Freedom House. \u201cIf the Chinese government\u2019s past record is of any indication, she will face continued harassment and surveillance by authorities. But if Zhang Zhan\u2019s past actions are any indication, she will keep fighting against efforts to silence her.\u201d Sarah Brooks, Amnesty International\u2019s China director, said she was concerned that Zhang\u2019s ability to travel or to make contact with relatives and others, especially those outside China, may be severely restricted. \u201cZhang Zhan should never have been jailed in the first place; now, having served her time, our hopes are with her and her family for a safe reunion and road back to health and, if she chooses, her important human rights work,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s jailing of Zhang Zhan has been a shameful assault on her human rights, and her release must mark a new beginning.\u201d Failing health Supporters and rights groups are also concerned about Zhang\u2019s access to medical treatment upon her release, given her poor health conditions while in prison. The 40-year-old has been on multiple hunger strikes since being detained and was briefly hospitalized. In 2021, Zhang\u2019s mother said her daughter was so frail that she could not hold her head up for lack of strength and was in desperate need of medical care. During a previous hunger strike, Amnesty International alleged Zhang was shackled and force fed, treatment the group said amounted to torture. China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not previously respond to CNN on allegations of Zhang\u2019s mistreatment in detention. In a lengthy statement issued in July 2020, the Foreign Ministry denied the Chinese government had cracked down on journalists who \u201cexercised their right to freedom of speech on the Internet\u201d during the pandemic. \u201cIn China, no one gets punished or penalized simply because of making remarks,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Chinese government has all along conducted its Covid-19 response in an open and transparent manner, and has made widely recognized achievements.\u201d Zhang was one of a number of independent reporters who were detained or disappeared during the outset of the pandemic, as Chinese authorities clamped down on coverage of the virus and propaganda outlets went into overdrive portraying Beijing\u2019s response as effective and timely. China is the biggest jailer of journalists in the world, according to Reporters Without Borders, which ranks it at 172 out of 180 countries around the world in its annual Press Freedom Index. Authorities tightly control the press at home while blocking most foreign media outlets via the Great Firewall, its vast online censorship and surveillance apparatus.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/china/china-covid-journalist-zhang-zhan-expected-release-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_india_india-elections-migrant-workers-voting-intl-hnk-dst", "text": "Chanu Gupta has lived in India\u2019s financial capital Mumbai nearly his whole life, since arriving as a child from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. But when polls open in the city, the 59-year-old street vendor won\u2019t be able to vote in the nationwide election \u2013 along with millions of internal migrant workers who are a major backbone of the country\u2019s economy. \u201cI cannot go vote as I don\u2019t belong to Maharashtra state,\u201d Gupta told CNN in Mumbai\u2019s shopping district Dadar, standing next to the roadside cart where he sells shaved ice and cold drinks. \u201cI have voting rights in another state.\u201d Under India\u2019s election rules, eligible voters can only cast ballots in their constituencies \u2013 meaning those working outside of their state have to return home to vote. That\u2019s all but impossible for many out-of-state workers, especially underprivileged daily-wage workers in the unorganized sector. And it\u2019s a huge group \u2013 one study estimates there were about 600 million internal migrants in 2020, making up 43% of the country\u2019s nearly 1.4 billion population at the time. These workers are often from poorer rural parts of India, in search of work in bigger cities. Even then, they earn low wages that are usually sent home to support family members. Perhaps nowhere is this starker than Mumbai \u2013 India\u2019s richest city and the birthplace of the Bollywood movie industry. Often referred to as the \u201ccity of dreams,\u201d Mumbai draws migrants from across the country hoping to find wealth and success. More than 43% of Mumbai\u2019s population were classed as migrants in 2011 during the last national census, according to migration think tank Knomad. Many come from states with higher poverty and unemployment rates such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Gujarat. Signs of that diverse mix are everywhere in Mumbai \u2013 the varied languages spoken, the many day laborers across the city, from auto-rickshaw drivers to construction workers and sugarcane juice vendors lining the streets. For these workers, forgoing daily wages to head home to vote would come at a high cost \u2013 both in the money they would spend getting there, and lost wages. And those losses have a ripple effect on the family members back home dependent on their income \u2013 from children missing out on tuition fees to elderly parents\u2019 rent and food costs. The Covid-19 pandemic only underscored the volatility of migrant workers\u2019 circumstances when millions lost their jobs almost overnight and were forced to go home. \u201cDespite the living expenses being relatively high in large cities as compared to villages, their wages are considerably low causing poor living conditions including limited or non-existent public services such as water and sanitation,\u201d said one United Nations-led study that examined the impact of the pandemic on this segment of the workforce. Gupta said his shaved ice business relies on the hot summer months when the election takes place. \u201cIf I go to vote, I lose my business. Earning my living is more important to me than voting as I have to support my family,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many migrants like me who are in Mumbai to earn money and are not able to vote.\u201d India\u2019s diaspora Many Indian citizens abroad \u2013 part of the massive global Indian diaspora \u2013 face the same problem, though their circumstances vary considerably. Most are low-income laborers who helped build the economies and glittering cities of oil-rich Arab nations, while some are middle or upper-class students pursuing an international education or professional career in Western countries. According to government figures, there are 13.6 million such \u201cnon-resident Indians,\u201d or NRIs, globally. The biggest group is in the United Arab Emirates, with 3.4 million NRIs, followed by 2.5 million in Saudi Arabia; next is the United States with 1.2 million. The plight of NRIs in Gulf nations \u2013 many of whom live in cramped dormitories and labor camps \u2013 was also highlighted during the pandemic when businesses shut down, wages dried up and border restrictions prevented them from returning home, leaving them in limbo. For these overseas Indians, there is no such thing as online voting or postal ballots. Instead, NRIs must register as an \u201coverseas voter\u201d then travel to their hometown in India to be physically present in their constituencies to vote. Local media reports highlight some dedicated voters with the means to fly back and vote, such as professionals in the United Kingdom or Dubai. But they remain a tiny minority of NRIs who do so. According to the Election Commission of India, in the last national elections in 2019, more than 71,000 people registered as \u201coverseas voters\u201d \u2013 less than 1% of the total NRI population at the time. Push for voter turnout Indian authorities have pushed hard in recent years to increase turnout, urging all 968 million eligible voters nationwide to cast their ballots \u2013 a massive feat that includes setting up more than a million polling stations from remote forests to mountain peaks. The ECI has also launched voter literacy initiatives and social media campaigns targeting young voters. These efforts saw the highest voter turnout in the country\u2019s history in the 2019 election, with more than 67% of Indians going to the polls. The massive group of disenfranchised migrant workers stands in sharp contrast to these achievements \u2013 with no solution in sight. In a 2011 study that surveyed workers across five Indian states, 60% of respondents had \u201cmissed voting in elections at least once because they were away from home seeking livelihood options.\u201d It added that many migrants left home as young as age 13 to look for work \u2013 and did not have time to get their voter IDs when they became eligible at age 18. The ECI acknowledged this problem in a 2022 report, raising the question of how to improve voter participation among internal migrants. One issue the voting body highlighted was the absence of any clear definition of an internal migrant, adding that their inability to vote is a key reason \u201ccontributing to low voter turnout.\u201d The ECI said it had proposed remote voting machines to address the problem.

After going down 0-2 in the series following surprising back-to-back home defeats, the defending champion Nuggets have now wrestled homecourt advantage back from Minnesota with two straight road wins as the teams head back to Colorado. Only five teams in NBA history have come back to win a best-of-seven series when losing the first two at home. All five won Games 3 and 4 on the road, as Denver has done. It was another impressive victory for Nuggets, who took the lead for the first time towards the end of the first quarter and then never gave it up. Denver opened up a 15-point advantage at the half after a nightmare end to the second quarter for the Timberwolves. After a turnover allowed Michael Porter Jr. to score a breakaway dunk with just 1.6 seconds remaining, Nickeil Alexander-Walker tried to quickly inbounds the ball in the hope of giving Minnesota a chance of a final bucket before the horn, but threw the pass straight to Nuggets guard Jamal Murray. Murray heaved the ball from way beyond the half-court line and hit nothing but net, sucking the energy out of Target Center and leaving several fans with their head in their hands. Denver\u2019s lead swelled to as much as 18 in the third quarter, before the Timberwolves cut the deficit to as little as six points down the stretch, though it felt like the experienced Nuggets always kept their opponents at arm\u2019s length. \u201c\u2018Never underestimate the heart of a champion,\u2019\u201d Nuggets head coach Michael Malone said, per ESPN, quoting former Houston Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich. \u201cThey were quick to write us off, but these guys, we won a championship a year ago. \u201cWe went into Miami [in the NBA Finals], won two games in a row. This team has been tested time and time again, and we found a way to solve whatever\u2019s been thrown at us. This series is a long way from being over. We\u2019re not celebrating. \u201cIt\u2019s 2-2 \u2026 but what I found about our group is that they do believe in themselves and more importantly, they believe in the man next to them. We have a group that is acting as you would hope a championship team would act.\u201d Denver was led by 35 points, seven rebounds, seven assists and three steals from newly-crowned three-time MVP Nikola Joki\u0107, while Aaron Gordon had a near-perfect night with 27 points on 11-of-12 shooting \u2013 including 2-of-2 from three-point range \u2013 to go with seven rebounds, six assists and two blocks. Joki\u0107 called Gordon Denver\u2019s \u201cbest player\u201d in Sunday\u2019s victory. For the Timberwolves, rising superstar Anthony Edwards continued his impressive playoff performances with a huge 44-point night on 64% shooting, but it just wasn\u2019t enough to power Minnesota to a comeback win. Karl-Anthony Towns had a double-double with 13 points and 12 rebounds but was held to a miserly 27.8% shooting by Denver\u2019s improved defense. Towns said Murray\u2019s absurd shot just before the half \u201churt\u201d the team. \u201cWe made a good run to get ourselves back in the game and got some momentum, put some juice in the building, and then they did what the defending champs do,\u201d he said, per ESPN. \u201cIt definitely sent us to halftime with a bad taste in our mouth, so we just got to be better next time.\u201d The teams now head back to Denver for Tuesday\u2019s Game 5, before returning to Minnesota for Game 6 on Thursday.

{"id": "2024_05_13_sport_eton-harrow-lords-cricket-spt-intl", "text": "At Lord\u2019s Cricket Ground in the quiet, well-heeled streets of northwest London, different architectural eras collide together in a mishmash of mismatching styles representing the old and the new. A grand 134-year-old pavilion, its sandy brown stone fa\u00e7ade covered in ornate embellishments, sits at one end, staring at a futuristic glass media center across the pitch which balances on white columns and peers like a giant oblong eye over the ground. And never is that collision between the old and new more evident than when Lord\u2019s, the self-styled \u201chome\u201d of cricket and one of its most prestigious grounds, hosts the annual schoolboys fixture Eton vs. Harrow. The fixture \u2013 in which two of England\u2019s most exclusive and expensive boys\u2019 private schools play one another \u2013 is older than the oldest brick at this ground, first played in 1805 before Lord\u2019s was even at its current location. But it has become increasingly controversial and somewhat emblematic of the attempts of British institutions to reconcile their pasts with the present after it was axed from Lord\u2019s schedule by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which owns the ground, in 2022. That provoked an uproar from its members and the warring factions eventually reached a compromise in which Lord\u2019s would host both the Eton vs. Harrow and Oxford vs.Cambridge fixtures for another five years, as well as the finals of the UK\u2019s school and university cricket competitions, before another consultation with members in 2027. In a statement to CNN, Eton said it was \u201ca huge privilege\u201d to play at Lord\u2019s again this year and thanked the MCC. CNN has contacted Harrow for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication. For those criticizing the fixture, it is steeped in elitism and serves only to perpetuate stereotypes that cricket is an upper-class sport, one in which public schoolboys play annually on its most hallowed ground where the England Women have never played a Test. \u201cGuaranteeing a tiny number of schoolboys the right to play at Lord\u2019s every year when millions of children are denied that right is completely unacceptable,\u201d said the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket in its 2023 report, which examined inequalities and discrimination within the English game. However, for those attending Friday\u2019s match \u2013 mostly relatives of the schoolboys on the pitch or alumni who have attended this fixture for decades \u2013 it is an important piece of history to preserve, a cherished tradition and another victim of \u201ccancel culture.\u201d \u2018Part of the season\u2019 The Romantic poet Lord Byron played in the inaugural Eton vs. Harrow match more than two centuries ago. Afterwards, he wrote, \u201cWe were most of us very drunk and we went together to the Haymarket Theatre where we kicked up a row, as you may suppose when so many Harrovians and Etonians meet in one place.\u201d On Friday, cheers and chants began from the moment the two teams walked out onto the sun-drenched pitch. \u201cLet\u2019s go, oi, oi, oi!\u201d shouted the Etonians as they rose to their feet from the first ball, shouting, clapping, and even waving their shoes in their air, as is tradition. In another section of the stands, the Harrovians reciprocated with a standing ovation at the first boundary, before the Etonians launched into a rendition of the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d theme song when a player called Jack Sparrow bowled his first over. \u201cThe atmosphere today has been incredible; everyone has been really friendly. I\u2019ve never known such a convivial atmosphere before,\u201d Mark McCullen, who attended Eton and whose son is now at the school, told CNN Sport. There is no qualification procedure for the fixture. Eton and Harrow play at Lord\u2019s because they have played here for 219 years, because they are schools that are held aloft on their centuries-old history and which still churn out a disproportionate number of the British establishment. Twenty of the country\u2019s 45 Prime Ministers, including two of its last five, went to Eton; another seven Prime Ministers went to Harrow. It costs \u00a349,998 ($62,620) per year to attend Eton, and \u00a350,550 ($63,310) to attend Harrow, though both offer bursaries and scholarships for a small number of students. For many spectators, this fixture is an intrinsic part of the schools\u2019 respective histories, a tradition that remains from a time when debutantes making their entrance into upper-class society had to attend it, along with Wimbledon and the Ascot Races. Times may have changed but the tradition remains, making it almost sacrosanct for those who observe it and out-of-touch for those who don\u2019t. \u201cI think it\u2019s rather disappointing that there are a lot of people at the MCC whothink this fixture should be abolished because it\u2019s elitist,\u201d Harry Wells, an OldEtonian who first came to this fixture 57 years ago and is this year supporting hisfriend\u2019s son in the Harrow squad, told CNN. \u201cI think our country is going to sell itself down the river if it abolishes everything we\u2019ve held dear over the millennia.\u201d As late as the 1960s, carriages would pull up outside the ground, depositing families there for one of the biggest events of the \u201cseason,\u201d spectators who had watched those matches recalled. The crowds are smaller now, drawing in less money for the MCC, and around 2,000 to 3,000 people were expected to attend this year. \u201cIt used to be a big social event \u2026 people in top hat and tails. It was quite part of the season as they used to say in those days,\u201d Wells added. \u201cEveryone dresses down now, we\u2019re not so formal in any form of society, though looking here, there are lots of people in jackets and ties.\u201d Despite the May sunshine, almost every man wandered around in their suits, the Eton boys wore their red striped blazers and matching hats, the Harrow boys their navy-blue blazers while women wore flowing dresses or blouses and many carried designer handbags. \u201cI don\u2019t feel a sense of exclusivity at all,\u201d one spectator told CNN, pointing to the \u00a320 ($25) ticket available for people to come and watch. \u201cThe boys work really hard to get here \u2026 You may as well get rid of history because it\u2019s traditional and backward and imperialistic and whatever,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have to learn from the past, and the successes of the past too.\u201d \u2018A turgid image of snobbery\u2019 The question of the Eton vs. Harrow match has become entangled in the wider conversations around cricket presently. The sport \u2013 long associated with the English upper classes \u2013 has been buffeted by accusations of racism, sexism and elitism in the country where it originated while it has millions of fans around the world, considered more popular than any other global sport except soccer. For actor, writer and comedian Stephen Fry, the Eton vs. Harrow match is indicative of an image that English cricket can\u2019t quite shake off, what he described as \u201ca turgid image of snobbery and elitism.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not what cricket is about,\u201d Fry, a former MCC president and longtime cricket fan, told the Times in October 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s the second most popular sport in the world and it needs people to understand what a wonderful game it is, and how it\u2019s available for everybody.\u201d In the end on Friday, Harrow coasted to victory by 91 runs, posting 321-5 before Eton could only respond with 230 all out. And there may not be too many more opportunities for Eton to retaliate. \u201cTimes change. And the world is so far removed from that world now,\u201d Mark Nicholas, the current MCC president, told the Telegraph in October. \u201cCommon sense will prevail over the next four years within this compromise\u2026 I can see it moving on from here now very naturally.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/sport/eton-harrow-lords-cricket-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_world_whale-communication-coda-alphabet-scn", "text": "Scientists have accomplished a whale of a feat. They\u2019ve identified previously unknown complexity in whale communication by analyzing thousands of recorded sequences of sperm whale clicks with artificial intelligence. Variations in tempo, rhythm and length of the whales\u2019 click sequences, called codas, weave a rich acoustic tapestry. These variables hint that whales can combine click patterns in multiple ways,\u00a0mixing and matching phrases to convey a broad range of information to\u00a0one another. What sperm whales are saying with their clicks remains a mystery to human ears. Still, uncovering the scope of whales\u2019 vocal exchanges is an important step toward linking whale calls to specific messages or social behaviors, the scientists reported May 7 in the journal Nature Communications. \u201cThis work builds on a lot of prior work focused on understanding the calls of sperm whales. However, this is the first work that has started to look at sperm whale calls in their wider communicative context and in the context of exchanges between whales, which has made some of the findings possible,\u201d said study coauthor Dr. Daniela Rus, director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT, in an email. \u201cUnderstanding what aspects of their codas they can control and vary helps us understand how they can encode information in their calls,\u201d Rus said. The researchers dubbed their catalog of sound combinations a \u201cphonetic alphabet\u201d for sperm whales, comparing variations in the whales\u2019 click sequences to the production of different phonetic sounds in human speech. But while the team\u2019s findings are interesting, that term offers a misleading perspective on whales\u2019 vocal interactions, said Dr. Luke Rendell, a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in the United Kingdom whose work focuses on communication in marine mammals, in an email. \u201cThe presentation of the \u2018phonetic alphabet\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s nothing of the sort,\u201d said Rendell, who was not involved in the research. \u201cThe way the tempo variation is used is completely different to how, say, we use elements of an alphabet to construct linguistic expression,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of that, and it\u2019s not a super helpful interpretation because it forces everything into a restricted and somewhat over-sold perspective of \u2018is it like human language or not,\u2019 when there are a much broader range of interpretations available.\u201d Pattern recognition Sperm whales produce their clicks by forcing air through an organ in their heads called the spermaceti, and these sounds can be as loud as 230 decibels \u2014 louder than a rocket launch and capable of rupturing human eardrums \u2014 another team of scientists previously reported in the journal Scientific Reports. For the new study, the researchers used machine learning to detect patterns in audio data collected by The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, a repository for observations of sperm whales that inhabit the Caribbean Sea. The recordings represented the voices of approximately 60 sperm whales \u2014 a subset of a group of about 400 whales known as the Eastern Caribbean clan \u2014 and the vocalizations were recorded between 2005 and 2018. Prior research had identified 150 types of codas in sperm whales worldwide, but the Caribbean whales used just 21 of those codas. The scientists examined the timing and frequency of 8,719 coda sequences\u00a0\u2014 in solitary whale utterances, in choruses and in call-and-response exchanges between whales. When visualized with artificial intelligence, previously unseen coda patterns emerged. The study authors defined four features in codas: rhythm, tempo, rubato\u00a0and ornamentation. Rhythm describes the sequence of intervals between clicks. Tempo is the duration of the entire coda. Rubato refers to variations in duration across adjacent codas of the same rhythm and tempo. And ornamentation is an \u201cextra click\u201d added at the end of a coda in a group of shorter codas, Rus explained. These so-called ornament clicks \u201coccur more towards the beginning and end of turns\u201d during vocal exchanges between whales, \u201cbehaving like discourse markers,\u201d Rus said. The discovery that whales could synchronize variations in coda tempo was \u201ca really interesting observation,\u201d\u00a0Rendell said. \u201cI am less convinced by the \u2018ornamentation,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cIt occurs very rarely, and I think we need more evidence that they aren\u2019t just production glitches,\u201d or filler sounds, \u201clike when we say \u2018um\u2019 or \u2018err.\u2019\u201d In all, the program detected 18 types of rhythm, five types of tempo, three types of rubato and two types of ornamentation. These coda features could all be mixed and matched to form an \u201cenormous repertoire\u201d of phrases, the study authors reported. What\u2019s more, meaning could be tweaked even further depending on the placement of a coda \u2014 following or overlapping other codas \u2014 within an exchange or chorus involving two or more whales. Interactive experimentation \u201cActually, many of us have been waiting for advanced technology to allow us to do something like this for decades!\u201d said Dr. Brenda McCowan, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, in an email. McCowan, who was not involved in the research, was part of another team that, in 2021,\u00a0conducted an interactive \u201cconversation\u201d with a humpback whale in waters near Alaska. For about 20 minutes, a curious whale repeatedly responded to a recording of a humpback song transmitted from the scientists\u2019 boat. \u201cThis particular playback (with the humpback in 2021) was an opportunistic experiment with an inquisitive whale engaging us both behaviorally and vocally, and completely at her own volition,\u201d McCowan said. Such interactive experimentation with whales, along with observations of whale behavior, could be an important part of unraveling the syntax of sperm whale click sequences, the authors wrote in the study. Their machine learning method may also prove useful for studying other types of animal vocalizations, McCowan added. \u201cTempo, rhythm, rubato and ornamentation are likely to be found in other species of whales,\u201d McCowan said. \u201cWe already know this is true of humpback song. But there is also evidence for this type of patterning in other aquatic, terrestrial and arboreal species to which this approach could be applied.\u201d But although this technique is helpful for identifying certain aspects of communication, it\u2019s no Rosetta stone, Rendell cautioned. \u201cMachine learning is great for finding patterns in large datasets,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t create meaning.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/world/whale-communication-coda-alphabet-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_13_europe_russia-putin-reshuffle-shoigu-belousov-intl", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s weekend government shakeup appears to be the triumph of competence over loyalty: The Kremlin leader has replaced his camping-and-fishing buddy head of the country\u2019s\u00a0defense\u00a0ministry\u00a0with\u00a0someone widely seen as a competent technocrat. That, at least, seems to be the immediate takeway after the Kremlin announced that Andrey Belousov, a civilian economist and former first deputy prime minister, would take over the top slot at the Russian Ministry\u00a0of Defense\u00a0from\u00a0Sergei Shoigu, who had served in the post since 2012. Alexandra Prokopenko, a former adviser at Russia\u2019s Central Bank, put the shakeup down to the growing interrelationship between the war and Russia\u2019s economy. \u201cPutin\u2019s priority is war; war of attrition is won by economics,\u201d Prokopenko wrote in a thread on X. \u201cBelousov is in favor of stimulating demand from the budget, which means that military spending will at least not decrease but rather increase.\u201d Such a move makes sense when one views the war in Ukraine as a contest between the defense manufacturers of the West, which supplies Ukraine with ammunition and military hardware, and those of Russia. US and NATO officials already concede that Russia is massively outproducing the West when it comes to production of artillery ammunition:\u00a0NATO intelligence estimates of Russian defense production shared with CNN indicate that Russia produces roughly\u00a0three times more artillery shells per year\u00a0than the US and Europe for Ukraine. Having a competent economic manager at the top of the defense ministry can be an asset for Putin, especially when the US Congress has finally turned on the taps of more military aid to Ukraine and\u00a0as\u00a0Russia\u00a0presses\u00a0forward with a new advance along Ukraine\u2019s northeastern border. Whether that advance represents a new front for Russia or an effort to divert Ukrainian forces remains unclear, but it puts more pressure on Kyiv as its allies rush to deliver more weaponry. The appointment of Belousov could also represent house-cleaning at the Ministry of Defense. In recent weeks, the ministry has been hit by a corruption scandal that led to the sacking and arrest of a former deputy to Shoigu. A game of musical chairs Prokopenko,\u00a0who is one of the most perceptive observers of the Russian economy, described Belousov as \u201cwell-versed in military-industrial complex matters\u201d in her thread on X,\u00a0adding that\u00a0he \u201cembodies\u00a0Stolypin-esque statesmanship,\u201d a reference to the reformist Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin, who led an effort to overhaul and modernize Russia\u2019s inefficient economy after its humiliating military defeat by Japan in 1905. But the reality may be more complex. Putin has shifted Shoigu sideways to a post as the secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council, meaning that Shoigu is not completely out of the picture. Discussing Shoigu\u2019s new appointment, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the former defense minister would remain immersed in matters of military production.\u00a0But\u00a0competent management of the wartime economy\u00a0is now\u00a0key: Peskov noted that defense spending is approaching 7% of Russian GDP, close to the level seen in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, when military priorities and central planning strangled the consumer economy and stifled technological innovation. \u201cToday on the battlefield, the winner is the one who is more open to innovation,\u201d\u00a0Peskov said in\u00a0a call with reporters\u00a0Sunday.\u00a0\u201cAnd therefore, it is natural that at the current stage, the president decided that the Russian Ministry of Defense should be headed by a civilian.\u201d The appointment of a civilian to the defense ministry, then, does not signal a less hawkish approach to the war in Ukraine. General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia\u2019s General Staff and one of the architects of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, remains in place. The top echelons of power remain committed to Putin\u2019s brand of personalistic rule \u2014 and Putin\u2019s goal of subjugating Ukraine. Nevertheless, the newest government shakeup does hint at a\u00a0potential future\u00a0power struggle among Russia\u2019s\u00a0elite. With Shoigu\u2019s new appointment, Nikolai\u00a0Patrushev, the previous\u00a0Secretary of the Security Council, was relieved of his position and is \u201cdue to a transfer to another job,\u201d according to Peskov. Patrushev represents a class known as the\u00a0siloviki\u00a0\u2014 the men of power who graduated from the ranks of the Soviet security services. A former head of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, Patrushev has been one of the more hardline members of Putin\u2019s inner circle. And the Patrushev family name has often come up in speculation about who\u00a0may be\u00a0next in line\u00a0to\u00a0the throne after Putin dies \u2014 because, as the Russian president begins a fifth term of office, smart money has him staying on as president-for-life. Putin has no clear successor (if he dies or is incapacitated while in office, his duties will be assumed temporarily by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin), but Kremlin-watchers keep a running list of potential aspirants for a successor. Dmitry Patrushev, the son of the former security council chief, is sometimes described as one of the \u201cprincelings\u201d who are waiting; the younger Patrushev was just made a deputy prime minister in the latest reshuffle. Despite the changes at the top,\u00a0there is no sense that the overall goals\u00a0of the Kremlin \u2014 pursuing the war on Ukraine and continuing a confrontation with the West \u2014\u00a0have changed. \u201cPutin\u2019s primary objective is to enhance the state\u2019s capacity to support military needs more effectively, while most elements of the existing \u2018structure\u2019 will stay intact,\u201d wrote political observer Tatiana Stanovaya, the founder and CEO of the analytical group R.Politik, on X.

The design was upcycled from vintage Chanel scarves by stylist Logan Horne, whose brand, J. Logan Home, specializes in refashioning heritage luxury accessories. His pieces, which retail at close to $3,000 each, have also been worn by the musicians Dua Lipa and 2 Chainz and are sold at stores including Farfetch, Kith and The Webster. They\u2019ve also caught the attention of the French luxury giant\u2019s legal department. In February, lawyers acting for Chanel sent Horne a cease and desist letter, demanding his label stop selling products bearing its logo and other brand signifiers. It\u2019s the latest in a flurry of cases that have turned upcycling into an emerging legal battle ground, pitting a practice that\u2019s been pitched as key to improving the industry\u2019s sustainability credentials against the established bounds of trademark protection. \u201cWe really have these two values that point in different directions,\u201d said Fashion Law Institute founder Susan Scafidi. \u201c(Upcycling) is absolutely risky, despite the fact that it is trending and ethical.\u201d Why is upcycling controversial?

It\u2019s a tension that has played out prominently over the last decade thanks to the rapid rise of online resale platforms. Though some brands have begun to tentatively embrace the space, others have remained cautious. Chanel, in particular, has pursued high-profile cases against re-commerce players it argues are using its brand without permission and selling fakes. (The brand scored a major win earlier this year, when a New York court awarded it $4 million in damages in its suit against the resale business What Goes Around Comes Around. A separate legal dispute with The RealReal is ongoing.) Smaller-scale upcycling has attracted less attention so far. But the practice has become more widespread, driven in part by demand for logo-heavy streetwear, greater access to vintage products and deadstock fabrics and a growing desire among young designers to operate sustainably. That\u2019s given rise to an increasing number of trademark and copyright infringement complaints targeting upcyclers from brands including Louis Vuitton and Levi\u2019s, as well as Chanel. In 2022, Louis Vuitton secured a $603,000 pay out and permanent injunction in a Texas case against a business selling refashioned Vuitton products. Last year, Levi\u2019s brought a complaint against French label Coperni, alleging it was using pocket stitching and fabric tabs confusingly similar to the famed denim label. The sale of such products, alongside items that had actually been upcycled from Levi\u2019s jeans without authorization, created additional risk of consumer confusion, the company argued. Both brands declined to comment when reached by Business of Fashion. Does upcycling infringe on brands\u2019 trademarks? The disputes reflect legitimate trademark and copyright concerns, but they also raise questions over how far these protections should stretch when they conflict with broader sustainability goals, according to legal experts. \u201cIt is a grey area within the law,\u201d said Scafidi. \u201cBrands absolutely have a legal leg to stand on. The question is how well-clad it is.\u201d In general terms, once a brand has sold an item, it becomes fair game to be resold or redistributed by third parties. But this principle, known as the first-sale doctrine or trademark exhaustion, may not apply if an item has been reworked or embellished, lawyers said. Upcyclers can take precautions, like avoiding the prominent use of logos, or providing consumers with clear disclosures that reworked products are not authorized or affiliated with the brands they reference (an approach J. Logan Home adopted). But these steps still may not be sufficient to counter arguments of copyright or trademark infringement, according to lawyers. And while the legal frameworks protecting companies\u2019 intellectual property are well established, whether the sustainability benefits of upcycling should be weighed against these hasn\u2019t really been tested. \u201cIf we want to move from a linear to a circular economy, we need to upcycle,\u201d said Irene Calboli, a professor of law at Texas A&M University. \u201cThe fact that intellectual property law gets in the way of those who want to upcycle or recycle is just wrong.\u201d Chanel said it is paying close attention to sustainability matters, pointing to its work with L\u2019Atelier des Mati\u00e8res, which recycles unsold items and deadstock from luxury and premium brands. \u201c(Upcycling is) a positive trend that we continue to explore, and we have always been conscious of the need to strike a balance between protecting the rights of our brand and the rights of others to create and trade freely,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cHowever, the use of elements stamped with the Chanel logo is sometimes simply an unauthorized misappropriation of our trademarks\u2026 in such cases, we take the action we deem appropriate to protect our rights.\u201d The wider legal crackdown hasn\u2019t only targeted brands making prominent use of logos either. Before she became a celebrated New York designer, Batsheva Hay worked as a copyright lawyer. So it was a shock when she found herself on the receiving end of a cease and desist letter from a large commercial brand over a short run of dresses made from deadstock fabric sourced from India. Though it bore no obvious logo, as it turned out, the print she used had been made for a bigger player who didn\u2019t want to see it reproduced elsewhere. \u201cI was really humiliated and horrified because I thought it was some cool vintage fruit print and it turned out to be some kind of junky commercial print,\u201d said Hay. Rather than take on the time and expense of fighting the case, she just took the remaining three dresses she hadn\u2019t yet sold off her site. What does this mean for the future of upcycling? Horne says he can\u2019t afford to fight Chanel, which has threatened to seek statutory damages of $2 million per mark, disgorgement of all profits and payment of its attorney\u2019s fees if he doesn\u2019t stop selling products carrying the company\u2019s branding, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by Business of Fashion. Instead, he said he\u2019s looking at to pivot his brand while continuing to find creative ways to address the industry\u2019s issues with waste and over-production. The dream would be an opportunity to officially collaborate with an established label on an upcycled collection. \u201cAs much as I believe in my mission\u2026 I\u2019m not trying to go bankrupt going to battle with Chanel,\u201d he said. Industry watchers say the current flurry of cases reflect a broader adjustment to emerging new models. Some big brands, like Prada, Gucci and indeed Levi\u2019s, have already dabbled with upcycling collections and programs of their own. Anna Foster, who runs the refashioned brand E.L.V. Denim, has partnered with companies including Gabriela Hearst and The Outnet to help upcycle excess inventory. These days, she says she\u2019s having about a conversation a week with brands interested in exploring collaboration, but the industry moves slowly. Meanwhile, politics may be moving at a faster speed, creating different challenges for brands. Both consumers and policy makers are increasingly aware of the huge levels of waste generated by the fashion industry, with new regulations that would make brands more responsible for dealing with old clothes and excess inventory in the pipeline in both Europe and the US. \u201cWe really are at an inflection point where we might have a result in court that is different from the result in the court of social media,\u201d said Scafidi. \u201cIt\u2019s that tension that really needs to be resolved.\u201d This article was originally published by\u00a0The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

{"id": "2024_05_13_sport_rory-mcilroy-wells-fargo-championship-win-spt-intl", "text": "After a week buzzing with outside noise, Rory McIlroy let his clubs do the talking on Sunday. The Northern Irishman mounted a magnificent, final-round charge to power to his fourth career Wells Fargo Championship, finishing five shots ahead of American Xander Schauffele on 17-under overall at Quail Hollow in North Carolina. McIlroy had trailed world No. 3 Schauffele by two strokes after seven holes but tore away from the overnight leader down the stretch, carding four birdies and two eagles in a dazzling eight-hole run. Even with a closing double bogey, McIlroy\u2019s six-under 65 was still the best score of the day, easily enough to secure his 26th PGA Tour crown and a second in a row after triumph at the Zurich Classic alongside fellow Irishman Shane Lowry last month. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s more unbelievable, winning a PGA Tour event for the fourth time or getting my 26th,\u201d McIlroy \u2013 who previously won the event in 2010, 2015 and 2021 \u2013 told reporters. \u201cWhenever I hit some of these milestones or do these things, I always think back to 20-year-old me playing in this tournament for the first time. If I had known back then that this is the way everything was going to pan out, I probably wouldn\u2019t have believed you.\u201d \u2018No strain\u2019 with Woods McIlroy had made headlines after his first round on Wednesday, revealing that he would not be returning to the PGA Tour policy board. The world No. 2 said a potential comeback had been dashed following \u201cpretty complicated and messy\u201d conversations, adding that some of the current board were \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with him reclaiming the position he left after two years in November. Tiger Woods is one of six player directors on the current board, having\u00a0joined\u00a0last August. Woods and McIlroy are longtime friends as well as business partners, having teamed up to launch the TGL, a high-tech indoor golf venture that has been postponed until 2025 after its inflatable dome venue collapsed. McIlroy brushed off any suggestion of a soured relationship with the 15-time major winner, adding that he had a seat on the \u201ctransaction subcommittee\u201d attempting to strike a deal with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which funds LIV Golf. \u201cI think friends can have disagreements or not see eye to eye on things \u2026 I think that\u2019s fine,\u201d McIlroy said Thursday when asked if his relationship with Woods had been strained. \u201cWe had a really good talk last Friday for 45 minutes just about a lot of different things. There\u2019s no strain there. I think we might see the future of golf a little bit differently, but I don\u2019t think that should place any strain on a relationship or on a friendship.\u201d \u2018It feels like the stars are aligning\u2019 A second straight victory, which secured a $3.6 million winner\u2019s cut of a $20 million prize purse, increases McIlroy\u2019s momentum ahead of the PGA Championship next week. The 35-year-old is a four-time major champion and has played some of his best golf in recent years, but is now into his 10th year without a major win despite 20 top-10 finishes in that time. Buoyed by his recent form, McIlroy heads to Valhalla Golf Club in Kentucky chasing his third PGA Championship title at the site of his last major triumph. \u201cI really got some confidence from New Orleans, winning with Shane,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cComing into this week at a golf course that I\u2019m comfortable at, my golf swing feels a lot more comfortable than it has. So going to a venue next week where I\u2019ve won, it feels like the stars are aligning a little bit. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a lot of golf to play and a lot of great players to try to beat next week. Going into the next major of the year feeling really good about myself.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/sport/rory-mcilroy-wells-fargo-championship-win-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was \u201cway too soon\u201d to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building\u2019s cultural heritage \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d The B\u00f8rsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning \u201cviolently\u201d inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it.

{"id": "2024_05_08_uk_garrick-club-votes-women-gbr-intl-scli", "text": "A London members club formed in 1831 has voted to let women join for the first time, after coming under scrutiny for its exclusionary policy in recent weeks. Members of the Garrick Club, in London\u2019s West End, gathered Tuesday to debate admitting women to the club, the BBC and the Guardian reported. A vote among almost 1,000 members passed by 60% to 40%, according to the Guardian, which sparked discussion of the club\u2019s men-only policy when it published a list of dozens of members, including influential figures from the British establishment, on March 18. King Charles III is one notable member, according to the paper, as are dozens of lawmakers, leading lawyers and theater directors, producers and actors, the majority of whom are White and aged over 50. The publication of the list shone a spotlight on how women continued to be excluded, leading to the resignation of a handful of members and threats from others that they, too, would leave if women were not admitted. Despite the vote, it may be some time before the first woman joins: The admissions process involves nominations by existing members and discussions among committee members, who are able to blackball anyone considered unsuitable. CNN has contacted the Garrick Club for comment. Located in Covent Garden, the club is named after the celebrated 18th-century actor-manager David Garrick. \u201cAttracted by the combination of the traditions of the eighteenth century literary society with the advantages of a well-run dining and social club, the first members of the Garrick were a sophisticated and cosmopolitan group that included twenty-four peers of the realm as well as writers, actors, musicians and publishers,\u201d the club\u2019s website reads. The club, which has around 1,300 members, boasts a coffee room, morning room, card room, billiards room, reading room, members\u2019 computer room and roof terrace, as well as 17 bedrooms, a members\u2019 lounge and a number of private rooms that can be booked for group events. It is also home to a theatrical library of around 1,000 items. Men must wear jackets and collared shirts while in the club, with ties required if lunching or dining in the coffee room, apart from for those who arrive after 9.30 p.m. for after-theater supper, according to the website. \u201cLadies may wear trousers but not jeans,\u201d it adds. \u201cNo denim, trainers or gym shoes are allowed.\u201d According to its website, \u201cThe original assurance of the committee, \u2018that it would be better that ten unobjectionable men should be excluded than one terrible bore should be admitted,\u2019 ensures that the lively atmosphere for which the Club was so well-known in the nineteenth century continues to invigorate members of the Club in the twenty-first century.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/uk/garrick-club-votes-women-gbr-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_middleeast_death-toll-gaza-fatalities-un-intl-latam", "text": "The United Nations on Monday clarified that the overall number of fatalities in Gaza tallied by the Ministry of Health in Gaza remains unchanged, at more than 35,000, since the war broke out between Israel and Hamas on October 7. The clarification comes after the UN humanitarian agency OCHA (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) published a report on May 8 with revised data regarding the number of Palestinian casualties in the war. The UN agency in its report reduced the number of women and children believed to have been killed in the war by nearly half. The number was reduced because the UN says it is now relying on the number of deceased women and children whose names and other identifying details have been fully documented, rather than the total number of women and children killed. The ministry says bodies that arrive at hospitals get counted in the overall death count. UN spokesperson Farhan Haq told a daily briefing at the UN that the health ministry in Gaza recently published two separate death tolls \u2013 an overall death toll and a total number of identified fatalities. In the UN report, only the total number of fatalities whose identities (such as name and date of birth) have been documented was published, leading to confusion. According to Haq, the ministry published a breakdown for 24,686 fully identified deaths out of the total 34,622 fatalities recorded in Gaza as of April 30. The fully identified death toll comprises of 7,797 children, 4,959 women, 1,924 elderly, and 10,006 men, the UN spokesperson said, citing the Gaza health ministry. The health authority in Gaza noted that the documentation process of casualties\u2019 full identification details is still ongoing, Haq added. Two officials from the Palestinian Ministry of Health have told CNN that although the ministry keeps a separate death toll for identified and unidentified individuals, the total number of people killed remains unchanged. The total number of dead also does not include the approximately 10,000 people who are still missing and trapped under the rubble, the officials added. Israel launched its military assault on Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people in Israel and abducted more than 250 others. Israel\u2019s months-long siege of the Palestinian enclave has since pulverized large parts of Gaza and drastically diminished critical supplies, exposing the entire population of more than 2.2 million people to the risk\u00a0of famine. CNN has seen a daily report from the Palestinian health ministry which matches the number OCHA published in the revised version. A total of 15,103 children and 9,961 women have been killed in Gaza since October 7, the Gaza ministry of health said in its latest report. Both the UN and US officials have previously appraised the figures from the Ministry of Health in Gaza as credible.  CNN cannot independently verify the ministry\u2019s numbers. The ministry does not distinguish between casualties among fighters and civilians.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/middleeast/death-toll-gaza-fatalities-un-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_07_tech_apple-unveils-new-ipad-lineup", "text": "Apple is hoping its latest iPad lineup will breathe new life into its sluggish tablet market. In a pre-recorded live streamed event from its Cupertino, California headquarters, the company introduced the latest versions of its iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets, and an all-new Apple Pencil Pro. CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday\u2019s announcement marked \u201cthe biggest day for iPad since its introduction.\u201d At the heart of the new iPad Pro is Apple\u2019s new custom M4 processor, which delivers 4 times the performance as its existing iPad Pro models. Considering Apple\u2019s latest MacBook lineup currently runs on the M3 chip, this is, as Cook put it, an \u201coutrageously powerful chip for AI.\u201d The company is expected to show off its first batch of AI-tools for the iPhone and iPad at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. The latest iPad Pro comes in two sizes: 11 inches and 13 inches. Apple said the 11-inch model is its thinnest yet, at 5.1 mm, and less than a pound. The display combines two OLED panels to maximize brightness. The iPad Pro comes in two finishes, silver and space black. Meanwhile, the iPad Air, for the first time, comes in the same two sizes: an 11-inch ($599) and 13-inch ($799) design. The bigger size, inspired by the iPad Pro with a larger screen, has 30% more screen real estate than the 11-inch display. The iPad Air is powered by Apple\u2019s custom M2 processor with faster GPU and neural engine that\u2019s 50% faster than the previous iPad Air. The company said it better supports AI-powered software. It also features a front-facing landscape camera. Meanwhile, an upgraded Apple Pencil ($129) comes with a new squeeze function that allows users to bring up tools, customize drawing layers of what they\u2019re working on and includes haptic feedback. It also supports Find My to locate the pencil when it inevitably goes missing. Apple also showed off a redesigned Magic Keyboard with a haptic trackpad to make the iPad more like a laptop. Some key apps, including Final Cut, also received substantial upgrades, including the ability to add AI-based audio or edit with AI. The new iPad lineup is available for pre-order starting Tuesday and in stores next week. The event comes just days after Apple reported its iPad revenue of $5.6 billion for its latest quarter, down 17% year over year. However, the company said it expects its iPad business to grow in double digits for the June quarter. Apple also reported last week a first-quarter revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% year over year, as the tech giant continues to struggle with growth challenges, particularly in China, amid an uncertain economic environment. It announced a $110 billion share buyback \u2013 the largest in the company\u2019s history \u2013 as iPhones sales declined 10%. Ben Wood, a chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight, said the unexpected introduction of the iPad Pro\u2019s new M4 chip and its significant performance jumps may be enough to ignite some excitement among consumers. \u201cWhile these new iPads are unlikely to return the category to growth immediately, they represent a much-needed reason to upgrade for customers with aging products,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emphasis on artificial intelligence was palpable with Apple determined to seize back the initiative in this area given the huge focus on this topic by all its rivals over the last 18 months.\u201d On the earnings call last week, Cook teased that generative AI tools could be coming to Apple products in the \u201cweeks ahead,\u201d at a time when it\u2019s currently behind competitors. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/tech/apple-unveils-new-ipad-lineup/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror \u2014 the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In the May issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has been reported as a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. \u201cI think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 \u2014 so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.\u201d she told AD. \u201cI have a picture of the day we moved in\u2026 I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.\u201d The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts\u2019 \u201cMadame Web\u201d co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. \u201cWe want a house to look like it\u2019s been there for 50 years,\u201d Pierce told AD in the cover story. \u201cWe never want a home to look new.\u201d In that spirit, much of Roberts\u2019 furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts\u2019 most treasured artworks \u2014 a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette \u2014 hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don\u2019t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. \u201cI remember as a kid, whatever\u2019s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,\u201d Roberts explained. \u201cSo I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/16/style/emma-roberts-la-home-architectural-digest/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_africa_meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam", "text": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex embarked on what was officially dubbed a 3-day private visit to Nigeria, yet it unfolded with all the grandeur and attention typically reserved for royal tours. Their first day saw them receive a red-carpet welcome complete with cultural dancers following their arrival in the Nigerian capital\u00a0of\u00a0Abuja, where they kicked off a multi-day mental health summit at Lightway Academy. There, they also unveiled a partnership between their Archewell Foundation and the\u00a0GEANCO Foundation to provide students with school supplies and menstrual products. The pair had been invited to the West African nation by the country\u2019s highest-ranking military official, Christopher Musa. After meeting him at the\u00a0Nigerian Defence Headquarters, Meghan signed a guest book thanking officials for \u201cwelcoming me home.\u201d Despite the private nature of their visit, the couple\u2019s itinerary resembled previous official tours they carried out before stepping back as senior working royals in 2020. They were warmly received everywhere they went, with Nigerians showcasing their famed hospitality. The couple were showered with gifts, including\u00a0a touching portrait of a young Harry with his mum. For both Nigeria and the Sussexes, this visit held significant weight. It was an opportunity for Nigeria to demonstrate its capability to host such high-profile guests and dispel any doubts raised by skeptics, especially considering the country\u2019s standing in the eyes of the UK\u2019s Foreign Office as one of the most dangerous countries to visit in the world. Nigeria has security issues with a terrorist insurgency in the northeast and northwest.\u00a0However, it is a huge country \u2014\u00a0 larger than the US state of Texas\u00a0 \u2014 and the other areas\u00a0visited by the royal couple over the past several days are relatively safe. Meanwhile, for Prince Harry and Meghan, this marked their first major trip to Africa since relinquishing\u00a0their official royal duties. It was a chance for them to engage in a hearts-and-minds charm offensive, which they executed with aplomb. Meghan, in particular, embraced exploring her Nigerian ancestry\u00a0after discovering several years ago\u00a0that she is 43% Nigerian\u00a0through a genealogy test. On Saturday, she co-hosted a women\u2019s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, for about 50 leading women from across Nigerian society and politics, business, media, and culture. During a panel discussion, moderated by Nigerian media mogul Mo Abudu, the duchess\u00a0spoke passionately about uncovering\u00a0her Nigerian roots and its significance to her own identity. She described Nigeria as \u201cmy country,\u201d adding\u00a0that \u201cbeing African American, part of it is not knowing so much about your lineage or background, where you come from specifically. And it was exciting \u2026 to discover more and understand what that really means.\u201d It was here that Meghan\u2019s natural ability to connect really shone through. She chatted\u00a0effortlessly with attendees, posed\u00a0for selfies and engaged\u00a0in heartfelt conversations. At another event on Sunday at the prestigious Delborough Hotel in Lagos\u00a0- where the great and good of Nigerian society had gathered to welcome the coupl\u00a0- \u00a0she appeared visibly moved when three powerful traditional rulers honored her with royal titles. The Obi of Onitsha, His Majesty Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Ugochukwu Achebe christened Meghan \u201cAda Mazi,\u201d which means \u201cthe daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace.\u201d While, the Oluwo of Iwoland, southwest, Nigeria,\u00a0Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi christened her with the Yoruba name of \u201cAdetokunbo\u201d which means \u201croyalty from across the seas.\u201d Their engagements during the three-day visit were centered around their core passions:\u00a0sports rehabilitation,\u00a0mental health, and women\u2019s empowerment. For Harry\u2019s part, the duke\u00a0demonstrated his compassion and connection to his late mother, Princess Diana, as he visited wounded soldiers at a military hospital in Kaduna, 150 miles from Abuja. His first stop was to drop in on the governor of Kaduna state, Senator Uba Sani, where he was again welcomed by a troupe of dancers and a red carpet.\u00a0Governor Sani sat opposite him and praised Harry as a \u201csymbol of courage and \u201cpraised his service to his country.\u201d He added, \u201cPlease give our regards to the Duchess of Sussex, Princess Meghan.\u201d Harry toured about six wards and met young men recuperating from their injuries. Many had been shot, ambushed by Boko Haram or lost limbs due to blasts. One moment captured by a photographer showing Harry holding a wounded soldier lying on the hospital bed during the visit resonated deeply and went viral on social media. Corporal Yusef, 23, who had been shot through the knee, spoke with the duke, who\u00a0asked him about his rehab. \u201cAre you going to try for the Invictus Games team? Are you preparing for that?\u2026 We will see you there,\u201d Harry suggested. Their visit also extended to cultural experiences, such as witnessing a vibrant dance performance and a polo match at the historic Lagos Polo Club. Polo holds special significance for Harry and the event provided a platform to showcase his longstanding commitment to the sport and its charitable endeavors. Amid the festivities, the couple expressed gratitude for Nigeria\u2019s warm reception.\u00a0As they bid farewell to Nigeria, Meghan declared: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to come back!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/africa/meghan-nigeria-tour-int-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_world_solar-flares-storms-cme-auroras-scn", "text": "A series of solar flares and coronal mass ejections from the sun have the potential to create dazzling auroras that may be seen as far south as Alabama and Northern California but also disrupt communications on Earth tonight and over the weekend, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center. The center, which is a division of the National Weather Service, observed conditions of an extreme geomagnetic storm at 6:54 p.m. ET on Friday evening, reaching a level 5 out of 5 severity. The last time a solar storm of this magnitude reached Earth was in October 2003, resulting in power outages in Sweden and damaged power transformers in South Africa, according to the center. Signs of a severe geomagnetic storm, or level 4, were first observed by scientists at the center at 12:37 p.m. ET, when a major disturbance was detected in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Previously, the center issued a geomagnetic storm watch on Thursday evening, the first such watch issued since January 2005. But the forecast was upgraded after scientists observed G5, or extreme geomagnetic storm, conditions Friday evening. As the sun nears the peak of activity in its 11-year cycle, known as solar maximum, later this year, researchers have observed increasingly intense solar flares erupting from the fiery orb. Increased solar activity causes auroras that dance around Earth\u2019s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky. The Space Weather Prediction Center tracked multiple strong flares emitting from a large cluster of sunspots on the solar surface since Wednesday. The cluster is 17 times the diameter of Earth. Scientists also observed at least seven coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, releasing from the sun in the direction of Earth. These significant outbursts are expected to continue through Sunday. The center\u2019s space weather scale covers three categories: solar flares that cause high-frequency radio blackouts, geomagnetic storms and solar radiation storms. The current solar activity is capable of producing a solar radiation storm, according to Shawn Dahl, the service coordinator for the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201cThat\u2019s the very low end of our scale,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cIt does mean things to some rocket launch operations and satellite operators. But at this point in time, it\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be handled as far as we understand it. The potential for stronger events of course does exist and we\u2019ll see if any materialize.\u201d The peak of the geomagnetic storm activity for Earth could occur between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. ET on Saturday, the center has forecasted. The center referred to this as \u201can unusual event.\u201d There have been three geomagnetic storms since December 2019, but all of them have been considered weak, according to the center. Geomagnetic storms driven by the sun in recent months have caused auroras to be visible in places where they are rarely seen, including as far south as New Mexico, Missouri, North Carolina and California in the United States, and the southeast of England and other parts of the United Kingdom. The solar storm caused a dazzling aurora australis to light up the sky over New Zealand around 6:20 a.m. local time. Depending on the location, the auroras may not always be visible overhead, but keep an eye on the horizon, experts say, because they may create a colorful display there as well. Even if auroras aren\u2019t visible in the sky, experts at the center recommend taking images of the sky with your phone because the images may capture what you can\u2019t see with the naked eye. \u201cA severe storm would mean that the aurora will likely be visible in southern Michigan,\u201d said Michael Liemohn, a professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, in a statement. \u201cGet away from city lights to a place with clear skies and you should be able to see the green or red glow of aurora across the sky.\u201d The effects of geomagnetic storms When coronal mass ejections are directed at Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of Earth\u2019s magnetic field. \u201cGeomagnetic storms can impact infrastructure in near-Earth orbit and on Earth\u2019s surface, potentially disrupting communications, the electric power grid, navigation, radio and satellite operations,\u201d according to the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201c(The center) has notified the operators of these systems so they can take protective action.\u201d The center has notified operators in these areas to take action to mitigate the potential for any impacts, which include the possibility of increased and more frequent voltage control problems. Other aspects operators will monitor include a chance of anomalies or impacts to satellite operations and frequent or longer periods of GPS degradation. In turn, the operators also make sure power lines are performing as expected, ensure that alternate equipment is available and functioning, and any maintenance is suspended, Dahl said. \u201cBut the key element here is that they know what\u2019s causing anything if the situation unfolds that will allow us to be able to take the proper steps to help mitigate and control any developing problems,\u201d Dahl said. When coronal mass ejections arrive, they carry their own magnetic field, which can overwhelm power lines and induce electrical currents, so operators will monitor for any signs of such activity, said Rob Steenburgh, space scientist at the Space Weather Prediction Center. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about impacts to the power grid, we\u2019re talking about the high voltage transmission lines. That\u2019s where these currents can develop. It\u2019s not on any line going from a small transformer to their home,\u201d Dahl said. \u201cIt\u2019s only really developing on the high voltage transmission lines, which creates problems for the major transformers that control distribution.\u201d Solar storms generated by the sun can also cause radio blackouts and even pose risks for crewed space missions. NASA\u2019s Space Radiation Analysis Group is dedicated to monitoring conditions for astronauts aboard the International Space Station. If there appears to be an increased radiation risk, the astronauts can move to parts of the station that are more well-shielded. \u201cNASA completed a thorough analysis of recent space weather activity and determined it posed no risk to the crew aboard the International Space Station and no additional precautionary measures are needed,\u201d according to an update released by the federal agency. \u201cThe current solar flare activity has not warranted these precautions. NASA will keep an eye on additional solar eruptions, called coronal mass ejections, coming toward Earth in the wake of the flares, but do not anticipate concern for the astronauts.\u201d The center warned that additional solar activity could cause geomagnetic storm conditions to be ongoing through the weekend. So far, researchers have obseverd only three severe geomagnetic storms during the current solar cycle, which began in December 2019, according to the center. Experts at the center say they are a \u201clittle concerned,\u201d but mainly because such events are rare. The team likened it to being prepared for a summer storm: Keep batteries and a weather radio on hand in the event of a power outage, but said that people don\u2019t need to \u201cdo anything out of the ordinary\u201d to prepare for space weather. No disruption to internet or cellphone service is expected. And any disruption to GPS is not expected to be prolonged, as long as providers can quickly lock back on to satellite signals, according to experts at the center. Tracking space weather Every 11 years or so, the sun experiences periods of low and high solar activity, which is associated with the amount of sunspots on its surface. The sun\u2019s strong and constantly shifting magnetic fields drive these dark regions, some of which can reach the size of Earth or larger. Over the course of a solar cycle, the sun will transition from a calm to an intense and active period. During the peak of activity, called solar maximum, the sun\u2019s magnetic poles flip. Then, the sun will grow quiet again during a solar minimum. Solar maximum is expected to peak through mid- to late 2024, but the sun will remain active for a couple of years afterward. Teams at the Space Weather Prediction Center use data from ground and space-based observatories, magnetic maps of the solar surface, and ultraviolet observations of the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere to determine when the sun is most likely to send out solar flares, coronal mass ejections and other space weather that could affect Earth. Solar flares can affect communications and GPS almost immediately because they disrupt Earth\u2019s ionosphere, or part of the upper atmosphere. Energetic particles released by the sun can also disrupt electronics on spacecraft and affect astronauts without proper protection within 20 minutes to several hours. The material sent speeding away from the sun during coronal mass ejections can arrive at Earth between 30 and 72 hours afterward, causing geomagnetic storms that affect satellites and create electrical currents in the upper atmosphere that travel through the ground and can have an impact on electric power grids. The storms also affect flight patterns of commercial airlines, which are instructed to stay away from Earth\u2019s poles during geomagnetic storms due to loss of communication or navigation capabilities. Extreme storms have occurred before, such as one that knocked out the power grid in Quebec in 1989 and the Carrington Event of 1859.The latter remains the most intense geomagnetic storm ever recorded, causing telegraph stations to spark and catch fire. If such an event were to occur today, it could cause trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage and bring down some power grids for a substantial amount of time.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/world/solar-flares-storms-cme-auroras-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_10_middleeast_israel-sde-teiman-detention-whistleblowers-intl-cmd", "text": "At a military base that now doubles as a detention center in Israel\u2019s Negev desert, an Israeli working at the facility snapped two photographs of a scene that he says continues to haunt him. Rows of men in gray tracksuits are seen sitting on paper-thin mattresses, ringfenced by barbed wire. All appear blindfolded, their heads hanging heavy under the glare of floodlights. A putrid stench filled the air and the room hummed with the men\u2019s murmurs, the Israeli who was at the facility told CNN. Forbidden from speaking to each other, the detainees mumbled to themselves. \u201cWe were told they were not allowed to move. They should sit upright. They\u2019re not allowed to talk. Not allowed to peek under their blindfold.\u201d Guards were instructed \u201cto scream uskot\u201d \u2013 shut up in Arabic \u2013 and told to \u201cpick people out that were problematic and punish them,\u201d the source added. CNN spoke to three Israeli whistleblowers who worked at the Sde Teiman desert camp, which holds Palestinians detained during Israel\u2019s invasion of Gaza. All spoke out at risk of legal repercussions and reprisals from groups supportive of Israel\u2019s hardline policies in Gaza. They paint a picture of a facility where doctors sometimes amputated prisoners\u2019 limbs due to injuries sustained from constant handcuffing; of medical procedures sometimes performed by underqualified medics earning it a reputation for being \u201ca paradise for interns\u201d; and where the air is filled with the smell of neglected wounds left to rot. According to the accounts,\u00a0the facility some 18 miles from the Gaza frontier is split into two parts: enclosures where around 70 Palestinian detainees from Gaza\u00a0are placed under extreme physical restraint, and a field hospital where wounded detainees are strapped to their beds, wearing diapers\u00a0and fed through straws. \u201cThey stripped them down of anything that resembles human beings,\u201d said one whistleblower, who worked as a medic at the facility\u2019s field hospital. \u201c(The beatings) were not done to gather intelligence. They were done out of revenge,\u201d said another whistleblower. \u201cIt was punishment for what they (the Palestinians) did on October 7 and punishment for behavior in the camp.\u201d Responding to CNN\u2019s request for comment on all the allegations made in this report, the Israeli military, known as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said in a statement: \u201cThe IDF ensures proper conduct towards the detainees in custody. Any allegation of misconduct by IDF soldiers is examined and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, MPCID (Military Police Criminal Investigation\u2019s Division) investigations are opened when there is suspicion of misconduct justifying such action.\u201d \u201cDetainees are handcuffed based on their risk level and health status. Incidents of unlawful handcuffing are not known to the authorities.\u201d The IDF did not directly deny accounts of people being stripped of their clothing or held in diapers. Instead, the Israeli military said that the detainees are given back their clothing once the IDF has determined that they pose no security risk. Reports of abuse\u00a0at Sde Teiman have already surfaced in Israeli and Arab media after an outcry from Israeli and Palestinian rights groups over conditions there. But this rare testimony from Israelis working at the facility sheds further light on Israel\u2019s conduct as it wages war in Gaza,\u00a0with fresh allegations of mistreatment.\u00a0It also casts more doubt on the Israeli government\u2019s repeated assertions that it acts in accordance with accepted international practices and law. CNN has requested permission from the Israeli military to access the Sde Teiman base. Last month, a CNN team covered a small protest outside its main gate staged by Israeli activists demanding the closure of the facility. Israeli security forces questioned the team for around 30 minutes there, demanding to see the footage taken by CNN\u2019s photojournalist. Israel often subjects reporters, even foreign journalists, to military censorship on security issues. Detained in the desert The Israeli military has acknowledged partially converting three different military facilities into detention camps for Palestinian detainees from Gaza since the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel, in which Israeli authorities say about 1,200 were killed and over 250 were abducted, and the subsequent Israeli offensive in Gaza, killing nearly 35,000 people according to the strip\u2019s health ministry. These facilities are Sde Teiman in the Negev desert, as well as Anatot and Ofer military bases\u00a0in the occupied West Bank. The camps are part of the infrastructure of Israel\u2019s Unlawful Combatants Law, an amended legislation passed by the Knesset last December that expanded the military\u2019s authority to detain suspected militants. The law permits the military to detain people for 45 days without an arrest warrant, after which they must be transferred to Israel\u2019s formal prison system (IPS), where over 9,000 Palestinians are being held in conditions that rights groups say have drastically deteriorated since October 7. Two Palestinian prisoners associations said last week that 18 Palestinians \u2013 including leading Gaza surgeon Dr. Adnan al-Bursh \u2013 had died in Israeli custody over the course of the war. The military detention camps \u2013 where the number of inmates is unknown \u2013 serve as a filtration point during the arrest period mandated by the Unlawful Combatants Law. After their detention in the camps, those with suspected Hamas links are transferred to the IPS, while those whose militant ties have been ruled out are released back to Gaza. CNN interviewed over a dozen former Gazan detainees who appeared to have been released from those camps. They said they could not determine where they were held because they were blindfolded through most of their detention and cut off from the outside world. But the details of their accounts tally with those of the whistleblowers. \u201cWe looked forward to the night so we could sleep. Then we looked forward to the morning in hopes that our situation might change,\u201d said Dr. Mohammed al-Ran, recalling his detainment at a military facility where he said he endured desert temperatures, swinging from the heat of the day to the chill of night.\u00a0CNN interviewed him outside Gaza last month. Al-Ran, a Palestinian who holds Bosnian citizenship, headed the surgical unit at northern Gaza\u2019s Indonesian hospital, one of the first to be shut down and raided as Israel carried out its aerial, ground and naval offensive. He was arrested on December 18, he said, outside Gaza City\u2019s Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital, where he had been working for three days after fleeing his hospital in the heavily bombarded north. He was stripped down to his underwear, blindfolded and his wrists tied, then dumped in the back of a truck where, he said, the near-naked detainees were piled on top of one another as they were shuttled to a detention camp in the middle of the desert. The details in his account are consistent with those of dozens of others collected by CNN recounting the conditions of arrest in Gaza. His account is also supported by numerous images depicting mass arrests published on social media profiles belonging to Israeli soldiers. Many of those images show captive Gazans, their wrists or ankles tied by cables, in their underwear and blindfolded. Al-Ran was held in a military detention center for 44 days, he told CNN. \u201cOur days were filled with prayer, tears, and supplication. This eased our agony,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cWe cried and cried and cried. We cried for ourselves, cried for our nation, cried for our community, cried for our loved ones. We cried about everything that crossed our minds.\u201d A week into his imprisonment, the detention camp\u2019s authorities ordered him to act as an intermediary between the guards and the prisoners, a role known as Shawish, \u201csupervisor,\u201d in vernacular Arabic. According to the Israeli whistleblowers, a Shawish is normally a prisoner who has been cleared of suspected links to Hamas after interrogation. The Israeli military denied holding detainees unnecessarily, or using them for translation purposes. \u201cIf there is no reason for continued detention, the detainees are released back to Gaza,\u201d they said in a statement. However, whistleblower and detainee accounts \u2013 particularly pertaining to Shawish \u2013 cast doubt on the IDF\u2019s depiction of its clearing process. Al-Ran says that he served as Shawish for several weeks after he was cleared of Hamas links. Whistleblowers also said that the absolved Shawish served as intermediaries for some time. They are typically proficient in Hebrew, according to the eyewitnesses, enabling them to communicate the guards\u2019 orders to the rest of the prisoners in Arabic. For that, al-Ran said he was given a special privilege: his blindfold was removed. He said this was another kind of hell. \u201cPart of my torture was being able to see how people were being tortured,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first you couldn\u2019t see. You couldn\u2019t see the torture, the vengeance, the oppression. \u201cWhen they removed my blindfold, I could see the extent of the humiliation and abasement \u2026 I could see the extent to which they saw us not as human beings but as animals.\u201d Al-Ran\u2019s account of the forms of punishment he saw were corroborated by the whistleblowers who spoke with CNN. A prisoner who committed an offense such as speaking to another would be ordered to raise his arms above his head for up to an hour. The prisoner\u2019s hands would sometimes be zip-tied to a fence to ensure that he did not come out of the stress position. For those who repeatedly breached the prohibition on speaking and moving, the punishment became more severe. Israeli guards would sometimes take a prisoner to an area outside the enclosure and beat him aggressively, according to two whistleblowers and al-Ran. A whistleblower who worked as a guard said he saw a man emerge from a beating with his teeth, and some bones, apparently broken. That whistleblower and al-Ran also described a routine search when the guards would unleash large dogs on sleeping detainees, lobbing a sound grenade at the enclosure as troops barged in. Al-Ran called this \u201cthe nightly torture.\u201d \u201cWhile we were cabled, they unleashed the dogs that would move between us, and trample over us,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cYou\u2019d be lying on your belly, your face pressed against the ground. You can\u2019t move, and they\u2019re moving above you.\u201d The same whistleblower recounted the search in the same harrowing detail. \u201cIt was a special unit of the military police that did the so-called search,\u201d said the source. \u201cBut really it was an excuse to hit them. It was a terrifying situation.\u201d \u201cThere was a lot of screaming and dogs barking.\u201d Strapped to beds in a field hospital Whistleblower accounts portrayed a different kind of horror at the Sde Teiman field hospital. \u201cWhat I felt when I was dealing with those patients is an idea of total vulnerability,\u201d said one medic who worked at Sde Teiman. \u201cIf you imagine yourself being unable to move, being unable to see what\u2019s going on, and being completely naked, that leaves you completely exposed,\u201d the source said.\u00a0 \u201cI think that\u2019s something that borders on, if not crosses to, psychological torture.\u201d Another whistleblower said he was ordered to perform medical procedures on the Palestinian detainees for which he was not qualified. \u201cI was asked to learn how to do things on the patients, performing minor medical procedures that are totally outside my expertise,\u201d he said, adding that this was frequently done without anesthesia. \u201cIf they complained about pain, they would be given paracetamol,\u201d he said, using another name for acetaminophen. \u201cJust being there felt like being complicit in abuse.\u201d The same whistleblower also said he witnessed an amputation performed on a man who had sustained injuries caused by the constant zip-tying of his wrists. The account tallied with details of\u00a0a letter authored by a doctor\u00a0working at Sde Teiman published by Ha\u2019aretz in April. \u201cFrom the first days of the medical facility\u2019s operation until today, I have faced serious ethical dilemmas,\u201d said the letter addressed to Israel\u2019s attorney general, and its health and defense ministries, according to Ha\u2019aretz. \u201cMore than that, I am writing (this letter) to warn you that the facilities\u2019 operations do not comply with a single section among those dealing with health in the Incarceration of Unlawful Combatants Law.\u201d An IDF spokesperson denied the allegations reported by Ha\u2019aretz in a written statement to CNN at the time, saying that medical procedures were conducted with \u201cextreme care\u201d and in accordance with Israeli and international law. The spokesperson added that the handcuffing of the detainees was done in \u201caccordance with procedures, their health condition and the level of danger posed by them,\u201d and that any allegation of violence would be examined. Whistleblowers also said that medical team were told to refrain from signing medical documents, corroborating previous reporting by rights group Physicians for Human Rights in Israel (PHRI). The PHRI report released in April warned of \u201ca serious concern that anonymity is employed to prevent the possibility of investigations or complaints regarding breaches of medical ethics and professionalism.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t sign anything, and there is no verification of authority,\u201d said the same whistleblower who said he lacked the appropriate training for the treatment he was asked to administer. \u201cIt is a paradise for interns because it\u2019s like you do whatever you want.\u201d CNN also requested comment from the Israeli health ministry on the allegations in this report. The ministry referred CNN back to the IDF. Concealed from the outside world Sde Teiman and other military detention camps have been shrouded in secrecy since their inception. Israel has repeatedly refused requests to disclose the number of detainees held at the facilities, or to reveal the whereabouts of Gazan prisoners. Last Wednesday, the Israeli Supreme Court held a hearing in response to a petition brought forward by Israeli rights group, HaMoked, to reveal the location of a Palestinian X-Ray technician detained from Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza in February. It was the first court session of its kind since October 7. Israel\u2019s highest court had previously rejected writs of habeas corpus filed on behalf of dozens of Palestinians from Gaza held in unknown locations. The disappearances \u201callows for the atrocities that we\u2019ve been hearing about to happen,\u201d said Tal Steiner, an Israeli human rights lawyer and executive director of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel. \u201cPeople completely disconnected from the outside world are the most vulnerable to torture and mistreatment,\u201d Steiner said in an interview with CNN. Satellite images provide further insight into activities at Sde Teiman, revealing that in the months since the start of the\u00a0Israel-Hamas war on October 7, more than 100 new structures, including large tents and hangars, have been built at the desert camp. A comparison of aerial photographs from September 10, 2023 and March 1 this year also showed a significant increase in the number of vehicles at the facility, indicating an uptick in activity. Satellite imagery from two dates in early December showed construction work in progress. CNN also geolocated the two leaked photographs showing the enclosure holding the group of blindfolded men in gray tracksuits. The pattern of panels seen on the roof matched those of a large hangar visible in satellite imagery. The structure, which resembles an animal pen, is located in the central area of the Sde Teiman compound. It is an older structure seen among new buildings which have appeared since the war began. CNN reviewed satellite images from two other military detention camps \u2013 Ofer and Anatot bases in the occupied West Bank \u2013 and did not detect expansion in the grounds since October 7. Several rights groups and legal experts say they believe that Sde Teiman, which is the nearest to Gaza, likely hosts the largest number of detainees of the three military detention camps. \u201cI was there for 23 days. Twenty-three days that felt like 100 years,\u201d said 27-year-old Ibrahim Yassine on the day of his release from a military detention camp. He was lying in a crowded room with over a dozen newly freed men \u2013 they were still in the grey tracksuit prison uniforms. Some had deep flesh wounds from where the handcuffs had been removed. \u201cWe were handcuffed and blindfolded,\u201d said another man, 43-year-old Sufyan Abu Salah. \u201cToday is the first day I can see.\u201d Several had a glassy look in their eyes and were seemingly emaciated. One elderly man breathed through an oxygen machine as he lay on a stretcher. Outside the hospital, two freed men from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society embraced their colleagues. For Dr. Al-Ran, his reunion with his friends was anything but joyful. The experience, he said, rendered him mute for a month as he battled an \u201cemotional deadness.\u201d \u201cIt was very painful. When I was released, people expected me to miss them, to embrace them. But there was a gap,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cThe people who were with me at the detention facility became my family. Those friendships were the only things that belonged to us.\u201d Just before his release, a fellow prisoner had called out to him, his voice barely rising above a whisper, al-Ran said. He asked the doctor to find his wife and kids in Gaza. \u201cHe asked me to tell them that it is better for them to be martyrs,\u201d said al-Ran. \u201cIt is better for them to die than to be captured and held here.\u201d CreditsExecutive producer: Barbara ArvanitidisSenior investigations writer: Tamara QiblawiChief global affairs correspondent: Matthew ChanceOSINT reporter: Allegra GoodwinPhotojournalist: Alex PlattReporters: Abeer Salman and Ami KaufmanGaza journalists: Mohammad Al Sawalhi and Tareq Al HilouContributing journalist: Kareem KhadderVisual and graphic editors: Carlotta Dotto, Lou Robinson and Mark Oliver3D designer: Tom JamesPhoto editor: Sarah TilottaVideo editors: Mark Baron, Julie Zink and Augusta AnthonyMotion designers: Patrick Gallagher and Yukari SchrickelDigital editors: Laura Smith-Spark and Eliza MackintoshExecutive editors: Dan Wright and Matt Wells ", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/middleeast/israel-sde-teiman-detention-whistleblowers-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_style_miss-usa-pageant-organization-allegations", "text": "During their year of service, pageant queens are highly visible, making appearances at major events, advocating for important causes and speaking at public engagements, all in an official capacity. But following the shocking double resignation of Miss USA 2023 Noelia Voigt and Miss Teen USA 2023 UmaSofia Srivastava this week, just days apart, insiders are painting a picture of national titleholders kept absent from their usual duties, their organization in disarray, and key players who appear to be unable to voice their experiences \u2014 and concerns. The Miss USA organization, which runs both pageants, has come under fire amid accusations of mismanagement, a hostile work environment, and conditions that led, in particular, to Voigt\u2019s resignation on the grounds that her role was impacting her mental health. While Srivastava, 16, who represented New Jersey at Miss Teen USA, released a statement on Instagram saying that her personal values \u201cno longer fully align\u201d with those of the organization, Voigt, 24, who represented Utah at Miss USA, wrote a long but cryptic post, citing her mental health. Soon, however, it went viral for an apparent hidden message \u2014 the first letter of the first 11 sentences spelled out \u201cI am silenced.\u201d (Voigt has not subsequently addressed this speculation.) \u201cWe respect and support Noelia\u2019s decision to step down from her duties,\u201d the Miss USA pageant said in a statement following Voigt\u2019s announcement. \u201cThe well-being of our titleholders is a top priority, and we understand her need to prioritize herself at this time.\u201d The organization has not returned CNN\u2019s request for further comment. In response, a number of current state titleholders who competed alongside Voigt for Miss USA \u2014 including Miss North Carolina USA 2023 Jordyn Ashlee McKey, Miss Wisconsin USA 2023 Alexis Loomans and Miss New York USA, Rachelle di Stasio \u2014 shared social media messages in support of Voigt, asking the organization to \u201crelease Noelia from the confidentiality NDA clause of her contract, in perpetuity, so that she is free to speak on her experiences and time as Miss USA.\u201d Denise White, a PR representative for both Srivastava and Voigt \u2014 and the 1994 Miss Oregon USA \u2014 alleged that both winners are restricted by \u201cironclad\u201d non-disclosure agreements in their contracts. To date, neither Voigt or Srivastava has publicly revealed more about what led them to quit. But in a resignation letter provided to the Miss USA organization and obtained by CNN, Voigt outlined a number of concerns, ranging from frustrating managerial issues to more serious allegations. In it, she described a \u201ctoxic work environment\u201d that \u201cat best, is poor management and, at worst, is bullying and harassment.\u201d She accused the pageant\u2019s CEO, Laylah Rose, of \u201cslandering\u201d her character in conversations with people inside and outside of the organization, including calling Voigt \u201cmentally ill.\u201d Rose is an entrepreneur and CEO of the VIP Pageantry Network, who took over the brand in 2023. Voigt says Rose\u2019s communications to her were \u201ccold and unnecessarily aggressive,\u201d and that she never received a formal meeting about her responsibilities. Despite the lack of communication about her role, she was \u201cconstantly\u2026 threatened with disciplinary action, including taking away my salary,\u201d according to the document. The organization failed to arrange travel accommodations for Voigt on multiple occasions, she wrote, and did not provide her with an apartment and car for months, as had been outlined in her prize package. Nor did she have an \u201ceffective handler,\u201d she claimed, the latter leading to an instance where Voigt says she was sexually harassed during a Christmas parade event in Sarasota, Florida, while alone with an unnamed person in a car. According to Voigt\u2019s letter, Rose is \u201cactively building a culture of fear and control, the antithesis of women\u2019s empowerment, that is\u2026unsafe for future titleholders and employees.\u201d Nor, she wrote, can she publicly voice her concerns, saying she is \u201csilenced contractually from being able to speak up for myself.\u201d \u2018Things are falling apart\u2019 Voigt and Srivastava\u2019s respective resignations were not coordinated, according to White. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve witnessed and seen is harassment, a toxic work environment and bullying,\u201d White said in a telephone interview with CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s just not conducive to a women\u2019s organization that uplifts women and is supposed to promote using your voice. It\u2019s quite the opposite.\u201d Both pageant winners sought out support from management at Miss Universe, which owns the Miss USA organization, without success, she added. \u201cBoth young ladies were always trying to resolve any issues quietly behind the scenes,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe fact that Miss Universe Organization has not even responded to Noelia\u2019s resignation at this point is just stonewalling\u2026 No wonder things are falling apart. Because nobody knows what to do.\u201d The Miss Universe organization and Rose, through Miss USA, did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Voigt\u2019s pageant coach, Thom Brodeur, who has worked with Miss USA contestants since 1991 and began working with Voigt while she was preparing for Miss Utah, emphasized new and ominous territory for the organization under Rose. \u201cNo woman has ever resigned as Miss USA or as Miss Teen USA, and she\u2019s lost both of them in 48 hours,\u201d he said. Even before Voigt and Srivastava stepped down, there was turmoil in the organization, according to White, Brodeur and Miss USA\u2019s former social media director, Claudia Engelhardt, who also resigned in recent days. Engelhardt claimed on Instagram that she had worked without pay for two months after being hired, and that she had seen a \u201cdecline\u201d in Voigt\u2019s mental health, and witnessed \u201cdisrespect\u201d toward Srivastava and members of her family. And according to Engelhardt, they were far from the only members of the Miss USA organization to depart. When she began her role in January, she was part of an already small team of five employees. Now, she says, after multiple firings and resignations, the team is down to Rose and one other employee. Multiple sources said the turnover has been constant. \u201cThis is not a state pageant. This is not a local pageant. You need\u2026 a whole team,\u201d Engelhardt said in a phone call with CNN. Engelhardt said she believed she was applying for a freelance role, and was surprised to find she was being hired as staff. Still, she claimed, she received no employee contract, no onboarding and no guidance. There was no one else to help her manage the day-to-day social media needs of the national brand, she said, and often came up against what she framed as Rose\u2019s overbearing approach to their social accounts. \u201cShe would block Instagram accounts with people that she had personal discrepancies with. She would censor comments, and she would leave comments for the Miss USA page as if she was Noelia,\u201d Engelhardt claimed. White also alleged that Rose impersonated the two pageant winners on their official accounts. Weeks before Voigt resigned, she announced in a now-deleted Instagram post on her personal account that she \u201cno longer had access\u201d to her Miss USA pages. An uneasy path forward Engelhardt said she witnessed firsthand the impact of the role on Voigt, who she considers a friend as well as a former colleague. \u201c(I saw) how stressed out she would get when the owner would constantly bombard her with emails,\u201d she recalled. \u201cShe was constantly living in an anxious state.\u201d But despite the day-to-day stressors, Voigt alleged that she only made few public appearances. She said in her letter that, aside from a handful of press interviews in Los Angeles following her win and subsequent ones in Utah, the state she had represented at the Miss USA pageant, she had \u201cyet to make an appearance outside of Sarasota, Florida,\u201d where she was living. This was due to a \u201clack of communication\u201d that she found \u201cbaffling,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOur Miss USA, who should have been booked and busy (with) endless opportunities was sitting around doing nothing, and it\u2019s not because she didn\u2019t want to, but because of mismanagement,\u201d Engelhardt said. On May 9, the Miss USA pageant announced that Savannah Gankiewicz, Miss Hawaii USA 2023 and first-runner up to Voigt at the 2023 Miss USA pageant, would be taking over the national title and its responsibilities. She will be officially crowned on May 15. \u201cWe are proud to crown Savannah Miss USA 2023, A true representation of vision, intelligence, and compassion,\u201d Rose said in a statement. \u201cHer dedication to empowering women through self-love and confidence is inspiring, and we look forward to her impactful reign as Miss USA.\u201d \u201cI fully support and respect Noelia\u2019s decision to step down, and I stand in solidarity with mental health awareness,\u201d Gankiewicz\u00a0added. \u201cTo my fellow Miss USA sisters, I believe it\u2019s crucial for us to stand united for the future of the organization and the incoming class of 2024 and beyond.\u201d Though many have offered their public support for the two resigned pageant winners \u2014 including\u00a0Shanna Moakler, who oversaw Voigt\u2019s win in her role as the state director for the Miss Utah USA pageant, and Cindy Provost and Debbie Miller, who oversaw Srivastava\u2019s win in their role as state directors for the Miss New Jersey Teen USA pageant \u2014 Engelhardt and White both hope that others will step up to reveal more about what they see as a stifling culture, as well as potential legal ramifications, that are keeping the titleholders quiet. \u201cThey need somebody else to speak up for them,\u201d White said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/style/miss-usa-pageant-organization-allegations/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_weather_brazil-rain-floods-scli-intl", "text": "People in southern Brazil, already reeling from deadly floods, are bracing for more disruption after heavy rainstorms pummeled the area on Friday and meteorologists warned of more to come throughout the weekend. The death toll in the floods that have ravaged parts of the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul has inched up to 113, the state\u2019s civil defense agency said, as relentless downpours sweep the region and spread to parts of neighboring Uruguay. Officials are urging those who have been rescued from the floods not to return to their homes. Intense rain is expected to continue in parts of the state\u2019s center and east until Sunday, with some areas expecting 150 mm over that time, the national meteorology institute INMET said. North of the state capital, Porto Alegre, 100 millimeters of rain is expected to fall in 24 hours. \u201cIt is important to highlight that the predicted volumes of rain may cause new disruptions in areas already affected previously,\u201d a statement from INMET read. The storms have affected more than 1.9 million people in Brazil, and displaced hundreds of thousands, many of whom are staying in temporary shelters. Over 140 people are still missing. Scenes of the devastating weather event have been beamed all over the world, including video footage of a horse that had to be rescued after being stranded for several days on a rooftop. The animal was rescued on Thursday by members of Sao Paulo\u2019s military. According to state run Agencia Brasil, the horse \u2013 which has been baptized on social media as Caramelo \u2013 was sedated prior to being placed on a boat as part of the rescue. It had been stuck on the roof for four days surrounded by flood water in the municipality of Canoas in the Brazilian state Rio Grande do Sul. Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva posted a video on X of the moment he learned of the horse\u2019s rescue. Agencia Brasil, the sate-run news agency, has reported the rescue of more than 2,000 animals since the floods impacted Rio Grande du Sol, including dogs, cats, chickens, and pigs. Uruguay has also been flooded by the storms. More than 1,300 people there have been displaced there, while thousands more are without electricity, the national emergency system said on Wednesday night, without specifying if there were casualties. There are growing concerns that gangs may take advantage of the abandoned homes and businesses. At least 47 people have been arrested for crimes related to the catastrophic floods, 41 of whom are suspected of looting establishments. Six were allged to have committed sexual abuse in shelters, Agencia Brasil reported. The record rainfall has been linked to El Ni\u00f1o, a natural climate phenomenon that warms waters in the Pacific and tends to bring heavy rainfall to southern Brazil. Long-term global warming, caused primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, has also exacerbated extreme weather in the region. Rio Grande do Sul \u2014 Brazil\u2019s southernmost state, and until recently a tranquil agricultural region \u2014 has seen repeatedly extreme weather events in recent years. According to the state government, 19 billion Brazilians reals ($3.7 billion US dollars) will be needed for rebuilding.

{"id": "2024_05_08_europe_berlin-senator-attack-germany-intl", "text": "A Berlin senator was attacked while visiting a library on Tuesday, amid what appears to be an increasing trend of violence against politicians in Germany. Franziska Giffey, Berlin senator for economy, was hit over the head with a bag containing hard material as she visited the library in her district in the German capital Tuesday afternoon, the Berlin prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement. Giffey, a former Berlin mayor, described the moment of the attack on Instagram, saying \u201cI suddenly felt a hard blow to my head and neck from behind. A man had attacked me with a bag filled with hard contents.\u201d The alleged perpetrator has been identified as a 74-year-old male, according to the prosecutor\u2019s office, which added that he has been previously charged with state security and hate crime and there are indications he is mentally ill. \u201cThe 74-year-old man has previously been charged by the police with state security and hate crime. However, investigations into the accused\u2019s motive for yesterday\u2019s attack are still ongoing,\u201d a statement said. \u201cThe accused is to be brought before an investigating judge today. As there are indications that the accused is mentally ill, the Berlin public prosecutor\u2019s office is to obtain an order to place him in a psychiatric hospital in accordance with Section 126a of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\u201d It comes days after a member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the European Parliament was attacked and seriously injured in Dresden, eastern Germany. Separately, Saxony state police said that two people had been detained over another attack on a female Green party politician in Dresden on Tuesday evening. The unnamed 47-year-old had been putting up posters when she was attacked by two people. The Green party in Saxony wrote on X that its members would continue campaigning, and would not be intimidated. It also said it would support a draft law to increase legislation around protection against attacks on politicians. Berlin Senator Giffey commented on the increased assaults, saying she was \u201cconcerned and shaken by the growing \u2018wild-animal culture\u2019 with which people who are politically active and committed in our country are increasingly exposed to attacks that are supposedly justified and acceptable.\u201d Scholz meanwhile described the attacks on Giffey and other politicians as \u201coutrageous and cowardly.\u201d \u201cViolence does not belong in a democratic debate.

{"id": "travel_stunning-secret-italian-lakes", "text": "Tourists regularly flock to Italy to enjoy its beaches and islands, they admire its historical cities \u2013 and of course they enjoy the food. Recently, they\u2019ve been coming in far greater numbers, leaving some destinations overwhelmed. However, there are still places to visit that offer an escape from the crowds as well as stunning scenery. We\u2019re talking lakes. But not Lake Garda, the huge body of water that nestles up against the Alps, busy with resort towns. And not celebrity-favorite Lake Como. Italy has dozens of secret smaller lakes that boast superb scenery, unknown to mass tourism, where locals get together on day trips and enjoy picnics. These are some of the best: Lake Turano One of the best-kept secrets of Lazio, the region around Rome, is Lake Turano. Visitors to Rome, many who wilt during the heat of the Eternal City\u2019s fiery summers, have no idea that nearby lies an enchanted place that has the views, the history, the food and a welcome breath of fresh air. It wasn\u2019t meant to be a vacation spot at first. When Benito Mussolini, Italy\u2019s former dictator, ordered the construction of this artificial lake in the 1930s to supply water to nearby power plants, the last thing he expected was for it to turn into a weekend detox retreat for people longing for open spaces. Lago del Turano has an ideal location, close to the capital but far from the noise and chaos. Set in the wild countryside north of Rome and surrounded by hills, the location was once home to the Fallisci, an ancient tribe, before they were wiped out by ancient Romans. Free-roaming cows and sheep greet visitors along a road cut through a deep forest that leads to the lake. Once out of the woods, the mesmerizing scenery of the lake forces drivers to stop at a belvedere with benches to take in the view. The lake brims with giant carp that draw anglers from across Italy for fishing contests. Two picturesque towns of stone dwellings with panoramic balconies overlook lake Turano - the clifftop medieval Castel di Tora and the even more ancient Colle di Tora, sit right on the shoreline. There\u2019s also a tall peninsula jutting out into the lake topped with an old monastery. The water is crystal-clear and the pebble shores are dotted with beach facilities where one can rent dinghies, canoes, boats, or simply suntan and sunbathe in tropical-like waters. Just one metal bridge runs over the water connecting Castel di Tora to the main road. In winter, most holiday homes are shut and the narrow alleys are largely deserted apart from cats. In spring, locals spruce up their outdoor patios and socialize in the little piazza. Fresh fish is served at restaurant L\u2019Angoletto, a stone cottage with an open panoramic veranda over the lake. Hotel Turano has cozy, no-frills lakefront rooms and a restaurant serving local specialties. Lake Scanno The most intriguing of all lakes however is Lake Scanno, the \u201cpearl\u201d of eastern Italy\u2019s Abruzzo region, which is as beautiful as it is mysterious. Over the years, tales and myths have been spun about this deep green, heart-shaped lake that persist today, attracting scientists and paranormal investigators who try to find explanations to weird happenings that have long baffled locals. Surrounded by the Apennines mountain range, it is said this natural lake, named after the overhanging village above, has magical powers. Locals believe the lake is alive and some have previously reported unusual phenomena such as shattering light bulbs, exploding TV screens and ceiling lamps dancing as if a small earthquake had just struck. They also tell stories of other unexplained events: sudden water level drops, divers compasses going berserk and dead fish and even long-lost World War II weapons floating on the surface. There\u2019s said to be a mysterious unidentified object buried in the lake bed. Lake Scanno\u2019s unusual atmosphere is almost palpable. In the heady days of summer, the sense of mystery hangs in the warm air. Despite its green color, caused by harmless algae in the water, bathing is permitted here as is windsurfing. The lake is also ripe for exploration, with a \u201cPath of the Heart\u201d trail that circles its banks and takes in a church, said to be a site of miracles, and an old hermitage. Along the shores there is a beach kitted out for summer bathing. There are mountain bike trails and it\u2019s possible to rent rickshaws, rowing boats and canoes.Other facilities include a children\u2019s playground, and a parking area for campers. Lakefront Agriturismo Miralago is a farm and B&B, where horses roam free. It serves traditional dishes like tagliatelle with wild boar. The village of Scanno, a puzzle of lavish bourgeois mansions and humble shepherd dwellings decorated with bright flower pots, is a must-see. Lake Iseo Located just a few miles from Milan, this picturesque spot formed from pure Alpine glacial meltwater is also a source of great sparkling wines, made from grapes grown on its banks. The lake has three islands. The two smallest are private while the largest, Montisola, a huge mountain sticking out of the deep blue water, is heaven for nature-lovers. Here, visitors can rent canoes or fishing boats for a private tour of the lake. Another shoreside attraction is the brightly colored dwellings built for fishermen that stand on stilts over the edge of the water, among them restaurant Locanda al Lago, known for its fish dishes and the sardines hung on the dock to dry. Hotel Sensole is a lakefront Baroque palazzo that contains a gourmet bistrot. Lake Nemi This small lake just beyond the southwestern suburbs of Rome is where locals flock for Sunday lunches with traditional porchetta pork sandwiches and heady red wines. They\u2019re treading in the footsteps of their ancient predecessors. Back in the days of Roman empire, senators and wealthy families came here to relax in lavish retreats around Nemi\u2019s shores, where succulent strawberries grow amid archeological ruins and dense forests. Sited among the Colli Albani hills on the edge of Rome, the lake is of volcanic origin and sits in an extinct crater. It\u2019s accessible by foot along an old route that winds down from a village on the slopes above it that shares the lake\u2019s name. Lakefront B&B Lago di Nemi is an old restyled farmhouse that rents out bicycles, while restaurant La Fiocina on the shore, serves fish specialties like fried whitebait with green peppers. Lake Orta Orta is one of the secret gems of Italy\u2019s Piedmont region, usually overlooked by visitors who flock to the more touristy Lago Maggiore nearby. Created by a melting Alpine glacier, it\u2019s a quiet idyll with picturesque villages, chapels and medieval towers along its banks. In the middle of Orta, the monastery-island of San Giulio rises from the water. Alongside myriad biking and horseback riding trails, it\u2019s possible to waterski and even scuba dive in the translucent waters that lie off its pebble beaches. L\u2019Approdo\u00a0is a four-star lakefront hotel restaurant with a panoramic terrace and pool. Lake Trasimeno This shallow lake formed millennia ago by tectonic movements of the Earth\u2019s crust is located in a less touristy part of Umbria, where just locals have holiday homes and shops in the overhanging village of Castiglione don\u2019t sell the usual souvenirs. Trasimeno\u2019s banks are dotted with medieval hamlets and wooden bridges that cross over the water that are great for birdwatching and sunset drinks. Beaches here rent out windsurf and kite equipment. B&B Dolce Dormire has cozy rooms in the ancient district of Castiglione, while La Casa di Campagna is a rural farm and tavern serving local specialties.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/stunning-secret-italian-lakes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_europe_russia-ukraine-cross-border-kharkiv-intl", "text": "Russian forces\u00a0have made two cross-border assaults inside northern Ukraine, according to information from Ukrainian sources and officials, in what President Volodymyr Zelensky is calling a \u201cnew wave of counteroffensive actions\u201d by Russia. In the first development, Russian soldiers\u00a0penetrated\u00a0at least one kilometer towards the town of Vovchansk, a Ukrainian military source told CNN. The aim, the source said, \u201cwas to get 10 km deep and create a buffer zone at the border to secure Russian territory from feeling the war.\u201d In an official statement, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry said Russian soldiers supported by armored vehicles had moved across the border at about 5 a.m. Friday, following a day of stepped-up attacks on the border area with guided aerial bombs and artillery. The statement added that Ukrainian reserve units had been deployed to strengthen defenses in the area. On Saturday, local authorities said more than 20 air glide KAB bombs had been launched at the town and its surrounding settlements. The region\u2019s governor Oleh Syniehubov said two civilians were killed when the bombs hit private houses. A second Ukrainian source with direct knowledge of frontline developments told CNN that Russian forces had also penetrated 5 kilometers inside Ukraine towards the village of Krasne, which lies about 75 km along the border, west of Vovchansk. The source said the Russian ground assault towards Krasne was carried out by four Russian battalions - about 2,000 men. Ukrainian officials have not given much information about the second Russian push, though Ukraine\u2019s General Staff, in its Friday evening update, did note Russian attacks in the area of Krasne and two neighboring villages. It is also noteworthy that DeepStateMap, a Ukrainian monitoring group which updates frontline developments daily, showed four villages next to each other - including Krasne - in the grey area, representing territory currently contested rather than under full Ukrainian control. DeepStateMap also noted on its Telegram channel that the number of Russian forces deployed in the two cross-border pushes was not enough for a deeper advance into Ukrainian territory, but it also drew attention to the fact Moscow has many more troops positioned along the border - estimated to be around 40,000. Asked about developments, Zelensky did not downplay their seriousness but said Ukraine\u2019s military had been expecting such a move. \u201cRussia launched a new wave of counteroffensive actions in [northern Kharkiv region]. Ukraine met them there with our troops, brigades and artillery,\u201d he told reporters early Friday afternoon. \u201cBut our military and military command were aware of this and anticipated their forces to meet the enemy with fire. Now there is a fierce battle in this area [\u2026] I think as of now we have stopped the enemy with artillery fire,\u201d Zelensky said. In an address Saturday evening local time, Zelensky said Ukraine was \u201cstrengthening our positions\u201d and adding forces to the Kharkiv region. Residents of border villages have been told to evacuate by authorities. National police posted photos and a video on social media showing officers helping people pack their belongings into police vehicles ahead of being driven to safer locations. A total of 1,775 people have so far been evacuated from Kharkiv region, a day after Russia\u2019s surprise assault, the head of the region\u2019s military administration said Saturday. The developments mark the most serious cross-border ground assault by Russia since Ukraine re-captured the northern Kharkiv region in the late summer of 2022, after it was first taken by Russia in the opening weeks of its full-scale invasion. It also comes after several months of increased Russian air attacks on the city of Kharkiv, which have knocked out all the city\u2019s power-generating capacity, as well as its sub-stations. Governor Syniehubov insisted the latest Russian ground assaults did not put the city, which lies just 30 km south from the Russian border, under heightened risk. \u201cThe enemy group does not pose a threat to Kharkiv city, its forces are only enough for provocations in the northern direction.\u201d However, analysts note that if Russian forces were able to push much further south, that could bring the northern edge of the city within range of Russian artillery, which can fire about 20 km.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/europe/russia-ukraine-cross-border-kharkiv-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

Standing by, her mother cried, \u201cAhed is dead!\u201d But 18-year-old Bseso was very much alive, and she has survived to tell her story, from a hospital in Greenville, South Carolina. Bseso said that on December 19 last year, she went to the top floor of her house in Gaza to get a cellphone signal when an Israeli tank outside fired at her building. It destroyed part of her home\u2019s wall, which came crashing down on her leg, along with heavy debris. With her neighborhood under siege and no possibility of medical attention, her uncle, who used to work as an orthopedic surgeon, used kitchen supplies to amputate her leg below the knee and dress it with unsterilized gauze. The days that followed were horrifically painful. \u201cFor four days, I couldn\u2019t leave the house because the Israelis wouldn\u2019t let me,\u201d she told CNN through a translator, at the Shriners Children\u2019s hospital. \u201cThere was no medication I could take to inhibit the pain or to help me with my condition. So, I just sat in agony for four days.\u201d The video of her amputation\u202fwent viral\u202fand caught the attention of the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund (PCRF), a US organization that provides free health care to thousands of injured and ill Palestinian children in the Middle East. The organization worked for weeks to evacuate her from northern Gaza and bring her to the United States for medical care, according to Tareq Hailat, international pediatric healthcare coordinator at PCRF. She is one of three Palestinians who received PCRF\u2019s help to come to the US for leg injury treatment. At least 1,000 children in Gaza have had one or both legs amputated, UNICEF reported\u202fin December. Though he couldn\u2019t give an exact figure, UNICEF spokesperson Joe English told CNN that the number has since grown. Nearly 26,000 children \u2014 or just over 2% of Gaza\u2019s child population \u2014 were  killed or injured in the Gaza Strip in the first six months of the Israel-Hamas war, according to international nongovernmental organization\u202fSave the Children. From October 7, 2023 \u2014 the date of the Hamas attack on Israel \u2014 to early April, more than 13,800 children were killed and at least 12,009 were injured, the organization said. Avoiding amputations Two-year-old Jood Damo\u2019s\u202fhouse was struck by a tank shell on December 26 last year, killing his mother and fracturing his right leg. His father, Ahmed Damo, who accompanied him to the US, told CNN that the toddler witnessed his mother dying. \u201cTo this day, he still has episodes where he asks about his mom,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, he wakes up in the middle of the night, just crying and screaming, and asking about his mother.\u201d Now, doctors at another hospital in Chicago are assessing whether his injured leg will respond to treatment and grow at the same rate as his left leg. If not, it could significantly delay his path to recovery and treatment plan, PCRF said. Ayham Musalm, 13, said his left leg was fractured and had glass shrapnel lodged in his knee when debris from a strike on a neighbors\u2019 house came straight into his home on December 10. He went months, however, without anyone identifying what was wrong. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to see any physician for a long time,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThen one physician just sewed my wound, and said it wasn\u2019t serious and sent me home.\u201d In the care of Shriners Children\u2019s hospital in Greenville, Musalm has had access to imaging and MRI processes, which helped American experts find the shards of glass inside his knee. That led to surgery and further treatment, and he avoided amputation. He is now in physical therapy. It took PCRF weeks and sometimes months to get children out of Gaza. Besides the time needed to secure their US visas, evacuating the children \u2014\u00a0or even moving them from one part of the strip to the other \u2014\u00a0required Israeli approval, which can be a complicated process, according to Hailat, who works on the evacuations. This delay in treatment for such injuries can result in grave repercussions, said Dr. Amber Alayyan from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders), an international aid NGO. \u201cThe longer they wait without care, the worse it\u2019s going to be,\u201d she said. Alayyan, who has traveled in and out of Gaza several times, said the enclave could have handled the care for such injuries before its\u202fhealthcare system was devastated\u202fby the war. \u201cWe see people who, despite their burns, walk into the clinic without a jaw because the healthcare system has completely collapsed and there are no spaces to take care of these people in the hospitals,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were 3,500 beds in the hospitals in Gaza before the war. But there are so many displaced people living, squatting, seeking shelter in hospitals, that there\u2019s not even space for the patients.\u201d \u201cAs a result, the wounds that these patients are suffering from are beginning to literally rot,\u201d she added. \u201cThey smell now.\u201d In these overwhelming conditions, doctors are struggling to identify infections and types of injuries, and the focus is entirely on saving lives. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t necessarily need to carry out these life-saving amputations because you would have had a system that functioned. You would have had reconstructive surgery. Possibly, you would have had immediate lifesaving surgery possible, and they would have been able to save these limbs,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd now we are doing everything we can just to save lives in the moment.\u201d PCRF\u2019s Hailat said he doesn\u2019t know if Bseso\u2019s injury required an amputation either. But with Gaza under siege, and no immediate medical attention, hospital care, and sterilized equipment available, amputation was the only choice. When she arrived in the United States, the bone in her other leg was also deeply infected. Doctors feared that she may have needed both legs amputated, but with adequate care and treatment, she has avoided that outcome. An anxious wait to return home Evacuating to the United States is not the obvious answer for all injured children, Hailat said. The country has accepted 20 children from Gaza for treatment, but Hailat said he has rerouted 17 of them to other nations. Some injuries are so severe that Hailat said he has to choose medical care as quickly as possible \u2014 which means staying in the region \u2014 over expertise and the advanced level of care in the United States. He also said he wants to ensure that the children who are evacuated to the US need treatment that\u2019s specifically available in the country. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to limit how many people we bring to the United States. We would much rather bring people to local areas and local countries around Gaza,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, if specific treatment of that particular child is needed to be done in the United States, then we will go out of our way to ensure that happens. Culture is also important for care and recovery, Hailat said. \u201cCulturally, you don\u2019t want to separate them so far away from their homeland that it\u2019s difficult for them to adapt,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I want them to be close to Gaza. This is a very sensitive time, and I don\u2019t want them to feel as though we are separating them from their country.\u201d Back home, Bseso said her mother fell sick as\u202fmalnourishment has plagued northern Gaza. She worriedly waits for more news and updates from home, and she knows that her family would be trying to make their way to the top of their residential building, to find a cell signal to contact her \u2014 the same ritual that put her in the Israeli line of attack. Her hope is to reunite with them in a safe place. \u201cWe really need our family to be with us together,\u201d she said. Musalm, too, wants his treatment to finish so he can return to Gaza and see his family. But there is no knowing when that may be. After their treatments, which Hailat said will most likely take a year, PCRF will ensure it is safe in Gaza before returning the children there. \u201cWe will not do that if it puts them in danger,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we will have to wait to ensure that Gaza is able to be a safe location for them to return.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/middleeast/palestinian-young-amputees-us-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_middleeast_israel-memorial-day-protests-intl-latam", "text": "Protesters took to the streets of several cities across Israel on Saturday, demanding the release of all hostages held in Gaza ahead of Israel\u2019s Memorial Day. They demanded the resignation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and for early elections to be held. Families of hostages held in Gaza also took part in anti-government protests, including in Tel Aviv, Caesarea, Rehovot, and Haifa. The protests come as Israel gears up to mark Memorial Day starting Sunday evening. Many waved Israeli flags and held up signs with images of the Israeli hostages, calling on the government to bring them home alive. Around 240 people were taken hostage and moved to Gaza during Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack on Israel that also killed more than 1,200 people. A little more than 100 were freed during a release deal in November, but the Israel Defense Forces believes there are still 132 hostages being held in Gaza, 128 of whom were taken on October 7. The believes that, of those 128, only 92 are still alive. Among those at the protests Saturday was Yael Adar, the mother of Tamir Adar, who was abducted on October 7 and whose death was announced in January. She said all she wanted was to bring back the body of her son so she could hold a proper burial. \u201cFor 90 days, we fought for his return alive, 90 days of hoping that Tamir would return to us, to the bosom of the family \u2013 a hope that vanished with the news that he was no longer alive,\u201d Adar said during a rally. \u201cSince then, all we ask is to bring Tamir and all the murdered hostages back for burial, here in the land they loved. To grant Tamir the burial he deserves. To grant us closure, to have a grave where we can be with his memory,\u201d she added. Hagit Chen, mother of Itay Chen, who was killed on October 7 and whose remains were taken into Gaza, said she wanted to bury her son in peace. \u201cI have been invited to take part in many ceremonies for Israel\u2019s Remembrance Day, but the only ceremony that I ought to be in, with my family and with the memory of my own son, is a ceremony that the country has not enabled me to have,\u201d Chen said. \u201cHow much more suffering can one take? I turn to the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu: It is time that you bring them all back! The living for rehabilitation and the fallen for a respectful, appropriate Jewish burial,\u201d she added. Hostage died a month ago, Hamas says The protests came as the Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, claimed that one of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza died more than a month ago. Abu Obaida, the military wing\u2019s spokesperson, said on Telegram that Nadav Popplewell, who was 51 years old when abducted, had died of wounds he sustained after an Israeli airstrike hit the place where he was held. \u201cHis health condition deteriorated and he died because he did not receive intensive medical care,\u201d Obaida said. Popplewell, who has dual British-Israeli citizenship, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nirim on October 7, 2023. His mother, Channah Peri, was also abducted but was released as part of the hostage deal on November 24. His brother Roi was killed on October 7. The Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office told CNN it did not know whether Popplewell was alive or dead. The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment. The United Kingdom\u2019s Foreign Office said it is seeking more information about Popplewell. \u201cThe UK government has been working with partners across the region to secure the release of hostages, including British nationals. We will continue to do all we can to secure the release of hostages,\u201d the office told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/middleeast/israel-memorial-day-protests-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

The two attended an event Saturday held by Nigeria\u2019s Defence Staff and \u2018Nigeria: Unconquered\u2019 \u2013 a local charity supporting wounded servicemembers inspired by the Duke of Sussex\u2019s Invictus Games Foundation.

Nigeria loves you. Welcome home.\u201d They presented her with a book and a Nigerian fabric. Meghan revealed in 2022 that she discovered she was 43% Nigerian from a genealogy test. Wounded service members shared their thoughts about the importance of the Sussexes visit. \u201cHonestly, Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s visit to Nigeria, it means a lot to me personally,\u201d flight sergeant Ifeoma Loveleen Nwagbo told CNN. \u201cThis [Invictus] initiative is very, very fantastic because it makes me understand that yes: I can actually achieve what I couldn\u2019t achieve before in my life.

Daniel Duggan, 55, a naturalized Australian citizen, feared requests by Western intelligence agencies for sensitive information were putting his family at risk, the lawyer said in a legal filing seen by Reuters. The lawyer\u2019s filing supports Reuters reporting linking Duggan to convicted Chinese defense\u00a0hacker Su Bin. Duggan denies the allegations that he broke US arms control laws. He has been in an Australian maximum security prison since his 2022 arrest after returning from six years working in Beijing. US authorities found correspondence with Duggan on electronic devices seized from Su Bin, Duggan\u2019s lawyer Bernard Collaery said in the March submission to Australian Attorney General Mark Dreyfus, who will decide whether to surrender Duggan to the US after a magistrate hears Duggan\u2019s extradition case. The case will be heard in a Sydney court this month, two years after\u00a0his arrest\u00a0in rural Australia at a time when Britain was warning its former military pilots not to work for China. Su Bin, arrested in Canada in 2014,\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in 2016 to theft of US military aircraft designs by hacking major US defense contractors. He is listed among seven co-conspirators with Duggan in the extradition request. Duggan knew Su Bin as an employment broker for Chinese state aviation company AVIC, lawyer Collaery wrote, and the hacking case was \u201ctotally unrelated to our client.\u201d Although Su Bin \u201cmay have had improper connection to (Chinese) agents this was unknown to our client,\u201d Duggan\u2019s lawyer wrote. \u2018Overt intelligence contact\u2019 AVIC was blacklisted by the US last year as a Chinese\u00a0military-linked\u00a0company. Messages retrieved from Su Bin\u2019s electronic devices show he paid for Duggan\u2019s travel from Australia to Beijing in May 2012, according to extradition documents lodged by the United States with the Australian court. Duggan asked Su Bin to help source Chinese aircraft parts for his Top Gun tourist flight business in Australia, Collaery wrote. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and US Navy criminal investigators knew Duggan was training pilots for AVIC and met him in Australia\u2019s Tasmania state in December 2012 and February 2013, his lawyer wrote. ASIO and the US Navy Criminal Investigation Service did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the meetings. ASIO has previously said it would not comment as the matter was before the court. \u201cAn ASIO officer suggested that while carrying on his legitimate business operations in China, Mr Duggan may be able to gather sensitive information,\u201d his lawyer wrote. Duggan moved to China in 2013 and was barred from leaving the country in 2014, his lawyer said. Duggan\u2019s\u00a0LinkedIn profile\u00a0and aviation sources who knew him said he was working in China as an aviation consultant in 2013 and 2014. He renounced his US citizenship in 2016 at the US embassy in Beijing, backdated to 2012 on a certificate, after \u201covert intelligence contact by US authorities that may have compromised his family\u2019s safety,\u201d his lawyer wrote. His lawyers oppose extradition, arguing there is no evidence the Chinese pilots he trained were military and that he became an Australian citizen in January 2012, before the alleged offenses. The United States government\u00a0has argued\u00a0Duggan did not lose his US citizenship until 2016.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/australia/duggan-us-marine-pilot-australia-chinese-hacker-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

That\u2019s because five Boeing 747 passenger jets once operated by the South Korean flag carrier Korean Air have been purchased by the Sierra Nevada Corporation, the contractor for the replacements for the US Air Force\u2019s current fleet of strategic command and control military aircraft, more commonly known as \u201cDoomsday\u201d planes. Also known as the E-4B \u201cNightwatch,\u201d the Doomsday planes are designed to be command-and-control centers for the US military in the event of a national emergency that sees command facilities on the ground destroyed or incapacitated, such as nuclear war. They could become what amounts to a Pentagon in the sky, taking aboard the US president, secretary of defense and members of the Joint Chiefs among more than 100 other people with the ability to control US forces worldwide from the aircraft, according to an Air Force fact sheet on the E-4Bs. The Doomsday planes are built to withstand the effects of an electromagnetic pulse, the burst of energy released by a nuclear explosion that can \u201cdisrupt and permanently damage electrical components and entire systems within most critical infrastructure sectors and impact large-scale infrastructure,\u201d according to the US Department of Homeland Security. At least one Doomsday plane is on alert 24/7 at a US military base somewhere in the world, the Air Force says. On Friday, a spokesperson for the Colorado-based Sierra Nevada\u00a0confirmed the purchase of the Korean Air jets but would not give any further details. However, on April 26 the Air Force awarded Sierra Nevada a $13 billion contract to develop and produce the Survivable Airborne Operations Center, the official name of the new Doomsday plane. Work on the project is to be completed by 2036, according to a Defense Department release. On Friday, an Air Force spokeswoman confirmed the contract had been awarded in April. \u201cThe development of this critical national security weapon system ensures the Department\u2019s Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications capability is operationally relevant and secure for decades to come. To satisfy operational requirements, the weapon system will be comprised of a Commercial Derivative Aircraft that will be hardened and modified to meet military requirements,\u201d Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek told CNN. Last year, Sierra Nevada opened a 100,000-square-foot aircraft repair, maintenance and overhaul facility at Dayton International Airport in Ohio, and construction on a second hangar of similar size has begun. An artist\u2019s rendering of the Dayton facility showed a 747-800 inside. The 747-800s would be an upgrade on the older and smaller 747-200 airframes of the current Doomsday fleet, which entered Air Force service in the 1980s. Earlier this week, Korean Air announced the $675 million sale of five of its aircraft to Sierra Nevada. The decision to sell the jets was part of a \u201cmid- to long-term introduction plan for new aircraft,\u201d the airline said in a statement, adding it expects the deal to be completed by September 30, 2025. Korean Air had nine 747-800 passenger jets in its fleet as of October 2023, according to its website.

{"id": "2024_05_08_africa_from-anonymity-to-empowerment-the-journey-of-diary-of-a-naija-girl", "text": "In the bustling world of social media, where everyone strives to be heard, few voices rise above the noise to truly make an impact. One such voice is that of Ifedayo Agoro, the founder of Diary of a Naija Girl (DANG), a platform that started as a simple Instagram page and has since grown into a thriving community of nearly one million followers across social media sites. The journey for the Nigerian former oil and gas executive began with a simple idea in 2006 \u2013 to share her stories and opinions authentically and without fear or shame. \u201cI realized the culture of shame had grown so much and I thought to myself, \u2018This is not how I grew up\u2026 I\u2019m gonna tell my story, the good, the bad, and the ugly, and I will not be ashamed,\u2019\u201d Agoro recalled. Candid conversations Through candid conversations and shared narratives, members of the DANG community confront taboo topics such as gender-based violence, discrimination, body image, mental health, and reproductive rights. \u201cWhat drives the content is the platform\u2019s values; to live our best life, never be suppressed by shame and our experiences, and learn and unlearn everything. Whatever falls under these values is what we put out,\u201d she explained. Agoro, 40, champions the message of self-worth and autonomy, inspiring women to embrace their individuality and make decisions based on their desires, not societal expectations. \u201cWomen are beginning to understand that they are worthy anyway, with marriage or without it,\u201d she said. She is often accused of being anti-men and marriage and Agoro was keen to clarify her stance on relationships. \u201cI\u2019m not anti-marriage\u2026 I just know that my life is still full without it. \u201cHusbands would write to me that I\u2019m spoiling their wives and teaching them to be rude and not submissive. Men would throw jabs at me on Twitter\u2026 they were just not happy that I was expressing\u2026 what other women are too scared to say,\u201d she told CNN. Although she admits the vitriol has lessened considerably. \u201cI would attribute that to not backing down. I\u2019m a person that\u2019s just going to do what I want to do.\u201d Undeterred by detractors, Agoro continues to amplify women\u2019s voices and create a safe space for women to share without limits. This ultimately led Agoro to create the #DangAfterHours series, a no-holds-barred discussion on sex and sexuality, a real taboo subject in Nigeria, Agoro says. \u201cWomen in Nigeria are not really able to talk about sex without being labeled promiscuous. I want to talk about sex in a hilarious way, we can learn from it and bond on that topic. The response shows that the conversation needed to happen.\u201d Creating impact Over the years, Agoro has used the DANG platform to transform the lives of hundreds of women. A self-described \u201cempath\u201d she finds herself getting involved in the lives of the women who reach her for help and advice, often \u201cbawling her eyes out,\u201d over their triumphs and tribulations, she says. However, one moment stands out for her. \u201cA few years ago, there was a lady who was sick in the hospital in Lagos and at the time doctors were on strike. She sent me a message saying \u2018I\u2019m losing blood, pregnant and sick. There\u2019s no one to attend to me. Please help me I don\u2019t want to die.\u2019\u201d Angered, Agoro says she took to her social media and posted about the woman\u2019s predicament. \u201cAfter I posted that, the office of the then First Lady reached me and resolved the issue immediately and the lady was attended to quickly and her tests were done. That was the day I realized the power of what we were doing.\u201d When she started posting her story on Instagram, Agoro initially chose to remain anonymous, to avoid the pressure of public scrutiny. However, as her platform gained traction, she confronted a pivotal moment when her identity was threatened to be exposed. Rather than succumbing to fear, she decided to reveal herself. \u201cI initially didn\u2019t see the need to put my face\u2026 and when the platform became bigger\u2026 I realized that this may not be sustainable. I have ambitions to write a book, to create a company. Then, someone threatened to reveal my identity, so I outed myself and it has been a blessing in disguise, so thank you to the person,\u2019 she joked. Soon after, she launched her DANG Lifestyle and skincare business which has grown largely through word of mouth through the DANG community, Agoro says. \u201cWe started with candles and went into skincare and we haven\u2019t done any campaign at all but have sold over 400,000 units. I owe the trajectory of the DANG lifestyle to the community. But It\u2019s a business that has to leave our comfort zone in Nigeria. Dang Lifestyle is already in the UK, USA, Ghana, and Kenya and we want to take it to more countries,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_05_12_europe_sergei-shoigu-putin-replaces-defense-minister-intl-latam", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has replaced his defense minister and a long-time close ally Sergei Shoigu with an economist, a major reshuffle of military leadership more than two years after Moscow\u2019s grinding war against Ukraine has sent defense spending soaring. Andrey Belousov, a civilian who served as former first deputy prime minister and specializes in economics, was appointed to the top defense post, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Sunday. Peskov tried to downplay the move, but the reshuffle comes amid speculation about\u00a0infighting at the highest echelons of power. Just last month, one of Shoigu\u2019s long-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9s at the defense ministry was arrested and charged with corruption. Shoigu was \u201crelieved\u201d of his position by presidential decree, Peskov said, but he will remain an influential part of Putin\u2019s administration as secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council, replacing Nikolai Patrushev, a former head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who would \u201ctransfer to another job.\u201d Shoigu will also become the deputy in Russia\u2019s Military-Industrial Commission, Peskov said, as Putin embarks on a fifth term as president. The timing of Shoigu\u2019s exit is notable, coming off the back of several significant advances by Russian troops in eastern Ukraine. Russia has launched its most serious cross-border ground assault since Ukraine recaptured the northern Kharkiv region in the late summer of 2022. There have been several months of increased Russian air attacks on the city of Kharkiv amid a grinding advance in Donetsk in the east that has seen incremental but significant progress. Shoigu had helmed the country\u2019s defense ministry for 12 years and led the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russian troops initially caught Kyiv by surprise but were soon beaten back, exposing the weaknesses of Moscow\u2019s corruption-riddled military and its willingness to send waves of poorly trained and equipped soldiers into what Ukraine and Russian troops have both dubbed a \u201cmeat grinder.\u201d His critics have frequently described Shoigu as remote and out-of-touch with the realities of the conflict. His most forceful critic was the late Wagner chief\u00a0Yevgeny Prigozhin\u00a0who accused the Defense Ministry of starving his fighters of resources and bureaucratic incompetence before launching an unsuccessful mutiny last year and dying weeks later in a plane crash. Despite the criticism, Shoigu has remained a popular politician in Russia. Having spent two decades as the minister of emergency situations, he cultivated an image of a helpful official who brings help when it\u2019s needed. He is also a rare outsider in Putin\u2019s original inner circle, which consists mostly of the president\u2019s allies from his St. Petersburg political beginnings and his former KGB colleagues. Shoigu was born and grew up in the remote Siberian republic of Tuva and got into politics through his association with the former president Boris Yeltsin. Rising military spending and need for \u2018innovation\u2019 Belousov\u2019s appointment suggests Russia\u2019s strategy will continue to focus on outgunning Ukraine. Belousov was selected by Putin because of a need for \u201cinnovation,\u201d Peskov said in a press call, during which he highlighted the ministry\u2019s rising budget, saying it was approaching levels last seen during the Cold War. \u201cToday on the battlefield, the winner is the one who is more open to innovation,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cTherefore, it is natural that at the current stage, the president decided that the Russian Ministry of Defense should be headed by a civilian.\u201d In a reference to the war in Ukraine, Peskov said that due to \u201cwell-known geopolitical circumstances, we are gradually approaching the situation of the mid-80s when the share of expenses for the security bloc in the economy was 7.4%. It\u2019s not critical, but it\u2019s extremely important,\u201d Peskov said. The budget currently amounts to 6.7% of GDP, he said. Peskov highlighted Belousov\u2019s previous leadership experience and economic background. \u201cThis is not just a civilian, but a person who very successfully headed the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia, for a long time he was aide to the president on economic issues, and was also the first deputy chairman of the government in the previous cabinet of ministers,\u201d Peskov said. Much has been made of Belousov\u2019s civilian status, even though Shoigu himself has limited hands-on experience with the military. He holds a rank of a general as a result of his official roles and has never served in active service. Peskov added that the new appointment did not signal a shift in Russia\u2019s current military system. \u201cAs for the military component, this appointment will in no way change the current coordinate systems. The military component has always been the prerogative of the Chief of the General Staff [Valery Gerasimov], and he will continue his activities. No changes are currently envisaged\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0regard,\u201d he said. In his new role, Shoigu will oversee Russia\u2019s military industrial complex, Peskov said. \u201cHe is deeply immersed in this work, he knows very well the pace of production of military-industrial products at specific enterprises and often visits these enterprises,\u201d he said. The news follows the arrest last month of one of Shoigu\u2019s close allies, deputy defense minister Timur Ivanov, who was charged with taking a bribe in what was the country\u2019s highest-profile corruption scandal since Putin launched his full invasion of Ukraine more than two years ago. Ivanov has been accused of accepting a bribe of 1 million rubles (at least $10,800), according to Russian state media TASS. Former US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper told CNN in an interview Sunday that Putin\u2019s reshuffle is an \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cinteresting move.\u201d \u201cThe bigger argument coming out of Moscow right now is that Russia is moving toward a war economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re on a war footing.\u201d Esper said that \u201cone of the disappointing things about Shoigu\u2019s tenure is we thought the Russian army, at least during my time at the Pentagon, we thought they were professionalizing, that they were modernizing all their equipment, their doctrine, how they train and fight, and we really haven\u2019t seen that on the battlefield.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/12/europe/sergei-shoigu-putin-replaces-defense-minister-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

Beside them, a rescuer lowers their baby brother, 2-year-old Arian, to the rooftop, a sheet tied around his waist that was used to pull him from the raging floodwaters below. \u201cTake it, let\u2019s get take off the rope from his body,\u201d the rescuer says on the video. \u201cBring his mother to hold him in her arms and be warm.\u201d In the past few days, at least 300 people have been killed in flooding in 18 districts across at least three provinces in northern Afghanistan, according to the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme (WFP), with at least 200 injured. Videos show raging torrents of mud washing away mud houses \u2013 and people, their limbs flailing, in the fast-moving brown current, as would-be rescuers watch from\u00a0higher ground, beyond reach. The rescued children, ages 3, 5 and 6, were among eight siblings who were at home with their parents in Folo, in the Bulka district of Baghlan, when the flooding hit. Their uncle Barakatullah, son of Haji Wakil Besmillah, the local school headmaster, told CNN something ominous seemed to be brewing late last week when severe wind swept through the district and neighboring areas, enveloping everything in darkness. \u201cVisibility was so poor that we couldn\u2019t even see each other,\u201d he said. Then the rain started falling gently during Friday prayers \u2013 an unusual event for locals, who say it doesn\u2019t rain very often so high in the mountain region, home to around 10,000 people, he added. As the rain got heavier, suddenly the situation \u201cturned dire.\u201d \u201cPeople fled to higher ground, seeking refuge in mountains and hills. Unfortunately, some individuals who were unable to leave their homes fell victim to the floodwaters,\u201d he said. Aerial photos show belongings piled in plastic bags on rooftops, among them the hooded figures of women forced to cover their entire bodies even in times of disaster. \u201cWomen who were rescued are forced to wear mud-soaked garments, while even infants as young as 2 to 3 months old are clothed in similarly soiled attire,\u201d Barakatullah said. In Folo, more than 100 people are believed to have been killed, he said \u2013 mostly women and children. Some burials began over the weekend, but many more are already believed to be buried deep beneath mud. From drought and hunger to flooding The torrent swept away animals and farmland in an area already facing severe food shortages, according to Timothy Anderson, head of the WFP in Afghanistan. He said the areas hit by floods had already been marked vulnerable to starvation after a difficult summer when searing heat brought drought. \u201cIt was already pretty grim. And now it\u2019s catastrophic,\u201d he told CNN. Most years, locals expect to see flash flooding, he said.\u00a0But this year, it\u2019s been far worse. The loss of the homes and their land is devastating for survivors, who were already among some of the country\u2019s most impoverished people, Anderson said. \u201cWhen people lose a bit of livestock, that\u2019s actually their livelihood,\u201d he said. Road access to the worst affected areas has been cut by floodwaters, forcing the WFP to use donkeys to send in supplies. Within the first day, the WFP had distributed high energy biscuits and food for children. They\u2019re also supporting local bakeries to supply free bread. In the next days, teams will start distributing food to feed families for a month \u2013 what happens next is unclear. Anderson said 17 joint assessment teams are being sent to the area, along with other UN partners.\u00a0He said it\u2019ll take four or five days for the teams to properly examine the impact of the floods on people, and their housing and infrastructure. \u2018Bearing the brunt\u2019 of climate crisis This latest natural disaster comes after drought in Afghanistan, and is being seen as an example of a climate crisis hitting those who have least contributed to rising global temperatures. \u201cThey\u2019re not net emitters of carbon,\u201d said Anderson of the WFP. \u201cThis is a subsistence agriculture community and society. So, they\u2019re bearing the brunt of it, without having necessarily contributed to the issue very much.\u201d He said during the recent dry months, efforts had been made to help the community capture rainfall in dams and irrigation canals to sustain crops. Now those efforts have been washed away, posing another challenge. \u201cThe need is massive, not just in Afghanistan. The world is seeing the impacts of much larger, more severe events, whether that\u2019s drought, rainfalls cyclones,\u201d Anderson said. Richard Bennett, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan said the recent floods \u201care a stark reminder of Afghanistan\u2019s vulnerability to the climate crisis.\u201d And\u00a0in a statement Sunday,\u00a0Teresa Anderson, the Global Climate Justice Lead at ActionAid International, said: \u201cThe climate crisis continues to rear its ugly head.\u201d \u201cWith the latest incident, Afghanistan joins a long list of Global South countries grappling with floods this year,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/asia/afghanistan-flooding-children-rescued-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

Cold lava, also known as lahar, is a mixture of volcanic debris such as ash, sand and pebbles that flows down a volcano\u2019s slopes during wet weather. Images\u00a0shared by Indonesia\u2019s disaster response agency showed thick mud and ash partially covering roads and\u00a0mountainside villages near the foot of Mount Marapi, an active volcano in western Sumatra.

{"id": "2024_05_11_europe_ukraine-kharkiv-russia-attack-intl", "text": "For Ukraine,\u00a0May is turning out to be the cruellest month. The town of Vovchansk in\u00a0the northern\u00a0Kharkiv region, liberated from Russian occupation more than 18 months ago, awoke Friday to intense shelling and aerial bombardment. Russia\u00a0has found another way of stretching Ukraine\u2019s already thin blue line. President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials said that Russian efforts to advance towards the town had been thwarted, but the Russians have since tried to cut road links with\u00a0Vovchansk. The Russians launched battalion-strength attacks along a 60-kilometer stretch of the border\u00a0on Friday, claiming to occupy several villages in what is known as the \u2018gray zone\u2019 along the frontier,\u00a0after focusing much of their offensive capabilities this year on a grinding advance in Donetsk in the east that has seen incremental but significant progress. As of Saturday, it appeared the Russians still held a handful of Ukrainian border villages, with intense aerial bombardment continuing in the Vovchansk area. The\u00a0cross-border attack is yet another example of what\u2019s going wrong for the Ukrainians this year. Their forces are thinly stretched, with much less artillery than the Russians, grossly inadequate air defenses and above all a lack of soldiers. Their plight has been worsened by dry weather, allowing Russian mechanized units to move more easily. The deputy head of Ukrainian Defense Intelligence, Major-General Vadym Skibitsky, told the Economist last week: \u201cOur problem is very simple: we have no weapons. They always knew April and May would be a difficult time for us.\u201d Ukrainian intelligence estimates that despite immense losses since the full-scale invasion began, Russia has more than half-a-million men now inside Ukraine or at its borders. It is also \u201cgenerating a division of reserves\u201d in central Russia, according to Skibitsky. The northern border assault follows the creation of a new Russian military grouping\u00a0called\u00a0Sever [North].\u00a0 George Barros at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington told CNN that Sever is an \u201coperationally significant group.\u201d \u201cRussia sought to generate 60,000-100,000 troops for its group to attack Kharkiv and we assess it\u2019s closer to 50,000,\u201d Barros says, but \u201cit still has a lot of combat power.\u201d It\u2019s from this new force that units of armored infantry tried to cross the border. The available evidence suggests they were expected and suffered significant losses. But if more elite units join (there are reports that elements from\u00a0other divisions\u00a0may do so) Russia\u2019s\u00a0ambitions could\u00a0grow. As a Ukrainian special forces unit told CNN this weekend, \u201cThis is only the beginning, the Russians have a bridgehead for further offensives.\u201d One former Ukrainian officer who writes about the conflict on the blog Frontelligence says that \u201cManpower shortages compel Ukraine to avoid deploying large units along the border continuously, with fully stocked and ready for immediate-use artillery.\u201d He expects the situation to evolve, \u201cwith Russian forces deploying more units to penetrate additional border areas or to reinforce initial successes.\u201d Several analysts expect the Russians to broaden the border attacks westwards to Sumy region, which has seen months of raids by Russian special forces. The Sever grouping could not attack and occupy a city the size of Kharkiv, but that\u2019s likely not the goal. Barros says that it is instead to compel Ukrainian forces to pivot from Donetsk to Kharkiv region. The Russians seek to \u201cthin Ukrainian forces out along the 600-mile frontline and create opportunities, specifically in Donetsk oblast, which is Russia\u2019s main operational objective for 2024,\u201d Barros says. The latest cross-border assaults may also divert Ukrainian units from the defense of Kupiansk, also in Kharkiv region, where a Russian assault has stalled for months, as well as create a buffer zone inside Ukraine that the Kremlin says it wants to reduce attacks on Russian cities like Belgorod. Upping the tempo What\u2019s happening in Kharkiv is not isolated. The Ukrainian military acknowledged this week a spike in combat engagements (more than 150 on Thursday alone), coming on top of a marked increase from March to April. In effect, the Russians have the manpower to stretch Ukrainian defenses through multiple points of attack hundreds of kilometers apart, forcing Kyiv to guess where\u00a0and when\u00a0an anticipated early-summer offensive will focus. The increased tempo of attacks exacerbates Ukraine\u2019s two critical vulnerabilities: insufficient manpower and sparse air defenses. Russia is exploiting both in a hurry, keen to establish facts on the ground before a new wave of Western aid can help.\u00a0That is at least weeks away in any meaningful amounts. \u201cManpower remains a core challenge, and Ukraine is working to restore its existing degraded brigades as well as from about 10 new maneuver brigades,\u201d Barros says. Only in the last month has a law been passed to expand mobilization, nearly two years after Russia mobilized some 300,000 additional troops.\u00a0The process was bogged down in the Ukrainian parliament for months, and President Zelensky was wary of both the cost and the political fallout of a more extensive mobilization.\u00a0The numerical inferiority has sharply worsened across the frontlines, providing Russian commanders with a growing number of opportunities to probe for weaknesses. Western analysts believe that in Chasiv Yar, Donetsk, for example, the Ukrainians may be outnumbered by 10:1, as well as suffering a chronic imbalance in shells and a complete lack of air cover. One Ukrainian military blogger this week estimated that elements of as many as 15 Russian motorized rifle brigades (each of which would have up to 1,000 men) were operating in the Chasiv Yar direction alone. Lose the high ground around Chasiv Yar and an important belt of industrial towns and cities: Slaviansk, Kramatorsk and Kostyantinyvka, becomes much more vulnerable. Skibitsky told the Economist that losing Chasiv Yar was a distinct possibility - \u201cnot today or tomorrow, of course, but all depending on our reserves and supplies.\u201d North-east of Chasiv Yar, a soldier called Stanislav told Ukrainian television this week that after a month of \u201cvery active hostilities\u201d the Russians \u201care advancing from the direction of Kreminna, where they are accumulating great reserves.\u201d \u201cHuge numbers of Russian infantry are attacking day and night, in large and small groups,\u201d the soldier said. Besides the shortage of trained soldiers, \u201cRussia is leveraging Russian airspace as a sanctuary to strike Kharkiv oblast, highlighting the urgent need for the US to provide more long-range air defense assets and to allow the Ukrainians to use them to intercept Russian aircraft in Russian airspace,\u201d says Barros. The United States announced Friday a $400 million package of air defense munitions and other weapons, but much more will be needed. Ukraine\u2019s losses are compounded by a lack of\u00a0prepared defensive positions behind the front lines. where\u00a0they could\u00a0fall back. In Krasnohorivka, for example, Ukrainian units were able for months to use apartment buildings and a brick factory as defensive positions. Slowly they have been obliterated \u2013 with one Russian military blogger claiming that artillery fire had buried them \u201cunder the rubble of their own shelters.\u201d President Zelensky and others have talked more about \u201cactive defense\u201d \u2013 having better defensive fortifications as a building block to turn the tide on Russian advances. Zelensky himself has toured such fortifications. But they are too few and too late in critical areas, especially in Donetsk. Zelensky asserted this week that \u201cwe will be able to stop the [Russians] in the east\u201d when the aid arrives. But he acknowledged that \u201cthe situation there is really difficult\u201d and contended that the aid that\u2019s arrived so far is \u201cnot the volumes that were voted for.\u201d \u201cWe need everything to come faster,\u201d he added. Every day that it doesn\u2019t, the Russians edge forward \u2013 and the Ukrainians lose soldiers they can\u2019t afford to lose. Barros says the Russians were prepared for the hiatus in military aid. \u201cThe recent Russian gains we see now are not merely opportunistic; the Russians prepared for it and are now exploiting it. Ukraine may need to make difficult decisions due to slowness of US action and the dilemma that is now causing.\u201d That may amount to trading territory for time. And ultimately accepting that much of the territory now lost may not be recovered.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/europe/ukraine-kharkiv-russia-attack-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_tech_us-export-licenses-china-huawei-hnk-intl", "text": "The United States has revoked licenses that allowed companies including Intel\u00a0and Qualcomm to ship chips used for laptops and handsets to sanctioned Chinese telecoms equipment maker\u00a0Huawei\u00a0Technologies, three people familiar with the matter said. A fourth person said some of the companies were notified on Tuesday that their licenses were revoked effective immediately. The U.S. Commerce Department earlier in the day confirmed it had revoked some licenses but stopped short of naming the companies. A spokesperson for Intel (INTC) declined to comment. Qualcomm (QCOM) did not respond to a request for comment, and\u00a0Huawei\u00a0did not immediately respond. The move comes after the release last month of\u00a0Huawei\u2019s first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro powered by Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra 9 processor. The laptop launch drew fire from Republican lawmakers, who said it suggested to them that the Commerce Department had given the green light to Intel to sell the chip to\u00a0Huawei. \u201cWe have revoked certain licenses for exports to\u00a0Huawei,\u201d the Commerce Department said in a statement, declining to specify which ones it had withdrawn. The Commerce Department\u2019s move, first reported by Reuters, comes after concerted pressure by Republican China hawks in Congress who have been urging the Biden administration to take tougher action to thwart\u00a0Huawei. \u201cThis action will bolster US national security, protect American ingenuity, and diminish Communist China\u2019s ability to advance its technology,\u201d Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik said in a statement. The move could hurt\u00a0Huawei,\u00a0which still relies on Intel chips to power its laptops, and could hurt US suppliers that do business with the company. Intel has also been facing weak demand for its traditional data center and PC chips. Last month, it lost $11 billion in stock market value after forecasting second-quarter revenue and profit\u00a0below market estimates. Licenses needed Huawei\u00a0was placed on a US trade restriction list in 2019 amid fears it could spy on Americans, part of a broader effort to handicap China\u2019s ability to bolster its military. Being added to the list means the company\u2019s suppliers have to seek a special, difficult-to-obtain license before shipping. Even so, suppliers to\u00a0Huawei\u00a0have received licenses\u00a0worth billions of dollars to sell goods and technology to the company, including one\u00a0particularly controversial authorization issued by the Trump administration, which has allowed Intel to ship central processors to\u00a0Huawei\u00a0for use in its laptops since 2020. Qualcomm has sold older 4G chips to handset makers since receiving a license from US officials in 2020. In a regulatory filing earlier this month, Qualcomm said it did not expect to receive more chip revenue from\u00a0Huawei\u00a0beyond this year. However, Qualcomm still licenses its portfolio of 5G technologies to\u00a0Huawei, which last year began using a 5G chip designed by its HiSilicon unit that most analysts believe is manufactured in violation of US sanctions. Qualcomm said in the filing this month that its patent deal with\u00a0Huawei\u00a0expires early in Qualcomm\u2019s fiscal 2025 and that it has started negotiations to renew the deal. Critics argue such licenses have contributed to the company\u2019s resurgence. Huawei shocked the industry last August with a new phone powered by a sophisticated chip manufactured by Chinese chipmaker SMIC, despite US export restrictions on both companies. The phone helped\u00a0Huawei\u00a0smartphone sales spike 64% year on year in the first six weeks of 2024, according to research firm Counterpoint. Its smart car component business has also contributed to\u00a0Huawei\u2019s resurgence, with the company notching its fastest revenue growth in four years in 2023.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/tech/us-export-licenses-china-huawei-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

President Joe Biden will appear at the site in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, on Wednesday to highlight the administration\u2019s efforts to invest in job growth in America. The news comes six years after the Trump administration announced a $10 billion investment by tech manufacturer Foxconn \u2013 with the promise to bring 13,000 jobs to the area \u2013 on the same Wisconsin land, a plan that never materialized. The new center aims to create 2,300 union construction jobs and 2,000 permanent jobs over time, according to Microsoft. Microsoft said it will use the center to train about 100,000 workers across the state on generative AI by\u00a02030, thanks in part to a partnership with United Way Wisconsin, United Way Racine and other community partners. It also plans to open a lab on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to help companies and manufacturers infuse the technology into their businesses. Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella earned a master\u2019s degree in computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, according to his company profile.

In a statement sent to CNN, Foxconn parent company Hon Hai Technology Group said it \u201ccontinues to grow\u201d in Wisconsin and \u201csupports expansion of technology and innovation to the state.\u201d Foxconn, which said it has invested about $1 billion into the state, still has a major manufacturing site for data servers in Racine County with more than 1,000 employees. It has facilities in 205 locations across 24 countries. \u201cEmployment at Foxconn Wisconsin has grown at least 42% in the three years since 2020,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe have been Racine County\u2019s largest taxpayer in recent years.\u201d The president\u2019s visit to the key battleground state will also present an opportunity for the White House to try to highlight some of the Biden administration\u2019s key first term achievements \u2014 and specifically, funding from legislation like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the so called \u201cChips Act,\u201d which invests in semiconductor chip manufacturing in the United States, that will boost the Badger State. In a fact sheet released by the White House ahead of the president\u2019s visit, the administration says that 177,000 jobs have been added in Wisconsin \u2013 4,000 specifically in Racine \u2013 since the president took office in 2021. Last year, Biden signed an executive order on AI aimed to get entrepreneurs access to technical assistance and resources, help small businesses commercialize AI breakthroughs, and expand grants for AI research in areas such as healthcare and climate change. The White House also introduced an order in 2023 to require AI system developers to share results of their safety tests with the federal government before they are released to the public. Microsoft\u2019s move comes at a time when the government seeks to monitor and regulate the risks of artificial intelligence. In March, Biden urged Congress during his State of the Union address to pass legislation to regulate artificial intelligence, including banning \u201cAI voice impersonation and more.\u201d He said lawmakers need to \u201charness the promise of AI and protect us from its peril,\u201d warning of the technology\u2019s risks to Americans if left unchecked. Beyond AI, Wisconsin is seeing a spate of funding toward futuristic industries. The state received $6.9 billion from Biden\u2019s \u201cInvesting in America\u201d agenda for infrastructure and clean energy.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/tech/microsoft-ai-wisconsin/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

Prince Harry arrived on Tuesday afternoon ahead of events and meetings related to the biennial sporting competition he founded a decade ago. \ufeffHuge cheers erupted from crowds gathered along police barriers in the spring sunshine outside St Paul\u2019s as the duke arrived. After waving to well-wishers, he was greeted at the cathedral\u2019s door by the Dean of St. Paul\u2019s before being escorted to his seat at the front of the congregation. Actor Damian Lewis recited the Invictus poem by William Ernest Henley at the service, and the Duke later delivered a reading from I Corinthians 12. 4-11. Harry was expected to attend a reception following the one-hour service. He was supported at the event by members from his late mother Princess Diana\u2019s side of the family. Earl Charles Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes sat directly behind their nephew, with Harry chatting with his aunt before the event got underway. A few miles away, the first Buckingham Palace garden party of the season was taking place, hosted by the King and Queen. They were joined by several senior royals including Princess Anne and the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. The fifth in line to the British throne will not be catching up with his father during the visit home, however, due to \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s full program,\u201d according to his spokesperson. \u201cThe Duke of course is understanding of his father\u2019s diary of commitments and various other priorities and hopes to see him soon,\u201d the spokesperson added. Buckingham Palace has not commented on the duke\u2019s visit. Harry has had a difficult relationship with his wider family since he and his wife, Meghan, stepped back from royal duties and moved to the United States in 2020. He is also not expected to meet his brother, Prince William, during the visit. Harry, 39, does not appear to have been accompanied by the Duchess of Sussex for his visit to the UK. Their son, Prince Archie, turned five on Monday. The last time the duke was back in his home country was in February on a fleeting visit after his father\u2019s\u00a0cancer diagnosis\u00a0was announced. Charles is continuing with treatment for an undisclosed cancer but he returned to public duties last week after his doctors said they were \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by his progress. The past few months have been a tumultuous period for Britain\u2019s royal family. Harry\u2019s sister-in-law, Catherine, Princess of Wales, revealed her own cancer battle in March and has asked for privacy while she undergoes treatment. The inaugural Invictus Games, an international sporting competition for wounded veterans and members of the military, was held in London in 2014. Following the Invictus celebrations in London, Harry and Meghan will head to Nigeria at the invitation of the Nigerian Defence Headquarters. Nigeria became\u00a0Africa\u2019s first participant\u00a0in the games last year. The next Invictus Games will be held in Vancouver and Whistler in Canada in February 2025. More than 500 competitors from over 20 nations will compete in adaptive sports such as indoor rowing, sitting volleyball, swimming, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball. Last week, the cities of Birmingham in the UK and Washington, DC in the US were announced as the shortlist to host the event in 2027.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/uk/prince-harry-king-charles-invictus-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_style_platon-photographer-portraits", "text": "Vladimir Putin, Muammar Gaddafi, Mark Zuckerberg. Presidents and Hollywood stars; political dissidents, abuse survivors and immigrants. One thing unites them all: a slightly scuffed, white wooden box. \u201cMore world leaders have sat on that box than any chair in history,\u201d the photographer Platon, owner of that very box, told CNN in an interview conducted over Zoom. For some world leaders, the scarcity of his set \u2014 sitting on the box in front of a plain black or white sheet of paper \u2014 can be intimidating, stripping them of their usual grandeur. For others it\u2019s liberating, allowing the human to shine through the professional storyteller. For the subjects of Platon\u2019s new book \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d the box became an opportunity. \u201cThere\u2019s a statement that\u2019s quite common in the human rights community,\u201d Platon said. \u201c\u2018Giving a voice to the voiceless\u2019. I have learned through my experiences that it\u2019s not right to say that. They have beautiful, powerful, strong voices; the issue is that those voices have been ignored.\u201d Through his work, he explained his mission is to help amplify people\u2019s stories, tuning into their humanity as though they were \u201can old-fashioned radio\u201d. Unseating power Born in Greece in 1968, Platon Antoniou moved to the UK aged eight and completed his studies in photography at the Royal College of Art, before leaving London for a career in New York. There, he worked on George magazine with John Kennedy Jr. and as a staff photographer at the New Yorker magazine. \u201cThe Defenders\u201d takes a different tack to Platon\u2019s earlier work. As a young photographer, he confessed he was dazzled by the world of politicians and celebrities he was working with, walking the corridors of the Kremlin and Downing Street and \u201chaving a chat about life\u201d in George Clooney\u2019s garden. Turning his lens to the powerless, by contrast, has upturned his ideas of power altogether. \u201cHaving photographed all these world leaders, often the people I meet in the trenches of the human rights movement are proper leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey transform their adversity into compassion for others. And that\u2019s something I very rarely see on that level in the political sphere. So I called them \u2014 I call the book \u2014 \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d because it\u2019s a superhero title. These are ordinary people who do extraordinary things, and I do think of them as superheroes. Changing the narrative is very important for me.\u201d Among \u201cThe Defenders\u201d are Burmese and Egyptian dissidents, the imprisoned Russian punk band Pussy Riot, and survivors of sexual violence at Dr. Denis Mukwege\u2019s Panzi Hospital in Congo. One of the girls that Platon photographed there was Esther Faraja. She appeared in an episode of Netflix\u2019s \u201cAbstract: The Art of Design,\u201d profiling Platon, although he said the details of the trauma she suffered were \u201ctoo harsh to put in the film.\u201d \u201cAs I was taking the picture, she wasn\u2019t crying,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\u2019m a privileged, middle-aged white man, and I\u2019m a mess. I said to her, \u2018how is it that I\u2019m crying, and you\u2019re not crying? And yet, you\u2019re the one that has suffered?\u2019 And she said: \u2018the reason I don\u2019t cry in your picture is because I don\u2019t want to make you feel sad. I don\u2019t want anyone to feel sad when they look at a picture of me. My mommy and daddy brought me into this world to bring joy to the world. And I will keep my promise\u2019.\u201d Platon is as awestruck now as he was standing in front of her. \u201cNow that is a leader,\u201d he said. \u201cI made a promise to her that I will deliver her message of compassion and strength, combined, to as many people as I can.\u201d \u201cThe Defenders\u201d is an attempt to tell dozens of stories like hers, each captured in one 500th of a second. \u201cTime is a very interesting concept; it doesn\u2019t really ever exist,\u201d Platon mused. \u201cYou try to freeze a moment that helps us understand the past and will still be relevant in the future. And yet, it was a moment in the present. And it was such a tiny fragment of a moment that if you blinked, you wouldn\u2019t even have seen it.\u201d Two political giants offer obvious examples of time\u2019s bizarre effect. Vladimir Putin, photographed by Platon for Time\u2019s Person of the Year in 2007, initially liked the image that Platon produced. He appears powerful. In the time since its publication, however, the same image has been taken, edited, and circulated by political dissidents to mock Putin and belittle his power. \u201cI heard in the last two years that anyone who\u2019s caught circulating my picture in connection with human rights issues will go to jail,\u201d Platon said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s the same picture. And Putin likes it.\u201d Bill Clinton, on a December 2000 cover of Esquire courtesy of Platon, has also been changed with age. \u201cAt the time, that picture represented insane levels of charisma,\u201d Platon recalled. \u201cHe was great with people \u2014 everyone says there\u2019s no one more charismatic than Bill Clinton. We look at it through a different lens now, but it\u2019s the same picture. When I get it right, that same picture works for everybody.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work for Hillary Clinton, though. \u201cHillary refuses to sit for me,\u201d Platon noted. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the only politicians who\u2019s ever said no. And that\u2019s interesting. The \u2018no\u2019 now is actually as interesting as the \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d Great responsibility Distilling broad, complicated, emotional human stories into one fleeting moment is a tribulation of all photography, including that of world leaders, but it was particularly difficult when it came to the sensitive topics broached in \u201cThe Defenders\u201d. \u201cMany of (the people photographed) risk their lives and their security telling me these stories,\u201d Platon said. \u201cI cannot be reckless. I cannot be \u2014 I must not be \u2014 a thrill-seeker.\u201d Exerting due diligence and handling sensitive subjects thoughtfully is something that Platon admits is a luxury of time; he is able to spend months on a project, producing the most considered and provoking images he can. Increasingly, however, a lot of the photography flooding social media is taken hastily, captured on phones and shared without so much as a pause for breath. In \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d Platon remembers the Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi coming out of house arrest and being bewildered by the sea of smartphones pointed at her. \u201cNow everyone\u2019s a photographer, and everyone\u2019s a filmmaker,\u201d Platon observed. \u201cIn many ways, that\u2019s fantastic. People are holding the powers that be accountable in a new way. The danger is that there\u2019s so much information that we\u2019re constantly distracted. It\u2019s very difficult to get that moment of reflection and pause, and to stand back and think for yourself. As you\u2019re even doing that, your phone is dinging and clicking and beeping \u2014 it\u2019s constant noise.\u201d In standing back, Platon was able to join the dots between the movements he was documenting; they weren\u2019t isolated struggles, he realized, but connected ones. \u201cObviously each geopolitical situation is inherently different, but they are all fighting for very basic human principles,\u201d he said. \u201cI photographed LGBTQ+ defenders in Burma and in Russia. That\u2019s two very, very different countries, with the same cause.\u201d In capturing and amplifying the stories of \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d Platon hopes to inspire and instruct other people, just as he was inspired and instructed. \u201cIt\u2019s really a handbook to the new generation to say: roll up your sleeves, get involved. Society needs a new generation of activists who will think differently. They will have a different path to navigate, but the principles remain timeless and the same. It\u2019s the principles that unite us all. The way we fight, the tools we fight with, the strategies \u2014 we have to change those, because times change. But the principles stay the same.\u201d \u201cThe Defenders\u201d, published by MW Editions, is available now.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/style/platon-photographer-portraits/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_world_beethoven-science-newsletter-wt-scn", "text": "Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s \u201cOde to Joy\u201d is one of the first songs I learned to play on the violin. I\u2019ll never forget the elation I felt playing the iconic fourth movement of his Ninth Symphony alongside my fellow orchestra members, each note joining in a celebration of togetherness. But every ebullient music moment has a flip side, and Beethoven also poured his feelings of despair into his final symphony. Beethoven began experiencing hearing loss in his 20s and became deaf in his 30s \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop him from composing some of his greatest and most enduring pieces. It was the classical composer\u2019s wish that his health issues would be understood and conveyed to the public. While his doctor\u2019s notes were lost to time, scientists\u00a0sequenced Beethoven\u2019s genome from locks of his hair\u00a0last year. Now, researchers are one step closer to understanding the troubled genius\u2019 mysterious ailments. Explorations A new analysis of Beethoven\u2019s hair has shown the composer experienced lead poisoning toward the end of his life. He died at age 56 in 1827. Tests revealed incredibly elevated levels of lead, as well as arsenic and mercury, in two of his locks, likely from drinking wine that was sweetened with lead. Researchers don\u2019t believe lead poisoning would have been enough to kill him, but it could have contributed to the composer\u2019s well-known gastrointestinal issues and deafness. Unlocking the factors that led to Beethoven\u2019s death due to kidney and liver diseases could also shed light on how the composer transformed his pain into music. \u201cPeople say, \u2018The music is the music, why do we need to know about any of this stuff?\u2019 But in Beethoven\u2019s life, there is a connection between his suffering and the music,\u201d said William Meredith, a Beethoven scholar. Solar update Dazzling auroras could appear in the skies over locations as far south as Alabama this weekend due to a rare spike in solar activity. Scientists at the Space Weather Prediction Center have observed multiple flares and coronal mass ejections. The large clouds of ionized gas, called plasma, and dynamic magnetic fields are erupting from a cluster of sunspots that measures 16 times the diameter of Earth. The forecasted solar storm has the potential to disrupt the power grid and communications on Earth, but experts agree that there is no need for people to take extraordinary measures to prepare for space weather. However, you may want to take photos of the sky with your phone, as your camera may capture the dancing lights of the aurora borealis. We are family Millions of years ago, lava flows on Earth created a network of vast subterranean tunnels called lava tubes, providing a perfect place for our Neolithic ancestors to beat the heat. During the Stone Age, as early as 7,000 years ago, the tunnels sheltered herders and their livestock from the relentless heat and wind of the Arabian Peninsula. Researchers in Saudi Arabia uncovered carvings of images showcasing\u00a0stick-figure humans alongside animals such as dogs and sheep\u00a0on the walls at Umm Jirsan. Artifacts have helped archaeologists piece together the story of the people who sought refuge in the lava tubes as well as how they adapted to such arid environments. Once upon a planet Strange creatures began appearing on Earth more than 500 million years ago \u2014 and scientists now think it\u2019s because Earth\u2019s protective magnetic field nearly collapsed. The first life-forms were single-celled, microscopic organisms. But 591 million years ago, Earth\u2019s magnetic field weakened drastically, potentially allowing for an increase in oxygen in the atmosphere. After this event, animals with\u00a0strikingly odd fan, doughnut and tube shapes\u00a0appeared in the fossil record, representing the first complex animals on the planet. Consequences A rare event is transforming the Great Barrier Reef, as well as reef systems around the world, into\u00a0silent marine graveyards. It\u2019s the fourth mass coral bleaching event, driven by rising ocean temperatures amid the climate crisis, since the late 1990s, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Marine heat waves stress corals, causing them to expel algae and drain their colors, and the die-off is occurring at unprecedented levels, experts say. \u201cWhat is happening now in our oceans is like wildfires underwater,\u201d said Kate Quigley, principal research scientist at Australia\u2019s Minderoo Foundation. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have so much warming that we\u2019re going to get to a tipping point, and we won\u2019t be able to come back from that.\u201d Discoveries Take your time exploring these new findings: \u2014 When being attacked by predators, a dice snake fakes its own death as a protective measure \u2014 and it uses\u00a0gory special effects to pull off a convincing theatrical display. \u2014 The Dark Energy Camera captured a dramatic image of the cosmic feature\u00a0\u201cGod\u2019s Hand\u201d that appears to reach for a defenseless galaxy\u00a0\u2014 but it\u2019s really a rarely seen celestial phenomenon. \u2014 The first historic crewed flight test of Boeing\u2019s Starling spacecraft has been rescheduled to no earlier than May 17 after a faulty valve halted a launch attempt on Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/world/beethoven-science-newsletter-wt-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_08_europe_dice-snakes-fake-own-death-special-effects-intl-scli-scn", "text": "Awards season may be over for human actors this year, but there\u2019s no rest for some of nature\u2019s most audacious thespians. Dice snakes can fake their own death when being attacked by predators, putting on a theatrical display that includes smearing themselves with their own poop and letting blood ooze from their mouths.  And dice snakes that use these extra dramatic effects spend less time feigning their own deaths, and consequently less time in a dangerous situation, than their counterparts that don\u2019t use this strategy, a study published on Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters found. Many different animals fake their own death as a defense mechanism against predators, with examples seen among insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, but just how \u2013 and to what degree \u2013 it works is still unclear. \u201cThere are conflicting theories about the origin of death feigning,\u201d Vuka\u0161in Bjelica, a research associate at the University of Belgrade in Serbia and one of the study\u2019s authors, told CNN via email. \u201cSome say it is a conscious response while others are adamant it is not. One theory is that it is the \u2018most primitive\u2019 defense response, similar to freezing in a high stress situation,\u201d he said. Lying motionless and exposing vulnerable body parts to a predator is risky, and so researchers from the University of Belgrade hypothesized that the more dramatic the show, the less time snakes would have to spend in danger. To test this, the researchers traveled to Golem Grad, an island in a lake in North Macedonia, where the snakes are common. There, they grabbed hold of 263 of the nonvenomous dice snakes and pinched them with their fingers to simulate the actions of a predator, before releasing each snake and timing its subsequent behavior as it feigned death. They observed that some snakes played dead by leaving their mouth wide open, some  smeared themselves with poop and others oozed blood from their mouth, too. The 28 snakes that bled from the mouth spent two seconds less on average feigning their death, the study found, though some snakes that didn\u2019t unleash the full theatrics spent a shorter amount of time playing dead too, perhaps due to other factors like temperature, sex or size.  Overall, the snakes spent between about six and 24 seconds playing dead. Bleeding from the mouth was a relatively uncommon behavior and observed in only 28 of the snakes tested, while smearing occurred in 124 of the cases. Not all the snakes tested feigned their own death. Juvenile snakes captured faked death for a much shorter time period and bled from the mouth much less, and these behaviors were completely absent in newly hatched snakes from a similar species, the study said, perhaps because of the dangers associated with it. Antipredator behavior is dependent on many different things, like the sex of the individual, body temperature, size, age, presence of food in the gut, presence of eggs in females, previous experience with a predator and preexisting injuries, Bjelica said. \u201cIt is still not exactly clear how each individual \u2018tailors\u2019 their antipredator response and our observations are mainly limited as most of them come from interactions with human researchers and not observations of real life encounters with natural predators,\u201d he added. Smearing itself with poop makes the snake less appetizing for its predator, which researchers said explains why snakes that do this before playing dead then spend less time in this situation. While the snakes don\u2019t squirt blood directly at their predators, like horned lizards do, bleeding from the mouth signals their apparent death to the predator. Researchers believe the bleeding is caused by an increase in blood pressure, prompted by high levels of stress hormones, Bjelica said. The study\u2019s results now need to be replicated in other species and ecosystems, the researchers said, adding that future research should focus on the precise sequence of behaviors displayed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/europe/dice-snakes-fake-own-death-special-effects-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.

But it now says the Palestinian militant group is trying to \u201creassemble\u201d in the area, raising doubts about whether Israel\u2019s goal to eradicate the group in the enclave is realistic. Israel\u2019s renewed ground operation began on Saturday, with intense shelling and gunfire gripping much of the Jabalya refugee camp in northern Gaza. The Israeli military also began operating in the area of Zeitoun in central Gaza, as it continues its offensive in eastern Rafah and near the Rafah crossing with Egypt. Israel\u2019s return to pockets it had supposedly cleared of Hamas renews questions about its long-term military strategy, which after more than seven months of war has left more than 35,000 Palestinians dead and much of Gaza in ruins \u2013 but more than 100 hostages from Israel still in captivity and Hamas\u2019 top leadership still at large. The resumption in fighting in the north comes as talks aimed at reaching a ceasefire-for-hostages deal have stalled, and as the Biden administration signals that the United States is losing patience with its closest ally in the Middle East. Over the weekend, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave a scathing assessment of Israel\u2019s conduct in the war. In an interview on Sunday with CBS News, Blinken said any initial success in Israel\u2019s invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah \u2013 which Washington has strongly opposed \u2013 is \u201cnot sustainable.\u201d The top diplomat criticized Israel for neither having a \u201ccredible plan to protect civilians,\u201d nor a post-war plan for Gaza. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing parts of Gaza that Israel has cleared of Hamas, where Hamas is coming back, including in the north, including in Khan Younis,\u201d Blinken said, adding that a ground offensive in Rafah will leave Israel \u201cholding the bag on an enduring insurgency because a lot of armed Hamas will be left no matter what they do in Rafah.\u201d \u201cOr if they (Israel) leave and get out of Gaza as we believe they need to do, then you\u2019re going to have a vacuum and a vacuum that\u2019s likely to be filled by chaos by anarchy, and ultimately by Hamas again.\u201d Some Israeli experts say that Netanyahu\u2019s current war strategy, which is aimed at the complete destruction of Hamas in Gaza, is flawed and unrealistic as it lacks a long-term vision. \u201cIsrael\u2019s strategy is not a good one,\u201d said Danny Orbach, a military historian at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The tactic of endless clearing and degrading of Hamas\u2019 capabilities while avoiding the responsibility of governing Gaza will not work, he said. Netanyahu has previously said Israel will have the \u201coverall security responsibility\u201d in Gaza for an \u201cindefinite period\u201d after the war ends, a position that is at odds with that of the US. With no viable alternative government in place, Netanyahu \u201cas usual decides not to decide,\u201d Orbach said, adding that the ongoing strategy of \u201cclearing and degrading\u201d allows the prime minister to avoid making difficult decisions about post-war Gaza, while preventing Hamas from re-emerging as strong as it was before October 7. The Israeli leader is yet to present a post-war plan for the enclave. The US has pushed for a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA) to rule Gaza, which Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected. The PA is a government-in-waiting for a future independent Palestinian state it seeks in the occupied West Bank, occupied East Jerusalem and Gaza as part of a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Netanyahu has repeatedly said the military is on track to eliminate Hamas, and in an interview with Dr. Phil on Friday claimed that 14,000 Hamas fighters have so far been killed. Israel estimated Gaza to have 30,000 fighters before October 7. CNN cannot independently verify the figures provided by either the Palestinian health ministry or Israel due to reporting restrictions on international media. Former and current Israeli officials, including a top military figure, have sounded alarms at the direction Israel is heading with its war. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Major General Herzi Halevi over the weekend reportedly criticized Netanyahu\u2019s strategy. \u00a0\u201cAs long as there is no political move that will bring forth a governing body other than Hamas in the strip, we will have to operate again and again there and in other places to dismantle the Hamas infrastructure,\u201d Israel\u2019s Channel 13 cited Halevi as saying. \u201cIt will be a Sisyphean task,\u201d he said, suggesting that it may never be accomplished. Senior IDF officials have urged the prime minister to make decisions and formulate a strategy for the war, Channel 13 added. Israel\u2019s former head of military intelligence, Tamir Hayman, has also urged Israel\u2019s leadership to strike a hostage deal that includes an indefinite ceasefire and work with a reformed Palestinian Authority to restore order in Gaza. Hayman, who now heads the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, told CNN earlier that Israel risks falling into a perpetual war of attrition, where there is \u201cendless friction\u201d with its neighbors. A prolonged war, he said, risks either leaving Gaza under Hamas rule or at the mercy of a power vacuum where various armed groups may compete for authority. Others say the re-emergence of Hamas \u201cpockets\u201d is not unusual, and that the Israeli military will have to keep re-entering areas in Gaza until no more fighters emerge. \u201cThis process will happen again and again,\u201d Amir Aviv, former deputy commander of the Gaza Division of Israel\u2019s military, told CNN, until all \u201cpockets of resistance\u201d are removed. The former deputy commander believes it is possible to eradicate Hamas though. \u201cGaza is not endless, it is not so big,\u201d he said. \u201c(Israel) has reached the last stronghold (Rafah), and now Hamas is with their backs to the wall.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/middleeast/israel-restarts-fighting-north-gaza-military-strategy-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_11_europe_european-parliament-populists-security-concerns-intl-cmd", "text": "Right-wing populists are set to make unprecedented gains in the\u00a0elections to the\u00a0European Parliament\u00a0taking\u00a0place next month. As European officials brace for a new-look parliament, there are growing concerns that the 27-nation bloc could become more vulnerable to adversarial states seeking to do the union harm. Polling data\u00a0suggests that far-right Members of the European Parliament\u00a0(MEPs)\u00a0could have enough seats to, together, block the passage of European Union legislation, creating a massive headache for the union as a whole. As important as this\u00a0shift\u00a0may\u00a0become in influencing the most powerful people in Brussels and the direction of the bloc, officials are now\u00a0concerned about the impact this will have on the EU\u2019s security. The recent arrest\u00a0of a German national working as an aide to a far-right MEP\u00a0on suspicion of spying for China\u00a0has fueled fears that a substantial influx of Euroskeptic, anti-establishment figures who have lived lives on the fringes of\u00a0mainstream\u00a0politics\u00a0will mean a lot of sitting ducks for adversarial states to target. \u201cElected populists are uniquely attractive to malign actors for two reasons,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0James Shires, co-director of the European Cyber Conflict Research Initiative. \u201cFirst, they are anti-establishment figures who don\u2019t trust the institutions or structures they now work inside. It is hard to make the jump from believing there is an establishment conspiracy against you to cooperating with those institutions to counter security threats,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cSecond, in many cases, there is instinctive alignment with states like China or Russia. They agree with them in certain areas and are happy to put forward views, and even spread misinformation, on their behalf.\u201d While hostile actors attempting to influence politicians is hardly new, an influx of populists to an institution\u00a0like the European Parliament at this precise moment in time is particularly concerning. One point European security officials make is that these smaller, newer\u00a0parties don\u2019t have much experience of working with security services, or even\u00a0have much experience \u2014 or indeed interest \u2014\u00a0in vetting their own\u00a0candidates or staffers. The European Parliament itself does not have a unit set up to screen parliamentarians and relies on the 27\u00a0EU\u00a0member states who send MEPs to Brussels and Strasbourg. \u201cFor some countries, that is a six-month process, in others it can take two years,\u201d a senior\u00a0European\u00a0Parliament source told CNN. \u201cLarge parts of the EU treaties don\u2019t apply to security services, so we have very little central oversight and countries are not obliged to send us sensitive information. We can do criminal record checks but, you\u2019ll be shocked to learn, most spies don\u2019t have active criminal records.\u201d What damage could an MEP actually do once elected to the European Parliament? There are multiple opportunities to wreak havoc from inside the system, but two in particular stand out. The first is more innocuous on the surface. MEPs are allowed to make speeches in\u00a0parliament that are recorded, clipped and promoted on social media. Many British former MEPs\u00a0used these speeches to great effect between 2010 and 2016 as a way of spreading Euroskepticism in Britain. This ultimately\u00a0played into\u00a0Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. If\u00a0MEPs\u00a0want\u00a0to stand up and spread misinformation or disinformation that aligns with\u00a0the objectives of\u00a0states who are hostile to the EU, they are perfectly entitled to do so. They can stand up and denounce Europe\u2019s support for Ukraine, rail against equal marriage and climate change, all to undermine Western ideas and sow disunity. Knowingly or unknowingly, it doesn\u2019t matter: If it aligns with the interests of a hostile state, it aligns with the interests of a hostile state. This is difficult for the EU because, unless\u00a0an MEP is\u00a0being paid directly by a foreign state to lobby and lie on\u00a0its\u00a0behalf, it\u2019s perfectly legal. \u201cOne can be \u2018Putinist\u2019, or \u2018Xi\u2019st\u2019, and that is OK \u2014 in the sense that they have\u00a0a\u00a0right to their opinion. It only becomes an issue if they are working with foreign powers to advance their agenda,\u201d an EU security source\u00a0told CNN. \u201cOtherwise, it is democratically legitimate for them to have an opinion and express it in the Parliament.\u201d The second major way an MEP or member of\u00a0their staff could hurt the EU to the benefit of a hostile state is through illegal means. Leaking sensitive information\u00a0to which\u00a0they have access, aiding\u00a0in\u00a0cyberattacks, stealing documents and handing them over to foreign actors \u2013\u00a0what is considered\u00a0more classic espionage. Between the 27 member states \u2014\u00a0all of whom have embassies, multiple institutions, hundreds of elected officials and thousands of members of staff \u2014\u00a0Brussels is a place where lots of sensitive information is flying around.\u00a0Quite a bit of it gets leaked. Anything from future EU plans to\u00a0the\u00a0personal details of individuals could be valuable to those who wish to do the EU harm. One senior EU diplomat\u00a0told CNN that this was of particular concern now that Europe is taking more serious and direct action in security and defense policy in response to Russia\u2019s\u00a0full-scale\u00a0invasion of Ukraine\u00a0in 2022. With Brussels seeking to be taken ever more seriously as a diplomatic player, its own security will come under increasing pressure from international rivals. Whether it takes sufficient measures to stop those who want to\u00a0do it\u00a0harm\u00a0rests solely with the EU and its member states.\u00a0And failure to do so could scupper those grand ambitions of greater global relevance.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/europe/european-parliament-populists-security-concerns-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_weather_flooding-severe-storms-south-monday", "text": "Another round of storms is drenching the waterlogged South and bringing yet another threat of damaging winds, tornadoes and flash flooding, including in parts of Texas where hundreds of people were rescued during torrential downpours earlier this month. Between 3 and 6 inches of rain have already fallen along the Gulf Coast in a stripe from East Texas to Mississippi, and more heavy rain is expected throughout the day as storms hug the coast and track across Texas. More than 9 million people are under flood watches in an expanse stretching from Central Texas to southeast Georgia, including the rain-weary areas just north of Houston. Metropolitan hubs including New Orleans and Shreveport in Louisiana; Mobile, Alabama; and Tallahassee, Florida, could see flooding. And it\u2019s not just rainy. The storms have also packed a damaging punch: A hurricane-force wind gust topping 80 mph was reported in the Florida Panhandle Monday morning. \u201cSevere thunderstorms are expected through tonight from south central and southeast Texas across southern Louisiana, as well as the Florida Panhandle. The potential exists for multiple corridors of significant wind gusts, very large hail, and a few tornadoes,\u201d warned the Storm Prediction Center. The South has been battered by several rounds of rain and severe thunderstorms over the past week. Severe storms moved through Texas and into Louisiana on Sunday, bringing tennis ball-sized hail and prompting the National Weather Service to issue tornado watches and flash flood warnings. In Tallahassee, officials are warning residents to \u201cstay weather aware in the coming days.\u201d The city, Florida\u2019s capital, is still recovering from Friday\u2019s deadly tornadoes and 100 mph winds. Close to 20% of Tallahassee\u2019s Leon County was still without power Monday morning after the storms broke hundreds of utility poles and downed countless trees and power lines, city officials said. On Monday, powerful winds, hail up to 4 inches in diameter and a handful of tornadoes are expected as storms advance into the Gulf Coast and another wall of severe storms begins to ramp up across eastern Texas and Louisiana. The heaviest downpours are forecast from southeastern Louisiana to western Florida. Rainfall rates in the area could reach 3 inches per hour and combine with Sunday\u2019s storms to reach as high as 8 inches of\u00a0total rainfall. Parts of the Southeast have endured a relentless barrage of severe storms over the last two weeks, pelting the region with damaging winds and hail and dangerous tornadoes and flooding. River gauges across eastern Texas and Louisiana are still running high from the rainfall over a week ago, including the Trinity River, which is\u00a0still in major flood stage northeast of Houston. Several other rivers across both states are at moderate flood stage. On Tuesday, the threat shifts further southeast and an area extending from the Florida Panhandle to the Carolinas is forecast to see the bulk of the storms. Texas gets pounded by brutal weather Severe storms lashing Texas are just the latest in a series of severe weather events plaguing the state since early April. Dozens of tornadoes have hit from the Texas Panhandle to the Gulf Coast in the last month, leaving paths of destroyed homes and businesses in their wake. Some areas of the state have also been showered with softball-sized hail and months\u2019-worth of rain has soaked East Texas, causing rivers to rise to levels not seen since the devastating floods of Hurricane Harvey in 2017. In early May, in Harris County, Texas, more than 200 people had to be rescued from homes and vehicles as downpours caused rivers to overflow and roads were plunged underwater. Many people had to leave livestock stranded and more than 150 pets were rescued in the storms, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo told CNN. Just days before, some communities north of Houston picked up nearly two months\u2019 worth of rain, which led to evacuations and water rescues. The back-to-back rounds of rain leave the region especially vulnerable to flash flooding as rivers are already swollen and soils have little capacity to soak up more water.

{"id": "2024_05_06_europe_putin-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drill-russia-ukraine-intl", "text": "President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian forces to rehearse deploying tactical nuclear weapons, as part of military drills to respond to what he called \u201cthreats\u201d by the West. Since invading Ukraine in 2022, Putin has repeatedly made veiled threats to use tactical nuclear weapons against the West, but Monday marked the first time Russia has publicly announced drills. \u201cDuring the exercises, a set of measures will be carried out to practice the issues of preparation and use of non-strategic nuclear weapons,\u201d Russia\u2019s defense ministry said. Non-strategic, or \u201ctactical,\u201d nuclear weapons can be used in battlefield situations, carrying less power than strategic nuclear weapons, which have the potential to level entire cities. Russia\u2019s defense ministry said the drills were ordered after \u201cprovocative statements and threats\u201d by Western officials against Russia, which Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said had reached \u201cunprecedented levels.\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron last week reaffirmed that he would not rule out sending Western troops to Ukraine, as he warned of the risks Russia poses to European security and other countries near its borders. \u201cI\u2019m not ruling anything out, because we are facing someone who is not ruling anything out,\u201d Macron told The Economist magazine. \u201cI have a clear strategic objective: Russia cannot win in Ukraine. If Russia wins in Ukraine, there will be no security in Europe. Who can pretend that Russia will stop there?\u201d And during a visit to Ukraine last week, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said that Ukraine could use British-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia. \u201cIn terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view it is their decision about how to use these weapons. They are defending their country. They were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps,\u201d Cameron told reporters after the United Kingdom pledged continued financial and military support for Ukraine. The drills announcement also comes shortly after the United States last month passed a long-delayed aid package for Kyiv, which will allow desperately needed military equipment and ammunition to flow to Ukraine as it tries to shore up its frontlines in the face of a renewed Russian onslaughts. Russian forces last month made further gains in at least three locations along Ukraine\u2019s eastern front, as Moscow tries to press home its manpower and ammunition advantage before the bulk of the US aid arrives in Ukraine. Russia has tended to raise the nuclear specter when its invasion of Ukraine has hit obstacles or when other countries make new pledges of support for Ukraine. After Ukraine liberated large swathes of its territory in late 2022, Putin conceded that the war is \u201cgoing to take a while\u201d and warned of the \u201cincreasing\u201d threat of nuclear war. In February last year, Putin announced that Russia would suspend participation in the New START treaty, a key nuclear arms reduction agreement with the United States, the last remaining pact that regulates the world\u2019s two largest nuclear arsenals. Putin said Russia would not be the first to test nuclear weapons, but would do so in the event of a US test. After Macron said in February that sending Western troops to Ukraine could not be ruled out, Putin warned \u201cthis really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and therefore the destruction of civilization.\u201d US President Joe Biden and State Department officials have previously downplayed concerns that Putin could deploy a nuclear weapon, but continue to take the threats seriously. In response to Russia\u2019s latest announcement, the US said it had seen no change in Russia\u2019s \u201cstrategic force posture\u201d following Moscow\u2019s announcement that it would begin tactical nuclear weapons drills, according to Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder. Ryder said Russia\u2019s announcement is \u201ccompletely inappropriate,\u201d and \u201can example of the kind of irresponsible rhetoric that we\u2019ve seen from Russia in the past.\u201d In late 2022, the US began \u201cpreparing rigorously\u201d for Russia potentially striking Ukraine with a tactical nuclear weapon, in what would have been the first nuclear attack in war since the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki nearly 80 years before, two senior administration officials previously told CNN. In Monday\u2019s announcement, Russia\u2019s defense ministry said the military\u2019s General Staff had begun preparations for conducting \u201cexercises in the near future with missile formations of the Southern Military District involving aviation as well as naval forces.\u201d On Tuesday, the Defense Ministry of Belarus said on Telegram it had held a \u201csurprise inspection\u201d of non-strategic nuclear arms carriers. President Alexander Lukashenko ordered the inspection to \u201ctest the entire range of activities from planning, preparation, and use of strikes with tactical nuclear weapons,\u201d according to Belarusian Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin. Khrenin also said that \u201ca division of the Iskander operational-tactical complex and a squadron of Su-25 aircraft\u201d have been transferred into positions for the drills. Belarus does not possess its own nuclear weapons. Russia and Belarus signed an agreement to place Moscow\u2019s non-strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus in May of 2023 and the transfer was completed by October of that year. Lukashenko has previously said that the nuclear weapons stationed in Belarus are for \u201cdefensive purposes\u201d only and could be used to \u201crespond to aggression.\u201d CNN\u2019s Natasha Bertrand and Mariya Knight contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/06/europe/putin-tactical-nuclear-weapon-drill-russia-ukraine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

The typically jovial event \u2013 one of the most watched in the world\u2019s cultural calendar \u2013 descended into turmoil in recent days, as organizers in host country Sweden tried and failed to contain anger aimed towards Israel\u2019s delegation. But Nemo, a favorite throughout the process, won over crowds with a stunning rendition of \u201cThe Code,\u201d a genre-bending anthem about their journey towards accepting their non-binary identity. \u201cI hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue to stand for peace and dignity for every person,\u201d Nemo said after accepting the trophy. \u201cI have to say this whole experience was really intense and not just pleasant all the way.

Their win \u2013 the first for a non-binary person \u2013 was Switzerland\u2019s first triumph since Celine Dion won in 1988. Malmo hosted the competition on the 50th anniversary of ABBA\u2019s Eurovision breakout, but the event quickly found itself facing political controversy, and tension grew in the hours leading to the final. Protesters said the event was \u201cartwashing\u201d Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians since being launched in the wake of the militant group\u2019s October 7 attacks on Israel. But organizer the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) defended Israel\u2019s presence, and insisted the contest is non-political \u2013 a line that became increasingly untenable as artists, broadcasters and fans clashed over the presence of Israel\u2019s singer Eden Golan. Golan was booed by some members of the crowd during her performance, while a few turned their backs or left the arena, but more attendees cheered the Israeli performance. And outside the arena, police surrounded a small group of pro-Palestinian protesters, keeping them separate from crowds arriving for the event as they chanted \u201cFree, free Palestine!\u201d and \u201cBoycott the Eurovision.\u201d Ireland\u2019s Bambie Thug meanwhile told CNN in the build-up to the event that it was \u201cthe wrong decision\u201d not to exclude Israel, as Russia had been two years ago.

There\u2019s so much depth to Eurovision that I didn\u2019t know of before.\u201d \u201cIf I win, I will throw a big party on the lake of my hometown, Biel,\u201d they told CNN. Just hours before the event, it was thrown into added turmoil when the EBU disqualified the Dutch entrant for a backstage incident involving a female crew member. The EBU said police were investigating the incident involving the singer Joost Klein and that it would not be appropriate for him to participate. Some fans made their anger at the decision clear during the final by booing EBU representatives when they appeared onscreen. The Saturday-night showpiece event featured celebrations of ABBA and other Swedish musical stars, and performances from 26 finalists that spanned genre, language and style.

Their first engagement was an event hosted at a school in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, where Meghan told students: \u201cI see myself in all of you.\u201d Outside the Lightway Academy, students lined up patiently to welcome the royal couple, alongside a troupe of dancers. They were there to kick off a two-day mental health summit run by the GEANCO Foundation, which supports girls and young women across the country with menstrual health products and education. \u201cWe\u2019re so honored to be with you. We have got to acknowledge those amazing dance moves! My husband was excited to jump up!\u201d Meghan told cheering students in the school\u2019s hall. Harry then jumped into the conversation, asking the children about their knowledge of mental health and reminding them to look after themselves and each other. \u201cWill you promise to us that after today, no more being scared, no more being unsure of mental health. If you are unsure, then ask. Ask your teachers. Ask your friends. Be there for one another,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see your friend in your class not smiling, what are you gonna do? You gonna check in with them? Are you gonna ask him if they\u2019re okay? \u2018cause it\u2019s okay not to be okay.\u201d As they were leaving, the couple were given a traditional wooden mask and a set of books about Nigerian heritage. \u201cI need to read these now,\u201d the duchess added. Prince Harry and Meghan were invited to Nigeria by the chief of defense staff, Christopher Musa, the country\u2019s highest-ranking military official. He formally welcomed them to Nigeria at a meeting Friday lunchtime at the defense headquarters in the heart of Abuja. The duke expressed gratitude to their hosts, commending Nigeria for recognizing the power of sport in the rehabilitation process for the injured or wounded. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first country to notice that it not only transforms lives but saves lives. I\u2019m eternally grateful to you all of you for joining the Invictus movement for Nigeria and for every single soul who\u2019s been injured protecting the freedoms of Nigeria,\u201d he said. Marquis said the duchess was keen to accompany her husband on the visit \u201cas part of her lineage and heritage.\u201d Meghan revealed in 2022 that she discovered she was 43% Nigerian from a genealogy test. The trip to Nigeria sparked a wave of excitement among the public when it was announced two weeks ago. Oyeyemi Aderibigbe, 38, a Lagos-based lawyer, told CNN, \u201cI have watched Harry\u2019s evolution and quest for personal expression\u2026 and I love how bold he is about living authentically. Meghan was my favorite character in the \u2018Suits\u2019 series. I love how she has spent so much time using her voice for good, openly sharing her experiences.\u201d \u201cTogether, they are using their influence to democratize opportunity and push causes for the advantage of underrepresented groups. I would love to see them at an event with young people in politics in Nigeria,\u201d she added. Entrepreneur Ife Durosinmi-Etti spoke of her joy that Meghan was \u201ccoming to a place that she\u2019s absolutely loved and welcomed.\u201d \u201cIt got me all giddy when I found out about her Nigerian heritage because Nigerian women are smart, resilient, multitalented, they go after what they want and that\u2019s exactly how I see her, so when I heard; I was like, \u2018Yup, that\u2019s it, it\u2019s the Nigerian Spirit in her,\u2019\u201d the 35-year-old said. A packed itinerary This is the Sussexes\u2019 first trip as a couple to Nigeria, where they will be heavily promoting Invictus as well as the themes of mental health and female empowerment.  Harry flew to Abuja after a quick visit to London, where he attended events marking the 10th anniversary of his Invictus Games, a Paralympics-style event for wounded, injured and sick military personnel and veterans. Meghan flew in from Los Angeles, and together, they are following a busy schedule, which includes visiting a military rehabilitation center and local organizations dedicated to supporting veterans\u2019 welfare. On Saturday, the duke is also scheduled to join wounded veterans during a sitting volleyball game and later, his wife is expected to co-host a women\u2019s leadership event with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director-general of the World Trade Organization. As it has been described as a private visit, the royal couple will not be meeting with Nigeria\u2019s president, Bola Tinubu. However, they will meet with the governors of Lagos and Kaduna State. The UK\u2019s high commissioner to Nigeria, Richard Montgomery, told local media that there wouldn\u2019t be a meeting with the Nigerian leader because \u201cthey are visiting in a private capacity, not an official one.\u201d Profound challenges Nigeria\u2019s military personnel face profound challenges, particularly as the country has been combating the Boko Haram insurgency since 2009. On Friday, Musa told the couple more about some of the issues \u2013 like terrorism and criminality \u2013 that the armed forces contend with, adding that IEDs present \u201cthe greatest challenge\u201d for them. In response, the duke shared that he was looking forward to visiting a hospital supporting military personnel in Kaduna, a city in the north of the country. The couple\u2019s hosts, the Nigerian Defence Headquarters, are eager to be involved further in the Invictus Games and to be part of the wider Invictus community. Recalling how the most recent games, which were held in Germany last year, saw Nigeria become the first African country to participate, Harry reminisced: \u201cThe team that turned up in D\u00fcsseldorf was small but mighty. They danced their way into the stage. They won medals and danced off the stage. They were the life and soul of those games. Our goal now is to help you grow that team and provide as much opportunity and resource here in Nigeria and for the games that are coming at the beginning of next year.\u201d Marquis said taking part in the Invictus Games recovery program has boosted the morale of Nigerian soldiers and Nigeria has expressed interest in hosting the games, which take place every two years. He added: \u201cEighty percent of our soldiers involved in these recovery programs have a better outlook in life and say it has given them the opportunity to improve their self-esteem and mental health.\u201d Cpl. Effiom Antigha, captain of Team Nigeria, told CNN last year that the games gave him a new lease on life. \u201cBefore now, I didn\u2019t think I could engage myself in any of these sporting activities. The Invictus Foundation has helped develop me physically and mentally.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/africa/prince-harry-meghan-nigerian-visit-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_13_americas_haiti-mss-unodc-guns-drugs-intl-latam", "text": "On the rare days that the hills surrounding Port-au-Prince fall silent, people notice. \u201cIf you can\u2019t hear shooting somewhere, the gangs are probably running low on ammunition,\u201d a police source in the\u00a0Haitian capital told CNN. \u201cBut when there\u2019s a lot of shooting, they\u2019ve definitely received a fresh shipment.\u201d For over two months, Port-au-Prince has been cut off from the world, its international seaport and airport shuttered following an explosion of gang attacks in late February. All major roads are blocked by gang checkpoints. For most people living here, there is no way out \u2013 and no way to bring in desperately needed food and medicine. Encircling the Caribbean nation is another closed perimeter, this one created by\u00a0Haiti\u2019s neighbors. The Dominican Republic has sealed the island\u2019s shared border and airspace. The Bahamas has launched\u00a0a naval blockade\u00a0to keep\u00a0Haitians from fleeing the crisis by boat; the UK has\u00a0sent a warship\u00a0to ward off anyone seeking refuge in Turks and Caicos, a British overseas territory; and the US state of Florida has\u00a0increased marine and aviation patrols. And yet guns, bullets and drugs keep pouring in, crossing international waters and airspace to reach the embattled country \u2013 most of the firepower originating from the US. \u201cHaiti\u00a0doesn\u2019t produce guns and ammunition, yet the gang members don\u2019t seem to have any trouble accessing those things,\u201d says Pierre Esperance, executive director of\u00a0Haiti\u2019s National Human Rights Defense Network. Since the start of the year, thousands of people have been killed in gang-related violence and hundreds kidnapped, including at least 21 children, UN figures show. Stopping the flow of guns to\u00a0Haiti\u00a0would likely have an immediate impact on the bloodshed, according to police and human rights experts. \u201cWe have to cut the gangs\u2019 weapons supply lines. This is absolutely the most important thing now,\u201d the police source told CNN. \u201cBecause when they don\u2019t have bullets, their machine guns become nothing more than clubs.\u201d And as a Kenyan-led multinational security support force (MSS) prepares to deploy to\u00a0Haiti, starving the gangs of ammunition should be a top priority for the US, says William O\u2019Neill, the UN Designated Expert of the High Commissioner on the situation of Human Rights in Haiti. \u201cAll of these countries that are contributing their young men and women (to the MSS), how can we make it safer for them to do their job? One way the US could help immediately and directly would be to really seriously crack down on the flow of illegal weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gangs have literally nothing else; their only currency is intimidation and fear.\u201d Defying a global arms embargo Eighteen months ago, the UN Security Council imposed\u00a0an arms embargo on\u00a0Haiti, which bans the export of weapons to anyone in the country other than the government. The US has also taken independent steps to crack down on illicit exports, appointing a regional coordinator for firearms prosecution in the Caribbean and a\u00a0special unit\u00a0to investigate transnational crimes in\u00a0Haiti. Yet the guns keep coming. In January, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) warned that\u00a0Haiti-bound firearms and ammunition were being \u201croutinely incorporated into outbound shipments at warehouses near seaports and airports\u201d in Florida, citing interviews with US customs officials. The following month,\u00a0Haiti\u2019s gangs put their weapons to devastating use, taking the country hostage in an explosion of coordinated violence that forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign, and led to the creation of a transitional governing council that has so far been mired in disagreement. \u201cThe planes have not stopped flying. There continue to be exchanges of both ammunition and arms across the border,\u201d Sylvie Bertrand, the UNODC regional representative, told CNN recently, urging the global community to enforce the arms embargo. But amid today\u2019s chaos, experts say it is likely becoming easier than ever for the gangs to resupply, as they now control major routes and infrastructure to bypass official controls. \u201cThere are always weapons coming in. There are always bullets,\u201d Vitel\u2019homme Innocent, leader of the Kraze Bary\u00e9 gang, told CNN in April, his masked entourage bristling with a globally manufactured assortment of firepower. Weapons experts who later analyzed some of CNN\u2019s images from the encounter said they could spot weapons and accessory parts originating from Israel, Turkey, the Czech Republic, probably Brazil \u2013 and, overwhelmingly, from the United States. An \u2018iron river\u2019 from the United States The guns\u00a0Haiti\u2019s gangs wield are a mix of stolen and smuggled, and the United States is by far the main source of the latter, according to UN experts. From 2020 to 2022, over 80% of the weapons seized in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0and submitted to US authorities for tracing were manufactured in or imported from the United States,\u00a0UNODC\u00a0reported in January,\u00a0citing the most-recent available tracing data. \u00a0They are typically purchased in the US from federally licensed retail outlets, gun shows or pawn shops through \u201cstraw man\u201d intermediaries, the agency also found. It\u2019s all part of a phenomenon that experts in Latin America and the Caribbean call the \u201ciron river\u201d \u2013 a flood of guns bought in US states with lax gun laws, and then shipped across the region to criminal groups. The Mexican government, which has been outspoken about the issue, currently has a $10 billion lawsuit pending against several US gun manufacturers whose products, it says, arm powerful cartels. A senior agent at the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which investigates the diversion of lawfully purchased guns to illegal ends, told CNN that Miami is a significant source of weapons sent to\u00a0Haiti, which have historically been trafficked in small freighters by family networks. \u201cThose are difficult to enforce because they\u2019re not your typical commercial freighter\u2026 it\u2019s relatively easy to conceal a small number of firearms in those shipments,\u201d he said. Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia are also sources of weapons trafficked to the Caribbean, where the ATF has a specialized gun intelligence unit to track and stop such flows, he added. Asked whether the US was doing enough, he emphasized that combatting gun trafficking was a top priority. \u201cIt is a very high priority of the United States government and ATF\u2019s role in that, to stem the flow of illegal firearms, whether domestic or international, and particularly places like\u00a0Haiti\u00a0where the rule of law is under extreme threat.\u201d In January, Joly Germine \u2013 leader of the gang 400 Mawozo \u2013 pleaded guilty to\u00a0US charges over a gunrunning scheme\u00a0that saw dozens of rifles, handguns and a shotgun purchased legally in Florida under false pretenses, and smuggled into\u00a0Haiti. Land of mountains From above, traces of Haiti\u2019s extensive smuggling networks come into focus: the scars of a clandestine airstrip in its sun-bleached Central Plateau, a dock jutting from gang-held territory into the still waters of the Gulf of Gonave. Sea and air are the main means of transport for the guns and the drugs trans-shipments that fund more weapons purchases, experts say. And while\u00a0Haitian authorities have seen some successes in seizing illicit cargo over the years, the dramatic peaks and plains of this \u201cland of mountains\u201d add difficulty for an already understaffed police force and customs agency. Haiti\u2019s secluded and sparsely populated rural areas are ideal for landings and take-offs by small planes aiming to avoid observation. There are at least 11 known informal or clandestine airstrips in the country, according to UNODC, many originally built for humanitarian purposes following the country\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake. \u201cHere, you don\u2019t have anything around you. So, you just go, probably in the middle of the night, with a couple vehicles parked on each side of the improvised runway so the pilot can identify the area. They land, drop off or pick up stuff, and take off again all outside of\u00a0Haitian jurisdiction,\u201d a\u00a0security expert in Port-au-Prince told CNN. The sea is the preferred option for arms smugglers given the weight of their cargo.\u00a0Haiti\u2019s roughly horseshoe shape offers\u00a0over 1,100 miles of coastline, a challenging distance to comprehensively patrol for\u00a0Haiti\u2019s coast guard. Haiti\u2019s south in particular has emerged as a strategic location for smugglers, the UNODC reported in April, offering entry points for cocaine from South America, cannabis from Jamaica and firearms from across the region. \u201cOne popular method of moving illegal products involves \u201cbanana boats,\u201d go-fast vessels that arrive at night, beach on coastal banana plantations, and are subsequently destroyed after unloading their cargo,\u201d the UNODC report details. Guns and ammunition that arrive in the south are frequently sent onward to Port-au-Prince via the gang-controlled Route National 3, it also said, identifying the Mariani gang, Grand Ravine gang, and 5 Segond gang as \u201cmajor players in the organization and distribution of arms, munitions and drugs.\u201d In 2022, 5 Segond group attacked\u00a0Haiti\u2019s largest flour mill. It would have been an incongruous target if not for its location, positioned right next to Port-au-Prince Bay with a large jetty to accept deliveries. Just about a mile inland lies a major highway, and in between the two is a massive warehouse; a perfect distribution set-up for any import entrepreneur. Today, the entire area is controlled by 5 Segond, with security sources telling CNN that they believe the mill has been taken over and no longer functions. \u201cIzo has the jetty, so he has access to the sea. And boats keep coming in and out of that area, which again is completely controlled by his gang\u2026 and is kept under tight control, with barricades in the surroundings,\u201d the same security expert said, referring to 5 Segond\u2019s rapper frontman\u00a0Andre Johnson, who often posts videos of gang members flashing guns and paramilitary gear set to music on social media. Containers and corruption Contraband arriving via secretive small boats and planes is just part of the picture. Last month,\u00a0Haitian National Police and Customs agents seized\u00a0more than two dozen firearms, including 12 assault rifles, and nearly a thousand cartridges\u00a0from a shipping container that had arrived\u00a0in Haiti\u2019s northern city of Cap\u00a0Haitien. Drugs and arms smuggling has a long history in\u00a0Haiti, much of it facilitated through official channels by government agents and even, in one 2022 case, by a rogue Episcopal church staffer who allegedly hid guns and thousands of rounds in a shipping container reportedly labeled as church donations, before it was seized by customs agents in Port-au-Prince. Customs officials\u00a0trying to do their job\u00a0on the front lines in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0can face threats to their lives. In 2018, local press reported that several customs agents at the Malpasse border crossing between the Dominican Republic and\u00a0Haiti\u00a0were burned alive after an argument erupted in the course of a cargo inspection. Allegations of smuggling and gang affiliations have also been made at the highest levels of\u00a0Haiti\u2019s government. Four former\u00a0Haitian senators\u00a0have been sanctioned by the US for alleged drug trafficking, as have multiple past presidents and prime ministers of\u00a0Haiti\u00a0for allegedly financing the country\u2019s gangs. They\u2019re part of what gang leader Innocent refers to as the country\u2019s \u201coligarchs,\u201d who historically created and armed local gangs to become their enforcers-for-hire as they profited from white-collar crime schemes. \u201cAs a\u00a0Haitian human rights defender, I can\u2019t say that all the responsibility for these guns is on the US \u2013 I think it\u2019s the\u00a0Haitian government too. They need to regain control of the port, they need to control customs. The problem is corruption,\u201d says Esperance, the human rights advocate. That\u2019s why, he says, the planned deployment of an international police force to restore calm to\u00a0Haiti\u00a0is destined to fail unless the US and global community also commit to fighting corruption, building frameworks for good governance, and closing legal loopholes abused by the country\u2019s elite. \u201cNow, of course, the government is completely destabilized, it\u2019s easy for the gangs to smuggle weapons themselves. But how did they begin? Just two years ago, smuggling was going through official channels, and it happened that way because everyone was corrupt,\u201d Esperance said. Bertrand, the UNODC representative, also emphasized the importance of building up\u00a0Haiti\u2019s institutions as its new government takes shape. Her agency is working to strengthen the country\u2019s customs authority and coast guard, for example, including providing much-needed equipment from protective gear to cargo scanners. \u201cIt\u2019s time for people in\u00a0Haiti\u00a0to live peacefully \u2013 for their kids to go back to school, for them to be able to eat every day.\u201d And that means, she says, ensuring that \u201cnational authorities are well-trained, well-equipped, and ready to face and curb down the level of violence.\u201d CNN reached out to Homeland Security Investigations, part of the US Department of Homeland Security; the US Department of Commerce\u2019s Office of Export Enforcement, Haiti\u2019s National Police and Haiti\u2019s General Customs Administration for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/13/americas/haiti-mss-unodc-guns-drugs-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

On Saturday, stars gathered on the steps of The Music Center in Los Angeles for the Gold Gala \u2014 a celebration of Asian Pacific influential talent across entertainment, fashion, technology and more, hosted by the non-profit Gold House. And they were dressed to represent \u2014 many proudly embracing Asian designers and cultural heritage through their red carpet looks. Actor Karrueche Tran stunned in a striking red ao dai with a sheer overlay and headpiece by Vietnamese American fashion designer Thai Nguyen. \u201cI knew I had to represent my culture, half of who I am, in a major way,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. Tran has a Vietnamese mother and African American father. Taiwanese drag queen Nymphia Wind, who recently won \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d told CNN that her ensemble by Singaporean designer Sheng Cheong \u2014 a dress and cape featuring a bold print of neon yellow and white \u201claser cut clouds\u201d \u2014 was intended to \u201creimagine what club kids would look like in the Forbidden City.\u201d Elsewhere, Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar wore an ornately embroidered suit jacket by Rimple and Harpeet \u2014 an Indian fashion brand that specializes in handcrafted pieces inspired by ancient crafts and vintage textiles \u2014 and Indonesian singer Agnez Mo accessorized with golden hair pins and an elegant hand fan. \u201cAnything goes here and that\u2019s what is so celebratory,\u201d TV personality Jeannie Mai told CNN of the event, which is sometimes described as the \u201cAsian Pacific Met Gala.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the one place where you can really represent and be invited to do so.\u201d The glitzy affair honors the Gold House\u2019s annual A100 list \u2014 one hundred Asian Pacific leaders who have made a significant impact on culture and society. Author and TV host Padma Lakshmi, actor Lucy Liu and the cast and creator of Netflix\u2019s Emmy-award winning series \u201cBeef\u201d were among honorees. For actor and comedian Joel Kim Booster, the significance of a gala feting so many people in the AAPI community, was not lost. \u201cEvents like this are so exciting to me because when I was coming up, I think there was a lot of energy like, there\u2019s only going to be one of us in the room,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so rewarding to be in a space like this where we\u2019re all coming together and supporting each other. It\u2019s not something that I grew up imagining I\u2019d have for myself.\u201d There have been barriers across industries; in Hollywood, Asians have historically been underrepresented or stereotyped. But that has changed in recent years. A\u202fjoint study\u202fby Gold House and the USC Annenberg found the percentage of speaking Asian characters in top box-office films in the US rose from 3.4% in 2007 to 15.9% in 2022. The roles themselves are more complex. The age of streaming has also ushered in more opportunities for diverse and daring storytelling \u2014 on and off screen. FX\u2019s Shogun, for example, became an instant hit when it premiered in February. Not only does it feature a predominantly Asian cast who speak mostly in Japanese \u2014 behind the scenes, Japanese experts in everything from samurai dramas to a \u201cmaster of gesture,\u201d were brought in to ensure authenticity. \u201cI think what the industry has realized is that Asian creativity and Asian talent is a) different and b) lucrative.

The crowd on Saturday waved\u00a0Georgian, European Union and some Ukrainian flags and in a break with the past, included more older protesters as well as the many young people who have thronged the streets over the past month. \u201cThe government should hear the free people of\u00a0Georgia,\u201d said one protester in her 30s who gave her name as Nino, waved a large\u00a0Georgian flag and led one of three columns that converged on the city center, which blocked many of the city\u2019s roads and filled the cobblestoned heart of Tbilisi\u2019s old town. \u201cWe want to enter the European Union with our proud nation and our dignity,\u201d she said. Anuki, a 22-year-old student of acting, said it was her generation\u2019s responsibility \u201cto make sure that our future and the future of generations after us are safe, that they have freedom of speech, and they are free, basically.\u201d \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want to be part of Russia,\u201d she added. \u201cWe never wanted to be part of Russia. And it has always been and always will be our goal to be part of Europe.\u201d Parliament, which is controlled by the ruling\u00a0Georgian Dream party and its allies, will begin committee hearings on the bill\u2019s third and final reading on Monday. Opposition groups had called for a fresh wave of protests from Saturday. The crisis has pitted the\u00a0Georgian Dream ruling party against a coalition of opposition parties, civil society, celebrities and the country\u2019s figurehead president, with mass demonstrations shutting down much of central Tbilisi almost nightly for more than a month. Georgian opponents of the bill have dubbed it \u201cthe Russian law,\u201d comparing it to legislation used to target critics of\u00a0President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u2019s Kremlin. The European Union, which granted\u00a0Georgia\u00a0candidate status in December, has said that the bill will pose a serious obstacle to further integration if passed. Georgian Dream says the bill will promote transparency and\u00a0Georgian national sovereignty. Bidzina\u00a0Ivanishvili, the founder of\u00a0Georgian Dream, has said the law is necessary to stop the West trying to use\u00a0Georgians\u00a0as \u201ccannon fodder\u201d in a confrontation with Russia. Sullivan\u00a0said that\u00a0Georgian Dream appeared to be deliberately trying to break with the West, even as both the ruling party and\u00a0Georgian public opinion has traditionally been in favor of the country joining the EU and the US-led NATO military alliance. Sullivan wrote: \u201cGeorgian Dream\u2019s recent rhetoric, proposed legislative changes, and actions go against the aspirations of the\u00a0Georgian people and are designed to isolate\u00a0Georgians from the United States and Europe.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/europe/georgia-foreign-agents-bill-protests-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_vietage-luxury-train-vietnam-anantara-intl-hnk", "text": "There\u2019s nothing quite like settling back into your train seat, the urban skyline out the window fading into lush natural landscapes as you make your way to your next destination. According to rail experts, an increasing number of luxury travelers are looking to experience this sensation, all part of a global shift towards slower and more sustainable tourism activities. Anantara is among the hospitality giants now tapping into this demand, with the high-end hotel brand offering a new five-hour luxury train experience in southern Vietnam that connects the popular resort destinations of Na Trang and Quy Nhon \u2013 its second route in the country. The first \u201cThe Vietage by Anantara\u201d luxury train carriage launched in 2020 \u2013 a six-hour journey connecting Da Nang and Quy Nhon. Ananatara\u2019s head of PR and marketing for Vietnam, Kate Jones tells CNN the new carriage heads in the opposite direction and aims to expose travelers to even more of Vietnam\u2019s beautiful views. Like the first Vietage carriage, it will be attached to Vietnam\u2019s state-run commercial railway that runs up and down the country. \u201cThe main difference is that the new route connecting Nha Trang and Quy Nhon passes through many more coastal areas than the journey between Da Nang and Quy Nhon,\u201d says Jones. \u201cThere is a selection of really quite stunning bays and some striking coastline facing the East Sea. There are some mountainous areas and still plenty of rice paddies and lotus ponds, but the coastal scenery is the biggest view \u2018pull\u2019 for this five-hour journey.\u201d This is slow travel at its best \u2013 the trains hit an average speed of 51.9 kilometers per hour (32.2 mph) according to Anantara. That gives guests on the Quy Nhon-Nha Trang route plenty of time to enjoy their complimentary afternoon tea set, which includes local caviar, Vietnamese artisanal cheeses, a selection of cold cuts and premium Vietnamese teas. For the six-hour journeys between Da Nang and Quy Nhon, passengers are served a pre-ordered three-course gourmet meal. Guests on either route also get complimentary snacks, free-flow wine, cocktails, mocktails, teas, coffee and soft drinks, plus a 15-minute head and shoulder treatment. The Vietage carriage is fitted out with a sit-up bar, restroom facilities and six private booths that seat two, each of which comes with power outlets, charging stations, free wifi and amenity baskets with pillows, blankets and other essentials. Travelers can reserve their seats online at Thevietagetrain.com, while those wanting to combine their rail journeys with a stay at one of Anantara\u2019s properties \u2013 \u2013 Anantara Hoi An Resort, Anantara Quy Nhon Villas or Avani Quy Nhon Resort \u2013 can book packages through those individual hotel websites. The cost of a one-way Vietage journey is $420 per person. The new route departs from Nha Trang Train Station at 2 p.m., arriving at Dieu Tri Station in Quy Nhon at 6:29 p.m. For those preferring to travel in the opposite direction, trains depart Dieu Tri Train Station at 2:15 p.m. - arriving at Nha Trang Train Station at 6:36 p.m. The original route departs from Da Nang Train Station at 8 a.m., arriving at Quy Nhon\u2019s Dieu Tri Station at 2:03 p.m. There is also an evening option that departs Quy Nhon at 7:00 p.m., arriving in Da Nang at 12:53 a.m. the following day. This Vietage journey is slightly cheaper, costing $315 per passenger. As for demand, Jones says many are turning to rail travel rather than \u201crushing through airports to get from A to B.\u201d \u201cThe domestic aviation industry in Vietnam right now is also facing some challenges with the disappearance of two airlines and a reduced fleet with the national carrier, so overall air travel is currently not popular, plus overly expensive,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Vietage is the only experience of its kind in Vietnam and, of course, with the return of the Belmond train, the awareness of luxury rail travel is growing in Southeast Asia.\u201d In addition to traveling slowly and more sustainably, Jones says rail travelers gain real visual insights into the country, taking in scenes like \u201crural villages, fishermen casting their nets, farmers in fields with the water buffaloes \u2013 things you definitely don\u2019t experience at 35,000 feet.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/vietage-luxury-train-vietnam-anantara-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

The suspect was indicted on a charge of forced disappearance in the case involving the three tourists, whose bodies were found last week dumped in a 50-foot well with gunshot wounds to the head. The prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement Wednesday that it would also press charges of homicide. Brothers Jake and Callum Robinson and their friend Jack Carter Rhoad were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana when they went missing. Mexican authorities believe that at some point between the afternoon of April 27 and the following morning, several people approached the surfers intending to steal their vehicle, and \u201cdue to the reaction of the victims, they deprived them of their lives.\u201d Authorities said the suspect \u2013 one of three Mexican citizens who have been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping in the case \u2013 was captured a \u201cfew hours\u201d later. \u201cOther evidence was also collected, such as rods from tents, firearm casings, plastic gallon bottles, blood stains, and drag marks, in the place where they were presumably camping,\u201d authorities said. While Baja California\u00a0has been plagued by drug cartel violence in recent years, it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada. Dozens of people held a protest last week in Ensenada calling on authorities to do more to tackle violence facing tourists and locals alike. Many held up surfboards with slogans written on them in tribute to the three slain tourists. Drug cartels have terrorized Mexico with ever-increasing levels of violence, fueled in part by huge demand for drugs from US consumers and armed with an arsenal of weaponry from north of the border. While parts of Mexico are established tourist destinations, violent crime including kidnapping and human trafficking plague parts of the country, particularly in border areas. Mexico\u2019s\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is among the highest in the world, and\u00a0more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country.\u00a0Studies show only around seven percent of murders in Mexico are ever solved.

{"id": "travel_article_turkey-by-boat", "text": "Fringed by mountains, Turkey\u2019s southern Aegean coast is dotted with lively resorts and quaint quays in sleepy villages, pine-backed beaches, and translucent bays studded with ancient ruins.  With summer meltemi winds filling your sails, it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s best regions for a holiday afloat. You can spend your days exploring secluded swimming spots, enjoying long lunches on vine-covered terraces lapped by clear waters, and your nights mooring up under the stars in magical coves, many of which are only accessible by boat.  So whether you\u2019re a seasoned yachtie or happier lounging on the deck of a luxury gullet (Turkey\u2019s traditional-style motor sailing yachts) or even just a traveler keen on day trips on the water, here are some spots worth checking out on Turkey\u2019s Turquoise Coast.    Gulf of G\u00f6kova   Starting from the increasingly stylish fishing town of Yal\u0131kavak on the northwest tip of the Bodrum peninsula (and its ultra-modern marina), head south to G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fl\u00fck.  The quay of this small, sheltered bay opposite the Greek island of Kalymnos is lined with restaurants offering mezes, fresh fish, octopus, calamari and Turkish staples such as lahmacun (Turkish pizza), kofte and kebabs, all washed down with raki, the national drink.   Mimoza is an upmarket option with homemade lanterns hanging from the trees and whitewashed rafters, while Fenerci, overlooking little Tav\u015fan Ada (Rabbit Island) in the entrance to the bay, has been serving local seafood since 1979.  Sailing further south, you enter the Gulf of G\u00f6kova, which resembles the open mouth of a crocodile \u2013 with the Dat\u00e7a Peninsula as the lower jaw and the Greek island of Kos about to be gobbled up.   The 60-mile gulf is home to cosmopolitan Bodrum, dubbed the \u201cSt. Tropez of Turkey,\u201d but there are plentiful nooks and crannies to discover away from the crowds.  East of Bodrum, Orak island is a good spot for diving and snorkeling \u2013 the water is so clear it looks like it could have been piped from the Maldives. Further east is sleepy \u00c7\u00f6kertme, a fishing village and carpet-weaving community backed by mountains and swathed in pine, almond and olive trees. Jetties jut into the emerald water enticing boat crews to dine at the small tavernas, including Captain Ibrahim\u2019s and Rosemary Restaurant. Rooms are available at both.  Continuing further east into the gulf is hidden-away Akb\u00fck Limani, a serene east-facing bay with a pebbly beach lapped by teal water. It\u2019s the perfect place for a pine-scented dip at dawn, followed by a breakfast onshore of thick coffee or \u00e7ay, Turkish tea served in tulip-shaped glasses.   On the south side of the gulf, Sedir Island is home to Cleopatra Beach where, according to legend, the Egyptian queen and her beau Mark Antony swam. The romantic Roman is said to have imported the sand here from North Africa for her, and experts have confirmed it\u2019s not typical of the region. Ruins of the ancient city of Kedrai (\u201cCedar Tree\u201d) \u2013 which dates back to the sixth century BCE \u2013 add to the timeless ambiance.  To the southwest lies De\u011firmen B\u00fck\u00fc, or English Harbour, so named because British naval vessels hid here during World War II. It\u2019s another tranquil spot with several smaller coves to explore and a wooden jetty to reach a couple of rustic restaurants shaded by trees.  Further west, the Yedi Adalari (\u201cSeven Islands\u201d) are a string of uninhabited islets and reefs offering sublime swimming and snorkeling with a brilliant backdrop of blue and green from the pine-clad slopes. On the southwestern tip of the gulf, at the end of the Dat\u00e7a Peninsula, lies the ancient Greek city of Knidos, once a significant trading port. You can stroll among the ruins of temples, including the Temple of Aphrodite, two theaters, a marketplace and old harbor.  Its sheltered aquamarine bay is an enduring setting for evening cocktails onboard, with views over to the south shore of Kos. Meanwhile, Knidos Restaurant is the solitary taverna at this meeting point of the Aegean and the Mediterranean.      Gulf of Hisar\u00f6n\u00fc  Like the open pincers of a crab about to seize the Greek isle of Simi, the Hisar\u00f6n\u00fc Gulf to the south of the Gulf of G\u00f6kova is bordered by an ageless landscape of rocky outcrops, hillsides, coves and crumbling ruins \u2013 accompanied by wild goats and the scents of thyme, rosemary, sage and pine.     The main draw is cutesy Dat\u00e7a, with its buzzy harborfront bars and restaurants. Its enchanting old town (Eski Dat\u00e7a) has been rejuvenated in recent decades and is a hive of cobbled streets, bougainvillea-covered cafes and chic shops selling local arts and crafts. A few streets back from the water, restaurant Eski Meyhane is a good spot \u2013 the grilled octopus is a specialty.   Across the gulf on its own peninsula is pretty waterfront town Bozburun, known for its thyme honey, sponge fishing and traditional boat builders.   Sleepy Selimiye, with its Byzantine castle, and Orhaniye, with its finger of sand stretching into the bay at Kizkumu beach, are other attractive spots in this remote and rugged corner of Turkey.    There are plentiful bays to hole up in for cooling dips or nights afloat, such as Dirsek B\u00fck\u00fc, a cozy inlet only accessible by boat with a lone taverna serving calamari, homemade bread, grilled meat and fresh fish.  Aquarium Bay, Ben\u00e7ik Bay and the coves around Kizil Island all offer peaceful stops with water that wheels through the whole palette of blue, as well as pine, almond and olive trees ashore.  With their wide arcs of pebble beach, Palamut B\u00fck\u00fc and Karg\u0131 Koyu are popular spots for lounging and swimming between Knidos and Dat\u00e7a.   Marmaris to G\u00f6cek  Rounding the southern tip of the gulf and sailing a short distance east you reach the attractive anchorage of Bozuk B\u00fck\u00fc guarded by the crumbling ruins of a Hellenic castle. The remains of the ancient city of Loryma can also be traced on the scrubby slopes surrounding the bay. Sailor\u2019s House is one of a couple of restaurants on the shore, with mezes, meat and seafood served yards from the lapping water.   A short hop east, Ser\u00e7e Limani is a peaceful inlet with a simple taverna, while Gerbekse, just south of \u00c7iftlik, is a similarly secret hideaway with ruins of an ancient church and beckoning blue water, only accessible by boat. Tucked into its own pine-backed gulf to the north of \u00c7iftlik, the lively resort of Marmaris offers all manner of life. Several hours east of Marmaris is the picturesque cove of Ekin\u00e7ik, where you\u2019ll find the swish My Marina restaurant, a more upmarket affair than many in the region. From here, you can visit the ancient Carian town of Kaunos, indulge in age-defying mud baths up the Dalyan river or watch the loggerhead turtles nesting at the protected \u0130ztuzu Beach.    Gulf of Fethiye   Backed by mountains and fringed by thick pine forest, the compact Gulf of Fethiye is home to 12 islands and innumerable coves and bays.    Fethiye, once the ancient city of Telmessos and now one end of the 335-mile Lycian Way hike, is a busy harbor in its own protected bay. For a good wander, head to the bazaar, browsing stalls selling spices, fruit and vegetables, cheese, textiles, bags and other handmade goods. You can refuel at cafe Baba Dondurma, known for its ice cream.  G\u00f6cek, a pretty waterfront town, is the gulf\u2019s main yachting center. It\u2019s a laid-back place for strolling, shopping, eating and drinking and taking a boat out to the bays and islands, with the odd superyacht appearance getting tongues wagging.  Hotel D-Resort is a stylish spot with several gourmet restaurants, including Q Lounge, serving Japanese cuisine infused with local and Peruvian flavours.  Lotis Kitchen is a good option on the waterfront, while for cheaper eats Kebab Hospital is a fun joint serving a range of skewered treats with flatbreads and Turkish sides.   Of those 12 islands, Tersane, once the dockyard for the Ottoman navy, is the largest. It\u2019s an attractive spot with a cozy harbor, lone taverna, rocky ruins \u2013 and goats.    Tomb Bay, Fathom Bay, Ruin Bay and Wall Bay (sometimes known as Cleopatra\u2019s Bath), are a few of the anchorages around the islands, some with simple restaurants ashore.     Little Kapi Creek, on the inside of the peninsula at the southwest tip of the gulf, is a tucked-away spot with olive groves, crumbling ruins and old orchards. It\u2019s home to the atmospheric Gobun restaurant, serving Turkish classics such as lamb tandir. The real world is a million miles away here.   To the south of Fethiye is Bestas Limani, more commonly known as Cold Water Bay because of the cold springs that flow from the mountains. When taking a dip here, you\u2019ll notice the top layer of water is distinctly colder than lower down. A short walk away is the ghost town of Kayak\u00f6y, abandoned in 1923 when the Treaty of Lausanne forced the Greek residents out.  Nearby, Gemiler Island is thought to house the tomb of St. Nicholas \u2013 the patron saint of sailors \u2013 and still has the ruins of five Byzantine churches.

{"id": "2024_05_08_tech_roblox-earnings-2024", "text": "Roblox shares slid more than 20% in early trading, as the gaming giant dialed back its forecasts for growth and first-quarter earnings showed player spending is slowing. Average daily active users (DAUs) were 77.7 million, up 17% year-over-year. But analysts said Roblox needs to prove to Wall Street there\u2019s new sources of revenue growth, up ahead. Its devoted fan base is mostly teens, so the company is taking aggressive steps to attract both younger and older players. \u201cOur teams have been hard at work identifying opportunities to drive DAUs, hours, and bookings growth rates back to 20% year-over-year, said\u00a0David Baszucki, founder and CEO of\u00a0Roblox, in a statement. \u201cBased on results since the middle of April, we believe that these steps are yielding positive results.\u201d In mid-morning trading shares stand at about $23. The stock had shuffled between $25 and $45 for many months after hitting a peak, just above $130 in 2021, the year the company went public. \u201cThe company has faced high operational costs and it needs to sustain rapid growth at the same time,\u201d said Matilda Beinat, an AR/VR analyst at tech intelligence firm ABI Research. \u201cInvestors have wondered if that can be feasible.\u201d Still, some analysts and investors remain moderately optimistic. Here are three reasons why. New revenue streams Roblox has evolved since its 2006 launch and so has its growth strategy. The platform allows users to both play user-created games and create their own games and it also blends elements of a social media network, so people can make friends and talk to developers as they explore virtual worlds. Last year, its Baszucki shared visions of Roblox becoming a place where people can date and form \u201creal-life relationships\u201d within the next five years. In February, the company said 19.7 million new \u201cfriendships\u201d are formed every day on the site. The company\u2019s vision has long been for Roblox to be everywhere, and in many ways, it\u2019s succeeding. The platform\u2019s active daily users are using the platform for an average of 2.5 hours a day \u2013 and those numbers continue to grow. About half of US youth, ages 12 to 17, use Roblox in the US monthly; and it continues to experience growth overseas, especially in Asia. Its biggest hits include Adopt me! (a pet simulator), Brookhaven RP (a functioning virtual town) and Tower of Hell. Although many of the games are geared toward teens, the company seeks to grow and monetize the number of older players. Just last week, the company announced it will show immersive video ads to players over the age of 13. Roblox\u2019s stock price has moved up a bit since that announcement. A new developer subscription offer allows developers to create monetary subscriptions to unlock certain experiences, a feature some analysts expect could help the platform grow even more among other generations. Brand interest and risks Brands have growing interest in Roblox, too. The company said it experienced the strongest brand engagements on its platforms during the fourth quarter of 2023, with more than 300 brand activations on the site including those from Ralph Lauren, Nike, Crocs and Lego. Walmart has even joined the Roblox metaverse, adding an experience that allows users to buy physical items and receive them in the mail. Although more brand involvement will likely continue this year, the company will need to ensure users don\u2019t suffer from ad fatigue, according to Mike Proulx, a research director at market research firm Forrester. \u201cAs the company doubles down on advertising as a way to lure in more brands, it needs to balance what might be seen as \u2018easy revenue\u2019 with user experience,\u201d he said. \u201cToo many ads risk user backlash. Brands that want to effectively reach Roblox\u2019s young user base should prioritize creating a value exchange. Programmatic ads alone won\u2019t cut it,\u201d Proulx said. Good timing Roblox\u2019s user growth and emergence as a public company possibly aligns with budding interest in two buzzy industries: artificial intelligence and extended reality (XR), a term that covers virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality. In February, Roblox introduced an AI chatbot that allows users to communicate with each other in real time, regardless of what language they speak. The tool works in 16 languages. The company also previously shared its vision for the expansion of AI on the platform with tools that will \u201cenable every user to become a creator.\u201d At the same time, major tech companies continue to invest in XR, with increased interest due in part to the launch of Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset. The metaverse is attracting renewed interest. \u201cWe can already start to see the performance of the company going up with these new strategy implementations, and I do believe that with the right advertising and the right timings, Roblox will soon be the communication and collaboration platform it is striving to be,\u201d Beinat said. Facing rivals But Roblox also faces challenges from its chief competitor, Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite, and that platform\u2019s Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), a tool that enables creators to build experiences and publish them directly into Fortnite. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely pushing hard to eat Roblox\u2019s lunch, even though the Fortnite player base tends to be older,\u201d said Lewis Ward, director of gaming at market research firm IDC. Epic has also been taking steps to creep in on Roblox\u2019s core user base. In February, the publisher announced it is teaming up with Disney to create open games and entertainment connected to Fortnite, offering users the ability to play, watch, shop and engage with content and characters from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar and other franchises. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that [Fortnite] intends to go after younger gamers in 2024 and 2025,\u201d Ward said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/08/tech/roblox-earnings-2024/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments.

{"id": "2024_05_07_americas_australia-surfer-parents-mexico-intl-hnk", "text": "The grieving parents of two Australian brothers killed on a surfing trip in Mexico alongside their American friend said their deaths had made the world a \u201cdarker place,\u201d days after their sons\u2019 bodies were identified. The brothers, Jake and Callum Robinson, and American friend Jack Carter Rhoad, were on a surfing and camping trip near the town of Ensenada, about 60 miles south of the border city of Tijuana, when they went missing on April 29. Earlier this week, three bodies were found dumped in a well with gunshot wounds to the head. On Sunday, Mexican authorities confirmed their identities as the three missing friends with the help of relatives who flew out help investigators. \u201cOur hearts are broken and the world has become a darker place for us,\u201d said Debra Robinson, speaking from San Diego, where she and her husband had since flown to, according to Seven Network Australia. \u201cWe also mourn the loss of Carter Rhoad, a close friend. They were young men, enjoying their passion of surfing together,\u201d she said. She thanked the friends, family and supporters who have reached out, saying: \u201cWe know that they were truly loved and impacted many people\u2019s lives.\u201d Standing beside her husband Martin on the beach, the sound the Pacific waves crashing in the background, the Perth-based couple then paid tribute to the brothers: Callum, 33, who was based in San Diego and played for Australia\u2019s national lacrosse team, and Jake, a 30-year-old doctor who flew from Australia two weeks ago to join his brother in their travels, his parents previously told CNN affiliate Seven News. \u201cCallum was a lovable, larger-than-life character and considered the United States his second home. Known as the Big Koala, he played professional lacrosse in the PLL and represented Australia in the World Championships and always found time to coach the junior teams,\u201d said Debra. \u201cHis brother Jake was a happy, gentle and compassionate soul who\u00a0was pursuing a career in medicine. Jake\u2019s passion was surfing and it was no coincidence that many of his hospitals that he worked in were close to surfing beaches,\u201d she added \u2013 listing Jake\u2019s other hobbies and passions, including running, swimming, cricket and live music. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to bring them home to family and friends and the ocean waves in Australia,\u201d she said, speaking through tears. \u201cPlease live bigger, shine brighter and love harder in their memory.\u201d Jake and Callum\u2019s father, Martin, also spoke to extend his thanks to the Australian agencies that had helped in the search for their sons \u2013 including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Federal Police, and the Australian Embassy in Mexico. He also thanked Australia\u2019s Foreign Minister Penny Wong, saying she had\u00a0called\u00a0to express her support on Monday. Mexican authorities have vowed to investigate the murders, saying the surfers may have been attacked in an attempted vehicle robbery.\u00a0Baja California\u00a0has been plagued by cartel violence in recent years, though it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada. Dozens of people held a protest last week in Ensenada calling on authorities to do more to tackle violence facing tourists and locals alike. Many held up surfboards with slogans written on them in tribute to the three slain tourists. Drug cartels have terrorized Mexico with ever-increasing levels of violence, fueled in part by huge demand for drugs from US consumers and armed with an arsenal of weaponry from north of the border. While parts of Mexico are established tourist destinations, violent crime including kidnapping and human trafficking plague parts of the country, particularly in border areas. Mexico\u2019s\u00a0homicide rate\u00a0is among the highest in the world, and\u00a0more than 100,000 people remain missing in the country. Studies show only around seven percent of murders in Mexico are ever solved. Three Mexican citizens previously questioned in relation to the disappearance of the three murdered surfers have been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping, the attorney general\u2019s office said. One of the suspects was identified as Jes\u00fas Gerardo \u201cN,\u201d alias \u201cEl Kekas.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/americas/australia-surfer-parents-mexico-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_middleeast_unga-palestinian-membership-resolution-intl", "text": "A United Nations resolution in support of Palestinian membership passed with overwhelming support on Friday, and granted new privileges to the Palestinian Authority in its current capacity as a non-member observer state. The resolution won a resounding majority of 143 votes in favor. Twenty five abstained, and nine nations voted against the text: Czechia, Hungary, Argentina, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Israel and the United States. The text, put forward by the United Arab Emirates, calls for the UN\u2019s powerful Security Council \u2013 which must rule on Palestinian membership \u2013 to \u201creconsider the matter favourably.\u201d \u201cThe State of Palestine is qualified for membership in the United Nations,\u201d it asserts. With emotion running high on Friday, more than 100 national representatives asked to speak about the resolution, with most emphasizing strong support for Palestinian statehood no matter how they voted. In remarks before the vote, Palestinian ambassador Riyad Mansour spoke passionately about the plight of Palestinians in wartorn Gaza. \u201cAs we speak, 1.4 million Palestinians in Rafah wonder if they will survive today,\u201d he told the assembly, referring to Israeli threats of a major attack on the densely populated city in southern Gaza. He also thanked protesters on US university campuses and abroad who have demonstrated against the Israel-Hamas war. \u201cOur flag flies high and proud in Palestine and across the globe, and on the campus of Columbia University. It has become a symbol by all those who believe in freedom and is just ruled by all those who can no longer stand idly by in the face of such utter injustice,\u201d Mansour said. Israel foreign minister Israel Katz quickly condemned the resolution\u2019s passage, describing it as a an \u201cabsurd decision\u201d that highlights \u201cthe structural bias of the UN\u201d and rewards the actions of Hamas on October 7. \u201cThe message that the UN is sending to our suffering region: violence pays off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe decision to upgrade the status of Palestinians in the UN is a prize for Hamas terrorists after they committed the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.\u201d New rights and privileges While a General Assembly vote cannot confer UN membership, the approved resolution does endow the Palestinian Authority with new procedural rights and privileges. Only member states can vote, but the Palestinian Authority can now be seated among member states in alphabetical order; submit and introduce proposals and amendments; and co-sponsor proposals and amendments. It can also make statements and explanations of votes, and has the right to reply on behalf of a group within the UN. It can also request proposals to be put to a vote and request items to be put on the UNGA\u2019s provisional agenda. The Palestinian Authority will now request full membership from the Security Council, according to Mansour. The US has already warned that it will likely veto such a request in the Security Council \u2013 a replay of its April veto of an earlier Palestinian membership request. Following the general assembly vote on Friday, US Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations Robert Wood described the resolution text as \u201cunproductive,\u201d saying a \u201cdurable peace\u201d in the Middle East would mean bundling the two-state solution with other elements. \u201cGaza cannot be a platform for terrorism, that there should be no Israeli reoccupation of Gaza and that the size of Gaza\u2019s territory should not be reduced,\u201d he said. Wood also suggested that the United Nations was the wrong forum for consideration of Palestinian statehood, telling the General Assembly that \u201cit remains the US view that the most expeditious path toward statehood and UN membership for the Palestinian people is through direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authority.\u201d Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UN Gilad\u00a0Erdan also made emotional remarks before the assembly before the vote, accusing resolution supporters of voting to \u201cadvance the establishment of a Palestinian terror state\u201d\u00a0and shredding part of the UN charter\u00a0while standing at the organization\u2019s storied rostrum in New York \u201cThis is your mirror so that you can see exactly what you are inflicting upon the UN charter with this destructive vote,\u201d Erdan said, holding up a small paper shredder. Hours later, UN spokesman Farhan Haq defended the charter, telling press that \u201cthis is an organization that is premised on respect for the UN charter and all of the member states have pledged to uphold the UN charter and we expect them to fulfill that obligation\u201d, said the spokesman. \u201cAs long as this organization\u00a0exists, the\u00a0charter exists,\u201d Haq added. In September 2011, the\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0Authority\u00a0failed to win UN\u00a0recognition as an independent member state. A year later, the UN decided that the\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0Authority\u2019s \u201cnon-member observer entity\u201d status would be changed to \u201cnon-member observer state,\u201d similar to the Vatican.

{"id": "2024_05_12_europe_russia-kharkiv-region-offensive-ukraine-intl", "text": "Ukraine\u2019s top general says the situation in the northern\u00a0Kharkiv region\u00a0has \u201csignificantly worsened\u201d after Russia claimed to have captured four further villages as it expanded its surprise cross-border offensive. A Ukrainian regional official insisted Russia\u2019s progress was not yet \u201csignificant\u201d but admitted ground fighting in the area was spreading. Meanwhile, speaking on British television, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron acknowledged it was an \u201cextremely dangerous moment,\u201d adding that Russia had effectively \u201cinvaded [Ukraine] again.\u201d The precise goal of Russia\u2019s new push \u2013 which began in the early hours of Friday morning \u2013 is unclear. It may be to create a buffer zone designed to reduce Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory, or possibly even a renewed assault on the city of Kharkiv, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south. Equally, it could be an attempt to draw Ukrainian forces away from other key Russian objectives further south \u2013 which was the rationale Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered in his Sunday evening address. \u201cThe idea behind the attacks in Kharkiv region is to stretch our forces and undermine morale and the motivational foundations of Ukrainians\u2019 ability to defend ourselves,\u201d he said. According to information from the Defense Ministry in Moscow, Russia now claims control over nine Ukrainian border villages, which are clustered in two areas, now just a few dozen kilometers apart, to the northeast of Kharkiv city. A Ukrainian military blogger, Myroshnykov, said Sunday afternoon that Russian troops had now pushed south and entered the town of Vovchansk, though the pace of advance there had slowed in the face of Ukraine\u2019s defending forces. Myroshnykov went on to predict an attempt by Russia to make its numerical advantage count and throw large numbers of infantry soldiers into the battle. \u201cThey will try to seize the area with a lot of cannon fodder,\u201d he wrote on his Telegram channel, referencing previous Russian offensives which reports suggest have resulted in many Russian troops killed. A Ukrainian military spokesman later denied reports Russian forces were inside Vovchansk, saying Ukraine\u2019s armed forces had succeeded in keeping them at bay. Ahead of any stepped-up Russian actions, Ukrainian officials have been evacuating hundreds of local residents to safety. An idea of the destruction being wrought on the town and surrounding villages came from regional Ukrainian leader, Oleh Syniehubov, who said Saturday that Russia had dropped more than 20 huge glide bombs on the area in under two days. These bombs have a minimum weight of 250 kgs, but can go up to 1,500 kgs, and are among the most destructive mass-produced devices currently used by Russia in the war. They have previously been used as a precursor to a major attempt to seize ground. Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine\u2019s army chief, told readers of his social media channels on Sunday that defensive operations were ongoing and that battlefield conditions were difficult. \u201cThis week, the situation in Kharkiv Oblast has significantly worsened. Currently, there are ongoing battles in the border areas along the state border with the Russian Federation,\u201d he wrote on Telegram. Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration, insisted control over the border villages was still contested rather than ceded, however the influential DeepStateMap group \u2013 a Ukrainian organisation monitoring developments on the battlefield \u2013 showed seven Ukrainian villages under either full or partial Russian control. So far, Russian gains are not sufficient to put its big artillery pieces within range of Kharkiv city, but residents there admit the situation is frightening. One woman, Anna Ivanova, speaking to Reuters, said: \u201cOf course it is scary, we keep on monitoring the situation, following the news but we remain home and are not planning to go anywhere. All depends on what happens.\u201d Another Kharkiv resident, Olena Pidhirna, said: \u201cDespite all those attacks, air raid alarms, we live normal lives, everyone keeps going out, playing, going to school, enjoying themselves, working. Life goes on, as normal.\u201d It is not just in Ukraine\u2019s north that Kyiv\u2019s armed forces are losing ground. DeepStateMap also shows Russia making further gains in two other key areas, most notably towards the town of Chasiv Yar, which has become an important forward military position, and further south in the industrial town of Krasnohorivka, where Russian troops are now in control of the town\u2019s main facility, a brick factory. Meanwhile, Russian authorities say eight people are known to have died in an explosion in a residential building in Belgorod. CCTV video of the blast shows a huge plume of dark grey smoke emerging from one of the building\u2019s lower floors, before part of the building collapses on itself. Russian television later broadcast video of rescuers at work looking for survivors among the rubble. Russian officials said the blast was caused by a Ukrainian missile attack. And in a separate development, a fire briefly broke out at the\u00a0Volgograd\u00a0oil\u00a0refinery, the largest oil\u00a0refinery\u00a0in southern\u00a0Russia, after a Ukrainian drone attack overnight into Sunday, according to the region\u2019s governor. \u201cOn the night of May 12, air defense and electronic warfare forces repelled a UAV attack on the territory of the\u00a0Volgograd\u00a0region,\u201d Andrey Bocharov said in a post on Telegram. \u201cAs a result of the consequences of a UAV crash with subsequent detonation, a fire broke out at the\u00a0Volgograd\u00a0Refinery\u00a0site,\u201d he said.

Rasoulof condemned the Iranian government in an Instagram post on Monday, calling it a tyrannical and oppressive regime, and posting a video that showed him crossing the country\u2019s mountainous border. \u201cIf geographical Iran suffers beneath the boots of your religious tyranny, cultural Iran is alive in the common minds of millions of Iranians who were forced to leave Iran due to your brutality and no power can impose its will on it. From today, I am a resident of cultural Iran,\u201d he said. In a separate statement dated May 12, Rasoulof said he had decided to escape Iran after his lawyers told him his prison sentence would be implemented on short notice. \u201cI had to choose between prison and leaving Iran. With a heavy heart, I chose exile,\u201d he said in that statement, which was provided by a spokesperson. CNN has reached out to Iranian authorities for comment. His lawyer Babak Paknia said last week that an Iranian court had sentenced Rasoulof to eight years in prison and flogging after it found his films and documentaries to be \u201cexamples of collusion with the intention of committing a crime against the security of the country.\u201d Rasoulof is among several high-profile artists to have been caught up in a widening crackdown on dissent by Iranian authorities since nationwide protests broke out over the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who was arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf properly. Rasoulof, whose recent films have been critical of the Iranian government, was among a group of artists and filmmakers who signed a letter criticizing the violent response of security forces to quell a 2022 protest over a building collapse in the southwestern city of Abadan that killed more than 40 people. Rasoulof\u00a0won a Golden Bear\u00a0for best film at the Berlinale festival in 2020 for \u201cThere Is No Evil\u201d and his film\u00a0\u201cA Man of Integrity\u201d\u00a0was recognized for a \u201cCertain Regard\u201d honor at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2017. The filmmaker\u2019s latest work, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig,\u201d is set to premiere at Cannes next week, but it\u2019s unclear if he will be able to attend. \u201cWe are very happy and much relieved that Mohammad has safely arrived in Europe after a dangerous journey,\u201d said Jean-Christophe Simon, the distributor for Rasoulof\u2019s latest film. The Films Boutique and Parallel45 executive added that he hopes that Rasoulof will be able to attend the Cannes premiere for his film \u201cin spite of all attempts to prevent him from being there in person.\u201d Rasoulof said on Instagram that he will now work to quickly finish the last technical steps of his film\u2019s post-production. \u201cMany people helped to make this film. My thoughts are with all of them, and I fear for their safety and well-being,\u201d he said, accusing the Iranian government of pressuring members of his production team with interrogations, court filings and travel restrictions. Rasoulof didn\u2019t specify how he escaped Iran, saying only that he did it secretly with the help of friends and acquaintances. In 2022, an Iranian court sentenced Rasoulof to one year in prison and banned him from making films for two years on the charge of \u201cpropaganda against the system,\u201d according to Human Rights Watch. Iranian authorities have previously arrested him multiple times and confiscated his passport because of his work, HRW said.

The provinces of\u00a0Badakhshan, Ghor, Baghlan, and Herat have all experienced heavy flooding, which has also damaged nearly 2,000 homes, a communications officer from UN agency the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a statement a day earlier. \u201cFlash floods ravage Afghanistan, killing more than 300 people in Baghlan and destroying more than 1000 houses,\u201d the WFP said in a post on X. \u201cThis has been one of many floods over the last few weeks, due to unusually heavy rainfall. WFP is now distributing fortified biscuits to the survivors.\u201d The International Rescue Committee (IRC), which is preparing its emergency response to the flooding that spans seven provinces, said \u201cthousands\u201d of people have been stranded without access to services. \u201cThese latest floods have caused a major humanitarian emergency in Afghanistan, which is still reeling from a string of earthquakes at the beginning of this year as well as severe flooding in March,\u201d said IRC Afghanistan director Salma Ben Aissa. \u201cCommunities have lost entire families, while livelihoods have been decimated as a result,\u201d she said. More than half of the 600,000 people affected by the floods are children, Save the Children reported\u00a0in a statement, adding that it is sending a \u201ca \u2018clinic on wheels\u2019 with mobile health and child protection teams to support children and their families.\u201d On Saturday, video captured by news agency Reuters showed mourners burying the dead in Baghlan province. One man named Gulbudeen described losing several family members in the floods. \u201cI lost five members of my family, two sons, two daughters, and their mother as a result of these devastating flash floods, we were standing on the other side of the flood, but we could not help them, and eventually the flood took the lives of our loved ones,\u201d he recounted. Residents in the village of Laqayi, also in Baghlan, tried to clean up the rivers of mud outside their homes on Saturday, video filmed by news agency AFP showed. Villagers could be seen wading through the deep pools of mud that appeared to have wrought extensive damage to dwellings. The ruling Taliban acknowledged the \u201cgrievous toll\u201d caused by the flooding in a statement posted Saturday on X by spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid. \u201cRegrettably, hundreds of our fellow citizens have succumbed to these calamitous floods, while a substantial number have sustained injuries. Moreover, the deluge has wrought extensive devastation upon residential properties, resulting in significant financial losses,\u201d Mujahid said. The Taliban has tasked its interior ministry, the ministry of disaster management and local officials to \u201cuse all available resources\u201d to rescue the stranded, retrieve dead bodies and provide medical treatment to the injured, Mujahid added. The flash floods add to a string of recent natural disasters that the region has had to endure. In April, unseasonal rainfall and floods killed more than 100 people in Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to authorities. More than 600 animals also died. Flash floods also swept away dozens in Afghanistan in July, less than three months before thousands were killed by a powerful 6.3 magnitude earthquake that struck the western part of the country.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/11/asia/flash-floods-kill-hundreds-afghanistan-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_10_asia_japan-ageing-population-women-opportunities-intl-hnk", "text": "With a history spanning more than 1,200 years, \u201chadaka matsuri,\u201d or the naked festival, is Japanese masculinity on full display. Quite literally. Across Japan, in freezing winter, thousands of men strip naked \u2014 except for a delicate piece of crotch-covering white loincloth \u2014 to jostle around their local shrines. Each participant tries to get as close as possible to a man playing the role of \u201cshin-otoko,\u201d a\u00a0god-man who wards off bad luck. On one hand, the ritual illustrates Japan\u2019s steadfast respect for tradition and cultural heritage. But on the other, its insistence on excluding women \u2014 only men are considered pure in the traditional Japanese culture \u2014 bears all the hallmarks of one of the country\u2019s greatest modern struggles: gender inequality. To this day, men hold the country\u2019s highest offices and most of the top jobs at prestigious private firms. Last year, the World Economic Forum ranked Japan 125th in its Global Gender Gap Index report, far below other G7 countries such as Germany, Britain and the United States. It was just a few spots ahead of India and Saudi Arabia \u2014 both notoriously poor performers on gender equality. Some women in Japan still battle deep-rooted cultural expectations that require them to take the role of \u201cshufu,\u201d or housewife, experts say. Meanwhile, the country\u2019s painstakingly long work hours and male-centric institutional culture conspire further against women who are already burdened disproportionately by more family duties than men. But in the naked festival, women have recently found hope. Even the country\u2019s most entrenched male-centric tradition was recently subverted by another wrinkle in the national fabric: a shrinking population. In February, as the number of male participants dwindled, the country\u2019s oldest hadaka matsuri, at the Konomiya Shrine in central Japan, welcomed 41 women to take part for the first time. \u201cOne reason to permit women to participate in such a traditional festival is due to the shortage of men,\u201d said Mikiko Eto, emerita professor who specializes in gender politics at Hosei University in Tokyo. \u201cThe number of young men is declining rapidly. Women should be welcome because of shortage of male participants, so we\u2019ve been very welcome.\u201d Haruhiko Nishio, 57, a member of an alumni club for shin-otoko involved in organizing the hadaka matsuri at the Konomiya Shrine, recalled: \u201cLast year, the festival had only 1,700 attendees, only one-fifth of pre-pandemic crowds.\u201d He said women had never been explicitly banned from taking part, but such mass participation was a first. The female group, known as Enyukai, was assigned a minor role on the day (and the women agreed they should keep their clothes on). But for those who took part, it was deeply symbolic. \u201cJapan can\u2019t help but put men at the front and women in the back. I want to unleash female power from now on,\u201d participant Atsuko Tamakoshi, 56, told CNN. For the organizer, it may be a practical decision. But vice president of Enyukai, Ayaka Suzuki, 36, said: \u201cIt\u2019s about gender equality.\u201d It does not end there, scholars say. With no easy solutions in sight, Japan\u2019s declining population may not only reshape the millennium-old festival, but also transform the world\u2019s fourth-biggest economy. \u201cThe impact of an aging society is very important for the Japanese economy. You need more working people, more active people. So why are women still at home? Let women participate in the labor market,\u201d Eto said. \u201cAging society is a chance for women to achieve gender equality because our society needs more able people,\u201d she said. \u2018Now or never\u2019 Japan\u2019s number of births dropped for the eighth consecutive year in 2023, plunging 5.1% from the previous year to an all-time low of 758,631, according to the Ministry of Health. With a fertility rate hovering around 1.3 in recent years \u2014 far below the rate of 2.1 required to maintain a stable population (Japan has very low levels of immigration) \u2014 the Japanese government has long described its mission to boost births as a question of \u201cnow or never.\u201d Eto, from Hosei University, said the consequences of a declining population aren\u2019t confined to small towns or traditional rituals. Japan\u2019s workforce totaled 66 million people in 2023, including foreign nationals, according to a report released in January this year by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). But the figure will plunge by more than half to about 32 million by the turn of the century if Japan\u2019s fertility rate continues to stagnate, the report predicted. And as the population crisis spirals, the government and many businesses have started asking why women are still bound by social expectation to stay home, Eto said. Amplified voices There have been improvements, according to Eto, though \u2014 as with the changes to the hadaka matsuri \u2014 the motives may have been more pragmatic than progressive. Many businesses are promoting greater gender equality in workplaces to make women feel more welcome. The government has also introduced a string of initiatives to lessen the burdens on mothers, including a vision to encourage 85% of male workers to take paternity leave by 2030, for a more even division of domestic labor. Examples of women leaders include Mitsuko Tottori, who took the helm of Japan Airlines on April 1 to become its first female president and CEO. Seasoned politician Yoko Kamikawa was appointed foreign minister last September, becoming the first woman to take up the role in two decades. But in general, women\u2019s representation in politics and management remains unsatisfactorily low, experts note. Only five of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida\u2019s 20-member cabinet are women and, as of 2023, less than 13% of senior and leadership posts in businesses were held by women, according to the Global Gender Gap report. A lack of innovative policies, such as quota systems for women adopted by some European countries, is holding Japan back, Eto said. Kaori Katada, an associate social science professor at Hosei University, said Japan\u2019s improvement on gender equality has been incremental and nuanced. While women are given more opportunities, she said, bias and stereotypes persist. Women are mostly confined to junior positions and caretaking jobs, such as kindergarten care and nursing, and they are generally paid less than their male counterparts, she said. \u201c(This means) women have to take care of the house and children, which forces them into part-time work. They cannot accept high-responsibility management positions because they need to look after children too,\u201d she said. And not all social institutions are ready to embrace women as much as the hadaka matsuri at Konomiya Shrine, as the handful of women who try to set foot in the ring of sumo wrestling, another male-dominated sport, can testify. Hiyori Kon, 26, a top amateur sumo wrestler and the protagonist in the 2018 Netflix documentary \u201cLittle Miss Sumo,\u201d told CNN she is often confronted by disapproval, reminding her that Japan has a long way to go\u00a0on gender equality.\u00a0Once, she said, her male colleague told her: \u201cIf you continue sumo, you won\u2019t be able to marry, so you better quit soon.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/10/asia/japan-ageing-population-women-opportunities-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}

CNN has identified several camps sheltering Gaza\u2019s vast refugee population \u2013 including the main camp in central Rafah that housed thousands of tents \u2013 which have significantly decreased in size between Tuesday and Wednesday. Although some camps in Rafah did see a decrease in population earlier in the week, the majority of camps identified by CNN saw their greatest declines since Tuesday. Some of the tent camps had been in United Nations schools, others in open fields, or along roadways for months.\u00a0Now, a significant number have vanished, but many remain in the camps despite orders from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to leave. At least 110,000 Palestinians have fled Rafah since Monday, after the IDF issued an evacuation order, according to the UN\u2019s agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA).  Streams of Palestinians made their way to Al-Mawasi earlier this week, following an Israeli relocation order. The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), Jan Egeland, warned that dire conditions there, including a lack of stable security, adequate accommodation or space, \u201cqualifies Israel\u2019s relocation directives as forcible transfer, amounting to a serious violation of international law.\u201d Rafah has become the central focus of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces\u00a0growing pressure\u00a0from the extreme wing of his coalition to launch a full-scale ground operation in the city to destroy Hamas, while the more moderate wing has urged him to prioritize securing a\u00a0ceasefire-for-hostages deal. Israel launched a military assault on Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people in Israel and abducted more than 250 others. Israel\u2019s offensive has since pulverized patches of the Gaza Strip and drastically diminished critical supplies, exposing the entire population of more than 2.2 million people to the risk of famine. Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed 34,904 Palestinians and injured another 78,514 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. International pressure is growing for Israel not to move in on the densely populated city bordering Egypt. During nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have taken refuge in Rafah. Hamas is also believed to have regrouped in the area, after Israel\u2019s destruction of much of the strip\u2019s north. On Wednesday, US President Joe Biden sent shockwaves through the US and Israel when he warned that the US would halt some shipments of American weapons should Netanyahu order a major invasion of the city. But Netanyahy responded defiantly saying in a speech \u201cif we need to stand alone, we will stand alone. I have said that, if necessary, we will fight with our fingernails.\u201d Gazans began fleeing Rafah on Monday, after Israel\u2019s military\u00a0issued a call\u00a0for residents in the east of Rafah to\u00a0\u201cevacuate immediately\u201d toward Al Mawasi and other areas north of Rafah. Many people have fled further north than Al-Mawasi, heading for areas in central Gaza that have more infrastructure. The IDF began conducting ground operations on Tuesday, after seizing the Gaza-side of the Rafah border crossing.\u00a0Those operations are ongoing, but are largely focused in the easternmost sections of Rafah \u2013 just over a mile away from the closest camp CNN identified. A full-scale Israeli ground attack on Rafah could lead to \u201cpotential mass atrocities,\u201d Egeland, the NRC chief, said on Monday. This story has been updated with new information.

{"id": "2024_05_07_tech_tiktok-sues-us-app-ban", "text": "TikTok sued Tuesday to block a US law that could force a nationwide ban of the popular app, following through on legal threats the company issued after President Joe Biden signed the legislation last month. The court challenge sets up a historic legal battle, one that will determine whether US security concerns about TikTok\u2019s links to China can trump the First Amendment rights of TikTok\u2019s 170 million US users. The stakes of the case are existential for TikTok. If it loses, TikTok could be banned from US app stores unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, sells the app to a non-Chinese entity by mid-January 2025. In its\u00a0petition filed Tuesday at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, TikTok and Bytedance allege the law is unconstitutional because it stifles Americans\u2019 speech and prevents them from accessing lawful information. The petition claims the US government \u201chas taken the unprecedented step of expressly singling out and banning\u201d the short-form video app in an unconstitutional exercise of congressional power. \u201cFor the first time in history,\u201d the petition said, \u201cCongress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than 1 billion people worldwide.\u201d The White House referred questions about TikTok\u2019s legal challenge to the Justice Department, which didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit follows years of US allegations that TikTok\u2019s ties to China could potentially expose Americans\u2019 personal information to the Chinese government. Debate over data sharing TikTok has strongly denied that it has ever given Chinese government officials access to US user data and says it has taken steps to protect that information by hosting the data on servers owned by US tech giant Oracle. Those moves are part of a 90-page draft agreement before a government panel known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a multiagency body that has been reviewing TikTok\u2019s US operations since 2019, the petition said. That same draft deal also includes the ability for the US government to shut down TikTok if it or ByteDance \u201cviolate certain obligations under the agreement,\u201d the petition said. But those assurances have not eased US officials\u2019 concerns, which include fears that China could use TikTok\u2019s data to identify intelligence targets, spread propaganda or engage in other forms of covert influence. The US government has not publicly presented any concrete evidence showing Chinese government access of TikTok data to date; US lawmakers have received classified briefings by national security officials behind closed doors, but they have not declassified any materials from those meetings. Reactions to the briefings have been mixed, with one House Republican saying there was \u201cno specific information \u2026 that was well-founded evidence\u201d and one House Democrat saying the issue comes down to a judgment call about curbing \u201cmalign influence\u201d from China. But Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, an advocate for the TikTok legislation, said in remarks on the Senate floor in April that the briefings provided critical insight into the risk TikTok poses. \u201cMany Americans, particularly young Americans, are rightfully skeptical\u201d of the legislation clamping down on TikTok, Warner said in his remarks. \u201cAt the end of the day, they\u2019ve not seen what Congress has seen. They\u2019ve not been in the classified briefings that Congress has held, which have delved into more deeply some of the threat posed by the foreign control of TikTok.\u201d In March, those fears culminated in legislation giving TikTok roughly six months to sell or face a US ban. Passed by the House, it stalled in the Senate before an updated version of the bill was fast-tracked and attached to a major foreign aid package benefiting Israel and Ukraine. US policymakers have described the law at issue as a forced divestiture of TikTok, not an outright app ban. TikTok has insisted, however, that a ban would be the only probable outcome if the law is upheld. \u201cThe \u2018qualified divestiture\u2019 demanded by the Act to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States is simply not possible,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s petition said, \u201cnot commercially, not technologically, not legally.\u201d First Amendment implications TikTok and ByteDance called the national security fears at the heart of the TikTok legislation \u201cspeculative and analytically flawed,\u201d adding in the petition that the bill\u2019s swift passage reflects how its congressional authors relied on \u201cspeculation, not \u2018evidence,\u2019 as the First Amendment requires,\u201d to make their case. First Amendment scholars say TikTok\u2019s claims have some merit. The Supreme Court has held, for instance, that the US government cannot prohibit Americans from receiving foreign propaganda if they so choose. Underscoring the point, legislation known as the Berman amendment also forbids US presidents from blocking the free flow of media from foreign countries, even those considered hostile to the United States. \u201cNational security claims should not trump the First Amendment,\u201d said Evelyn Douek, an assistant law professor at Stanford University who studies online platform regulations. \u201cOtherwise, it would make the Constitution a paper tiger. At the very least, the government should be forced to provide evidence for its claims. That said, there is precedent of the [Supreme] Court neglecting these principles, especially in the context of counterterrorism and foreign speech.\u201d TikTok notched some early court victories last year as several US states tried to clamp down on the app, foreshadowing the battle to come over online speech. In Montana, the only state to have passed its own TikTok ban affecting personal devices, a federal judge temporarily blocked the legislation \u2014 saying the state law unconstitutionally \u201charmed [users\u2019] First Amendment rights and cut off a stream of income on which many rely.\u201d The bipartisan nature of the law Biden signed might convince\u00a0the courts of the seriousness of the national security concerns around TikTok, said Gautam Hans, associate director of the First Amendment Clinic at Cornell University. Still, Hans said, \u201cwithout public discussion of what exactly the risks are \u2026 it\u2019s difficult to determine why the courts should validate such an unprecedented law.\u201d In addition to potentially infringing on US TikTok users\u2019 speech rights, the federal law TikTok is challenging also implicates the constitutional rights of Apple and Google, whose app stores would be prohibited from carrying TikTok if a ban went into effect. \u201cThis raises concerns about potentially unconstitutional government intrusion into the decisions of these platforms regarding what content to host,\u201d wrote Jennifer Huddleston, a research fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, in an op-ed last month. \u201cFurther, it could set a dangerous precedent of government intervention in the online space that many would find anathema in the offline space.\u201d The US government and more than half of US states have restricted TikTok from government devices, however, reflecting the authority that governments have to manage their own property. Internationally, TikTok has been banned on government devices in Canada, the United Kingdom and at the European Commission. The app has been subject to a complete ban in the entire country of India since 2020. Some US officials have been trying to ban TikTok from the United States since 2020, when former President Donald Trump moved to block the app by executive order. (Trump has since reversed his position, saying a TikTok ban would only help Meta, a company Trump blames for his 2020 election defeat.) The outcome of the TikTok case is likely to have far-reaching consequences for how the US government regulates technology and other foreign speech, Douek said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to think of this not in terms of just TikTok, but in terms of all foreign platforms in the future,\u201d Douek said. \u201cIn a globalized world, this issue is going to come up again and again. And if the government is handed the power to simply ban a platform based on what seems at this stage mere concerns about potential for future harm, rather than actual clear and present dangers, that would be extremely worrying.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/07/tech/tiktok-sues-us-app-ban/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/14/2024", "section": "world"}}
