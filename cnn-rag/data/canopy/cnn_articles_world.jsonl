Authorities identified the suspect only by his last name, Cui, who was describes as a 55-year-old man from the city\u2019s Longtan District. Police said he \u201ccollided with a foreigner while walking\u201d in Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in the city center. The suspect then stabbed the instructors, as well as a Chinese tourist who stepped forward and tried to stop him during the incident, police said in a statement. Police said they received the call around 11:49 a.m. local time Monday, after which they dispatched officers to the scene and transported the injured to the hospital for treatment. The injured \u201chave all received proper medical treatment and are not in danger \u2026\u201d police said earlier. The educators from Cornell College, a private liberal arts college\u00a0in Mount Vernon, Iowa, were wounded \u201cin a serious incident\u201d\u00a0on Monday, while participating in a partnership program with Beihua University in Jilin, according to the college. \u201cWe have been in contact with all four instructors and are assisting them during this time,\u201d Cornell College President Jonathan Brand said in a statement, adding no students took part in the program. Footage purportedly showing the aftermath of the daylight attack emerged on Chinese social media on Monday but was swiftly censored. It showed two men and a woman lying on the ground covered in large blood stains, surrounded by onlookers. They appeared conscious and were talking on their cell phones, the video showed. CNN geolocated the video to Beishan Park, a popular green space\u00a0in Jilin city center, less than half an hour\u2019s drive from Beihua University. Monday was a public holiday in China. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry confirmed Tuesday that \u201cfour foreign teachers at Beihua University were attacked\u201d while visiting the park Monday morning \u2013 adding they were immediately taken to the hospital and did not suffer life-threatening injuries. Iowa state Rep. Adam Zabner told CNN his brother, David Zabner, was one of the victims of the stabbing. Zabner said his brother, who was on his second visit to China with Cornell, is \u201cdoing well\u201d and has \u201cbeen stitched up and seems to be recovering,\u201d after speaking to him on Tuesday morning Beijing time. The other three victims survived the attack, Adam Zabner said, adding he could not comment on their health status. \u201cI\u2019m just extremely grateful that my brother is OK and that he survived this attack,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe hope of my family is to get my brother back home as soon as possible and get them healthy. And we really just want to thank the US State Department for all their help, and also our federal delegation from Iowa who have been particularly helpful.\u201d The US State Department said it was aware of reports of a stabbing incident in China and is monitoring the situation. \u2018Horrifying attack\u2019 Knife attacks are not uncommon in China, where guns are tightly controlled. The country has faced a spate of stabbing rampages in public places including schools and hospitals. But public attacks against foreigners are rare. The attack in Jilin comes as China has been seeking to draw back international visitors following three years of stringent Covid-19 border controls. It also comes amid efforts to boost educational exchanges with the United States as the two countries look to stabilize their fraught relationship. The incident has drawn attention and concern in Iowa from officials and lawmakers. Gov. Kim Reynolds called it a \u201chorrifying attack.\u201d US Rep. Ashley Hinson, who represents the district where Cornell College is located, said the college employees \u201cwere brutally stabbed\u201d and vowed to \u201cdo everything in our power to bring these Iowans home safely.\u201d On China\u2019s heavily censored social media, visuals and discussions about the attack had been swiftly erased since Monday. Censorship appeared to have relaxed somewhat by noon Tuesday to allow some comments to surface. Some Chinese internet users called it a \u201cterrible\u201d incident, while others questioned why Chinese media was not reporting on the attack. Some also expressed concerns about its potential impact on China\u2019s global image and the willingness of foreigners to visit the country, amid a rise in nationalism and anti-American sentiment. At its news conference Tuesday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry sought to dismiss concerns that the attack would affect educational exchanges between China and the US. \u201cCarrying out people-to-people and cultural exchanges between China and the United States is in the common interests of both sides and has received active support and response from various sectors in both countries,\u201d said Lin, the spokesperson. \u201cChina is widely recognized as one of the safest countries in the world. China has always taken effective measures and will continue to take relevant measures to effectively protect the safety of all foreigners in China.\u201d Study ties Cornell College began a partnership with Beihua University in 2018, which would see the Chinese institution provide funding for educators from the Iowa school to travel and live in China and teach a portion of a course in areas of computer science, math and physics over two-week periods, according to information posted on the college website at the time. China has been trying to boost its educational cooperation with the US, which has suffered considerable setbacks due to the Covid pandemic and bilateral tensions. During a visit to the US in November, Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced the country would invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years to foster personal ties between the two countries. The Chinese leader noted his own enduring ties to the state of Iowa in his announcement. Xi stayed with a host family in Iowa during his first visit to the US nearly four decades ago, an experience he has described as \u201cunforgettable.\u201d Last week, Xi encouraged universities in China and the US to \u201cstrengthen exchanges and cooperation,\u201d in a letter to the president of Kean University in New Jersey, which has a China-based joint venture with Wenzhou University, according to state media. China has one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the world, partly due to its strict gun controls and powerful mass surveillance. But it has continued to face mass stabbings in public places. In May, two people were killed and another 21 injured in a knife attack in a hospital in the southwestern province of Yunnan. Last year, six people were killed and one injured in an early morning\u00a0stabbing incident\u00a0outside a kindergarten in southern Guangdong province. And a\u00a02022 stabbing, also at a kindergarten, killed three and injured six in eastern Jiangxi province. Correction: An earlier version of this story reported the wrong day for the stabbings. The attack happened Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/asia/china-4-us-cornell-college-instructors-attacked/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_middleeast_israel-plans-tactical-pause-gaza-what-we-know-mime-intl", "text": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has announced a \u201ctactical pause\u201d of military activities along a road in southern Gaza that has been designated for humanitarian aid deliveries every day for 11 hours. The announcement comes as the strip\u2019s population of more than 2 million grapples with humanitarian conditions that the United Nations has described as \u201cunspeakable.\u201d The war, which began on October 7 in the wake of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people and captured 250 hostages, is now in its ninth month with no indication of a ceasefire-hostage deal in the immediate future. The fighting has killed more than 37,000 people so far in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the enclave. On Saturday, eight Israeli soldiers were killed in southern Gaza in one of the deadliest single incidents since the war began. More than 300 IDF soldiers have died to date. The \u201cpause,\u201d which the IDF announced Sunday but COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for approving aid into Gaza, said came into effect on Saturday, raised questions about what it means for the conflict and for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Human rights groups have described health concerns \u201cbeyond crisis levels\u201d\u00a0for Palestinians in the enclave, with over 75% of the population displaced, according to the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). Israel\u2019s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. The announcement also appeared to have deepened existing political rifts in the Israeli government, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unhappy when he first heard about it, according to one official. Here\u2019s what we know. What did Israel announce? The IDF announced that a \u201clocal, tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes\u201d will take place every day from 8 a.m. until 7 p.m. local time until further notice. The pause began Saturday, the IDF said, and is meant to allow trucks to move from the Kerem Shalom Crossing, the main entry point for incoming aid to southern Gaza, up the Salah al-Din Road and northwards. The IDF has designated a specific route for aid trucks to take, which starts from Kerem Shalom to Al Bayuk neighborhood and onto the European Hospital in Khan Younis. The route will be run in coordination with international organizations, the IDF said, as part of efforts to increase volumes of aid reaching Gaza. Soon after announcing the move, the IDF said \u201cthe fighting in Rafah continues,\u201d adding that \u201cthere is no change\u201d in the country\u2019s policy on aid into the strip. In response to a question by CNN\u2019s Paula Hancocks during a briefing to international media in Kerem Shalom on Monday, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that \u201csometimes when you say a tactical pause, people might think that we\u2019re stopping the fighting in Gaza.\u201d \u201cWe should\u2019ve clarified better that we are fighting in Gaza, that we are fighting in Rafah and we created this safe pass, in those hours, to make sure the distribution (of aid) is ongoing,\u201d Hagari said. What will it mean in practice? The IDF said the \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d is meant to help the UN collect and distribute aid at its crossings, where Israel has said aid is\u00a0piling up. COGAT said on Sunday that there are 1,000 humanitarian aid trucks on the Gazan side of the Kerem Shalom crossing waiting to be collected and distributed. Georgios Petropoulos, head of the UN humanitarian affairs (UNOCHA) suboffice in Gaza, told CNN on Monday the pause \u201cwas not a new thing on the ground,\u201d and that there are a number of issues preventing aid workers from reaching parts of the Palestinian enclave. These include the fighting between Israel and Hamas, but also the danger that exists on travel routes as many parts of Gaza battle a state of lawlessness \u2013 where there is \u201ca lack of any police or rule of law,\u201d Petropoulos said. The pause is \u201csimply a packaging of an announcement reflecting what we have been doing here in Gaza for over a week,\u201d Petropoulos told CNN, adding that \u201cthat road was being used by the UN to move goods for days.\u201d When roads are dangerous, aid trucks cannot travel up them, he said. \u201cThe war between Hamas and Israel is not the only issue we have on the ground.\u201d It is unclear how effective the pause will be, as the IDF has previously designated other routes as safe paths for aid, only for aid convoys to be struck. In April, the deadly Israeli attack that killed seven aid workers from the non-profit World Central Kitchen (WCK) in Gaza hit what the team said was a \u201cdeconflicted zone\u201d in coordination with the Israeli military. Aid groups are saying that no difference has yet been seen on the ground. \u201cWe have not seen any improvements thus far,\u201d said Scott Anderson, director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza, stressing that \u201cthe law and order environment in Gaza is not enabling the efficient delivery of aid.\u201d The spokesperson for the UN Children\u2019s Fund, James Elder, warned the pause could not replace a ceasefire. \u201cI just don\u2019t know unfortunately (how long the pause will last), this is a question for the occupying power, for Israel and its military.\u201d What\u2019s the aid situation like in Gaza now? The more than eight-month long humanitarian crisis in Gaza is spiraling. Thousands have died in the besieged enclave, according to the health ministry there, and more than half the population has been internally displaced. Gazans are facing desperate levels of hunger, with more than 50,000 children in need of treatment for acute malnutrition, UNRWA said. Hospitals are in ruins, medical supplies are scarce and humanitarian access remains limited, the UN agency added. According to UNRWA\u2019s data, 60 trucks entered Gaza on June 12, the last batch of vehicles the UN agency has recorded. Land crossings, which aid groups say are the most effective way of getting aid into Gaza, remain limited. Out of five land crossings, only two have been open for aid trucks recently. Those are the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom and Western Erez crossings. A humanitarian pier\u00a0constructed by the US military off the coast of Gaza has also shuttered due to heavy seas, hampering maritime aid delivery. The Government Media Office (GMO) in Gaza has denied that a \u201ctactical pause\u201d is now in effect in the southern Gaza Strip. \u201cTalking about a tactical cessation of the war is an Israeli lie,\u201d the GMO said in a statement Sunday. \u201cWe are still demanding the opening of the Rafah crossing to meet the needs of the population, especially in the northern Gaza Strip.\u201d What has the Israeli government said? It is unclear who took the decision for the pause, as several senior Israeli officials seemed to have been kept in the dark ahead of the announcement. This includes the prime minister, who initially disowned the pause. According to one Israeli official, Netanyahu has raised the question of who ordered it and was unhappy when he first heard about it. The prime minister then contacted his military secretary and said the idea was unacceptable until he was assured the fighting in Rafah would continue, said the official who spoke to CNN on Sunday and requested anonymity. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir also condemned the pause. \u201cWhoever decided on a \u2018tactical pause\u2019 for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,\u201d he said. These disagreements, which burst out into the open across statements and in Israeli media, have only deepened rifts in the country\u2019s government. An IDF spokesman said Monday the pause had been approved by Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant. He said this kind of decision would first be made by COGAT and the Southern Command, and then go up the chain of command for approval, depending on the situation. When asked if this kind of decision would need approval from the Israeli government or cabinet, the spokesperson said, \u201cthis kind of decision does not necessarily need to be approved by the cabinet, and it was approved by the minister of defense.\u201d In an earlier statement Monday the IDF had said the decision was made by the military, not by the Israeli government. The announcement of the pause came \u201cafter the request of the political echelon of the IDF in recent weeks to allow the introduction of aid, and to announce this to the world,\u201d the military told CNN in a statement. The pause is meant to meet the demands of the International Court of Justice regarding Gaza aid deliveries ahead of a court hearing by the end of June, it added. The pause is \u201cintended for the hearing\u2026 at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where Israel will have to prove that it did not violate the order it issued regarding the fighting in Rafah,\u201d which prevented a court order to stop the war, the IDF said. The ICJ is investigating a case brought by Pretoria against Israel in which South Africa accuses Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians during the war. In May, it ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation in Rafah, saying the court considers the humanitarian situation in the southern city to be classified as \u201cdisastrous.\u201d Israeli officials condemned the ICJ\u2019s ruling.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/middleeast/israel-plans-tactical-pause-gaza-what-we-know-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

The National Weather Service warned people in the South and Midwest planning to celebrate dads outdoors on Sunday to stay cool amid a major heat risk, with high temperatures into the 90s in some areas. The intense heat wave won\u2019t stop there. An expansive and exceptionally strong heat dome will build Sunday over the East and stretch into the Midwest and Great Lakes over the next few days, with the heat expected to persist through the week. Heat domes trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. The final Sunday of spring will be a scorcher in the Plains and Midwest, where temperatures will reach the mid- to upper 90s, according to the Weather Prediction Center. People living across the Great Lakes region can expect temperatures in the upper 80s and low 90s. The Mississippi River Valley will be slammed with the worst of Sunday\u2019s sweltering conditions, with large portions of both states facing a Level 3 \u2013 or major \u2013 risk of heat-related impacts. The National Weather Service office in St. Louis encouraged residents to take extra precautions Sunday for its hottest day of the year. \u201cIt will feel like 100-105 during the afternoon hours. We aren\u2019t used to this kind of heat yet,\u201d forecasters wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Sunday\u2019s unrelenting heat will be felt across states including Kansas, Illinois, Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to the weather service. Some smaller pockets of Level 4 \u2013 or extreme \u2013 heat will be felt in a few locations such as Atlanta, where Sunday afternoon temperatures could reach 94 degrees by the afternoon. Millions will face heat-related health risks as conditions reach extreme levels into this week, according to a scale from the National Weather Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heat is the\u00a0deadliest form of weather\u00a0in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year on average as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. Persistent heat could break records this week The extreme temperatures and uncomfortable heat will seep into the larger cities of the Midwest and Northeast by the start of the workweek. On Monday, Chicago temperatures could hit 94 degrees with the heat index at 97 degrees, according to forecasters at Chicago\u2019s weather service office. The high temperatures for the Upper Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions will soar into the mid- and upper 90s on Monday, with the possibility of tying or breaking numerous records, according to the Weather Prediction Center. The potential for record-shattering heat will last across the Ohio Valley and the Northeast through Friday, with some areas hitting heat indices of 105 degrees, the Weather Prediction Center said. A Level 3 heat risk is expected to affect large portions of states including Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio on Monday, according to the weather service. Meanwhile, much of the southern half of Iowa faces an extreme heat risk on Monday. Weather service forecasters in Des Moines, Iowa, warned of high heat and humidity through Tuesday as temperatures push into the 90s and heat index values hit near-triple digits. \u201cMorning lows will be just as impressive, as temperatures remain in the mid- to even upper 70s,\u201d the Weather Prediction Center said. \u201cThe combination of heat, humidity and little overnight relief will bring potentially widespread, significant heat-related impacts to anyone without adequate hydration or reliable cooling,\u201d according to the center. In Detroit, where daytime temperatures are expected to hit the high 90s, the city\u2019s urban core won\u2019t see much relief after dark, where weather service forecasters say overnight lows will only dip to the 70s this week. The sweltering conditions will continue to shift into the eastern and northeastern US by Tuesday.

Thursday\u2019s order by the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas sets the date for a high-profile showdown over Media Matters\u2019 research highlighting antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on the social media platform. In November, X\u00a0sued Media Matters, alleging that the group went out of its way to misrepresent the likelihood that users may encounter hate speech on the platform. CNN has reached out to X for comment on Thursday\u2019s order. Media Matters declined to comment. Media Matters President Angelo Carusone\u00a0has previously called X\u2019s suit \u201cfrivolous\u201d and an attempt to silence Musk\u2019s critics. The lawsuit claimed that Media Matters\u2019 testing methodology was not representative of how real users experience the site and that the group\u2019s reports distorted the odds of a person seeing extremist material. Motions for summary judgment in the case are due in December, and a decision by the judge on those filings could decide the case prior to trial. Musk has suffered setbacks in similar cases. In March, a federal judge in California reprimanded X and tossed out a lawsuit it had filed against another watchdog group, the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

Fighters from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)\u00a0plundered the facility on Saturday stealing an ambulance among other supplies, the aid agency said. \u201cOn Saturday, MSF and the Ministry of Health suspended all activities in South Hospital, El Fasher, North Darfur, after RSF soldiers stormed the facility, opened fire, and looted it, including stealing an MSF ambulance,\u201d MSF Sudan said on social media Saturday. The hospital was the only one in the region \u201cequipped to deal with mass casualties\u201d and \u201cwas the main referral hospital for treating war-wounded.\u201d It was also one of the two hospitals in El Fasher with surgical capacity, according to MSF. As a result, patients are being moved to Paediatric and Saudi hospitals \u201cwhich were unprepared for such an influx,\u201d it added. Video posted on an apparent RSF \u201cX\u201d account shows armed men at the front gate of South Hospital. The footage was geolocated by CNN and shows at least one man firing an AK-style weapon on hospital grounds. According to MSF\u2019s statement posted on Twitter,\u00a0only ten patients and a small medical team were at the hospital\u00a0when it was attacked. Medical teams had already begun transferring patients and services to other facilities earlier in the week after intensified fighting in the region, the MSF said. Images posted to social media and verified by CNN show damaged medical equipment strewn in and around the facility. In one video, an armed man poses inside what appears to be an ambulance parked outside South Hospital. It is unclear whether the vehicle belonged to MSF. CNN has reached out to the RSF for comment. MSF said most patients and the remaining medical team, which included all MSF staff, were able to flee the violence but they are unable to say for certain if there were any casualties due to the chaos that ensued. South Hospital is the latest medical facility to fall into warring factions\u2019 crosshairs in Darfur. The medical facility had already been hit by mortar shells and bullets multiple times in the preceding weeks between May 25th\u00a0and June 3rd\u00a0resulting in two deaths and 14 injuries among patients and caretakers, according to MSF. On May 11, nearby Babiker Nahar Paediatric Hospital was impacted by an SAF airstrike 50 meters from the facility, per an MSF press release. Two children and a care giver in the intensive care unit were killed in the strike after a roof collapsed. \u201cIt is outrageous that the RSF opened fire inside the hospital. This is not an isolated incident, as staff and patients have endured attacks on the facility for weeks from all sides, but opening fire inside a hospital crosses a line,\u201d said MSF\u2019s Head of Emergencies Michel Lacharite, as quoted by MSF Sudan on X Saturday. \u201cWarring parties must halt attacks on medical care. Hospitals are closing. Remaining facilities can\u2019t handle mass casualties. We are trying to find solutions. The responsibility is on warring parties to spare medical facilities,\u201d Lacharite added. Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs & Security Policy of the EU Nabila Massrali\u00a0said on X Sunday,\u00a0\u201cThe EU is appalled by RSF-Janjaweed assault of staff at the El Fasher South Hospital in Darfur also looting it, as it did with many other hospitals in Sudan.\u201d \u201cWe remind again the [RSF] to show restraint and respect International Humanitarian Law,\u201d she added.

Civil war in Sudan between the SAF and RSF broke out in April 2023.

{"id": "2024_06_10_asia_north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea sent a new wave of trash-laden balloons toward its southern neighbor late Sunday, after Kim Jong Un\u2019s powerful sister warned of further responses if the South keeps up its \u201cpsychological warfare.\u201d The new balloons, which Seoul has previously slammed as \u201cbase and dangerous,\u201d come in apparent retaliation for the decision by South Korea to resume broadcasting anti-North Korean\u00a0propaganda over loudspeakers in border areas. Kim\u2019s sister and government spokeswoman Kim Yo Jong warned the resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts was \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation.\u201d In a statement carried by North Korean state media, Kim said South Korea would be subject to an unspecified \u201cnew counteraction\u201d\u00a0from the North if it continued with the loudspeaker broadcasts and failed to prevent activists from\u00a0sending anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the border. \u201cI sternly warn Seoul to stop at once this dangerous act,\u201d Kim said, adding that Seoul is creating a \u201cnew environment of crisis.\u201d South\u00a0Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)\u00a0has maintained North\u00a0Korea\u00a0is \u201cfully responsible\u201d for the current situation and urged the North to \u201cimmediately stop such mean acts like sending waste balloons.\u201d In a statement Monday, a JCS spokesman would not say whether the South would continue to broadcast over the loudspeakers, noting only that\u00a0the military would conduct missions \u201cwith flexibility according to the strategic and operational situation.\u201d The escalating tit-for-tat has sparked concerns of potential retaliatory military action. Last week, the South Korean government suspended a 2018 deal\u00a0to reduce military tensions with the North, allowing it to resume propaganda broadcasts and potentially restart military exercises along the border. South Korea\u2019s military once routinely deployed propaganda broadcasts as a means of psychological warfare against the North, until it withdrew the equipment following the 2018 deal. The broadcasts inform North\u00a0Korean soldiers and residents of the \u201creality of North\u00a0Korea,\u201d and the development of\u00a0South\u00a0Korea, and modern Korean culture, according to the JCS. Tit-for-tat balloons In recent weeks, the North has floated more than a thousand trash-filled balloons across the heavily fortified border, in what it claims is a response to the years-long practice among South Korean activist groups of sending\u00a0balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets in the other direction. As of Monday morning, the South Korean military had found \u201caround 50 balloons\u201d that fell into its territory overnight Sunday. Many other balloons are believed to have flown back into\u00a0North\u00a0Korea due to the wind, according to the JCS spokesman. On Thursday, South Korean activists sent balloons across the border toward the North, carrying hundreds of thousands of leaflets condemning leader Kim Jong Un and 5,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and K-dramas. For decades, North Korea has been almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers\u00a0sentenced to hard labor\u00a0for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including\u00a0parts of its pop culture,\u00a0to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years and diplomatic talks fell apart \u2013 prompting\u00a0strict rules to snap back\u00a0into place in the North.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/10/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-south-korea-loudspeakers-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

The oil spilled into the city-state\u2019s waters after a Netherlands-flagged dredger, Vox Maxima, hit Singapore-flagged bunker vessel, Marine Honor, on Friday afternoon, according to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). While the oil leak from the vessel had been contained and treated with dispersants as of Saturday,\u00a0some of the treated fuel had spread due to the\u00a0tidal currents, according to the MPA. The oil spill has spread from the busy Pasir Panjang Terminal cargo port, less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Sentosa, the country\u2019s popular resort island home to luxury hotels, golf courses and\u00a0Universal Studios Singapore. The incident occurred at the start of the Hari Raya Haji long holiday weekend, during which locals and tourists alike were expected to flock to Sentosa and other landmarks. While the scale of environmental damage of the spill remains unclear, local conservation group Marine Stewards posted photos of oil-soaked birds and shorelines on its Facebook page. \u201cThere have been many cases of wildlife affected \u2014 a number of kingfishers, otters and monitor lizards covered in oil, seabirds whose legs are stained with oil. We have also received reports of dead fish and a dead sea snake,\u201d said Marine Stewards founder Sue Ye in a statement. Cleanup efforts were ongoing Monday with about 100 workers deployed across Sentosa\u2019s beaches, a spokesperson from the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) told CNN. Sentosa\u2019s beaches remain open to the public but swimming and water activities are not allowed at Tanjong, Palawan and Siloso beaches on the west coast of the island, the SDC added. The outlying islands of St. John\u2019s, Lazarus and Kusu were closed off on Sunday evening as the slick had spread to the shores of the first two locations, which are popular among day trippers via ferries and yacht charters, according to a joint statement from the National Parks Board, together with scientists and volunteers from Friends of Marine Park. Authorities deployed skimmer vessels for the cleanup efforts and laid close to 1,500 meters\u00a0(4,921 feet) of oil absorbent booms to protect a coastal natural reserve lined with mangroves. Singapore is a global shipping and fuel bunkering hub that sits along a narrow, busy strait connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. Measuring about 13 kilometers (8 miles) long,\u00a019 kilometers (11.8 miles)\u00a0wide and dotted with several small islands, it is one of the world\u2019s busiest commercial waterways where around 1,000 ships pass through every day. Heng Kiah Chun, regional campaign strategist for Greenpeace, said the incident was a \u201cwake-up call\u201d on the need to phase out fossil fuels that bring permanent harm to people and the planet. \u201cThe oil spill is a growing environmental catastrophe that is impacting some of the region\u2019s most important and biodiverse marine protected areas and fisheries areas,\u201d Heng said.

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_africa_sudan-darfur-genocide-fears-explainer-intl", "text": "Darfur, a region in western Sudan, has a tragic history marked by ethnic violence and humanitarian crises. In the early 2000s, the area experienced a brutal conflict that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Today, there are alarming signs that Darfur may be heading towards another genocide. For more than a year, swathes of Sudan have erupted in fierce clashes between the Sudanese Army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that have left more 14,000 people dead and displaced more than 8 million others, according to the United Nations. But their battle for territorial control has now drifted toward El Fasher, the last major town in Darfur that\u2019s yet to be conquered by the RSF. Analysts say it\u2019s only a matter of days before El Fasher falls to the rebels. What\u2019s happening in Darfur? Ethnic-related killings have intensified in Darfur since fighting broke out in mid-April last year between the rival military factions. The RSF, which evolved from the Arab Janjaweed militia that spearheaded the genocide of the early 2000s, killing an estimated 300,000 people, has however, targeted the Masalit ethnic group and other non-Arab communities. Reports indicate widespread atrocities, including mass killings, sexual violence, and the systematic destruction of villages. Human Rights Watch and other organizations have documented these abuses, which have been likened to ethnic cleansing campaigns. The violence has forced tens of thousands of people to flee, many seeking refuge in neighboring Chad, the UN Refugee Agency said. At least 134 people were killed in El Fasher last month after gunfire rang out in the city and bombs fell on civilian homes as RSF fighters encircled the town. Last week, North Darfur\u2019s main hospital in El Fasher was also forced to close after the RSF raided the facility and looted vital supplies. The hospital had previously been hit by bullets and mortar shells. Indicators of genocide The RSF is headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, also known as Hemedti, a former leader of the Janjaweed militia. Analysts told CNN that the targeted nature of the violence in Darfur, the systematic approach of the RSF, and the historical context of ethnic conflicts in the region all suggest that the situation could evolve into another genocide. The intent to destroy the Masalit people and other non-Arab groups mirrors the patterns of violence that characterized the genocide of the early 2000s, said Sudanese lawyer Mutasim Ali. \u201cThe RSF uses systematic dehumanization method against non-Arabs in Darfur, saying,\u00a0\u2018these are dirt, dogs and monkeys\u2019 and \u2018let\u2019s kill the babies and males because if they grow up, they will fight us back.\u2019 There is a systematic policy of dehumanization .. the same explicit incitement from since the early 2000s,\u201d said Ali, a legal adviser at the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights. In April, the United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, warned that \u201cprevailing signs of genocide\u201d and \u201cgrave human rights violations and abuses continue to be reported against innocent civilian populations\u201d in Sudan. \u201cMost of the atrocities that are committed today\u00a0are by the same actors in the early 2000s.\u00a0The RSF is rebranded Janjaweed militia: same commanders, same ethnic tribes, and the same victim groups (non-Arab communities) in Darfur\u00a0that are being systematically targeted by the RSF,\u201d Ali told CNN. He added: \u201cWe see that the perpetrators are documenting their abuses by themselves. Back in the day, there were no cell\u00a0phones,\u00a0and (abuses) were primarily documented by human rights organizations that were in Sudan.\u00a0But this time, they document killing people, burning villages, and their incitement.\u201d Weapons support from regional powers Ali says that technology and sophisticated weaponry are the only peculiarities that differentiate the RSF\u2019s current atrocities from the genocide committed by the Janjaweed more than two decades ago. Where previously, they used camels, horses, and basic weapons. The militia now has armored vehicles, drones, and advanced weaponry, along with significant support from regional powers and nations such as the United Arab Emirates, Ali said. A June 12 report by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab said that a cargo plane believed to be owned by the UAE was identified through satellite imagery flying within RSF-controlled areas in El-Fasher on June 11. \u201cThe same model of aircraft (IL-76) is reported to be used for lethal aid transfers by the UAE to the RSF for flights to locations in Chad,\u201d the report added. The UAE has denied providing military, financial, or logistical support to any armed group in Sudan. What happens if El Fasher falls? US Special Envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, said this week that El Fasher\u2019s fall to the RSF could be imminent. Home to nearly 2 million people, the city is predominantly occupied by non-Arab\u00a0ethnic groups, including the Masalit. El Fasher also shelters hundreds of thousands of displaced people who fled other parts of Darfur that were captured by the RSF, including El Geneina where hundreds of non-Arab people were massacred last year. Ali told CNN similar atrocities were likely to happen in El Fasher if the city came under RSF control. \u201cEl Fasher is going to be a lot more catastrophic because it is basically in the middle of a desert. Even if people decide to leave, probably they will die\u00a0in the desert. We will see another genocide on our watch.\u201d What has been the international response? The UN Security Council adopted a UK-led\u00a0resolution Thursday demanding that the RSF ends its \u201csiege\u201d of El Fasher. \u201cThe fighting must stop now,\u201d said UK Foreign Secretary\u00a0David Cameron in a post on X, adding that warring \u201cparties must let in urgent humanitarian aid to prevent a famine.\u201d Earlier this week, the International Criminal Court said it was investigating allegations of war crimes in El Fasher while making a public call for evidence. International response to the conflict has however been criticized as insufficient. Despite calls for action, including the deployment of protective missions and the imposition of sanctions by the United States on key RSF commanders, concrete measures have been limited. \u201cThe international response does not come close to meeting the scale of the world\u2019s largest man-made humanitarian disaster,\u201d said\u00a0international human rights lawyer, Yonah Diamond. \u201cThe major powers have largely invested in a sham peace process for 14 months that is going nowhere and serves as a cover for daily mass atrocities on the ground. Only concrete acts of protection and accountability will stem the violence,\u201d he told CNN. International efforts to broker ceasefires between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF have been unsuccessful. Diamond said there has also been insufficient coverage of the Sudan war when compared to other global conflicts. \u201cEvery major news outlet has dedicated an ongoing slot to Gaza and Ukraine, with ad hoc coverage for Sudan. There is no reason why a conflict impacting a greater number of civilians, threatening millions with death by starvation and an ongoing genocide do not receive the same attention,\u201d he said. He noted that this lack of attention hinders humanitarian efforts, pointing out that while Gaza and Ukraine have each received about 30% of their humanitarian response plans, Sudan, where 25 million people urgently need help, has received only about half of that amount. What will happen next? As Sudan steers dangerously towards another genocide, the world\u2019s response in the coming months will be crucial in determining the outcome. \u201cThe international community, led by the African Union, must deploy a civilian protection mechanism to protect the millions at risk in El Fasher and elsewhere in Sudan and explicitly threaten the UAE with consequences should it fail to restrain the RSF and continue to supply the militias with heavy weaponry,\u201d Diamond advised. \u201cThe US, the UK, and others have leverage to exert pressure on their ally, the UAE, to end the RSF\u2019s genocidal campaign today. President (Joe) Biden can simply call on the UAE to halt its support for the RSF, which would fall apart without it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/africa/sudan-darfur-genocide-fears-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

The respective parties involved include the ANC, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the DA, Steenhuisen outlined in his statement. \u201cToday, the 14th of June 2024 will go down in the annals of history as the start of a new chapter for our beloved country,\u201d Steenhuisen said. The DA, a broadly centrist and pro-business party, is seen as the official opposition to the ANC, and has been heavily critical of the ANC for years. \u201cIt is difficult to overstate just how significant this moment is for the Democratic Alliance,\u201d Steenhuisen said, adding that the party will \u201cgovern the Republic of South Africa in a spirit of unity and collaboration.\u201d \u201cThanks to the 3.5 million people who voted for us, the DA will no longer only be an opposition party at a national level. Instead, the DA now becomes the second biggest party inside a multi-party national government,\u201d the DA leader added. No party managed to win an outright majority in South Africa\u2019s election last month. Support for the ANC dropped to 40.18%,\u00a0a huge slump from the 57.5% it received in the last election in 2019. The DA party received 21.8% of the vote. Former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s newly-formed uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) had nearly 14.59% of the vote.

Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC leader, will remain the country\u2019s president under the deal, according to a report on the TimesLive news website.

In an AI category at the 1839 Awards\u2019 Color Photography Contest, judged by industry leaders at Christie\u2019s, Phaidon and the Centre Pompidou, Astray pulled off an act of feathery subterfuge, sneaking in an entry of a real photo of a flamingo he took while in Aruba. Like AI images, which can bear hallmark signs of wonky anatomy, like too many teeth or fingers, the flamingo appeared headless as it bent its neck to scratch itself with its beak. To Astray\u2019s surprise, it won both third place in the category \u2014 and the People\u2019s Vote award. \u201cTo see it get shortlisted by the jury was a surprise in that it\u2019s always a bit of a lottery in such big contest. There are just so many excellent pictures competing,\u201d Astray told CNN over email. \u201cAfter it got shortlisted\u2026 I thought I might really have a shot and started campaigning for people\u2019s votes, but I had absolutely no idea how far or close I was to winning until the announcement.\u201d After the winners were revealed, the photographer notified the organization that runs the 1839 Awards, Creative Resource Collective, and took to social media to reveal his trickery. \u201cI entered this actual photo into the AI category of 1839 Awards to prove that human-made content has not lost its relevance, that Mother Nature and her human interpreters can still beat the machine, and that creativity and emotion are more than just a string of digits,\u201d Astray wrote. \u201cThere were ethical concerns, of course, so I was hoping that the jury and the audience would find that this jab at AI and its ethical implications outweighs the ethical implications of deceiving the viewer, which, of course, is ironic because that is what AI does.\u201d Astray was subsequently disqualified from the competition, with the director of Creative Resource Collective, Lily Fierman, explaining in a statement to CNN that \u201ceach category has distinct criteria that entrants\u2019 images must meet\u2026 we don\u2019t want to prevent other artists from their shot at winning in the AI category.\u201d Fierman said there\u2019s \u201cno hard feelings,\u201d and that their team plans to work with Astray to publish a conversation around the state of AI-generated images, using his entry as a \u201cjumping-off point.\u201d \u201cWe hope this will raise awareness (and send a message of hope) to other photographers who are worried about AI,\u201d she added. Creative Resource Collective did not comment on how their AI and non-AI photography categories are judged and vetted. As for the flamingo, Astray emphasized it was a serendipitous moment, not one that he sought out. \u201cI was not actively looking for a picture that would work for this stunt,\u201d he explained to CNN. \u201cRather, the idea had been roaming in some remote corner of my mind, more subconsciously than consciously I think, and when I saw this picture, it surfaced. It is simply the perfect shot for this because the scene is so unreal and for such a simple, natural reason: a flamingo scratching its belly.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/style/flamingo-photograph-ai-1839-awards/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Kanchenjunga Express, which runs between\u00a0the city of Kolkata and Silchar in northeastern Assam state, was struck by a freight train south of the city of Siliguri, according to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Disaster teams have rushed to the crash location, which lies below the foothills that lead to Darjeeling, a popular mountain tourist destination famous for its tea plantations and stunning Himalayan views. Local media pictures and video footage\u00a0from the scene showed at least one train car on its side, parts of it crushed into a mass of twisted metal. Another car can be seen rising into the air at a steep angle above an engine carriage. Northeast Frontier Railway spokesperson Sabyasachi De told CNN at least eight people were killed in the crash. A total of 52 patients have been admitted to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, of which nine are in \u201cvery serious\u201d condition, the facility\u2019s superintendent Sanjay Mallick told CNN. Others have minor fractures, he said. Banerjee, the local chief minister, wrote on X that \u201cdoctors, ambulances and disaster teams have been rushed to the site for rescue, recovery, medical assistance.\u201d \u201cAction on war-footing initiated,\u201d she added. Live images from the site of the crash streamed live by local news channel TV 9 showed people gathered outside the carriages, some filming on their phones. The crash comes more than a year after India experienced one of the worst train disasters in the country\u2019s history, when more than 280 people were killed in a three-way collision involving two passenger trains and a freight train in eastern Odisha state. That incident shocked the nation, renewing calls for authorities to confront safety issues in a railway system that transports more than 13 million passengers every day. India\u2019s extensive rail network, one of the largest in the world, was built more than 160 years ago under British colonial rule. Today, it runs about 11,000 trains every day over 67,000 miles of tracks in the world\u2019s\u00a0most populous nation. But decaying infrastructure is often cited as a cause for traffic delays and numerous train accidents. Though\u00a0government statistics show that accidents and derailments have been on the decline in recent years, they are still tragically common. More than 16,000 people were killed in nearly 18,000 railway accidents across the country in 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. Most railway accidents were due to falls from trains and collisions between trains and people on the track. Train-on-train collisions are less common. On Monday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the West Bengal crash \u201csaddening\u201d and sent a message of condolence to the affected families. \u201cI pray that the injured recover at the earliest. Spoke to officials and took stock of the situation. Rescue operations are underway to assist the affected,\u201d Modi wrote on X. Upgrading India\u2019s transportation infrastructure is a key priority for Modi in his push to create a\u00a0$5 trillion economy by 2025.\u00a0His government last year raised capital spending on airports, road and highway construction and other infrastructure projects to $122 billion, or 1.7% of its GDP. A significant portion of that spending is targeted at introducing more high-speed trains to India\u2019s notoriously slow railways.

The 30-year-old US golfer might be holding a one-shot lead atop the leaderboard at the US Open, but he gives a spectator a ball and signs his hat before high-fiving a row of on-lookers. DeChambeau looks to be a different man from a few years ago. There was a widely-held perception that the golfer was a highly-strung, uber-competitor, whose desire to win often grated on his rivals. Fast forward to 2024 and DeChambeau looks a lot more comfortable in his skin. That change has seemingly paid huge dividends, with the 30-year-old claiming his second major title over the weekend, winning the US Open at Pinehurst in North Carolina. He did so in spectacular fashion as he held off Rory McIlroy\u2019s challenge and hit a crucial bunker shot on the final hole to leave him a simple putt to clinch the title. DeChambeau called his bunker effort \u201cpossibly my best golf shot of my entire life.\u201d DeChambeau 2:0 is the result of a \u201clot of personal growth,\u201d according to the golfer. \u201c2022 was a rock-bottom year for me and pushed me to be the person I am today.

A loss of form resulted in DeChambeau tumble down the world rankings as he struggled with his game to leave him a \u201cpretty deep hole.\u201d \u201cGolf swing wasn\u2019t doing well.

But, through the help and support of the people around him and hard work on the course, DeChambeau\u2019s 2024 has something of a annus mirabilis. Before appearing at Pinehurst, he had engineered successful appearances at this year\u2019s majors, finishing tied-sixth at The Masters and second at the PGA Championship. The best was still to come though, as DeChambeau showed grit and resilience to claim his second US Open title, all the while showing his appreciation for the support he got over the four days in North Carolina. \u201cMy mission is to continue to expand the game, grow the game globally, domestically. YouTube has really helped me accomplish some of that,\u201d DeChambeau told reporters afterwards. \u201cConsequently I think people have seen who I am on YouTube, which has been fantastic, \u2018cause then I get to play off of it. It just feeds itself out here. \u201cThey just say things that make me interact and engage. When is the next junior club set coming out? \u201cIt\u2019s direct conversations to people that truly engage with what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s such an awesome, awesome platform for me to show who I truly am.\u201d DeChambeau\u2019s YouTube channel currently has over 700,000 subscribers. He posts educational golf videos, while others are more humorous or involve challenges he tries to complete. He added: \u201cFrom my perspective, I\u2019m just passionate. I really care about doing well out here and showing the fans a side of me that was locked up for so long.\u201d A special day Not only did Sunday\u2019s victory have DeChambeau back in the winner\u2019s circle at a majora for the first time in four years, but it also came on a particularly poignant day for the US golfer. The tournament\u2019s final round fell on Father\u2019s Day \u2013 his dad, Jon, passed away in 2022 and DeChambeau admitted that that memory loomed large on Sunday. \u201cAll day,\u201d DeChambeau told CNN\u2019s Patrick Snell when asked whether he felt Jon\u2019s presence with him during Sunday\u2019s action. \u201cThere were numerous times on 2, 3, 4, even 5 where I was just walking down the fairway thinking about him.\u201d And afterwards, DeChambeau dedicated his US Open victory to his dad. \u201cThis one is for him,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/sport/bryson-dechambeau-reinvention-dad-us-open-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_europe_russia-evan-gershkovich-court-trial-intl", "text": "Evan Gershkovich, the first American journalist to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War, will stand trial in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg after prosecutors formally accused him of spying for the CIA. The Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s office said Thursday it had approved the indictment, more than a year after Gershkovich was first detained. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. Gershkovich, the US government and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, have vehemently denied the charges against him. Less than two weeks after his arrest, Gershkovich was designated as wrongfully detained by the US State Department, which called for his immediate release. Russian prosecutors said the country\u2019s federal security service (FSB) had \u201cestablished and documented\u201d that Gershkovich was acting on CIA instructions in the month he was arrested, alleging he had \u201ccollected secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory. \u201cGershkovich carried out the illegal actions using painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d it said in a statement. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Thursday said the allegations against Gershkovich have \u201cabsolutely zero credibility.\u201d \u201cWe have been clear from the start that Evan has done nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place. Journalism is not a crime. The charges against him are false, and the Russian government knows that they\u2019re false. He should be released immediately,\u201d Miller said at a State Department briefing. In the year since his arrest, the 32-year-old journalist has been imprisoned in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo Prison, and his pre-trial detention period had been extended numerous times. On Thursday, the State Department\u2019s top hostage official confirmed \u201cas of today, Evan\u2019s detention and the investigative process has ended.\u201d Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens said Gershkovich was likely to be moved from Lefortovo to Yekaterinburg \u2013 more than 800 miles away \u2013before the end of June, and was then likely to stand trial in that city. \u201cIf it\u2019s anything like what happened to Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan, Trevor Reed, there\u2019ll be a period when he leaves Lefortovo where we won\u2019t have any contact with him,\u201d Carstens explained, referencing other Americans wrongfully detained in Russia. \u201cIt\u2019ll almost be like it\u2019s gone dark, but eventually, an American or I would say, a detainee surfaces in Yekaterinburg and we\u2019ll have a chance to reestablish that connectivity from there,\u201d Carstens said at a congressional hearing. Responding to Thursday\u2019s announcement, WSJ Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker said Gershkovich is facing a \u201cfalse and baseless\u201d charge. \u201cRussia\u2019s latest move toward a sham trial is, while expected, deeply disappointing and still no less outrageous. Evan has spent 441 days wrongfully detained in a Russian prison for simply doing his job. Evan is a journalist. The Russian regime\u2019s smearing of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on calculated and transparent lies. Journalism is not a crime. Evan\u2019s case is an assault on free press,\u201d Tucker said in a statement. Reporters Without Borders, an international group promoting press freedom, denounced Gershkovich\u2019s indictment. \u201cThe espionage accusations must be abandoned and Evan immediately liberated,\u201d it said in a statement. US Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy, speaking after Gershkovich\u2019s pre-trial detention was extended in March, said: \u201cEvan\u2019s case is not about evidence, due process, or rule of law. It is about using American citizens as pawns to achieve political ends.\u201d She called on the Kremlin \u201cto let Evan go.\u201d Proposed swaps Miller, the State Department spokesperson, reiterated on Thursday that the US would continue to pursue Gershkovich\u2019s release, as well that of Whelan, a former US marine who was arrested in Moscow in 2018 and sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he and the US deny. \u201cWe put a substantial offer on the table to secure the release of Evan and Paul Whelan some months ago, as we said,\u201d Miller said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re continuing to work to secure their release. We don\u2019t talk about all the details of that publicly.\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin hinted earlier in the year that \u201can agreement can be reached\u201d with the United States to release Gershkovich, as he brought up the conviction of a \u201cpatriotic\u201d Russian hitman in Germany. Speaking in a lengthy and at times ponderous interview with American right-wing pundit Tucket Carlson in February, Putin alluded to the case of Vadim Krasikov, a former colonel from Russia\u2019s domestic spy organization who was convicted of assassinating a former Chechen fighter in broad daylight in Berlin in 2019. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll tell you: sitting in one country, a country that is an ally of the United States, is a man who, for patriotic reasons, eliminated a bandit in one of the European capitals,\u201d Putin said. Russian government officials\u00a0have\u00a0previously requested\u00a0that Krasikov be released as part of a proposed prisoner swap of notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout for US citizens Griner and Whelan\u00a0according to US officials and\u00a0CNN reporting. Griner, a professional basketball player, was freed in a prisoner exchange for Bout while Whelan remains in prison. Speaking to CNN in Berlin to mark the year since Gershkovich\u2019s detention, Polina Ivanova \u2013 one of his closest friends and a reporter at the Financial Times \u2013 said he was doing \u201cremarkably well\u201d and passing most of his time writing letters \u201ctrying to make us feel better.\u201d \u201cWhen you see Putin talk about it in very clear terms that this is what they want to see happen, that they are looking for a deal, it gives you hope that at some point he will be home. He needs to be home,\u201d Ivanova said. In recent years, Russia has detained a number of other Americans. Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was detained in June 2023, Russian-American ballerina Ksenia Karelina was\u00a0arrested in January, and American teacher Marc Fogel\u00a0was arrested in August 2021.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/europe/russia-evan-gershkovich-court-trial-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Record-breaking high temperatures will last into next week, ushering in the start of summer with this year\u2019s most significant heat event yet. Hundreds of records could be tied or broken this week as a massive heat dome parks over part of the East. Multiple all-time June high temperature records could fall as the heat rises to levels normally seen only on the hottest July days. Parts of the Midwest to the Northeast could endure the longest heat wave they\u2019ve seen in decades, the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center said. Tens of millions of people who live as far north as Maine and aren\u2019t used to heat this intense will be sweating in temperatures well into the 90s this week. It will feel even hotter than that as humidity helps drive heat index values \u2013 how temperatures feel to the body \u2013 into the low 100s. Read more: Search continues for US tourist and two others missing amid Greek heat wave An extreme heat risk is in place from the Great Lakes into the Northeast this week, according to the National Weather Service. Wednesday and Thursday will be the hottest days of the week, but the surrounding days will only be slightly less brutal. Heat will reach dangerous levels in many places including the major metropolitan areas of Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York City and Boston. Temperatures will top out at 15 to 20 degrees above normal over a sweeping area of the northeastern US Monday afternoon and are expected to rise up to 25 degrees above normal through the rest of the workweek. Some areas, including Montpelier, Vermont; Syracuse, New York; and Pittsburgh, haven\u2019t seen heat like this in about three decades. \u201cLast time we saw heat in Pittsburgh like what we\u2019re expecting next week was 30 yrs ago (almost to the day) when it reached 95\u00b0F or warmer for 6 straight days (June 15-20, 1994),\u201d the local weather service office said on X. \u201cThat stands as the longest stretch of 95+ (degree) days on record. We have a shot at tying or beating that.\u201d Some affected areas have started to activate heat protocols. Cooling centers will open across New York City starting Tuesday and cooling kits will be distributed to people working outdoors, Mayor Eric Adams said Monday. Burlington, Vermont, will also activate cooling centers starting Tuesday, according to the city. Recreation centers in Cleveland will be open for extended hours this week to serve as cooling centers, city officials said Monday. The city also suspended all playground programs for the week as temperatures soar. Heat domes like the one fueling this week\u2019s intense conditions trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. The oven-like conditions mean overnight temperatures often don\u2019t cool down enough to offer relief for overheated bodies, posing increased risks for heat-related illness. \u201cWarm overnight temperatures only dropping into the mid-70s will offer little to no relief, especially to those without adequate or reliable cooling,\u201d the Weather Prediction Center said.   Humidity will also join forces with extreme heat to create triple-digit heat indices \u2013 measurements of how hot the human body feels \u2013 in some areas. Chicago residents could feel\u00a0heat indices between 95 and 105 degrees through next week, the NWS in Chicago warned. Parts of eastern New York and western New England could see indices as high as 107 degrees. The NWS in Detroit, where the heat index could reach 100 degrees, urged residents to practice heat safety in the coming days, including limiting strenuous outdoor activities, staying hydrated, and checking up on neighbors who are elderly or don\u2019t have A/C. Heat-related illness is a concern in severely impacted areas, particularly for the elderly, young children and outdoor workers. Extreme heat is by far the deadliest form of severe weather, killing on average twice as many people a year as tornadoes and hurricanes combined.

{"id": "2024_06_17_style_wheatfield-ny-montana-agnes-denes", "text": "Four decades after the artist Agnes Denes planted and harvested a two-acre wheat field in Lower Manhattan, using one of the last undeveloped plots of land in the economic capital to create an idyllic but ephemeral vista, the ecological artist \u2014 now aged 93 \u2014 has reimagined the project in Montana. \u201cWheatfield \u2013 An Inspiration\u201d marks the first time the Budapest-born, New York-based artist has planted a wheat field in the US since she spent that muggy summer in 1982 with a group of volunteers cleaning up a landfill in Battery Park City to make it tenable for rows of the golden crop to grow. It drew crowds and reporters \u2014 including CNN \u2014 and made for a striking view as the wheat flourished against the backdrop of the Twin Towers. Made as an act of rebellion, the beauty of the field was a call to reprioritize human values and incite change among world powers decades before the environmental crisis became a mainstream concern. (It has been restaged internationally, including in Milan in 2015, and at Art Basel in Switzerland this month, concurrently with the field in Montana.) Out west, Denes hopes to plant seeds of community with the help of the project\u2019s host,\u00a0Tinworks, an arts organization in the rapidly developing city of Bozeman. Wheat may not be out of place in Montana, a top-producing state of the crop in the country\u2019s agricultural heartland, but it is a reminder of the changing landscape as urban centers continue to sprawl outwards and food insecurity looms due to climate change. \u201cWheat is wonderful \u2014 it sustains humanity and is probably the most planted food next to rice. It\u2019s a good metaphor,\u201d Denes said in a video call with CNN. \u201cThe original \u2018Wheatfield\u2019 was a confrontation of people who run the world. I wanted leaders to rethink the use of land and the use of humanity,\u201d she added. \u201cThis \u2018Wheatfield\u2019 is a totally different idea \u2014 to bring people together.\u201d Denes and Tinworks are doing so in collaboration with Bozeman residents, students and small businesses. Last fall, around 50 volunteers cleaned up the site, a lot owned by Tinworks, and planted the winter wheat led by a local fifth-generation farmer, Kenny Van Dyke. They will tend the wheat by hand all summer until September, when students from Montana State University\u2019s plant sciences department, which is also a partner on the project, will harvest the crop. Wheat will also be sprouting all around the city in solidarity with the project, thanks to some 200 packets of seeds Tinworks distributed to community members. Come fall, local bakeries will use the resulting flour milled from the grain in their products, and will help keep regional food banks stocked, according to Tinworks director Jenny Moore.  \u201c(\u2018Wheatfield\u2019) is so timely, in terms of the issues that we\u2019re facing with climate change, agricultural developments, food sustainability, food insecurity, the value of land and the loss of agricultural land in Bozeman,\u201d Moore said in a call. \u201cUnderstanding the presence and role of wheat in Montana both historically and presently, it just seemed like such a fantastic opportunity to ask Agnes if she would reconsider the work in (this) context.\u201d Though the wheat has successfully sprouted, unseasonably warm weather in December and January meant only scant snow for the winter crop, whose survival typically relies on several inches of coverage. At the time of the call with Moore in February, the field\u2019s future seemed precarious. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019d wished the weather wasn\u2019t so much proving the point of what a crisis point we\u2019re in,\u201d she said. Through land and time Over her career, Denes has been a pioneering figure in ecological art, with concepts that strive to \u201cunite the human intellect with the majesty of nature,\u201d as she described in her collection of writings, \u201cThe Human Argument.\u201d Her work is a call to action and, often, a warning, but always in service of demonstrating how art can help improve humanity. The scale of her projects is often grand and complex. Take \u201cTree Mountain,\u201d which involved planting 11,000 trees in a spiral formation in a gravel pit near Ylojarvi, Finland, in the 1990s. Embodying her fascination with mathematics in nature, structure and beauty, the form is based on the spiral of sunflower seeds, which follow the golden ratio. Each tree belongs to the person who planted it, an assertion of our shared responsibility over the stewardship of Earth \u201cThey own it. The only thing is, they can\u2019t sell it \u2014 no money is ever involved, but they can leave it to their children and their children\u2019s children in perpetuity,\u201d Denes explained. \u201cSo it becomes a family. The forest becomes a family connected by a tree.\u201d Many of her ideas are in this vein, with projects meant to establish conversations not only globally, but through vast stretches of time. \u201cI\u2019m the most impractical person you ever want to meet,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it never comes into question of how difficult it\u2019s going to be\u2026 I know it\u2019s practical, because it\u2019s made for humanity.\u201d But though Denes has been extraordinarily prolific in her concepts and proposals \u2014 many of her some 200 ideas have been published in \u201cThe Human Argument\u201d \u2014 she has only realized a fraction of them in her lifetime. The majority only be experienced through writings, schematics and models. They include her plan to bury time capsules containing information about our current civilization in Antarctica\u2019s glaciers, to be carried out by the ocean in thousands of years\u2019 time, or an early idea to create a silent, flying aircraft to understand the movements and behaviors of migrating birds. \u201cPeople know me finally \u2014 (but) after working 60 years or 70 years, they know me on three or four projects. That\u2019s it,\u201d she said. \u201cCan you imagine if I could have realized 20 or 30?\u201d Sowing seeds for change As with \u201cWheatfield,\u201d seeds have often served as potent symbols for Denes. Her first noted work was a small, private performance in Sullivan County, New York, in 1968, which involved Denes planting rice seeds to signify life, chaining a series of trees together to represent decay, and burying a haiku to illustrate higher thinking \u2014 three concepts which exist in a triangularity, she asserted. Nine years later, she was invited to restage the performance at Artpark in Lewiston, where she planted a half-acre of rice on Niagara Gorge above the falls. More recently, she exhibited the verdant \u201cLiving Pyramid\u201d in Long Island, New York, in 2015; in Kassel, Germany, in 2017 for the international art show Documenta; and in Istanbul in 2022. Comprising rows of greenery that sloped upward into a vertiginous pyramid, the plants sprouted over the course of the exhibitions and were eventually given away to visitors. The artist has often returned to pyramids in her work as another vehicle for her ideas; a 17-foot model for her study of towering, luminescent \u201cCrystal Pyramid,\u201d meant to be a counterpart to Egypt\u2019s stone-made wonders of the world, was shown at her retrospective at The Shed in New York from 2019-2020. With \u201cWheatfield \u2013 An Inspiration,\u201d like with all her work, Denes strives for nuance and to engender change through visitors and participants who take something meaningful from the work. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of political art going on \u2014 useless, aggravating. I want to change people in the most subtle way possible,\u201d she explained. \u201cLet people sensitize themselves and believe in themselves \u2014 and that\u2019s political. But\u2026 it\u2019s not making people into enemies, or looking down on different people.\u201d Denes has left her mark in significant ways around the world, in messages buried deep in the earth and in the formations of forests architected as monuments to a more hopeful future. She is continuing the work even now, well into her nineties, looking for more of her projects to be approved\u00a0\u2014 including a 117-acre forest in a landfill in Queens, New York, that she hopes she can\u00a0bring to life,\u00a0rather than lose the site to building developers. All, she hopes, will outlive her in some way, through their physicality or ideology. \u201cI\u2019m planting ideas in the mind, as well as wheat,\u201d she said of \u201cWheatfield.\u201d \u201cMining into minds takes a long time,\u201d she added with a small laugh. \u201cI\u2019m a mind-miner.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/style/wheatfield-ny-montana-agnes-denes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_ethiopian-unique-calendar-year", "text": "On September 11, Ethiopians will celebrate the end of one year and the beginning of another. However, when the East African country rings in its New Year in a few months, it will technically be 2017, according to the Ethiopian calendar. So why is Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second most populous country, seven years and eight months \u201cbehind\u201d much of the rest of the world? And how does that work for Ethiopians living on an increasingly interconnected planet that mostly operates in an entirely different era? The answers lie in traditions that date back centuries \u2013 and a firm sense of national identity. Unique calendar In Ethiopia, the birth year of Jesus Christ is recognized as seven or eight years later than the Gregorian, or \u201cWestern\u201d calendar, which was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. According to experts, the Roman Church adjusted its calculation in 500 CE, while the Ethiopian Orthodox Church opted to stick to the ancient dates. Although much of the rest of the world went on to adopt the Gregorian calendar, Ethiopia has kept its own. \u201cWe are unique,\u201d says Eshetu Getachew, CEO of Rotate Ethiopia Tours And Travel. \u201cWe [were] never colonized. We have our own calendar. We have our own alphabet. We have our own cultural traditions.\u201d Thought to date back at least 1,500 years, the Ethiopian Calendar has many similarities to the Coptic calendar of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, an Oriental Orthodox Christian church based in Egypt. Following a solar-lunar system, it\u2019s 13 months long, with 12 of those months lasting for 30 days. The final month consists of just five days, or six days during a leap year. Travelers visiting Ethiopia are often stunned to learn that they\u2019ve gone \u201cback in time,\u201d with some taking to social media to express their bewilderment. As international businesses and schools based in the country tend to follow the Gregorian\u00a0calendar, many Ethiopians have little choice but to use both the traditional Ethiopian calendar and the Western calendar simultaneously. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult,\u201d Ethiopian archaeologist Goitom W. Tekle, currently based in Germany, tells CNN Travel. \u201cI still can\u2019t switch into one\u2026 It\u2019s quite a challenge. \u201cI need to think of the hours, the days. Sometimes the months, and sometimes even the year.\u201d Tekle explains that some institutions have to keep switching between the two calendars, incorporating the different dates and times, when corresponding with Ethiopians, especially those based in rural areas, and those outside the country. Even something as simple as applying for a birth certificate can pose problems when attempting to merge the Ethiopian system and the Western system. Date confusion \u201cLet\u2019s say, a baby is three years old, and you file for their birth certificate with the city or with the local government,\u201d says German historian Verena Krebs, who specializes in medieval European and African history. \u201cAnd then you state according to the Ethiopian system of time, and then you have to trust that the clerk does the conversion well. \u201cSo there are certain variables, which can then result in doubled or tripled birthdays.\u201d While she notes that this may seem unusual to those who aren\u2019t accustomed to it, it\u2019s not something that she gives much thought to anymore. \u201cYou just adapt to the system,\u201d she says. \u201cYou switch from one to the other. So you\u2019re not even actively aware anymore that this is a thing that people might find striking, because it\u2019s become so normal.\u201d Krebs also acknowledges that the traditional Ethiopian calendar isn\u2019t the only separate calendar, pointing to the ancient Egyptian calendar, where the year 2024 corresponds to the year 6266, as an example. \u201cThat is clearly a very, very different way of counting time,\u201d she says. Saudi Arabia has traditionally prioritized the Hijri calendar, made up of 12 months and 354 days, but recently approved the use of the Gregorian calendar for official dealings. Meanwhile, the Hebrew calendar is the official calendar of Israel. Krebs feels that interest in the Ethiopian calendar has increased in recent years, suggesting that this may be linked to the fact that it\u2019s \u201cvery close\u201d to the Gregorian calendar, and yet different. \u2018Logical\u2019 approach Photographer Abel Gashaw is among the many Ethiopians who have adapted to moving between both calendars relatively comfortably. However, he admits that he prefers the Ethiopian calendar, describing it as \u201cmore logical,\u201d particularly in reference to the start of the year. New Year, or Enkutatash, which translates to \u201cgift of jewels\u201d in the Ethiopian Semitic language Amharic, arrives towards the end of the rainy season. Adey Abeba, a flower indigenous to Ethiopia, blooms during this period and has become a symbol of the Ethiopian New Year. \u201cThat\u2019s like a fresh start,\u201d says Gashaw. \u201cIt\u2019s a new beginning for us\u2026 After that, the amount of rain becomes low, and everywhere you go, it\u2019s so green.\u201d He goes on to point out that having the New Year on January 1 wouldn\u2019t make any sense in Ethiopia, as the date falls during the dry season, whereas September 11 (or September 12 during a leap year,) which also marks the beginning of the Egyptian year, works well. \u201cI know it\u2019s a bad day for the world,\u201d says Gashaw, referencing the 9/11 attacks in 2001. \u201cBut the Ethiopian calendar happens annually on that day.\u201d Meanwhile, Krebs stresses that \u201cthere\u2019s no reason beyond basically the Christian appropriation of pagan holidays from the Roman Empire\u201d to suggest that the New Year should begin \u201cat the threshold between December and January.\u201d \u201cSo I think it makes much more sense, in that it often coincides with the tail end of the rainy season. It\u2019s not over yet, but it\u2019s going out,\u201d she adds. It\u2019s not just months, days and years that differ in Ethiopia. The country also runs on its own time system. 12-hour clock While most countries begin their day at midnight, Ethiopians use a 12-hour clock system that runs from dawn to dusk, beginning at 1 a.m. This means that what most people outside of the country would consider as 7 a.m., Ethiopians would class as 1 a.m. Gashaw explains that this is reflective of life in Ethiopia \u2013 the hours of daylight in the country are pretty consistent due to its proximity to the Equator \u2013 and feels like a more sensible approach. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know why the European time changes at midnight,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause everybody sleeps.\u201d Understandably, this can cause confusion, particularly for travelers visiting the country. When making appointments with international visitors, Gashaw always makes sure to clarify whether they\u2019re referring to Ethiopian timings or Western time. \u201cIf somebody says let\u2019s meet at 2 p.m. I will double-check [whether they mean morning or afternoon.]\u201d he says. \u201cAlso, when I buy a flight ticket, the airlines use the European calendar, so I double check three or four times, to understand in my time.\u201d However, even he\u2019s gotten it wrong on occasion. Gashaw once missed an exam because his university schedule was set to Western times, and he misunderstood. \u201cWhen they said 2 p.m., I thought it was in Ethiopian time, and that means in the morning,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo when I go there\u2019s nobody there. I think. \u2018Okay, the exam got canceled.\u2019\u201d Tekle suggests that there may be something of a disconnect between residents who live in more rural areas of the country and don\u2019t necessarily have to consider different timings and calendars, and those based in the cities who are regularly exposed to the Western system. Time of change? \u201cEthiopia is a very conservative Christian country where the majority of the people don\u2019t care about the rest of the world,\u201d he says, explaining that the way things are done in the Western world would be of little interest or concern to many Ethiopians, particularly those who live in the countryside. \u201cThey tell you a time\u2026 Sometimes they don\u2019t even know that there is another way of counting time.\u201d Of course, Ethiopia has made it all the way to 2024 \u2013 or 2016 depending on which system you\u2019re using \u2013 without shifting its approach to timing, changing its calendar or amending its method of counting the years. But is that likely to change in the future as more people based in rural areas of the country become connected to the rest of the world? \u201cI know that a lot of farmers nowadays already, of course, have smartphones,\u201d says Krebs, noting that this could potentially affect the way they view the Ethiopian approach to things. \u201cIt will be interesting [to see] how that plays out in the coming decades with even more connectivity and whether that will have an impact.\u201d Gashaw doesn\u2019t feel that this is a particularly pressing issue, or something that will make much of a difference to Ethiopians either way. \u201cIn my opinion, as long as there\u2019s complete months and days difference, the year coordination will not matter that much,\u201d he says. Tekle stresses that the traditional Ethiopian calendar, based on the teachings of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, isn\u2019t even the only functioning calendar in the country. It\u2019s also worth noting that Ethiopia has the third-largest Muslim population in sub-Saharan Africa. \u201cThere are at least two other calendars, to my knowledge, that work for people who use them in southern Ethiopia,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo you know, you can use a lot of other calendars.\u201d For Krebs, the notion that a country with a population of around 130 million should alter one of its long-standing traditions in the name of \u201cpracticality\u201d is difficult to champion. \u201cThere is no real reason, other than practicality, that anybody should adapt to it [the Western method of tracking time] in a globalized world,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom an outsider\u2019s perspective, I don\u2019t think that any other nation should lose their own local system, which has much more cultural significance and meaning [to them].\u201d Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified Ethiopia\u2019s location in Africa.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/ethiopian-unique-calendar-year/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

Gershkovich, 32, has been imprisoned since he was arrested while on a reporting trip in March last year by the FSB, Russia\u2019s federal security service, which accused him of trying to obtain state secrets. Gershkovich, the US government and his employer, the Wall Street Journal, have vehemently denied the charges against him. The Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s office said last Thursday it had approved the indictment and referred Gershkovich\u2019s case to a trial court. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. The case will be heard in the Sverdlovsk Regional Court, TASS reported Monday. A US State Department spokesperson said Monday the US was concerned about reports the trial would be held behind closed doors, but said members of the US Embassy in Russia would try to go to it anyway. \u201cWe will try to attend the trial, as we try to attend the trial of any American citizens who are detained in Russia, but ultimately I don\u2019t have an answer for you yet whether that\u2019s going to be possible,\u201d said the spokesperson Matthew Miller told a press briefing. Miller said the US would continue to try to free Gershkovich as well as fellow wrongfully detained US citizen and former Marine Paul Whelan. For more than a year since his arrest,\u00a0Gershkovich\u00a0has been imprisoned in Moscow\u2019s notorious Lefortovo Prison, and his pre-trial detention period had been extended numerous times. The trial venue of Yekaterinburg is more than 1,100 miles east of the capital. Miller said he did not know if Gershkovich had yet been moved from Lefortovo to Yekaterinburg. Last week, Russian prosecutors said the FSB had \u201cestablished and documented\u201d that Gershkovich was acting on CIA instructions in the month he was arrested, alleging he had \u201ccollected secret information\u201d about a Russian tank factory. \u201cGershkovich carried out the illegal actions using painstaking conspiratorial methods,\u201d it said in a statement. Gershkovich\u2019s detention has been a source of tension between Washington and Moscow, whose relations were already deeply strained due to Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The White House has previously alleged the Kremlin is using Gershkovich, the first American reporter detained in Russia on allegations of spying since the Cold War, as a geopolitical hostage. On Thursday, the State Department\u2019s Miller\u00a0said the allegations against Gershkovich have \u201cabsolutely zero credibility.\u201d \u201cWe have been clear from the start that Evan has done nothing wrong. He should never have been arrested in the first place. Journalism is not a crime. The charges against him are false, and the Russian government knows that they\u2019re false. He should be released immediately,\u201d Miller said at a State Department briefing.

{"id": "2024_06_16_travel_high-speed-sleeper-train-hong-kong-beijing-shanghai-intl-hnk", "text": "Interested in capping off your trip to Hong Kong with a long weekend in Beijing or Shanghai? A new high-speed sleeper train service is making that possibility easier than ever. Two new overnight routes connecting the city with Beijing and Shanghai entered into service on June 15. Both trains depart Hong Kong West Kowloon Station in the evening and arrive in Beijing at 6.53 a.m. and Shanghai at 6.45 a.m., making the journeys around 12.5 hours and 11 hours respectively. Return trips depart from Beijing and Shanghai at around 8 p.m. and arrive in Hong Kong at 8.47 a.m. and 7.29 a.m. These routes run four days a week, departing all three stations every evening from Friday to Monday. \u201cIt will be more comfortable and faster, reducing the travel time by about half, and will cover a wider range of destinations, including popular tourist attraction cities,\u201d John Lee, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, said in a press statement, referring to the previous overnight train routes that connected Hong Kong with China\u2019s two biggest cities. Those intercity railway services, Beijing-Kowloon and Shanghai-Kowloon, launched in 1997. The train ride to China\u2019s capital took around 24 hours while the journey to Shanghai was about 19 hours. The services were suspended during the pandemic in 2020 and have been replaced by the new high-speed options that launched on June 15. But while the new trips do indeed slash the overnight travel time by almost half, the high-speed sleeper services take slightly longer than the daytime bullet trains already in service connecting Hong Kong and the two cities in mainland China. Currently, the train company operates one daily high-speed connection to Beijing, which takes around 8.5 hours, and one to Shanghai, which is around 7.5 hours. Why bother with the longer journey then? The new sleeper trains might not be the fastest way to get between Hong Kong and Beijing or Shanghai, but they are a great option for business travelers who need to arrive well-rested before standard office hours, as well as leisure tourists who don\u2019t want to waste a full day on the train or wish to save money on accommodations. Inside the sleeper trains Each of the electric multiple unit (EMU) trains used to service the routes has 16 carriages, including 13 sleeper cars, two second-class seating cars and one dining car. There are three types of seats to choose from: Second class (without a bed), sleeper and deluxe sleeper. A standard sleeper class cabin consists of two bunk beds, sleeping four passengers, in a cabin. The deluxe version, only available on the Hong Kong-Shanghai route for now, features a bunk bed, wardrobe and sofa. Prices range from HKD937 to HKD1,506 ($120-$193) for the Hong Kong-Beijing route and HKD682 to HKD2,128 ($88-273) for the Hong Kong-Shanghai route. Passengers who want to book a seat can reserve their tickets on China Railway\u2019s official ticketing site 12306.cn. Note that for trains departing from Hong Kong, you have to search \u201chkwestkowloon.\u201d International travelers can also book through ticketing platforms such as Trip.com or buy their tickets at the West Kowloon Station directly. A joint immigration checkpoint inside West Kowloon Station allows passengers to avoid additional checks when crossing the border in and out of Hong Kong. However, travelers still need to have a valid China visa or travel document to ride the train. (Although part of China, Hong Kong is governed under a separate legal framework.) Hong Kong\u2019s controversial high-speed railway Opened in 2018, the 26-kilometer Hong Kong high-speed railway is a part of the larger Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link (XRL). Costing more than $10.7 billion to build, the Hong Kong section connects the city with China\u2019s 25,000-kilometer national high-speed rail network. But the project, which marked the first time mainland Chinese laws were given jurisdiction inside Hong Kong territory, stirred much controversy, even well before its opening. The massive price tag, the limited traveling speed (the Hong Kong section has a maximum speed of 200 kilometers/hour \u2013 much lower than the usual 300 kilometers/hour due to its short distance) and the political implications all cast a shadow over the new railway. Controversy aside, the introduction of the Express Rail Link provided an alternative way to travel to major Chinese cities through Hong Kong \u2013 and avoid China\u2019s notorious flight delays. The Hong Kong station now offers direct trips to 78 destinations around China and some 70,600 passengers use the network daily according to official figures.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/travel/high-speed-sleeper-train-hong-kong-beijing-shanghai-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_brazil-pantanal-wetland-fires-intl-latam", "text": "Brazil\u2019s Pantanal, the largest tropical wetland on earth, is ablaze, with fires in June breaking historical records for that month. While aerial views of the wetland show smoke rising and the bright orange of burning fires, a closer look at burnt vegetation found charred skeletons of wildlife, including an alligator, monkey and snake, photos from Reuters showed earlier this week. Brazil\u2019s National Institute of Space Research (INPE) has detected 733 fires in the Pantanal biome so far this month, with the previous record for fires in Pantanal for June being 435 registered in 2005. The state of Mato Grosso do Sul, which encompasses 60% of the Brazilian Pantanal, is under a \u201cdanger\u201d warning for a heat wave expected to hit with temperatures 5\u00baC higher than average for the next three to five days, according to Brazil\u2019s National Meteorological Institute (INMET). The World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) Brazil has warned that the entire year of 2024 could become the worst year on record for the Pantanal as the dry season is just beginning, and the number of fires this year already represents an increase of 898% compared to the same period in 2023, according to INPE\u2019s data. \u201cIt is necessary to act quickly reinforcing [fire] brigades and counting with the support of the local communities to avoid a catastrophe\u201d, said Cynthia Santos, conservation analyst for WWF Brazil, in a statement. What to know about the wetlands The Pantanal\u2019s distinctive habitats rely on what scientists call the \u201cflood pulse.\u201d During the wet season between November and March, three quarters of the plain gets flooded, only for much of the water to drain away during the dry months, from April to September. This seasonal flooding makes the Pantanal a unique biome where large swaths of land regularly turn from terrestrial into aquatic habitats and back again. Wetlands like the Pantanal are Earth\u2019s most effective carbon sinks \u2013 ecosystems that absorb and store more carbon than they release, keeping it away from the atmosphere. At roughly 200,000 square kilometers, the Pantanal comprises about 3% of the globe\u2019s wetlands and plays a key role in the carbon cycle. When these carbon-rich ecosystems burn, vast amounts of heat-trapping gases are released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (known as the World Wildlife Fund in the US and Canada), the Pantanal boasts the greatest concentration of wildlife in South America \u2013 higher than that of its more famous northern neighbor, the Amazon. \u201cThe Pantanal is very important for the planet, it has unique wild areas that are fundamental to life on Earth,\u201d said Andre Luiz Siqueira, the CEO of ECOA, an environmental NGO based in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, speaking to CNN in 2020. The area is home to thousands of endangered or unusual species, including jaguars, capybaras, black caimans, giant otters and hyacinth macaws. It\u2019s also an important stop on the routes of around 180 species of migratory birds. The wetland is facing a \u201chydrological crisis scenario\u201d due to an intense drought. The lack of rain began in 2023 and has been aggravated by the ongoing El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, according to ECOA. Occasional wildfires are normal in the Pantanal, so much so that some plants in the region developed resistance to fires \u2013 for example by growing thick bark or covering their seeds with hard shells. In 2020, the fires destroyed unique habitats and wrecked the livelihoods of many of the Pantanal\u2019s diverse indigenous communities.

{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_onboard-the-russian-warship-visiting-cuba", "text": "In twelve years of living in Cuba, I have waited in all kinds of lines. Lines to buy food, lines to pay bills, lines just because people were lining up for something maybe worth lining up for. But now I was in a line for something unexpected:\u00a0to\u00a0board\u00a0a Russian warship docked in Havana\u2019s harbor. When a Russian diplomat told me that starting on Thursday, the Admiral Gorshkov frigate would offer tours to the public for three days, I was somewhat skeptical. The Gorshkov is one of the most modern vessels in the Russian fleet, capable of firing hypersonic missiles that travel at more than 6,000 miles per hour. I had trouble imagining that\u00a0President Vladimir\u00a0Putin\u2019s prized\u00a0ship would be opened for anyone to see. When the Gorshkov arrived in Cuba\u00a0on Wednesday, it fired a deafening\u00a021-shot\u00a0salute.\u00a0The\u00a0Cubans answered with cannon fire from an 18th\u00a0century fortress overlooking the harbor that the Spanish had built to protect the city from pirates. With the frigate came a rescue tug, a fuel ship and the Kazan, an imposing nuclear-powered submarine. Cuba\u2019s Ministry of Defense said that none of the ships were carrying nuclear weapons and that they did not represent \u201ca threat to the region,\u201d clearly meaning the US, Cuba\u2019s neighbor 90 miles to the\u00a0north. But for many Cubans, the visit of the largest convoy of ships in years from their old Cold War ally seemed like a return to the past, particularly as Moscow and Washington increasingly spar over the war in Ukraine. \u201cI never thought I would see a Russian submarine so up close,\u201d said a Cuban man next to me as we waited in line in view of the four\u00a0vessels. We were standing outside the port terminal in Havana which,\u00a0just years earlier,\u00a0had been full\u00a0of\u00a0US cruise ships, until then-President Donald Trump banned their visits to the island\u00a0in 2019. Even though a line had formed, it was not clear if any of us waiting there were going to get aboard. An hour passed in the broiling Cuban sun. \u201cWe are roasting out here,\u201d a woman carrying a small baby next to me said. Cubans are champion line-waiters and I worried that I would have nothing to show for my interlude outside the port other than a worsening sunburn. Finally, a Cuban Navy official in a sparkling white uniform came out to speak to us, resting his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou can go aboard but need to leave any sharp objects like knives, scissors or hair clippers behind,\u201d he said. Two plainclothes\u00a0state\u00a0security officers began to run everyone\u2019s\u00a0identity card numbers through a database on their phones. I handed my\u00a0carn\u00e9,\u00a0or\u00a0ID card,\u00a0that lists my birthplace in the US to one of the officers who appeared too young to shave. He looked at my\u00a0carn\u00e9\u00a0and turned to his older colleague for advice. \u201cAre we letting foreign residents on board?\u201d\u00a0he asked. The older officer,\u00a0who was wearing a New York Yankee\u2019s baseball cap,\u00a0nodded and then ran my card information through the database. \u201cYou can go ahead,\u201d he said. Inside the port, past officials manning a metal detector, Russian sailors in dark blue unforms waited to take a group of about\u00a020\u00a0of us aboard the Gorshkov. In front of the ship, the sailors had posted a sign in English that declared the Gorshkov\u2019s \u201cmain purpose\u201d was \u201ccombat operations against enemy surface ships and submarines.\u201d The Russian sailors spoke more English than Spanish and I occasionally translated to help the other members of our group, who were\u00a0all\u00a0Cuban. We were told we could film and everyone immediately took out their smartphones to snap videos and selfies. We started out on the ship\u2019s massive helicopter pad and then walked through the ship to the bow. Every few feet a Russian sailor stood keeping watch. At the front of the ship, one of the sailors\u00a0showed me an anti-rocket system\u00a0to be used\u00a0in the unlikely event we came under attack. I asked about the massive cannon and the sailor replied that it could fire shells a distance of 23 kilometers,\u00a0or about 15 miles. A level up, where there appeared to be sensitive communications equipment, a Russian soldier in tactical gear with an assault rifle at his side looked down at us. Just off the bow we could see an unobstructed view of the Kazan, the 430-foot long submarine that stretched out into the harbor. I noticed one of the Russian sailors taking in the blue skies and calm waters around us. \u201cCuba good?\u201d I ask him. \u201cCuba good,\u201d he laughs in reply and gives me a thumbs up. The war in Ukraine has\u00a0severely\u00a0degraded the Russian fleet and once again pitted the US and Russia on opposite sides of a bloody conflict. For a Russian sailor, Cuba could be as good as it gets these days. I disembarked the Russian warship in Havana feeling that the Cold War did not seem like such a distant memory, when I saw an alert flash across my phone. It was an announcement that the Pentagon had just dispatched its own nuclear powered attack submarine\u00a0to the other side of the island:\u00a0the US Navy Base in Guantanamo\u00a0Bay,\u00a0Cuba, slightly more than 500 miles away from the where the Russian ships are docked.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/americas/onboard-the-russian-warship-visiting-cuba/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

I wanted images that you can look at, and imagine this very banal place as the last place someone has been.\u201d An internationally acclaimed photographer and distinguished artist at Columbia University\u2019s Barnard College in New York City, Matar\u2019s relationship with documenting landscapes and violence is rooted in her own personal experiences. In 1990, her father-in-law was forcibly disappeared by the Gadhafi regime in Libya, and was never seen by his family again. \u201cI was familiar with this idea of the legacy of state-sponsored violence and what it does intimately to a family\u2026 but also really looking at it through photography and what these landscapes hold,\u201d Matar said. Matar was born in California but has lived abroad for nearly two decades. Her photographic practice has taken her to locations across Libya, North Africa, Italy and Ukraine looking at the intersections of landscape and memory, in particular examining spaces where people had been killed or forcibly interned. But before beginning her work on \u201cMy America,\u201d she had never turned her lens on the US. In 2014 and 2015, the police killings of Black men and boys including Eric Garner in New York City, 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio and Walter Scott in Charleston, South Carolina, captured on camera and shared on social media, sparked national protests and a racial reckoning. Matar felt compelled to return to America. \u201cI had worked on issues around landscapes of violence and state violence for many years outside of my home country, and I wanted to start researching what was happening from that point of view (in the US).\u201d Using a range of sources \u2014 including victim databases, media coverage, district attorney documents and police reports \u2014 Matar made her work during six lengthy road trips. She would watch videos or local news coverage of what happened at the location right before photographing the site in question. \u201cThat really was very emotionally affecting,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time I got out of the car, I was very aware I was not just taking a photograph of a landscape or of a building. I was photographing something that held the last moments of someone\u2019s life \u2014 unless they had been taken to hospital, it was the place where these deaths happened. It made me think about my country, and made me question so many things. \u201d Of all the sites Matar visited, she said only seven had a memorial of some kind, whether that was a mural, flowers, memorabilia or photos. In a way, though, the photographs and the information placed alongside them in \u201cMy America\u201d have a memorial-like quality of their own; Matar emphasizes this was a conscious decision in the book\u2019s design. \u201cI wanted a lot of white space in there, because I wanted the viewer to sit and think, and not just move on quickly,\u201d she said. While the biographical information next to each photograph is sparse, Matar researched and wrote a longer passage of text dedicated to each person\u2019s life, and death, which is included in the book\u2019s final pages. She describes her research of the wider issues relating to law-enforcement related deaths as \u201ceven more affecting\u201d than the process of making the photographs. This is exemplified in a series of pages in the middle of the book which outline key statistics related to such deaths, those impacted and factors involved \u2014 like that the number of people who die in encounters with police each year (around 1,000) has not changed in the nine years since Matar started researching the project in 2015. \u201cWhen you see all the things that go into why this is occurring \u2014 the lack of mental health beds, the lack of arms training, the racial injustice \u2014 there\u2019s so many things that come together in this particular challenge,\u201d Matar reflected. \u201cThis book is placing this type of violence in a continuum of a lot of violence in the history of the country.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have an illusion that this work is going to change anything, she continued. \u201cWhat I do think, though, is that point a camera at something, researching something, writing about something \u2014 all these things require great attention. And that attention is saying that this matters, this really matters.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/style/my-america-diana-matar-police-shootings/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_13_tech_apple-ai-data-openai-artificial-intelligence", "text": "Apple\u2019s splashy announcement at its Worldwide Developers Conference this week that it\u2019s adding artificial intelligence to its products, and partnering with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has raised many questions about how Apple\u2019s AI offerings will work. The confusion is understandable. Apple is simultaneously launching a proprietary suite of AI models while also integrating ChatGPT into its devices and software. So it\u2019s natural to wonder where one ends and the other begins and \u2014 perhaps more pressingly \u2014 what both companies will do with the personal information they receive from users. The stakes are particularly high for Apple, a company that has made security and privacy a hallmark of its brand. Here\u2019s what we know. The difference between Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT If Apple has its own AI, why does it need ChatGPT? The answer is that each is meant to do different things. Apple Intelligence \u2014 the collective brand name for all of Apple\u2019s own AI tools \u2014 is intended to be more of a personal assistant than anything else, with an emphasis on \u201cpersonal.\u201d It takes in specific information about your relationships and contacts, messages and emails you\u2019ve sent, events you\u2019ve been to, meetings on your calendar and other highly individualized bits of data about your life. And then it uses that data to, Apple hopes, make your life a little easier \u2014 helping you dig up a photo you took from that concert years ago, finding the right attachment to put on an email, or ranking your mobile notifications by priority and urgency. But while Apple Intelligence might know that you went on a hiking trip last year, it will lack what company executives called \u201cworld knowledge\u201d \u2014 more general information about history, current events and other things that are less directly linked to you. That\u2019s where ChatGPT comes in. Users will be able to have Siri forward questions and prompts to ChatGPT \u2014\u00a0on an opt-in basis \u2014 or have ChatGPT help you write documents within Apple apps. Apple said it plans to integrate with other third-party AI models eventually, too. The integration essentially removes a step to accessing ChatGPT and gives Apple users a more seamless onramp to that platform. What does this mean for my data? Since Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT will be used for largely different purposes, the amount and type of information users send to each AI may be different, too. Apple Intelligence will have access to a wide range of your personal data, from your written communications to photos and videos you\u2019ve taken to a record of your calendar events. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a way to prevent Apple Intelligence from accessing this information, short of not using its features; an Apple spokesperson didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions on that topic. ChatGPT won\u2019t necessarily or automatically have access to your highly personal details, although you might choose to share some of this data and more with OpenAI if you decide to use ChatGPT through Apple. In Monday\u2019s demo, Apple showed Siri asking the user for permission to send a prompt to ChatGPT before doing so. As part of its agreement with Apple, OpenAI made an important concession: OpenAI agreed not to store any prompts from Apple users or to collect their IP addresses \u2014 though all bets are off if you consciously decide to log in and connect an existing ChatGPT account. Some users might\u00a0choose to do\u00a0that\u00a0to take advantage of their ChatGPT history or the benefits associated with ChatGPT\u2019s paid account plans. Should you trust Apple with your data? Now that we\u2019ve established what OpenAI will and won\u2019t do with your data, what about Apple? While Apple users will have to send their personal information and AI queries to OpenAI if they want to use ChatGPT, Apple has said that most of the time Apple Intelligence won\u2019t be sending user data anywhere. As much as possible, Apple will try to process AI prompts directly on your device using smaller AI models. This is similar to how Apple already processes FaceID and other sensitive data \u2014 the idea being that processing data right on the device limits risky exposure. Your data can\u2019t be intercepted or hacked from a central server if it never actually goes anywhere. In the event your AI task needs more processing power, Apple Intelligence will send your query and data to a cloud computing platform controlled by Apple, where a more capable AI model will fulfill the request. This is where Apple claims it has achieved a major privacy breakthrough. The company\u2019s announcement received relatively little airtime during its jam-packed Monday keynote but the company is plainly proud of the advancement it\u2019s clearly been extensively planning. Apple said Monday it has developed a new way to do cloud computing that means Apple can run computations on sensitive data while ensuring that nobody, not even the company itself, can tell what data is being processed or what computation is being done. Known as Private Cloud Compute, Apple\u2019s new architecture borrows certain hardware and security concepts from the iPhone, including the secure enclave that already protects sensitive user data on Apple mobile devices. With Private Cloud Compute, \u201cyour data is never stored or made accessible to Apple,\u201d said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s SVP of software engineering, during Monday\u2019s keynote. After fulfilling a user\u2019s AI request, Private Cloud Compute scrubs itself of any user data involved in the process, Apple said. Apple claims Private Cloud Compute\u00a0is \u201conly possible\u201d because of the tight control it has over its entire technology ecosystem \u2014 from the specialized, proprietary computer chips to the software tying everything together. If it\u2019s true that Apple can\u2019t see the personal data that its large AI models are crunching \u2014 a claim Apple invited researchers to test for themselves because the system\u2019s design is meant to be scrutinized \u2014 then that sets Apple\u2019s implementation apart from that of other companies. For example, when you use ChatGPT, OpenAI discloses that it uses your data to further train its AI models. With Private Cloud Compute, you theoretically won\u2019t have to take Apple\u2019s word that it doesn\u2019t use your data for AI training. What about Apple\u2019s training data? Apple\u2019s AI models didn\u2019t spring up out of nowhere. They had to be trained, too, just like models offered by other companies. And that raises questions about whose data Apple used, and how. In a technical document released this week, Apple said its models are trained \u201con licensed data, including data selected to enhance specific features.\u201d \u201cWe never use our users\u2019 private personal data or user interactions when training our foundation models,\u201d the company added, \u201cand we apply filters to remove personally identifiable information like social security and credit card numbers that are publicly available on the Internet.\u201d Apple did, however, admit to scraping the public internet for data that then went into training its proprietary models, making it somewhat similar to other AI companies, some of whom have faced copyright lawsuits and sparked a debate over whether AI startups have unfairly profited off the work of humans. Apple hasn\u2019t said what web-based information it has ingested. It did say that publishers can add code to their sites to prevent Apple\u2019s web crawler from collecting their data. But that places the burden squarely on publishers to safeguard their own intellectual property, not the company.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/tech/apple-ai-data-openai-artificial-intelligence/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_uk_trooping-the-colour-princess-kate-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "Catherine, Princess of Wales joined other British royals on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for the King\u2019s official birthday, capping her first public appearance since being diagnosed with cancer. The Princess of Wales, her husband William, their children George, Charlotte and Louis gathered together with King Charles and Queen Camilla to watch a Royal Air Force flypast. They waved and smiled at the crowd, who responded with cheers. The Princess, also known as Kate, was earlier driven in a state carriage with her children from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade to watch the celebration, known as Trooping the Colour. She could be seen wearing an Irish Guards regimental broach, a nod towards her role as their honorary colonel. The family were later seen watching events from a viewing point, while Kate\u2019s husband William, the Prince of Wales, rode on horseback. For Kate, it was her first public appearance since Christmas Day \u2013 weeks before her cancer diagnosis. Kate stepped away from public duties in January, following what Kensington Palace said at the time was surgery for a non-cancerous abdominal condition. In March, amid speculation about her wellbeing, she revealed she had been diagnosed with cancer after the operation, and was undergoing treatment. King Charles III and Queen Camilla were also taken in a carriage from Buckingham Palace, bringing cheers from the packed crowds as they made their way slowly up The Mall. The King took part riding a carriage rather than on horseback this year due to his own cancer diagnosis. People of all ages gathered along the length of the Mall for the event. Some onlookers are wearing Union Jack bucket hats and fascinators, while others are waving flags. Some sang the national anthem. Kate gave an update on her health on Friday, saying she had made \u201cgood progress\u201d in her recovery. But she said she expected her treatment to last for a few more months and was \u201cnot out of the woods yet.\u201d Trooping the Colour is the magnificent military spectacle which sees 1,400 officers and soldiers, together with 400 musicians and 200 horses, process through the streets of London from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guard\u2019s Parade, while crowds line the route. The event - one of the highlights of the royal calendar - is a tradition marking the official birthday of the British sovereign for more than 260 years. However, Charles\u2019s actual birthday is in November. Britain\u2019s Kings and Queens have doubled up on their festivities since the 18th century, holding both a public celebration \u2013 the official birthday \u2013 and a more private event on the real date. The tradition is believed to have started with the party-mad King George II in 1748. Like Charles III, George was born in November, when British weather is often far from ideal. Proving that point, the weather took a downward turn as events neared their end. Crowds waiting for the King to arrive back at the palace were lashed with heavy rain and gusts of wind. Some onlookers struggled to hold their umbrellas in place. Speaking about Kate\u2019s appearance on the balcony, David Betteridge, 66, told CNN that \u201cshe looked well so hopefully that is a good sign.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see her back actually,\u201d he added. \u201cFor the most part we stayed dry. But we got pretty wet just after the ceremony when the parade had finished. It rained very hard.\u201d Anna Yang, 30, who was visiting the UK from China on holiday, said she saw the flypast from her hotel nearby. \u201cIt was great. It\u2019s our first time, even in our own country, seeing all the national aircraft going through the sky,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIt was incredible.\u201d But anti-royalists turned out too, some of whom chanted \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cnot my king!\u201d This year\u2019s proceedings were adapted as the 75-year-old Charles continues his treatment for an unspecified form of cancer. Doctors have been encouraged by his progress, allowing him to resume public-facing duties in April, but each engagement he carries out is reviewed and adapted where appropriate. For the events on Saturday, he carried out his review of troops seated in an Ascot landau carriage alongside Queen Camilla. Three of the British Army\u2019s horses which bolted across in London in April returned to duty and took part in this weekend\u2019s birthday parade. The two remaining horses \u201care enjoying a summer holiday in the Chilterns\u201d and will return to service in due course, according to the army.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/uk/trooping-the-colour-princess-kate-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_europe_ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-intl", "text": "More than 100 countries and organizations have gathered for a major conference in Switzerland dedicated to setting out a path toward peace between Ukraine and Russia, but there will be no delegation from Moscow. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is aiming to use the meeting, which is being held at a resort near Lucerne, to drum up support for the 10-point peace plan he first outlined late in 2022. Addressing the conference on Saturday, Zelensky said the proposal for ending the war would be submitted to Russia once it had been agreed by the other nations in attendance and there would then be a second peace summit, where \u201cwe can fix the real end of the war.\u201d \u201cThe peace formula is inclusive, and we are happy to hear and work on all proposals, all ideas of what is really needed for peace and what is important to you dear friends,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cI urge you to be as active as possible and I am proud all parts of the world, all continents are now represented at the peace summit,\u201d he added. Most Western governments have sent representatives at a senior level. US Vice President Kamala Harris is attending and announced that Washington will supply Kyiv with an aid package of more than $1.5 billion to help the country rebuild its battered infrastructure and address humanitarian needs stemming from the conflict,\u00a0according to a statement from the White House on Saturday. \u201cThis war remains an utter failure for Putin. I am here in Switzerland to stand with Ukraine and the leaders from around the world in support of a just and lasting peace,\u201d Harris said. Heads of state and government from several European states, including France, Germany and the UK are also joining, as is Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. However, China will not attend. It has said that any such meeting needs to be attended by both Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky\u2019s plan includes demands for a cessation of hostilites, the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian soil and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s \ufeffpre-war borders with Russia. It also calls for the establishment of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian war crimes. \u201cUkraine never wanted this war, it\u2019s a criminal and absolutely unprovoked aggression of Russia. And the only one who wanted it was Putin,\u201d Zelensky said. Russia has expressed little interest in agreeing to those terms and has shown no sign of compromise when it comes to the territorial issues. On Friday, the day before the summit was set to kick off, Russian President Vladimir Putin restated the Kremlin\u2019s own peace plan, which Ukraine is unlikely to ever agree to. The proposal calls for Ukrainian troops withdraw from four southern and eastern regions of Ukrainian territory that Moscow said it would annex in violation of international law and demands Kyiv abandon its bid to join\u00a0NATO. While Russian forces have made modest gains in two of the regions \u2013 Donetsk and Luhansk \u2013 in recent months, they are far from occupying all four, which include Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Putin said later in the day that nearly 700,000 Russian soldiers are fighting in Ukraine, a hike from the 617,000 he reported during a end-of-year press conference in 2023. Zelensky responded in an interview with Italian television that \u201cthe fact that Putin says to give them part of our territories, occupied and unoccupied, speaks about several regions of our country, and he will stop (there), and there will be no frozen conflict.\u201d \u201cThe messages are the same as Hitler\u2019s,\u201d said Zelensky \u201cPutin understands that there will be a peace summit. That most of the world is on the side of Ukraine, on the side of life. And on the eve of the summit, amid air raid sirens, people being killed and missile attacks, he seems to be talking about some kind of ultimatum,\u201d Zelensky added.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/europe/ukraine-peace-summit-switzerland-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

As well as withdrawing from the four occupied regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, Putin said Ukraine must demilitarize and that Western countries must lift their sanctions on Russia, which have damaged but not crippled its economy. While these conditions are more maximalist than those Putin has hinted at before, they represent Russia\u2019s failure to achieve its original war aims, when Moscow believed it could capture Kyiv in days and the rest of Ukraine in weeks. Nearly 28 months later, Russia occupies around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula it annexed a decade ago. Ukrainian and certain Western officials have repeatedly warned that Putin intends to settle for nothing less than Kyiv\u2019s total defeat, and that any truce or peace talks are merely a guise to allow Russia\u2019s troops to regroup and launch a fresh and fiercer offensive in the future. But, in comments to the foreign ministry, Putin said Russia\u2019s conditions for peace talks are \u201csimple,\u201d beginning with the total withdrawal of Ukraine\u2019s troops from the entire territory of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Moscow only controls these regions partially, but claimed the whole of each region was part of Russia\u2019s territory in 2022. Putin stressed that Ukraine should surrender not just the territory on the Russian side of the frontline, which splices through each of these regions, but \u201cthe entire territory of these regions.\u201d \u201cAs soon as they declare in Kyiv that they are ready for such a decision and begin the real withdrawal of troops from these regions \u2013 and also officially notify about the abandonment of plans to join NATO \u2013 our side will immediately, at the same minute, make the order to cease fire and begin negotiations,\u201d he said. Putin promised to \u201cguarantee the unhindered and safe withdrawal of Ukrainian units and formations,\u201d and said Moscow acknowledges its role in global stability. He asked that his terms for ending the war would need to be cemented in international agreements. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country \u201cdoes not trust\u201d Putin\u2019s \u201cultimatum,\u201d which he said did not significantly differ from previous offers he has made before. Speaking Friday from the Group of Seven summit in Italy, Zelensky drew parallels between Putin\u2019s tactics and those used by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler to conquer swaths of Europe in the 1930s and 40s. \u201cHe talks about regions of our country, and he says he will not stop,\u201d Zelensky told CNN affiliate Sky Tg24. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing Hitler did, when he said \u2018give me a part of Czechoslovakia and that\u2019s the end of it.\u2019 You can\u2019t trust it,\u201d Zelensky said, referring to Hitler\u2019s annexation of the Sudetenland and Western countries\u2019 failed policy of appeasement. \u201cThat is why we must not trust these messages, because Putin follows the same course,\u201d Zelensky warned. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called on Kyiv\u2019s allies to \u201cget rid of illusions\u201d and to stop taking Russia\u2019s proposals seriously, describing Putin\u2019s terms as \u201coffensive to common sense.\u201d \u201cThere is no novelty in this, no real peace proposals and no desire to end the war. But there is a desire not to pay for this war and to continue it in new formats. It\u2019s all a complete sham,\u201d Podolyak said. Putin\u2019s speech comes on the eve of the Swiss peace conference, in which nearly 100 countries and organizations will take part. He dismissed the conference as \u201canother ploy to divert everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/europe/putin-conditions-peace-talks-ukraine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_europe_uk-mi5-spy-agency-chinese-alert-partygate-intl-latam", "text": "A former opposition lawmaker in Britain\u2019s House of Commons has alleged that the UK\u2019s domestic spy agency MI5 may have issued a rare alert notice in 2022 about an alleged Chinese agent as a distraction from the so-called Partygate scandal, according to testimony before a tribunal looking into the alert. In the alert issued back in January 2022, MI5\u00a0alleged\u00a0Christine Ching Kui Lee had \u201cacted covertly in coordination\u201d on behalf of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party and was \u201cjudged to be involved in political interference activities in the UK.\u201d The alert was issued a day after former Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologized to the House of Commons for the Partygate scandal. Johnson\u2019s premiership came crashing down in 2022 after it emerged that numerous social gatherings took place on his watch \u2013 some of which he personally attended \u2013 at a time when Britons were living under strict rules due to Covid-19. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal in London heard on Monday that Barry Gardiner, former lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party to whom Lee donated over \u00a3500,000 (more than $600,000) between 2014 and 2020, said in a text that he had heard that the MI5 alert had been issued to \u201cdetract attention\u201d from Johnson\u2019s Partygate scandal, PA news agency reported. In a text forwarded to Lee by a friend, Gardiner said that \u201cmany people\u201d had told him \u201cthey believe the reason for putting out the story when they did was to detract attention from Boris\u2019 Partygate apology,\u201d according to PA\u2019s report. Gardiner did not specify exactly who these people making the suggestion were. Nor was any evidence provided to the tribunal Monday to back the allegations. The hearing will continue on Tuesday. CNN reached out to Gardiner\u2019s office but did not receive an immediate response. \u201cI had never believed that the Security Services would be overtly party political in that way [\u2026] What has also been suggested to me is that the Security Services may have wished to \u2018pick a fight\u2019 or to \u2018detract attention\u2019 from something else and that we were simply collateral damage,\u201d read a portion of a text from Gardiner that Lee\u2019s lawyer read out to the hearing, according to PA. CNN has also reached out to the UK\u2019s Home Office and Boris Johnson\u2019s office for comment. The MI5 alert in question\u00a0also alleged that Lee had been facilitating \u201cfinancial donations to political parties, Parliamentarians, aspiring Parliamentarians and individuals seeking political office in the UK, including facilitating donations to political entities on behalf of foreign nationals.\u201d \u201cMs Lee denies the allegations and is taking legal action against the Security Service with her son, Daniel Wilkes, who lost his job with Mr Gardiner following the alert, arguing that issuing the alert was unlawful and interfered with their human rights,\u201d PA reported. Gardiner served as a Labour MP between 1997 and 2024. He was the chairman of the now-disbanded Chinese in Britain All-Party Parliamentary Group, on which Lee sat. It was not illegal for Lee to make the donations as the UK did not have a foreign agents registration act at the time, nor was it illegal for a British citizen or foreign national working in the UK to be affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Lee is listed as a British national in the UK\u2019s corporate registry. The UK has since introduced a foreign agents registration act, which is expected to come into force later this year.

{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_sport_ukraine-romania-france-austria-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Soccer superstar Kylian\u00a0Mbapp\u00e9 played a vital role in France\u2019s narrow 1-0 win against Austria in its opening Group D match at Euro 2024 on Monday. The new Real Madrid forward showed his trademark speed and lightning quick footwork to create the game\u2019s only goal in the 38th minute. After skipping past a defender, France\u2019s captain flashed a pass across the goal which was inadvertently headed by Austria\u2019s Maximilian W\u00f6ber into his own net. France continued to create chances throughout the tie but failed to add to its lead \u2013 the best chance falling to Mbapp\u00e9 who could only steer his shot wide when faced with just the goalkeeper to beat. Despite dominating for large periods of the match, Les Bleus didn\u2019t have it all their own way, with former Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick\u2019s Austria standing up to the No. 2 team in the world. But the Burschen couldn\u2019t produce that moment of quality in front of goal and eventually ran out of ideas. Mbapp\u00e9 finished the game on France\u2019s bench, though, after the forward bloodied his nose during a collision with Austria\u2019s Kevin Danso. In an attempt to head the ball, the 25-year-old\u2019s face collided with the defender\u2019s shoulder. The Frenchman could be seen heading down the tunnel in the 90th minute with blood staining his shirt. It was far from a vintage performance from France, with Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s moment of brilliance enough to secure a win against a resilient Austrian outfit. The game continued a trend at this year\u2019s tournament, which has seen multiple underdogs provide real challenges against Europe\u2019s supposed powerhouses. Once again, though, the team boasting the higher quality talent eventually got over the line. Les Bleus will face a tough test against the Netherlands in their next group match on Friday, while Austria bids to kickstart its campaign against Poland. Group E: Belgium vs Slovakia Twice, Romelu Lukaku thought he had scored for Belgium, but twice, the striker saw his goal disallowed as Slovakia staged an upset by winning 1-0 in its opening Group E match of Euro 2024. The Sokoli had taken a surprise lead in the seventh minute through Ivan Schranz after Belgian winger J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku gave the ball away in a dangerous position. Despite the array of attacking talent on the pitch for Belgium, including the likes of Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne, the Red Devils continued to be wasteful in front of goal and were unable to find an equalizer. Twice, though, striker Lukaku had the ball in the back of the net for Belgium, but the video assistant referee (VAR) saved Slovakia on both occasions. The first attempt was ruled out in the 56th minute for a narrow offside, before a second effort in the 86th minute was disallowed due to a handball by Belgium\u2019s Lo\u00efs Openda in the buildup. In truth, though, Lukaku and his Belgium teammate Leandro Trossard had enough chances between them to get at least a point from the game. Despite riding its luck at times, Slovakia still produced a brilliant performance which was well-deserving of the win. According to TNT Sports, it was the biggest upset in European Championship history by FIFA rankings: world No. 3 Belgium is 45 places ahead of Slovakia. Group E: Ukraine vs. Romania Earlier on Monday, Ukraine suffered a disastrous start to its Euro 2024 campaign, losing 3-0 to Romania in its opening match in Group E. Captain Nicolae Stanciu gave Romania the lead with a superb strike in the 29th minute, before second-half goals from R\u0103zvan Marin and Denis Dr\u0103gu\u0219 settled the exhilarating tie. It was all going to plan for Ukraine in the early stages of the match. The team ranked 24 places higher in the world rankings than Romania was dominating the ball, but things soon started to go wrong. Stanciu\u2019s brilliant long-range effort seemed to throw the Blue and Yellow off their game and the team never fully recovered. Romania, suddenly boasting a formidable sense of hope, doubled its lead shortly into the second half when Marin watched his 53rd minute shot hit the back of the net. In truth, Ukraine goalkeeper Andriy Lunin could have done better with his save, but he let the powerful shot creep under his outstretched hand. The Tricolorii continued to frustrate Ukraine\u2019s attacking frontline and soon scored its third. This time, there was little Lunin could have done as the brilliant Dr\u0103gu\u0219 was left free in the penalty area to tap home from close range. There was a flood of yellow at the full-time whistle, as Romania\u2019s bench rushed onto the pitch to celebrate in front of the team\u2019s traveling fans. Ukraine struggles Ukraine is playing in a major tournament for the first time since Russia launched its full scale invasion of the country in February 2022. Before the game, the Ukrainian Football Association (UAF) displayed a piece of the destroyed stand from Kharkiv\u2019s Sonyachny stadium in the streets of Munich, Germany. The UAF said the stadium, used to co-host Euro 2012, had been destroyed by Russian troops in May 2022. The stand will go on a tour of Germany, following the Ukrainian team throughout its group stage matches. Ukraine\u2019s players looked sheepish as they trudged of the pitch at full-time, but will have the chance to kick-start their Euro 2024 campaign against Slovakia on Friday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/sport/ukraine-romania-france-austria-euro-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_uk_king-charles-foundation-awards-intl-scli-gbr", "text": "King Charles III was in his element this week as he celebrated a very special moment for his foundation at St. James\u2019s Palace in London. On Tuesday, the 75-year-old monarch attended the inaugural awards of his King\u2019s Foundation, so we thought, why not take our Royal News readers along with us? Now, to rewind for just a moment \u2013 King Charles set up the charity back in 1990 when he was still the Prince of Wales. His vision was to help revitalize communities while creating a balance between people and the planet. More than 30 years on, the King\u2019s ethos continues to drive the organization\u2019s projects, whether it\u2019s through its education courses focusing on arts, architecture, traditional crafts or rural skills, its health and wellbeing programs, or its regeneration work. King\u2019s Foundation chief executive Kristina Murrin told CNN that the charity is underpinned by the monarch\u2019s philosophy of working in concert with nature to \u201cbuild sustainable thriving communities.\u201d \u201cThe way we do that is we take our inspiration from nature and from tradition to try and work out what are the best ways we can work with nature, not against her.\u201d Murrin said the foundation has six historic sites in the United Kingdom \u2013 including Dumfries House and Highgrove Gardens \u2013 which together attracted nearly 300,000 visitors in the past 12 months, as well as more than a dozen sites internationally. Meanwhile, its education, skills and training programs benefited more than 15,000 students last year. This week\u2019s glittering event \u2013 set to become an annual fixture in the charity\u2019s calendar \u2013 saw rock royalty Rod Stewart and his wife, Penny Lancaster, footballing legend David Beckham, actress Sienna Miller, fashion editor Edward Enninful, supermodel Naomi Campbell and chef Raymond Blanc hand out awards. Organizers are eager to offer a platform to recognize students, teachers, alumni and partners for their contributions to the organization\u2019s efforts across a range of sectors. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited about the awards. The charity has been going (for) nearly 35 years and it just felt the right moment to finally celebrate the work we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Murrin said. \u201cWe have amazing students and teachers \u2013 many of whom have gone (on) to start incredible businesses \u2013 and so it just felt it was about time we got around to celebrating some of those people.\u201d Nine awards were given out, with Charles presenting the final accolade, the King Charles III Harmony Award, to South Korean diplomat and former secretary-general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon. In a short speech, the King said the award was \u201ccreated to recognize the individuals who champion the values which underpin the King\u2019s Foundation\u2019s mission, and my own hope, for a world in which we live in harmony with nature.\u201d He then paid tribute to the former UN chief for his \u201ctireless dedication to promoting these ideals on the global stage.\u201d Some 250 guests attended the event at St. James\u2019s Palace. Pipers from the National Piping Centre and the Rock Choir played as nominees and their families made their way up the Grand Staircase to the lavish State Apartment for the reception. The awards also featured live demonstrations of some of the foundation\u2019s educational programs, including furniture-making, woodworking and embroidery. Charles was beaming as he made his way around the reception, keen to hear about how students have been supported in learning and entrepreneurship across traditional arts, textiles, rural skills, and health and wellbeing. British gardener and broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh spoke of his joy at being involved in the foundation for several decades, saying \u201cthe fact that it works\u201d continues to draw him in. He said he wants to be involved in the King\u2019s Foundation because of \u201cthe fact that it encourages practical skills \u2013 crafts, arts \u2013 that it catches people that might otherwise fall through the net and that it really makes a difference.\u201d \u201cIt makes a difference to our landscape, to the crafts and skills that are available, making sure they don\u2019t disappear, but also to individuals. It turns people around, people who are not necessarily academic but people who have really valuable skills,\u201d he added. Among the winners was Isabelle Pennington-Edmead, 27, who received the Young Entrepreneur Award from actress Sienna Miller. After graduating from the King\u2019s Foundation\u2019s The Modern Artisan program, she has gone on to set up her own eponymous label centered on a sustainable and ethical approach. Her collection \u2013 which is inspired by her mixed Caribbean Kittitian and English heritage \u2013 is made to order, cutting out unwanted stock. She will be expanding onto an online retailer this summer while scaling up her business sustainably. She told CNN that setting up her business \u201cwas something I\u2019d always wanted to do and when I left the King\u2019s Foundation, I felt that I had the tools to be able to do it.\u201d In the Throne Room, Charles had the chance to catch up with Beckham, who was recently announced as a new ambassador for the foundation and who mentioned at the event that he had cuts on his hands from planting roses over the weekend. The pair appeared delighted to see each other again, discussing the England men\u2019s soccer team\u2019s prospects ahead of the Euro 2024 tournament, which kicks off today in Germany. Beckham assured the King \u201cwe\u2019ll be ready\u201d after a recent loss to Iceland in a friendly. Charles may have only recently returned to public duties and is continuing his cancer treatment, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s slowed down. Murrin told CNN that King\u2019s Foundation staff had wondered how much time Charles would have to devote himself to the charity after his accession to the throne \u201cbut he stays very involved, very committed.\u201d \u201cHis Majesty is very involved and we\u2019re incredibly lucky to have him as our Royal Founding President. He was bringing attention to some of these themes around the climate, the planet, and our sustainability decades ago. It\u2019s a real honor to do his work.\u201d She added: \u201cHe loves seeing the projects that we\u2019re making out in the world \u2013 both here and across the globe.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/uk/king-charles-foundation-awards-intl-scli-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_asia_pig-butchering-scam-southeast-asia-dst-intl-hnk", "text": "Sitting at the kitchen table, Matt struggles to recount the events of the past few months. \u201cAs soon as I found out that it was a suicide, I was 100% sure that it was the scam,\u201d he says. \u201cOur father was, from the day I was born until six months ago, always a positive, happy person. This was literally the only thing in his life that had happened, to where it changed him, and it just crushed him.\u201d On a horse farm in northern Virginia, surrounded by sprawling fields and stables, the family gathers at their younger sister Adrianne\u2019s house - something they\u2019ve done a lot in the three months since their father took his own life after falling victim to a so-called \u201cpig butchering\u201d scam. The scams \u2013 mostly run out of Southeast Asia - are given that name because they involve \u201cfattening up\u201d victims before taking everything they have. The con artists behind them take on false online identities and spend months financially grooming their victims to get them to invest on fraudulent cryptocurrency websites. Dennis Jones, an avid runner and photographer, was adored by his children and grandchildren. Described as \u201ca bit of an activist\u201d by his family, the 82-year-old spent much of his retirement working with refugees and debating politics online. But in the last few months of his life he withdrew from his family and, having been divorced for years, befriended a woman going by the name Jessie on Facebook. The two had been talking online for months and built a close relationship. Eventually, Jessie convinced Dennis to invest in crypto. Dennis complied. Without ever meeting Jessie in person, he spent everything he had, and when he had nothing left, she demanded more. Until one day the money disappeared, leaving him in ruin. In early March, Dennis\u2019 children scheduled a meeting to help their father get back on his feet after the scam. The plan was for him to move in with Adrianne and her family. \u201cWe wanted him to know that he was going to be taken care of,\u201d Matt said. But the morning of the meeting none of them could reach Dennis. Matt drove to Dennis\u2019s apartment but he wasn\u2019t home, and all calls went straight to voicemail. They figured he must be out on one of his long runs. An hour later, police knocked on Matt\u2019s door to inform him that Dennis had taken his own life. Dennis was one of countless victims of a massive global criminal operation predominantly run by Chinese gangs who have built a multibillion-dollar scam industry in Southeast Asia. There, they\u2019ve assembled an army of scammers, many held against their will in guarded compounds and forced to con people all around the world out of their life savings. It\u2019s theft at a scale so large that investigators are now calling it a mass transfer of wealth from middle-class Americans to criminal gangs. Last year, the FBI estimates, pig butchering scams stole nearly $4 billion from tens of thousands of American victims, a 53% increase from the year before. While the crime takes place online, its real-world consequences are devastating. Law enforcement sources predict that losses will continue to grow in the next year, and as the criminals remain out of reach, money and lives will continue to be lost. \u2018Victims victimizing victims\u2019 Santa Clara county prosecutor Erin West has dedicated the last few years to fighting pig butchering scams. \u201cI\u2019ve been a prosecutor for over 25 years, I\u2019ve done all kinds of different types of crime. I spent nine years in sexual assault. And I\u2019ve never seen the absolute decimation of people that I\u2019ve seen as a result of pig butchering,\u201d she says. Being in the heart of the tech industry in California\u2019s Bay Area, Erin and her team were some of the first to begin investigating pig butchering scams. \u201cWe\u2019ve got victims victimizing victims and the only winners are Chinese gangsters,\u201d she says. Shawn Bradstreet, US special agent in charge of the San Francisco field office, told CNN that some of the money stolen from American victims is spent on expanding the scam operations and the massive compounds that house them and other illicit activities. West and Bradstreet are part of a small group of US law enforcement agencies working to find ways to tackle a crime that largely takes place online and overseas. Social media is flooded with scammers hunting for victims, on WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn and, increasingly, dating apps such as Bumble and Tinder. \u201cThe unfortunate reality is that scammers may pull on the heartstrings on those looking for love or connection - on dating apps and on all online platforms,\u201d a spokesman for Match group, which owns Tinder, said in a statement. Both Match and Facebook and Whatsapp parent company Meta told CNN they are working to prevent scammers from using their platforms, by flagging suspicious language and educating their users. CNN has reached out to LinkedIn and Bumble for comment. In May, a group of tech companies including cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase, Meta, Match group and the anti-scam charity organization GASO announced the \u201cTech Against Scams Coalition,\u201d acknowledging that scams \u201care a pervasive issue across the entire tech landscape.\u201d But West says that\u2019s not enough. She recently set up a task force called Operation Shamrock to bring together law enforcement, social media, crypto exchanges and traditional banks to tackle crypto scams. A 2023 CNN investigation revealed that many of the scammers are themselves victims of human trafficking. Lured to Southeast Asia with promises of white-collar jobs, they are instead trafficked into Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and other destinations. Since a 2021 military coup, Myanmar has become Asia\u2019s scam capital where criminals can operate freely under the cover of a bloody civil war. Today, city-sized compounds loom over the Myanmar side of the border with Thailand, with nothing but a dried-out river separating the two countries. Inside are what can only be described as scam factories \u2014 offices full of hundreds of slaves, working 16-hour days to befriend victims and convince them to invest in cryptocurrency on fake platforms that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges. Those kept inside tell stories of torture and abuse, of scammers who don\u2019t bring in enough money being beaten with electrical sticks and forced to do hundreds of squats as punishment. Rakesh, an Indian national, was trafficked to a compound called Gate 25 in Myanmar after applying for an IT job in Thailand in late 2022. There he signed a scamming contract under threat of execution, and was trained to scam. For 11 months he posed as \u201cKlara Semonov,\u201d a Russian investor based in Salt Lake City. To avoid gruesome punishments inflicted by his captors, he said he sent romantic messages to victims like Dennis to convince them to invest their money. \u201cSeventy to 80% fall for fake love,\u201d he said. Rakesh was eventually released in 2023 when his contract ended. He believes he was let go because he simply wasn\u2019t good enough at scamming. \u201cThey (were) treating us like slaves,\u201d he told CNN days after his release in 2023. Conveniently located on the border, the compounds use telecoms services from the Thai side. In November 2023 Thai Justice Minister Tawee Sodsong said they were working to cut off the compounds. Pachara Naripthaphan of the Thai National Broadcasting Transmissions Commission has since told CNN that in May they instructed all telecom operators to shut off wireless services in proximity to any areas bordering Myanmar, Laos or Cambodia. Despite that, their data shows that illicit activity has continued at a baseline level as criminals adjust to using other means of connecting to the internet such as Starlink. Even here on the border, where the physical distance is reduced to nothing but a narrow river, the criminals remain out of the reach of law enforcement, either locally or internationally. \u201cMany of these perpetrators are beyond my reach. And in order to establish deterrence, we need to prosecute some individuals who are running these operations in Southeast Asia,\u201d Santa Clara district attorney Jeff Rosen says. According to FBI data, out of nearly $5 billion dollars lost to cryptocurrency fraud in 2023, $3.96 billion was stolen in pig butchering scams. While Rosen\u2019s office and the Secret Service have had some success in retrieving millions of dollars in stolen funds, no American law enforcement agency has been able to arrest a single suspected scammer. \u2018Hard to believe\u2019 Carina, who asked CNN to only use her first name, met \u201cEvan\u201d on Bumble in May 2023. His photos showed a blond man with piercing blue eyes. He claimed to be Dutch and showed off his wealth \u2014 expensive cars and Rolexes, though none of that appealed to Carina, a chemistry PhD and triathlete. Their relationship moved fast. Right away he suggested they move their conversation to WhatsApp and delete the Bumble app to focus on getting to know each other. A few days later he started calling her \u201choney.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re doing that already?\u201d Carina asked, in a text conversation seen by CNN. Evan claimed he had made his money running a company with his uncle and investing in crypto. He told her she could pay off her student loans in a matter of months by investing. Carina was hesitant at first but eventually agreed to put in $1,000. He told her not to use the official app of the Kraken crypto platform, and instead sent her a link to a parallel website which they used to trade in the coming months. As their investments grew, so did their relationship. The two made plans for the future, romantic weekend getaways and family introductions, though they were yet to meet in person. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you before. Hard to believe I\u2019m falling for a man I have never seen or spoken to,\u201d Carina told him just a few weeks in. The first red flag emerged when Evan pressured Carina to enter an \u201cevent\u201d where she would have to invest $150,000 by the end of July to make extra profit. If she failed to reach the target, her account and money would be frozen. Scared to lose the money she had already put in, Carina panicked. She took out a high-interest loan and borrowed money from friends and family to meet the deadline. Despite all his purported wealth, Evan refused to help her, instead lying and telling her he was struggling to meet his target of $500,000 and needed her help, she said. At one point, Carina found herself consoling her scammer, telling him the money didn\u2019t matter as long as they loved each other. \u2018Major psychological stunt\u2019 After Dennis took his life, his adult children were left piecing together what happened by going through his Facebook messages. There, they learned for the first time what Dennis had been dealing with. \u201cI have been having dark thoughts about my life and it being over. Certainly it looks like my financial life is done,\u201d Dennis messaged his scammer in the months before his death. \u201cAnd the ultimate pain here is that I have betrayed family trust. This is unbearable,\u201d he writes in screenshots of their conversation seen by CNN. \u201cWhat\u2019s most heartbreaking is reading through these messages. He was talking about having signs of a nervous breakdown. And so these were all shared with the profile,\u201d Adrianne says. \u201cInstead of sharing with us,\u201d Matt adds. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing here is that these scammers overseas have figured out a way that they can get victims to trust them over their own families,\u201d West says. \u201cIt\u2019s a major psychological stunt that they\u2019re pulling on the rest of the world.\u201d Carina didn\u2019t tell her family about what had happened and the stress she was under until the very final moment. After hitting their event targets, Carina tried to withdraw some of her money, but was unable to do so, having violated platform rules by investing in the same account as Evan. After months of hiding it, Carina told her family, who suggested she speak to Kraken directly. The next morning she called Kraken customer services, who informed her there was no account under her name.  \u201cI realized I had been scammed at that point. And I broke down,\u201d Carina says. \u201cIt was all fake. It was a fake profile. It was a fake story. The amount of time that he spent grooming and getting to know me was incessant.\u201d Reading through their conversations a year later, Carina barely recognizes herself. \u201cIt\u2019s actually heartbreaking for me to see the state that I was in,\u201d she says.

As the heat of summer gathers, hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza are contending with a crisis in sanitation. Ismail Zayda, who lives in Gaza City in the north, told CNN that water supplies had been cut off for nine months. \u201cThe municipalities are not working, and waste in large piles is on our doorsteps and on the roads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeing large quantities of flying insects for the first time\u2026 Frankly, we have insects that we see for the first time and we do not know their names, and they sting our bodies and the bodies of our children.\u201d Israel\u2019s relentless bombardment of Gaza \u2013 launched in the wake of the October 7 attacks \u2013 is now into its eighth month and has triggered a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Human rights groups have repeatedly sounded the alarm over \u201cunspeakable\u201d living conditions for Palestinians, as Israel\u2019s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. There is little sign of a resolution to the protracted and bloody conflict. A US-backed ceasefire plan was overwhelmingly approved by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) this week. But neither side has accepted it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly stated that he will continue until Hamas is destroyed and the remaining hostages are freed. In an assessment this week, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), stated that in Deir al Balah in central Gaza, where thousands of displaced are sheltering, families say that shelters are overcrowded. They have reported a range of health issues, such as hepatitis A, skin diseases, and respiratory illnesses and say that access to water is also critically low. At one displacement site, the average amount of water available per day was less than one liter per person, well below the internationally recognized minimum requirement for survival of three litres per day, according to OCHA. A safe water supply is essential not just for drinking and cooking, but to prevent the spread of disease. OCHA reported this week that more than two-thirds of water and sanitation facilities and infrastructure in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged due to the conflict. It added many other facilities are out of service due to challenges including \u201cinsecurity, access impediments, and lack of power and fuel to operate generators.\u201d OCHA said that people\u2019s coping mechanisms are \u201cheavily stretched,\u201d with the most vulnerable collecting water from unreliable sources in inadequate containers, while lacking basic hygiene items like soap. The average high temperature in Gaza in the coming week is expected to be in the low 30 degrees celsius, with warmer weather likely to worsen what is already a crisis in sanitation. Roads \u2018full of sewage\u2019 Zayda, the Gaza City resident, told how an out-of-service swimming pool in his had become a magnet for insects. \u201cDuring the day, flies come, and at night, mosquitoes spread\u2026 We light fires at night and burn garbage until the flying insects disappear.\u201d Zayda spends much of the day wearing a mask, partly because some vehicles run on burned frying oil as an alternative to diesel, making breathing difficult. \u201cThe roads are full of sewage running through the streets, waste and rubble from the bombing,\u201d he said. The treatment of sewage amid damage to infrastructure and a lack of fuel has become an enduring problem in Gaza. Carl Skau, Deputy Executive Director of the World Food Programme, said after a tour of Gaza this week\u00a0that a million people have been pushed out of Rafah and are now \u201ctrapped\u201d in a \u201chighly congested area along the beach in the burning summer heat.\u201d \u201cWe drove through rivers of sewage,\u201d he said. According to the OCHA, the delivery of some fuel supplies has helped reduce the level of accumulated wastewater in the Sheikh Radwan area in Gaza City, but \u201cthe lack of a steady flow of fuel creates a continued risk of sewage overflow into neighbouring areas.\u201d Assem Al-Nabih, media officer for the Gaza City Municipality, told CNN there is now \u201ca leakage of large quantities of sewage in various parts of the city and also into the sea.\u201d \u201cThere is significant damage to the sewer lines and sewage pumps, this has led to the leakage of sewage and wastewater throughout the city.\u201d He estimated that more than 4 kilometers of water pipelines had been destroyed or damaged, an immense stretch to repair in the middle of a war. According to assessments by UN agencies and partner organizations published in the last week, 67% of water and sanitation facilities and infrastructure in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged due to conflict. There are sporadic efforts to repair infrastructure. The Coastal Municipalities Water Utility, in partnership with the International Committee of the Red Cross, has restored several wells in Khan Younis, Deir Al Balah and Nuseirat. But the scale of the task, without a ceasefire and with limited fuel supplies and equipment, is far beyond the capability of local authorities in Gaza.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/middleeast/gaza-health-crisis-mosquitoes-sewage-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

It was a glimmer of familial normality in Gaza for a nine-year-old and her younger sibling that ended in tragedy. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear its whizzing or anything, I only saw a red light when the missile fell,\u201d Hanan recalls from her hospital bed in Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza. Her voice is hoarse and cracked, following reconstructive surgery to her face. She has 20% burns to her face, hands, chest, and leg. Her sister, five-year-old Leene, who was walking ahead of her, escaped injury. \u201cThere was a man next to me dismembered and bleeding and a block of building cement fell on me,\u201d Hanan says. Hanan is one of thousands of critically ill patients waiting for medical evacuation from Gaza but unable to leave following the closure of the Rafah crossing to Egypt in early May. After the airstrike, her father rushed her to hospital, where she also had surgery to remove shrapnel from her face. Her doctor, Mahmoud Mahane, specializes in burns and eye injuries, but says there is nothing more they can do for her inside Gaza. \u201cMost children need medical transfers,\u201d he says, \u201cfor a more qualified treatment than here, as we don\u2019t have the treatment or tools and we don\u2019t have the supplies, we lack these supplies.\u201d Eight months of war have decimated the Gazan health system. Tens of thousands of injured Palestinians and a severe lack of medicine, doctors, and electricity, have proved a lethal combination. The only hope for many is to be evacuated through the Rafah crossing into Egypt and get treatment in neighboring countries. That lifeline has been cut off since May 7 when the Israeli military took\u00a0control of the crossing and closed it. Egypt says it will not open the crossing until the Israeli military withdraws. It cites security reasons \u2013 one Egyptian soldier was killed last month in fighting along the border. Israel says it will not hand over control of the crossing to Palestinian authorities, fearing Hamas would use the area to smuggle in weapons. 10,000 need evacuating Rik Peeperkorn is the World Health Organization\u2019s representative for the West Bank and Gaza. He says there are at least 10,000 urgent cases that need to be evacuated from Gaza for treatment, adding this is likely an under-estimate given the difficulty getting accurate data. \u201cThe biggest group is the war injuries and war-related \u2026 the severe trauma, spinal injury, etc. The other biggest group is, of course, chronic conditions \u2013 oncology, cardiovascular, respiratory as well.\u201d Before the war, Peeperkorn says between 50 and 100 patients would leave daily to be treated in Jerusalem and the West Bank.\u00a0Since May 7, not one single case has been able to leave through Rafah, creating a backlog of desperation and severe cases. \u201cThe Rafah crossing should be reopened as quickly as possible,\u201d Peeperkorn says, \u201cor there should be an alternative crossing or mechanism actually applied because we cannot leave these critical patients. We have no estimation at the moment how many of the patients which should have left actually have already passed away. Before the crossing was closed on May 7, various countries \u2013 including Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, the UAE, Turkey, and parts of the European Union \u2013 had taken in critically ill cases. Some patients also continued to be transferred for treatment in Israeli hospitals after the war began, according to COGAT, Israel\u2019s body overseeing the Palestinian Territories. Peeperkorn says many have said they are ready to welcome more. But with the crossing shut, and Israel and Egypt continuing to blame each other for its continued closure, time is running out for some. In the pediatric department of Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza, the sounds of the ICU are overwhelming; a constant cacophony of beeping machines keeping newborn patients alive. Kholoud al-Sharqi\u2019s baby girl Malak, meaning Angel, was just four days old when her mother spoke to CNN, holding her baby for the first time when she was allowed out of the incubator. Her doctor says Malak has a heart defect and needs a complex operation considered beyond the capabilities of his hospital with its lack of fuel for generators and medicine. \u201cThe doctors did what was necessary,\u201d al-Sharqi says, \u201cbut they said that she must be transferred (out of Gaza) quickly.\u201d With tears running down her face she adds, \u201cOne of the doctors told me not to have high hopes.

A tropical storm watch is in effect for the stretch of coast from Port O\u2019Connor in South Texas to northeastern Mexico as a broad area of thunderstorms in the Gulf of Mexico develops into the first tropical storm of what\u2019s expected to be a hyperactive hurricane season. The system was designated Potential Tropical Cyclone One by the National Hurricane Center on Monday afternoon. As the name suggests, it isn\u2019t quite a tropical storm yet, but is expected to become one and poses a threat to the areas in the tropical storm watch over the next 48 hours. The system had 40 mph winds Monday afternoon \u2013 strong enough that if it does develop a coherent circulation, it would be named Tropical Storm Alberto. It\u2019s forecast to by late Tuesday or Wednesday before approaching the northern coast of Mexico on Thursday. The system\u2019s strength will be limited by its short time over water, but it\u2019s main threat of significant rain and flooding will not: multiple days of gushing rainfall for parts of Central America, southern Mexico\u00a0and the US western Gulf Coast. Heavy rain was already ongoing Monday in parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras as the gyre churned. Double-digit rainfall totals are possible in these areas by Thursday. Rain is needed desperately in parts of Mexico and Central America that are bone-dry after weeks of unrelenting heat. But day after day of heavy rain will quickly overwhelm parched soils unable to absorb water as fast as it falls, resulting in dangerous flooding. Deep tropical moisture was also fueling storms as far north as the US\u2019s western Gulf Coast. Double-digit rainfall totals are likely in portions of coastal and southern Texas by the weekend, while other portions of the Gulf Coast could pick up several inches through midweek. A level 2 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place from the Texas coast to southern Alabama Monday. The risk increases to a level 3 of 4 for Tuesday in parts of Texas and Louisiana. By Wednesday, the air over the Gulf Coast will be loaded up with \u201cincredible amounts of moisture\u201d which could \u201ceasily\u201d produce flash flooding, the Weather Prediction Center warned Monday. A level 3 of 4 threat remains in place in Texas Wednesday. Heavy rain isn\u2019t the most welcome sight along some parts of the US Gulf Coast. June has been drier after a drenching spring, but the soil and area rivers are still holding on to plenty of water in eastern Texas and western Louisiana. Another tropical threat could take shape Another tropical threat is stirring in the Atlantic as development gets underway in the Gulf of Mexico. An area of showers and thunderstorms a few hundred miles east of the Bahamas could be the starting point for a potential tropical system later this week. Right now, the National Hurricane Center gives it a low chance of developing into a tropical system. Multiple atmospheric factors must align for the area of stormy weather to get its act together, but the opportunity for development exists over the next few days as it slowly pushes westward. If something tropical does develop, it could approach the southeastern US by Thursday or Friday and be steered south of the heat dome roasting areas farther north. It\u2019s unclear exactly which areas could be impacted, but anywhere from Florida to the Carolinas should keep a close eye on the forecast as it comes into focus in the coming days. Drenching rain could soak parts of the Southeast coast and rough seas are possible from the Bahamas to the mid-Atlantic coasts regardless of development.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/weather/hurricane-season-gulf-coast-flooding/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_asia_north-korea-russia-putin-visit-intl-hnk", "text": "Vladimir Putin is set to travel to North Korea for a two-day visit starting Tuesday, the Kremlin said, in the Russian president\u2019s first trip to the country in more than two decades \u2013 and the latest sign of a deepening alignment that\u2019s raised widespread international concern. This is a rare overseas trip for Putin since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022 and a key moment for North Korean President Kim Jong Un, who has not hosted another world leader in Pyongyang \u2013 among the globe\u2019s most politically isolated capitals \u2013 since the Covid-19 pandemic. The closely watched visit is expected to further cement a burgeoning partnership between the two powers that is founded on their shared animosity toward the West and driven by Putin\u2019s need for support in his ongoing war on Ukraine. Following his visit to North Korea, Putin will travel to Hanoi Wednesday for another two-day trip, in a display of Communist-governed Vietnam\u2019s ties to Russia that is likely to rankle the United States. Putin\u2019s trip to North Korea will have a \u201cvery eventful\u201d agenda, his aide Yuri Ushakov said during a press conference Monday. Both leaders plan to sign a new strategic partnership, Ushakov said, with main events of the visit scheduled for Wednesday. Ushakov insisted the agreement is not provocative or aimed against other countries, but is meant to ensure greater stability in northeast Asia. He said the new agreement will replace documents signed between Moscow and Pyongyang in 1961, 2000 and 2001. \u201cThe parties are still working on it, and a final decision regarding its signing will be formed in the coming hours,\u201d Ushakov said, according to Russian state media RIA. Satellite imagery from Planet Labs and Maxar Technologies shows preparations for a large parade in Pyongyang\u2019s central square. One image shows a grandstand being constructed on the eastern side of Kim Il Sung Square, the site where all major parades in North Korea are held. In an earlier image, taken on June 5, North Koreans can be seen practicing marching formations. US national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday the Biden administration wasn\u2019t \u201cconcerned about the trip\u201d itself, but added, \u201cWhat we are concerned about is the deepening relationship between these two countries.\u201d The US, South Korea and other countries have accused North Korea of providing substantial military aid to Russia\u2019s war effort in recent months, while observers have raised concerns that Moscow may be violating international sanctions to aid Pyongyang\u2019s development of its nascent military satellite program. Both countries have denied North Korean arms exports. Putin\u2019s trip reciprocates one Kim made last September, when the North Korean leader traveled in his armored train to Russia\u2019s far eastern region, for a visit that included stops at a factory that produces fighter jets and a rocket-launch facility. Kim last week hailed the future of the countries\u2019 \u201cmeaningful ties and close comradeship\u201d in a message to Putin commemorating Russia\u2019s national day on June 12. \u201cOur people give full support and solidarity to the successful work of the Russian army and people,\u201d Kim said, according to the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper. In an article for the Rodong Sinmun newspaper published early Tuesday local time to coincide with the trip, Putin thanked Pyongyang for showing \u201cunwavering support\u201d for Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and said the two countries were \u201cready to confront the ambition of the collective West.\u201d He said the two were \u201cactively advancing their multifaceted partnership\u201d and would \u201cdevelop alternative trade and mutual settlements mechanisms not controlled by the West, jointly oppose illegitimate unilateral restrictions, and shape the architecture of equal and indivisible security in Eurasia.\u201d The meeting comes just days after a summit of the Group of Seven (G7) developed economies in Italy attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, where Western leaders reiterated their enduring support for Ukraine and agreed to use profits from frozen Russian assets to back a $50 billion loan to the war-torn country. It also follows a Kyiv-backed international peace summit over the weekend attended by more than 100 countries and organizations, which was meant to drum up support for Zelensky\u2019s vision for peace, which calls for a complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. Putin rebuffed those efforts a day ahead of the gathering by offering his own peace conditions, including the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from four partially occupied regions and that Kyiv withdraw its bid to join NATO \u2013 a position seen as nonstarter by Ukraine and its allies. Putin\u2019s visit to North Korea is widely viewed as an opportunity for him to seek to bolster Kim\u2019s support for his war \u2013 a goal that may be increasingly urgent as long-delayed American military aid for Ukraine comes online. Last month, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told American lawmakers the provision of North Korean munitions and missiles, as well as Iranian drones, had allowed Russian forces \u201cto get back up on their feet.\u201d Between August and February, Pyongyang shipped about 6,700 containers to Russia, which could accommodate more than 3 million rounds of 152 mm artillery shells or more than 500,000 rounds of 122 mm multiple rocket launchers, South Korea\u2019s defense ministry said earlier this year. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied such arms transfers, with a senior North Korean official last month calling such allegations an \u201cabsurd paradox.\u201d When asked about concerns that Russia is considering the transfer of sensitive technologies to Pyongyang in exchange for those goods, a Kremlin spokesperson last week said the countries\u2019 \u201cpotential for developing bilateral relations\u201d was \u201cprofound\u201d and \u201cshould not cause concern to anyone and should not and cannot be challenged by anyone.\u201d Putin on the world stage Putin last visited North Korea in 2000, when he met with Kim\u2019s predecessor and late father Kim Jong Il. His travel now comes as the Russian leader appears keen to re-establish himself on the global stage, chipping away at an image of isolation in the wake of his widely condemned invasion of Ukraine by drawing in like-minded partners. Last month Putin made a state visit to Beijing, where he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping made a sweeping affirmation of their shared opposition to what they see as a US-led world order. Moscow last week hosted foreign ministers from countries including China, Iran, South Africa and Brazil for a meeting of the BRICS group of major developing economies. Putin\u2019s move to bolster North Korean ties has also been a boon for Kim, who remains unbowed by years of international sanctions over his illegal nuclear weapons program. It coincides with a period of heightened international concern about the North Korean leader\u2019s intentions as he ramped up bellicose language and scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea. The visit from a leader of a permanent member country of the United Nations Security Council will provide a signal to Kim\u2019s domestic audience of his global clout \u2013 and a chance to push for deeply needed economic and technological support from Moscow. Russia previously backed international sanctions and UN-backed investigations into North Korea\u2019s illegal weapons program, which includes tests of long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles that could in theory reach the US mainland. But Russia\u2019s apparent increasing reliance on North Korea and rising frictions with the West appear to have shifted that dynamic. In March, Moscow vetoed a UN resolution to renew independent monitoring of North Korea\u2019s violations of Security Council sanctions.

{"id": "2024_06_17_africa_british-army-abandoned-children-kenya-intl", "text": "Seventeen-year-old Marian Pannalossy cuts a striking figure wherever she goes in Archer\u2019s Post, a small town 200 miles north of Nairobi. She lives alone and is light-skinned in a place where mixed-race people are a rarity and therefore ostracized. \u201cThey call me \u2018mzungu maskini,\u2019 or a poor white girl,\u201d she told CNN at her single-room house, a tremor in her voice.\u00a0\u201cThey always say \u2018Why are you here? Just look for connections so that you can go to your own people. You don\u2019t belong here. You\u2019re not supposed to be here suffering.\u2019\u201d Marian believes that her father was a British soldier, but she has never met him. She does not even know his name. Marian is among a group of mixed-race children whose mothers say they were conceived after rape by British soldiers training in Kenya. Her mother, Lydia Juma, was among hundreds of Kenyan women who filed complaints with the UK military over the years, as documented by Kenya\u2019s human rights body. \u201cI don\u2019t know why God is punishing me. I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Juma said through tears in a powerful \u202f2011 documentary, \u2018The Rape of the Samburu Women.\u2019 Marian, aged four at the time, sat on her lap, sometimes hugging her mother as she wept and recounted how she was violated and the suffering she had endured since. \u00a0\u00a0Juma\u2019s live-in boyfriend, with whom she had two older children, left her after she gave birth to Marian, a mixed-race child, because rape is a taboo in their culture. \u201cThe moment he saw that the child is \u2018white,\u2019 he went, and he went forever,\u201d she said in the film. Juma died two years after that interview without ever finding the man she says raped her. Mixed-race children continue to be born in the remote villages where the British Army trains its soldiers in Kenya. The British Army Training Unit, Kenya (BATUK), is headquartered in the town of Nanyuki, about 70 miles southwest of Archer\u2019s Post. BATUK is currently under investigation by the Defense, Intelligence and Foreign Relations committee of Kenya\u2019s National Assembly. It has held public hearings in several areas where British troops train and heard a litany of complaints about abuse, exploitation, and sexual assaults from communities around them. It intends to hear from BATUK officials and the British High Commissioner to Kenya at the end of its work later this month, according to a schedule shared with CNN. One of the more contentious accusations against British soldiers involves the case of Agnes Wanjiru. Wanjiru, a 21-year-old Kenyan woman, vanished in 2012 after entering a hotel with British soldiers, according to reports. Her body was later found in a septic tank. Despite a Kenyan inquest ruling her death a murder and the reported identification of a suspect by fellow soldiers, the British soldier allegedly involved hasn\u2019t faced charges. Wanjiru\u2019s family believes British officials are\u00a0indifferent to her case\u00a0and pleaded with the King for help during his visit to Kenya. A British High Commission spokesperson said it takes all allegations raised by the community seriously and it will ensure thorough investigations. \u201cAll sexual activity which involves the abuse of power, including buying sex whether in the UK or abroad, is prohibited,\u201d the British High Commission, speaking on behalf of BATUK, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe are committed to preventing sexual exploitation in any form and investigate and hold to account any Service Personnel found to be involved in it.\u201d \u2018British boys behaving badly\u2019 Britain pays Kenya about $400,000 a year to allow its soldiers to train in the East African country, mostly in the expansive wildlife conservancies in Laikipia and Samburu counties. Kenya renewed the defense pact in 2021 despite strong local opposition. BATUK has a permanent training base in Nanyuki, to the south of those wildlife conservancies, with 100 full-time staff. The Defense, Intelligence and Foreign Relations committee\u2019s work has renewed scrutiny of the British Army\u2019s operations in Kenya and once again brought attention to the cases of the women who have accused soldiers of rape over several decades. Allegations of rape and other crimes, including murder, by British soldiers deployed there date back to the 1950s. \u201cThis to us is an example of British boys behaving badly,\u201d said Marian Mutugi,\u00a0a commissioner for the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis is a matter of taking care of the vulnerable in our society who our constitution says require special protection.\u201d She\u2019s referring to hundreds of women from the mostly pastoralist Maasai and Samburu communities who accused the British Army of rapes in the 1970s and 80s. They were represented by the British lawyer Martyn Day in a landmark civil case in London in the early 2000s. Ntoyie Lenkanan, 72, was among the complainants in the British case. \u00a0\u00a0Nearly forty years later, her voice trembles with emotion and barely controlled anger as she recounts her ordeal. \u201cI was going to fetch water when I was ambushed by a group of British soldiers who were hiding in the grass near the river. One of them grabbed me and raped me,\u201d she told CNN at her home in DolDol, about 35 miles north of Nanyuki. She has been waiting years for an official acknowledgment of the violation and compensation, but neither has come. A few miles from Lenkanan\u2019s home in the sparsely populated arid lands of DolDol, Saitet\u00a0Noltwalal\u00a0who is in her 70s, sits under a tree. She is blind and frail, relying on her family for everything. She, too, says she was raped by a British soldier at a hill near her home a few decades ago but she no longer remembers the exact period. \u201cI have been waiting a long time and I can no longer fend for myself. I wouldn\u2019t like what happened to me to happen to anyone else,\u201d she said. Her quality of life nosedived after the rape as she miscarried the child and lost her eyesight shortly after, she said. Some of her peers who accused the British Army of sexual violations have died while waiting for redress. In 2007, Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defense dismissed claims\u202fof rape brought by 2,187 women, Lenkanan and Noltwalal among them, saying \u201cthere was no reliable evidence to support any single allegation.\u201d A Royal Military Police investigation at the time concluded that most of the Kenyan evidence appeared to have been fabricated.The UK investigators did not conduct DNA tests on any of the 69 mixed-race children alleged to have been born\u00a0from rape by British soldiers. Some of the women testified in 2009 about being preyed on by British soldiers as they went about their daily chores to Kenya\u2019s Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission, set up in 2008 to hear from victims of injustices spanning from 1963 to 2008, including ethnic conflicts and political violence among others. And Kenya\u2019s Truth Justice and reconciliation commission claims the government in Nairobi lost the case files, without explanation. \u201cThe most horrific allegation of rape is said to have (occurred) in October 1997 at Archer\u2019s Post where 30 women were gang raped by British soldiers, often at knifepoint and sometimes inside the victims\u2019 own manyattas (compounds),\u201d the 2009 report said. A new day in court British soldiers can now be sued in Kenyan courts for any wrongdoing as part of a new addition to the 2021 defense pact signed between both countries. It means many of these women may finally have their day in court. Kenya also has no statute of limitations on cases involving alleged human rights abuses. So, 17 years later, lawyer Kelvin Kubai has signed up more than 300 of the women who previously brought rape claims and is working to reintroduce the case in Kenyan courts. Seventeen-year-old Marian will be the lead plaintiff. \u201cIt is traumatic and psychologically disturbing to people like Marian and many others who continue to see the British training amidst them with all these unresolved trauma and historical injustices,\u201d Kubai told CNN after meeting some of the pastoralist women who allege wrongdoing by British soldiers. \u201cWe can win because we have a very progressive constitution. The Kenyan legal system offers a better redress than what is available in the UK,\u201d he said. Abandoned children Kenyan women say they continue to struggle for recognition even for children conceived in consensual relationships with British soldiers. Generica Namoru, 28, says she started a consensual relationship in 2017 with a soldier while she worked at the BATUK headquarters in Nanyuki. \u201cHe went back to the UK when I was two months pregnant. He is the one that chose her name when she was born,\u201d she told CNN. Namoru says the soldier sent his passport and other personal information for the newborn\u2019s birth certificate. Her daughter Nicole, five, bears his last name, she told CNN, but he has never supported her. Namoru is unemployed and has to \u201chustle\u201d for her and Nicole\u2019s upkeep by selling fresh water in the semi-arid town where they live. \u201cI\u2019m a woman with a \u2018white\u2019 child. It\u2019s not easy for my family especially because a child is expensive,\u201d she said, pointing out that Nicole has no health insurance nor a permanent home. \u201cShe\u2019s suffering for no reason. I want him to take care of her education, health and shelter. Nothing else.\u201d In the meantime, Kabui the lawyer and his team have set up a crowdfunding campaign to support Marian, Nicole, and other \u201cabandoned children of British Army soldiers in Kenya with education and legal fees,\u201d he told CNN. Namoru says that she has tried without success to get the Kenyan or British governments to locate her ex-boyfriend and compel him to take financial responsibility for his daughter. The British High Commission in Nairobi told CNN that it cooperates with local child support authorities in paternity claims. Neither Nicole nor Marian have UK citizenship even though they qualify if they can prove their fathers are English. \u201cIt\u2019s not like these kids are looking for a free ticket to the UK. We\u2019re just saying that they deserve to get parental\u00a0care from their fathers that every child deserves,\u201d Mutugi of the Human Rights Commission said, claiming that the British government had shown no interest in resolving the cases. \u201cThese children deserve British citizenship. They\u2019re British kids. Their fathers were British!\u201d Mutugi said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/africa/british-army-abandoned-children-kenya-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_14_americas_colombia-chiquita-banana-intl-latam", "text": "The execution of banana plantation worker \u201cDavid\u201d\u00a0by right-wing Colombian paramilitary\u00a0members\u00a0in 1997 was as swift as it was brutal. Minutes after his bus was\u00a0stopped at a checkpoint in the coastal region of Urab\u00e1, he was dragged off, beaten to death in front of his fellow passengers, and dumped on the side of the road \u2013 where his killers covered his corpse with a\u00a0banana plant.\u00a0Cows would later feed on his body, according to court documents. The brutality did not end there. His\u00a0daughter and\u00a0sister-in-law\u00a0disappeared weeks later, never to be found again. Death threats were made to another member of the family. What was left of the family soon left Urab\u00e1 for good. He\u00a0was just one of thousands of people targeted by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, or AUC, an infamous right-wing terrorist group that, at the height of Colombia\u2019s civil conflict around the turn of the century, was able to mobilize tens of thousands of fighters. More than a quarter century\u00a0later, a landmark civil case in a US federal court this week found banana company Chiquita Brands International liable for financing the\u00a0paramilitary\u00a0group, and ordered Chiquita\u00a0to pay $38.3 million in compensation to \u201cDavid\u2019s\u201d family and those of\u00a0seven other victims \u2013 whose real identities were concealed in court documents. The details of those deaths, which took place between 1997 and 2004, and accounts of\u00a0the impact they had on the families, were read to jurors before\u00a0they deliberated whether Chiquita \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest banana producers \u2013 had acted \u201cas a reasonable businessperson\u201d by paying the AUC what the company characterized as extortion payments. The families\u00a0argued\u00a0that\u00a0payments from Chiquita to the AUC had helped to prop up the paramilitary group\u2019s violence in Colombia and that the company should therefore be held liable for the group\u2019s murders. The verdict\u00a0has been celebrated as a legal breakthrough.\u00a0According to the lawyers who won the case in Florida, it marks \u201cthe first time an American jury has held a major US corporation accountable for complicity in serious human rights abuses in another country.\u201d \u201cI feel great joy, we waited for so long and suddenly, we won. I had almost lost hope, but God helped us,\u201d one of the plaintiffs told CNN after the ruling. The mother of four daughters\u00a0recalled telling\u00a0the court how her partner\u00a0was\u00a0killed by AUC paramilitaries on November 14, 2003, to pressure the family to sell a banana plantation at below market rate. \u201cI don\u2019t want the money myself, I\u2019ll be gone soon\u2026 but at least, for the girls: may they get some justice now!\u201d she said of the compensation. A bellwether case? The verdict follows a nearly two-decade judicial fight by the families, who sued Chiquita International after a separate court case in 2007.\u00a0In\u00a0that case,\u00a0the company admitted paying $1.7 million in \u201cprotection money\u201d to the AUC \u2013 at that time considered a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the State Department \u2013 and agreed to pay the US government a $25 million fine. However, it\u2019s unlikely to be the last of the matter, and not only because Chiquita has already said it will appeal the verdict. Marco Simons, general counsel for Earth Rights International, a human rights NGO that provided legal assistance to the victims, described his legal strategy as a \u201cbellwether process,\u201d with his team selecting the nine strongest cases they had from over 4,500 complaints. He now hopes many more cases will follow. \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to represent these victims for the past 17 years. It\u2019s not over yet, but this is a significant step forward, and we hope that this will pave the way for compensation for all the victims,\u201d Simons told a press conference in Washington on Tuesday. Because of Chiquita\u2019s appeal, Simons says it is unlikely any of the victims will receive compensation soon, however, he says the case has sent a strong message to corporations about the need to respect human rights. \u201cUltimately, this money is not going to replace what\u2019s been lost. We\u2019re still talking about horrific abuses that these families have suffered, but the money is important because, unfortunately, the language that corporations understand best is money. Sometimes it takes a significant monetary penalty to change corporate behavior,\u201d Simons said. \u2018Tragic for so many\u2019 Chiquita has maintained in its defense \u2013 both throughout the latest case and in previous litigation \u2013 that it was itself a victim, as it had been forced to pay the AUC protection money. While that argument was not enough to\u00a0convince\u00a0the jury that it had acted \u201cas a reasonable businessperson would have acted under the circumstances,\u201d the company told CNN following the latest verdict that it remained \u201cconfident that our legal position will ultimately prevail.\u201d \u201cThe situation in Colombia was tragic for so many, including those directly affected by the violence there, and our thoughts remain with them and their families. However, that does not change our belief that there is no legal basis for these claims,\u201d the statement read. In its 2007 case against the US Justice Department, the company\u00a0admitted making more than \u201c100 payments to the AUC totaling over $1.7 million.\u201d\u00a0Chiquita recorded the AUC payments as \u201csecurity services,\u201d though the company never received any actual services from these payments,\u00a0according\u00a0to a US Justice Department press release from the time. Eric Holder, who represented Chiquita in the 2007 trial before serving as US Attorney General under President\u00a0Barack Obama, told the court then\u00a0that: \u201cThe company had to pay a variety of terrorist groups for over 15 years because those were the groups that controlled the areas in which the company operated. Not the Colombian government.\u201d However, in that trial, the company ended up admitting in a plea deal that it had willingly continued to pay the AUC even after the group was declared a terrorist organization by the US government in 2001, and even after a senior director lodged an objection to Chiquita\u2019s board reiterating \u201chis strong opinion to sell our operations in Colombia,\u201d due to the protection money issue. Federal attorneys found that Chiquita made $49.4 million in profit from their Colombian operations between 1997 and 2004. A time of \u2018real terror\u2019 The AUC was founded in 1997, during one of the most tragic phases of the Colombian civil conflict, which saw the government wrestle for control against left-wing guerrilla forces, right-wing paramilitaries, and criminal organizations. Around that time, left-wing guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN) were moving against the state and terrorizing the civilian population.\u00a0Chiquita said in the 2007 case that it had paid ransoms to the FARC and ELN\u00a0before it turned to the AUC in 1997. Faced with the possibility of an armed communist revolution in the country, Colombian landowners and right-wing sympathizers created groups of\u00a0vigilantes\u00a0to respond to the guerrillas blow for blow. The AUC were once such a\u00a0group and spent the years before their final demobilization\u00a0in 2006 terrorizing the population of northern Colombia to stem the rebellion. At its zenith, the AUC could mobilize tens of thousands of fighters, and was heavily financed by drug trafficking: following demobilization, more than a dozen AUC leaders were extradited on drug charges to the US. \u201cI remember that period, it was real terror,\u201d one of the plaintiffs awarded compensation on Monday told CNN. \u201cMy husband was killed, but my daughter was also raped, you had victims all across town.\u201d In other testimony heard by the jurors in the most recent court case, a minor\u00a0girl\u00a0was forced to watch from a taxi as her mother and stepfather were executed on the side of the street, before being given the equivalent of less than a dollar to return home and survive as an orphan. Colombia today Colombia today is a vastly different country to the one in which the AUC was born. A few years after the demobilization of the AUC, a peace deal in 2016 also brought to an end the 52-year conflict between the government and the FARC, though some dissidents continue to fight. Both right wing paramilitaries and left-wing guerrillas have since been included in transitional justice processes aimed at bringing closure to some of the darkest pages of the conflict. Yet the fear in Urab\u00e1 remains. Some of the AUC\u2019s former members remain at large and have joined a new organized criminal group, the Gulf Clan, that challenges government control in northwestern Colombia. Rights groups say powerful corporate interests continue to collude with local politicians and criminal groups to repress activism, particularly in defense of the environment, which can be a dangerous business in South America. Even so, for at least some of the many victims of the AUC, this week\u2019s court verdict is a reason for optimism.\u00a0One of the plaintiffs who spoke with CNN asked to share her message as an act of defiance. \u201cMy daughter, my son, they\u2019re all \u2018Mom don\u2019t pick up the phone, mom don\u2019t talk.\u2019 But hey, fear can only last until someone decides to speak,\u201d she said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/americas/colombia-chiquita-banana-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_15_middleeast_hajj-pilgrims-die-heatstroke-intl-latam", "text": "Six people have died from heatstroke during the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, amid warnings from Saudi officials that temperatures during the annual gathering could reach 48 degrees Celsius (118 degrees Fahrenheit) this year. All six of the dead are Jordanian citizens, the Jordanian foreign ministry said Saturday, adding that it was coordinating with Saudi authorities in Jeddah regarding burial procedures and possible transfer of their bodies back to Jordan. News of the deaths comes as pilgrims gathered atop Mount Arafat on Saturday, marking the main event of the pilgrimage, with the niece of one of the deceased telling CNN Arabic that her aunt had died on Mount Arafat and was buried in Saudi Arabia. More than\u00a01.8 million people\u00a0are taking part in Hajj this year, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. The Hajj is one of the biggest religious gatherings in the world and the largest annual event in Saudi Arabia. It occurs two months and 10 days after Ramadan ends, during the Islamic month of Dhul-Hijjah. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and shorter than the Gregorian calendar, the timing of Hajj on the Gregorian calendar shifts slightly each year. This year, Saudi Arabia is expected to experience extreme heat over the five-day pilgrimage, with temperatures reaching 48 degrees Celsius (118 degrees Fahrenheit) in Mecca. Hajj officials are asking pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated amid the harsh conditions, the spokesman for the ministry of health Muhammad Al-Abdulaali said, according to the state news agency SPA. The Saudi army has also deployed more than 1,600 personnel with medical units specifically for heatstroke and 30 rapid response teams. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers are taking part. Jordan has previously said there were more than 4,000 pilgrims in its official delegation this year. However, the foreign ministry clarified that the six who died were not part of the \u201cofficial delegation,\u201d meaning they did not have valid Hajj licenses to perform the pilgrimage. Performing Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam. Islam requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life. The pilgrimage includes numerous detailed rituals including wearing a special garment that symbolizes human equality and unity before God, a circular, counter-clockwise procession around the Kaaba, and the symbolic stoning of evil. People who have completed the pilgrimage may add the phrase al-Hajj or hajji (pilgrim) to their names. Over the past decade, Saudi Arabia has invested billions of dollars to upgrade transport, technology and accommodation for pilgrims performing Hajj \u2013 a key source of income for the world\u2019s largest oil producer.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/15/middleeast/hajj-pilgrims-die-heatstroke-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

According to state-run broadcaster CCTV, over 35,000 people were evacuated as of Saturday. As of Monday morning, more than 10,000 people were evacuated in Meizhou, the hardest flood-hit city in Guangdong province. Seventeen waterways in the major Han River basin \u201crecorded flooding above alert level,\u201d including two rivers at record flood levels, according to the Ministry of Water Resources on Monday. Guangdong province, an economic powerhouse home to 127 million people, is among parts of southern China that are subject to annual flooding from April to September. But the region has faced\u00a0more intense rainstorms and severe floods\u00a0in recent years as scientists warn that the climate crisis will amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent. Those warnings were underscored in April, when deadly floods submerged parts of Guangdong after rain poured for multiple days. On Monday, heavy rains wrought further devastation, with social media videos from the city of Meizhou, eastern Guangdong, showing river water almost overflowing as it lapped at bridges and partially submerged vehicles. More than 130,000 households in the city and suburbs were without power as of Monday morning, while classes were suspended, CCTV reported. \u201cAuthorities are still trying to reach some towns and villages\u201d\u00a0in the area, CCTV said. Further upstream along the Han River,\u00a0a\u00a0flood alert was issued in Fujian province due to heavy rainfall, according to its provincial alert center. Four people were killed in a series of landslides in the coastal province, CCTV reported Monday. Social media footage from Fujian, home to 40 million people, showed flood water rushing through the streets of towns and villages, Shanghang county in southwest Fujian recorded record rainfall of 375 millimeters (nearly 15 inches) in the past 24 hours, which represents 18% of its average annual rainfall, the province\u2019s meteorological service said in a statement Monday. China has been grappling with extreme weather this month as heavy rains inundate the south while severe drought and record temperatures scorch the north.

{"id": "2024_06_15_middleeast_eight-soldiers-killed-rafah-intl", "text": "Eight Israeli soldiers were killed in southern Gaza on Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces says, in one of the deadliest single incidents involving its troops since October 7. The IDF said the incident was still under review but preliminary findings suggested an armored vehicle carrying soldiers as part of a convoy had been hit by an explosion at around 5:15 a.m. local time during an operation targeting \u201cterrorist infrastructure\u201d in the northwestern part of Tal al-Sultan. \u201cAccording to the information we have at this point one of the engineering vehicles in the convoy was involved in an explosion that was apparently caused by explosive devices planted in the area or as a result of anti-tank missile fire,\u201d IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari told a press conference Saturday. The IDF is also investigating whether the initial explosion was compounded when explosive materiel aboard the vehicle detonated. \u201cThe current assessment is that the \u2018Nemera\u2019 armored vehicle got hit as a result of an explosion of a side bomb. In addition, on the vehicle there were engineering tools that include explosive materiel. The explosion was significant and may have been caused by the ignition of the explosive materiel on the vehicle. All this is not supposed to happen and therefore the incident is being examined,\u201d the IDF said. So great was the damage that it was difficult to identify and locate the bodies of those killed, the Israeli military added. \u201cToday we received another painful reminder of the price of war and that brave warriors and heroes were willing to sacrifice their lives for the state of Israel, which is the common home of all of us: Druze, Jews, Bedouin, Muslims and Christians. All citizens of Israel, our hearts and thoughts are with the families at this difficult time,\u201d Hagari said at the press conference. The IDF has not announced who they think was responsible for the incident. However, Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said it had \u201ccarried out a complex ambush against enemy vehicles\u201d operating in Tal al-Sultan, which lies west of the southern city of Rafah. The militant group claimed it had targeted a military bulldozer,\u00a0which then caught on fire, and that when rescue troops arrived,\u00a0it hit an armored personnel carrier with a missile strike. \u201cOur painful strikes against the enemy will continue everywhere they are present, and the occupying army will find nothing but death traps,\u201d the militant group said. The Israeli military has so far released the names of six of the eight soldiers killed in the incident. The troops, ages 19-23, were all members of the Combat Engineering Corps\u2019 601st Battalion. Meanwhile in the Sabra neighborhood in Gaza City, located in the enclave\u2019s north, two reservists were killed in an incident involving an explosive device on the tank they were traveling in, Israeli media, including CNN affiliate Channel 11 (Kan News), reported. The IDF did not say who they thought was responsible for the incident. We must stick to war goals: Netanyahu Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a speech on Saturday, spoke of his \u201cdeep sorrow\u201d over the deaths, describing the enemy as \u201cloathsome and murderous,\u201d but pledged to stick to his war goals. \u201cDespite the heavy and staggering cost, we must stick to the goals of the war: destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas, returning all our abductees, making sure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel and returning our residents safely to their homes \u2013 both in the north and in the south,\u201d Netanyahu said. He came under fire from opposition leader Yair Lapid, who accused Netanyahu of prioritizing political gains over national unity. Speaking at an anti-government rally in Tel Aviv, Lapid offered his condolences to the families of the eight soldiers killed in Tal al-Sultan before criticizing what he claimed was Netanyahu\u2019s response to a previous incident involving the deaths of four soldiers earlier this week. \u201cWhen the (four soldiers earlier this week) were killed, we were in the Knesset, voting on the conscription law. The whole Knesset already knew. We were all in a difficult, depressed mood, then we looked up and saw that there was one person who didn\u2019t feel that way (Netanyahu); we saw him smile,\u201d Lapid said. \u201cThat smile will bury his political career. This smile will remove him from our lives,\u201d Lapid added. The rally in Tel Aviv was attended by thousands of Israelis calling for an immediate ceasefire to secure the release of the remaining hostages. Similar protests have been taking place almost weekly. Various other ministers expressed their sorrow at the deaths, including defense minister Yoav Gallant, foreign minister Israel Katz and national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir. \u201cEight of our best sons were killed in Rafah,\u201d Katz said in a post on X. \u201cWhile knowing the price, they bravely entered Gaza to complete the mission of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages.\u201d Meanwhile Benny Gantz, who resigned from Israel\u2019s war cabinet just days ago, described the eight soldiers as \u201cthe beautiful faces of the people of Israel, the best among us.\u201d \u201cThe heart is torn by hearing the hard news, we will never stop protecting our country, and our society\u201d Gantz added. Push into Rafah Reports of airstrikes and artillery shelling emerged since dawn local time as Israel continues its push into Rafah. Ahmed Radwan, the media officer of\u00a0Rafah\u00a0Civil Defense, said they had received appeals to collect bodies and the injured but it was difficult for civil defense crews to access the area. Some of the fiercest fighting of recent days has been seen in Tal al-Sultan. Hamas\u00a0on\u00a0Friday said its fighters targeted\u00a0Israeli tanks\u00a0in\u00a0the neighborhood with Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs) and mortars, while the IDF said it found tunnels between neighboring houses used by militants as passageways. Elsewhere, at least 14 people were killed, including seven children, in Israeli strikes on central Gaza, the Civil Defense Directorate in Gaza said. In total, 30 people have been killed and 95 injured in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The conflict in Gaza began after the Hamas attacks of October 7, which killed around 1,200 people. Since then at least 37,296 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, according to the latest figures from the Ministry of Health in Gaza.

{"id": "2024_06_17_australia_australia-china-cheng-lei-blocked-intl-hnk", "text": "Chinese Premier Li Qiang\u2019s four-day visit to Australia this week was set to be focused on repairing long-strained relations between the two countries. But apparent efforts by Chinese officials to stand in front of an Australian reporter during a press briefing have shone a spotlight back on frictions between the countries. Cheng Lei, a TV anchor who was held in detention in China for more than three years before her release in 2023, told Sky News Australia the officials went to \u201cgreat lengths\u201d to block her from the cameras during a press event Monday where Li and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed cooperative agreements. Video footage appears to show two people involved in the incident, with one of them, described by the outlet as a Chinese embassy employee,\u00a0trying at one point to push closer to a seated Cheng, despite being blocked by another woman, identified by Sky News as an Australian official,\u00a0who intervenes to give her space. \u201cI\u2019m only guessing this is to prevent me from saying something or doing something that they think would be a bad look, but that in itself was a bad look,\u201d Cheng told Sky News, where she has been employed as a news presenter and columnist since late last year. Cheng added that such behavior was \u201ctypical\u201d as Chinese officials wouldn\u2019t want \u201cvoices of discord or the presence of someone who\u2019s a bit controversial\u201d when they are aiming to present a \u201cfriendly facade.\u201d Multiple media outlets that were also in attendance at the press conference, including the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph, reported the same details. CNN has requested comment from China\u2019s embassy in Canberra. China\u2019s security state keeps tight control on media and information within the country, where officials are not subject to the kind of robust questioning common to democratic countries. Beijing has also long been condemned by Western nations and rights groups for wrongful and arbitrary detentions. Cheng, previously a business anchor for China\u2019s state broadcaster CGTN, was detained by Chinese authorities in August 2020 on opaque espionage charges that came as diplomatic tensions were escalating between Beijing and Canberra. The mother of two spent more than three years in detention before being released by Beijing and returned home to her family in October, weeks before Albanese made the first visit of an Australian leader to China in seven years. Speaking to Sky News ahead of the news conference Monday, Cheng said it was a \u201cvery emotional day\u201d for her to be covering the major visit. \u201cSurely the fact that one minute I\u2019m sitting in incarceration and being raised as a topic at these visits then the next minute I\u2019m actually covering the visit \u2026 is testament to how wonderful freedom is and democracy is,\u201d she said. Cheng\u2019s detention had been a deep point of contention between the two governments, as has the jailing of writer and democracy activist Yang Hengjun, an Australian citizen who earlier this year was handed a suspended death penalty sentence for espionage following years of detention. Yang has denied the charges, which rights groups have said are politically motivated. Albanese said he raised Yang\u2019s case with Li, but declined to give an update on the health of the democracy activist, who has said he fears he could die in jail due to health issues. When asked during a press conference later about Cheng being blocked from view by officials during the document signing, Albanese said he didn\u2019t see the incident described but added it was \u201cimportant that people be allowed to participate fully and that\u2019s what should happen in this building or anywhere else in Australia.\u201d Pandas and visas The situation Monday stands as a stark reminder of Beijing-Canberra tensions and deep concerns within Australia, a staunch US ally, about China\u2019s authoritarianism amid a trip that was otherwise meant to instill goodwill. The\u00a0four-day visit of Li, China\u2019s No. 2 official, to Australia is the highest-level trip to a US-allied country of any Chinese official in seven years. It comes as the two countries have made strides in mending deep tensions over issues of trade, security and Beijing\u2019s alleged political influence in Australia and the South Pacific. Speaking alongside Li following the signing ceremony, Albanese called the visit \u201canother important step in stabilizing\u201d the relationship. The Chinese premier, speaking via a translator, pledged that China would work with Australia in \u201ca spirit of mutual respect, seeking common ground while showing differences and mutual benefit.\u201d Li announced Sunday that China would provide a new pair of giant pandas to the Adelaide Zoo in southern Australian after its current pair return to China later this year \u2013 extending a classic gesture of friendship from China often called \u201cpanda diplomacy.\u201d China would also\u00a0add Australia to its visa-waiver program, Li said Monday. Details were not immediately announced but follow similar visa arrangements with other countries in recent months as China struggles to draw in more international tourists to boost its flagging economy following years of Covid-19 border restrictions. Li announced a waiver scheme for New Zealand during a visit there Friday. The two leaders agreed to greater military-to-military communication, according to Albanese. The agreement follows recent close encounters of the two powers. In May, a Chinese fighter jet fired flares into the path of an Australian helicopter over the Yellow Sea in a move Albanese condemned at the time as \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d Li\u2019s Australia visit comes as China has gradually rolled back a number of crippling trade controls that it placed on key Australian imports including beef, barley, timber, coal and wine from 2020 after\u00a0then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an international inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in China.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/australia/australia-china-cheng-lei-blocked-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_sport_bryson-dechambeau-us-open-win-2024-spt-intl", "text": "American Bryson DeChambeau won his second US Open title on Sunday, edging Rory McIlroy in a nerve-shredding finale at Pinehurst No. 2 in Pinehurst, North Carolina. LIV Golf star DeChambeau carded a final round one-over 71 to finish one stroke ahead of his Northern Irish counterpart at six-under overall and add to his first major victory in 2020. It resigned world No. 3 McIlroy to yet another heartbreaking near-miss as his 10-year wait for a fifth major title continues. The 35-year-old played brilliantly to surge from three shots behind to two ahead of DeChambeau, only to miss two putts from inside four feet across the last two holes. Left needing to close with par to win, DeChambeau held his nerve to triumph and exorcise the demons of falling one stroke short of the PGA Championship to compatriot Xander Schauffele last month. With his victory falling on Father\u2019s Day, an emotional DeChambeau began his winner\u2019s speech by dedicating the trophy to his father Jon, who died in 2022. \u201cFirst off I want to say a Happy Father\u2019s Day to every father out there,\u201d DeChambeau said.\u201cThis one is for him.\u201d It makes the 30-year-old the second golfer after last year\u2019s PGA Championship winner Brooks Koepka to win a major after departing the PGA Tour for LIV Golf. Cameron Smith and Jon Rahm joined the Saudi-backed circuit after their victories at the 2022 Open Championship and 2023 Masters respectively. Once maligned by some fans, DeChambeau \u2013 whose personal YouTube channel continues to amass subscribers \u2013 has become a crowd-favorite at the majors this year and further consolidated that reputation at Pinehurst. The California-born golfer mixed thrilling play with regular fan interaction throughout, wooing fans one final time by delivering on his victor\u2019s speech promise to let them touch the trophy and ferrying it around the throngs gathered at the 18th green. \u201cI just can\u2019t thank you guys enough for all the support this week,\u201d he added to the crowd. \u201cYou guys have meant the world to me. You are the best fans in the world and I can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d The joyous scenes served as a stark contrast to the agony undoubtedly felt by McIlroy, who declined to speak to media after his final round one-under 69. McIlroy has plugged away at ending his major drought with remarkable consistency since his last triumph at the 2014 Open Championship, finishing inside the top-10 on 20 of his 36 subsequent appearances at the four flagship events, including his last five in a row at the US Open. He has been a major runner-up three times before, his most recent to Wyndham Clark at last year\u2019s tournament, but the fourth has the potential to haunt him the most given the context. Three bogeys and a par across his last four holes, compounded by two horror close-range misses, resigned him to a closing 69. Even one stroke better would ultimately have been enough to force DeChambeau into a playoff. McIlroy had made his previous 496 putts from inside three feet before his miss for par at the 16th, according to the PGA Tour. The curtain falls on the 2024 men\u2019s major calendar with the 152nd Open Championship at Royal Troon in Scotland on July 18, where American Brian Harman will seek to defend the Claret Jug. Scheffler endures rare torrid week Scottie Scheffler\u2019s miserable week ended in another birdie-less round as the world No.1 toiled to a tied-41st finish at eight-over par overall, his worst major performance in two years. Five wins in his previous eight starts \u2013 including last week\u2019s Memorial Tournament \u2013 had seen Scheffler arrive at Pinehurst as the overwhelming favorite yet he struggled to cope with the course\u2019s firm and fast greens, the typically unflappable Texan\u2019s frustrations bubbling over as he narrowly scraped under the cut line Friday. A third round one-over 71 meant Scheffler had shot four consecutive rounds over par for the first time in a professional career spanning 120 PGA Tour events, and the unwanted streak extended to five as he signed off with a 72. April\u2019s Masters champion had gone 168 rounds with at least one birdie before his second round 74, and had not finished outside the top-25 at a major since missing the cut at the 2022 PGA Championship. Both streaks had extended through a tied-eighth finish at last month\u2019s PGA Championship, a result achieved despite his arrest and release from jail during the major. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hole anything. I could not see the break on these greens,\u201d Scheffler, who has since seen all charges against him dismissed, told reporters Sunday. \u201cThe greens this week kind of had my number. I felt like I hit a lot of really good putts that did weird things at the cup that I was not expecting them to do.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been on a good stretch of golf,\u201d he added. \u201cHad one tough event following a great event. I\u2019m not really going to look too much into it but focus more on my prep.\u201d Scheffler finished 12 shots behind his compatriots Tony Finau and Patrick Cantlay, who shared third place at four-under overall, one shot behind McIlroy. France\u2019s Matthieu Pavon finished a further stroke back. Unfamiliar territory A virtuoso third round 67 that was as entertaining as it was excellent had rocketed DeChambeau into the final 18 holes with a plush \u2013 yet unfamiliar \u2013 three shot cushion. The Californian had never before held the 54-hole lead at a major championship. Though he had ultimately cantered to victory at Winged Foot six years ago, he had trailed Matthew Wolff by two strokes ahead of the final round before tearing away from his compatriot down the stretch. DeChambeau said Saturday he was aiming to play \u201cboring golf\u201d to get over the line, and looked to be delivering on his plan as he made a steady \u2013 albeit unspectacular \u2013 start with six pars and a bogey through the opening seven holes. Yet that strategy, and his nerve, soon came under enormous scrutiny. Unlike Wolff four years ago, McIlroy was showing no signs of fading. Far from it \u2013 he was catching fire. The steely-eyed Northern Irishman was making a mockery of the firm and fast greens that had humbled so much of the field across the week. After two birdies from beyond 20 feet, McIlroy lasered in his fourth in a five-hole stretch at the 13th. With DeChambeau bogeying the 12th, McIlroy headed to the next tee box with a two stroke cushion. The picture had changed entirely in less than 20 minutes, yet it took the same amount of time for it to reset as DeChambeau capitalized on a bogey from his rival to draw level just two holes later. It set up a climax that would serve as the ultimate test of nerve and DeChambeau blinked first, a birdie opportunity turning into a bogey as his four-foot par putt lipped out of the 15th cup. Incredibly though, McIlroy would mirror the error from even closer range mere moments later to surrender his lead and set in motion a meltdown to rival his infamous collapse at the Masters in 2011. Yet the minor consolation of that spiral at Augusta National was that victory had all but vanished shortly after he made the turn. This time, the nightmare ran on till to the last two-and-a-half feet, as a simple conversion for par at the 18th green would have forced DeChambeau to birdie to avoid a playoff. There was a glimmer of hope as DeChambeau went from a hook into the native area to a bunker, but the American recovered superbly with a stunning 55-yard approach to within four feet of the cup. Watching anxiously on a clubhouse TV, McIlroy could only watch as DeChambeau safely avoided making the same mistake he did.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/sport/bryson-dechambeau-us-open-win-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_16_europe_american-tourist-dead-greece-island-intl-latam", "text": "A missing American tourist has been found dead on a beach on a small Greek island west of Corfu, local media reported. The body of the man was found Sunday on a rocky, fairly remote beach on the island of Mathraki by another tourist. He had been reported missing Thursday by his host, a Greek-American friend. The tourist had last been seen Tuesday at a cafe in the company of two female tourists who have since left the island. No further details about the victim, including a name or hometown, were immediately available. Mathraki, which has a population of 100, is a 3.9-square-kilometer (1.2-square-mile) heavily wooded island, west of the better-known island of Corfu. This was the latest in a string of recent cases in which tourists on the Greek islands have died or gone missing. Some, if not all, had set out on hikes in very hot temperatures. A 74-year-old\u00a0Dutch tourist\u00a0was found by a fire department drone on Saturday lying face down in a ravine about 300 meters (330 yards) from the spot where he was last observed last Sunday, walking with some difficulty in the blistering heat. Dr.\u00a0Michael Mosley, a noted British television presenter and author, was found dead last Sunday on the island of Symi. A coroner concluded that he had died the previous Wednesday, shortly after going for a hike over difficult, rocky terrain. On Friday, two French tourists were reported missing on Sikinos, a relatively secluded Cyclades island in the Aegean Sea, with less than 400 permanent residents. The two women, ages 64 and 73, had left their respective hotels to meet. On the island of Amorgos, also in the Cyclades, authorities are still searching for a 59-year-old tourist reported missing since Tuesday, when he had gone on a solo hike in very hot conditions. US media identified the missing tourist as retired Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Albert Calibet of Hermosa Beach, California.

The prisoner swap was mediated by Oman, the country\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. \u201cOmani efforts resulted in the two sides agreeing on a mutual release, as those released were transferred from Tehran and Stockholm,\u201d it said. Sweden had freed convicted former Iranian official Hamid Noury, Iran\u2019s top human rights official said on X. Noury, who had been convicted for his part in a mass execution of political prisoners in Iran in 1988, would be back in Iran in a few hours, the official added. Separately, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said in a statement that Swedish citizens Johan Floderus and Saeed Azizi who had been detained in Iran were on a plane back to Sweden. \u201cIran used them both as pawns in a cynical negotiations game with the purpose of getting the Iranian citizen Hamid Noury released from prison in Sweden. He is convicted of serious crimes committed in Iran in the 1980s,\u201d Kristersson said. \u201cAs prime minister I have a special responsibility for Swedish citizens\u2019 safety. The government has therefore worked intensively on the issue, together with the Swedish security services which have negotiated with Iran.\u201d Kristersson confirmed in a video released by the government that Noury was now being transported back to Iran. Kristersson declined to give further details around the considerations, citing security concerns. Noury, 63, was arrested at a Stockholm airport in 2019 and later sentenced to life in prison for war crimes for the mass execution and torture of political prisoners at the Gohardasht prison in Karaj, Iran, in 1988. He denied the charges. The National Council of Resistance of Iran, a coalition of groups opposed to Iran\u2019s Islamic Republic government, said it appeared Sweden had yielded to blackmail and hostage-taking tactics in a move that would encourage Tehran. Floderus, a European Union employee, was arrested in Iran in 2022 and charged with spying for Israel and \u201ccorruption on earth,\u201d a crime that carries the death penalty. Swedish-Iranian dual national Saeed Azizi was arrested in Iran in November 2023 on what Sweden called \u201cwrongful grounds.\u201d Another Swedish-Iranian dual national, Ahmadreza Djalali, arrested in 2016, remains in an Iranian jail.

Catherine, who revealed in March she has been diagnosed with cancer, said in a new statement on Friday that she has experienced \u201cgood days and bad days\u201d while undergoing chemotherapy, and expects her treatment to continue \u201cfor a few more months.\u201d But she is expected to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony with the royal family on Saturday at Trooping the Colour, King Charles III\u2019s birthday parade, and Kensington Palace have released a new photo of the Princess taken earlier this week in Windsor. \u201cI am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days,\u201d the Princess, who is often known as Kate, said in a personal message released on Friday. \u201cOn those bad days you feel weak, tired and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.\u201d \u201cMy treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months,\u201d Kate wrote. \u201cOn the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home.\u201d She said she is hoping to join some more engagements over the summer, but acknowledged she is \u201cnot out of the woods yet.\u201d King Charles III is \u201cdelighted\u201d to hear that Kate will be attending royal events on Saturday, according to a Buckingham Palace spokesperson Friday. \u201cHis Majesty is delighted that The Princess is able to attend tomorrow\u2019s events, and is much looking forward to all elements of the day,\u201d the spokesperson said. Kate will travel down the Mall in a carriage during Saturday\u2019s Trooping the Colour, accompanied by her children. She will watch the rest of the parade with her family nearby, and is expected to join fellow royals on the balcony. It represents a significant moment in the Princess\u2019s recovery, marking her first public appearance since Christmas Day \u2013 weeks before her cancer diagnosis. But it does not represent a return to public duties, and throughout her recovery, any appearances will be taken alongside medical guidance and will be subject to change if required. \u201cI have been blown away by all the kind messages of support and encouragement over the last couple of months,\u201d Kate wrote. \u201cIt really has made the world of difference to William and me and has helped us both through some of the harder times.\u201d \u201cI am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much needed time to heal.\u201d Kate first stepped away from public duties in January, following what Kensington Palace said at the time was surgery for a non-cancerous abdominal condition. In March, amid speculation about her wellbeing, she revealed in a video message that she had been diagnosed with cancer after the operation. \u201cMy medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy,\u201d she said in that update, adding she was in the early stages of that treatment. The Princess\u2019s cancer diagnosis stunned the country, especially as it came so soon after Charles announced that he had also been diagnosed with cancer. Neither royal has specified the type of cancer they are receiving treatment for, or revealed details about their progress. Charles said in March he was \u201cso proud\u201d of Catherine, his daughter-in-law, for \u201cher courage in speaking as she did\u201d in sharing her diagnosis. Kate has not appeared in public or taken on any formal duties since her announcement, but her husband Prince William has returned to his roles. He recently traveled to France for the events marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day, alongside his father King Charles III.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/uk/catherine-princess-of-wales-cancer-update-appearance-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_16_style_new-chinese-style-gen-z-intl-hnk", "text": "What\u2019s old is new again. This time it\u2019s a centuries-old skirt design that\u2019s proving popular in China. The \u201cmamianqun\u201d or \u201chorse face skirt\u201d is being worn in cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu as young people in China are giving the attire a modern twist, with unconventional pairings and choice of fabrics. While once the sole purview of \u201chanfu\u201d enthusiasts (a renaissance of the ancient clothing traditionally worn by ethnic-majority Han Chinese before the Qing dynasty) and reserved for special occasions, the pleated often brocade skirts have become a part of everyday wear. The popularity of the skirt has been wrapped into a broader trend being dubbed \u201cxinzhongshi,\u201d or \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d \u2014 which merges all manner of contemporary design with traditional Chinese aesthetics, applied to everything from clothing to furniture. While the idea isn\u2019t new, and was once considered old-fashioned, the wide-ranging term is being used as a marketing tool on China\u2019s lucrative e-commerce platforms, with retailers quick to turn Gen Z\u2019s patriotic, and at times, nationalistic sentiments, for profit. On Chinese social media platforms Weibo and Xiaohongshu, searches for \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d and \u201cnew Chinese style outfits\u201d hashtags exceeded 100 million in early April, according to state news agency Xinhua. Besides fashion, the posts show everything from stuffed leather armchairs with the curves of traditional Chinese wood furniture to mobile phone wallpapers of landscape paintings. The state-backed China National Textile and Apparel Council estimates the market size of \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d clothing reached 1 billion yuan (nearly 138 million dollars) in 2023. On Xiaohongshu, a 33-year-old user, who goes by the handle Momo and didn\u2019t give her real name for privacy reasons, frequently gives tips on how to style Chinese clothing. In one post, she demonstrated how you can top an oversized pink sweatshirt with a black mamianqun, pairing it with a matching baseball cap and sneakers. \u201cMore and more young people are willing to use traditional culture as a new way to express their attitudes. That\u2019s a good thing and very cool,\u201d she told CNN in a text message. It\u2019s mostly young people following the trend, agrees Huang Weizhe, a 32-year-old designer and manager of local fashion brand Longfuji. On social media, Huang shares ways to dress in \u201cnew Chinese style,\u201d and in one post wears a loose silk shirt with jeans. \u201cThere is no set rule in the \u2018new Chinese style\u2019 (trend) that you must follow, so it is more inclusive. This is the style that young people like now,\u201d he told CNN over the phone. Riding the \u2018new\u2019 Chinese style wave Fashion designers like Samuel Gui Yang, whose collections have long taken inspiration from Chinese heritage, are seeing more interest from mainland China turn to their brands due to the \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d trend. But unlike the mamianqun, which is a literal nod to the past \u2013 and being mass produced \u2013 his 9-year-old brand has been about bridging the gap \u201cbetween Shanghai and London\u201d and drawing from the rich tapestry of what it means to be Chinese, in China and abroad. \u201cI think my wider audience (is) really a fan of\u2026the way we bring in this \u2018Chineseness\u2019 (the) heritage details in a more subtle way,\u201d he said in a phone interview. For Yang, the aesthetics and themes of Taiwanese filmmaker Ang Lee\u2019s 1994 movie \u201cEat Drink Man Woman\u201d represent his idea of what \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d should be. The film about the lives of a master chef and his three daughters navigating the tensions between modernity and traditions, personal freedom and family. Yang said, \u201csubtly reflects the lifestyle of Chinese people, especially the direct connection between a dinner table and interpersonal relationships.\u201d The film, he added, \u201cprovides us with a lot of inspiration for our design journey,\u201d and that he always draws from the \u201c80s and 90s Asian dressing style.\u201d There\u2019s the Lee denim jacket inspired by Hong Kong martial arts and film star Bruce Lee and the Ailing dress, named after Shanghai-born American novelist Eileen Chang. At Shanghai Fashion Week this March, he showcased a long-sleeved bias cut qipao with roll-up sleeves (pictured top), giving the classic silhouette a fresh update. For Ian Hylton, designer and decades-long China resident, \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d is a misnomer. His eponymous menswear label draws heavily on Chinese dress styles and design motifs \u2013 think elegant loose silk mandarin collar shirts, Tang puffer jackets and cashmere coats with button knots. \u201cI\u2019m kind of not a fan of this term \u2018new Chinese style,\u2019 because to me that\u2019s like saying new French clothes, new Italian clothes,\u201d Hylton told CNN over the phone. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new. There\u2019s a new way to approach it, but it\u2019s somehow being treated like a trend, like short or long skirts. They\u2019re part of a culture, they\u2019re the fabric and makeup of a culture.\u201d Hylton\u2019s wife, Min Liu, launched her own Chinese-aesthetics inspired label Ms. Min in 2010, a reaction, he said, to the fact that most people in the country weren\u2019t wearing Chinese clothes. Hylton is the company\u2019s president. \u201cWhen I arrived in China\u2026there was not a billboard, there was not an advertisement, there was not an anything that featured a Chinese person,\u201d said Hylton, who moved to China in 2005 as the creative director of luxury fashion label Ports 1961. \u201cEverything was a foreign face\u2026everything that was foreign was good and everything that was local was disrespected.\u201d The tides he believes have turned in the last decade or so with young Chinese becoming more aware and confident of their place in the world, and embracing China\u2019s culture and history. Domestic fashion labels also saw a boost during the pandemic, as strict travel restrictions prevented mainland Chinese from buying luxury goods abroad. Meanwhile Momo, the Xiaohongshu user, said the popularity of \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d has been down to \u201cserious commercialization,\u201d which she doesn\u2019t necessarily buy into. Douyin, China\u2019s TikTok released a report in March showing a 841% increase in the sale of the mamianqun skirts that typically retail for around 200 yuan (roughly US$28), on its e-commerce platform compared to the year before. State broadcaster CCTV reported that Cao county in Shandong province, which it said accounts for around half of the country\u2019s mamianqun production, sold 550 million yuan (almost $76 million) worth of skirts in the first two months of the year, a surge attributed to the run-up of the Lunar New Year holiday. But some of the \u201cnew Chinese style\u201d products are \u201cshoddily made\u201d she said, though she thinks that their designs will improve with time. Regardless of trends, Momo said she will continue to teach her 33,000 followers how to wear traditional clothing as much as possible \u2013 out and about, to study and to work. \u201cWhenever we wear \u2018new Chinese style\u2019 or hanfu and mamianqun, it\u2019s a way we can invite more people, including those around the world, to understand (our) culture.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/style/new-chinese-style-gen-z-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

Nikhil Gupta\u00a0has been accused\u00a0by U.S. federal prosecutors of plotting with an Indian government official to kill\u00a0Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a U.S. resident who advocated for a sovereign Sikh state in northern India. Gupta traveled to Prague from India last June and was arrested by Czech authorities. Last month, a Czech court rejected his petition to avoid being sent to the U.S., clearing the way for the Czech justice minister to extradite him. An inmate search by name on the Bureau of Prisons website showed on Sunday that Gupta, 52, is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, a federal administrative detention facility. A source familiar with the matter, who did not want to be identified, separately confirmed Gupta\u2019s extradition and his detention in Brooklyn. A U.S. Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. Gupta\u2019s U.S.-based lawyer, attorney Jeffrey Chabrowe, had no immediate comment. There was also no immediate comment from Czech authorities. The discovery\u00a0of assassination plots against Sikh separatists\u00a0in the U.S. and Canada has tested relations with India, seen by Western nations as a counter to China\u2019s rising global influence. India\u2019s government denies involvement in the plots. Canada said\u00a0in September\u00a0its intelligence agencies were pursuing allegations linking India\u2019s government to the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023 in Canada. In November, U.S. authorities said an Indian government official had directed the plot in the attempted murder of Pannun, who is a U.S. and Canadian citizen. Gupta is accused of involvement in that plot. Pannun told Reuters on Sunday that while the extradition was a welcome step, \u201cNikhil Gupta is just a foot soldier.\u201d He alleged that those who hired Gupta were senior members of the Indian government who act on the direction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India\u2019s government has\u00a0dissociated itself\u00a0from the plot against Pannun, saying it was against government policy. It has said it would formally investigate security concerns raised by Washington. New Delhi has\u00a0long complained\u00a0about Sikh separatist groups outside India, viewing them as security threats. The groups have kept alive the movement for\u00a0Khalistan, or the demand for an independent Sikh state to be carved out of India. Last month, Washington said it was satisfied so far with India\u2019s moves to ensure accountability in the alleged plots, but added that\u00a0many steps\u00a0still needed to be taken.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/world/indian-suspect-in-plot-to-kill-sikh-separatist-extradited-to-us/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_middleeast_netanyahu-disbands-israeli-war-cabinet-intl", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dissolved his war cabinet, an Israeli official told CNN Monday, just over a week after opposition leader Benny Gantz withdrew from the body. Decision-making will now move back to the government\u2019s main security cabinet, the Israeli official said, claiming Netanyahu \u201cwill hold smaller forums on sensitive matters.\u201d The war cabinet, set up five days after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks against Israel on October 7, had five members: Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, opposition leader Benny Gantz, and two \u201cobservers,\u201d Ron Dermer and Gadi Eisenkot. But Gantz \u2013 seen as Netanyahu\u2019s most formidable political opponent \u2013 announced his \u201ccomplex and painful\u201d decision to withdraw from the cabinet last week, citing Netanyahu\u2019s failure to devise a strategy for the conflict in Gaza and the future governance of the Strip. \u201cNetanyahu prevents us from moving forward to a real victory [in Gaza],\u201d Gantz said June 9. He accused Netanyahu of putting his own personal political considerations ahead of a post-war strategy for the Gaza Strip, claiming that \u201cfateful strategic decisions are met with hesitancy and procrastination due to political considerations,\u201d and urged the prime minister to hold an election in the coming months. \u201cI call on Netanyahu: set an agreed election date. Do not let our people be torn apart,\u201d Gantz said. In April, Gantz called\u00a0for early elections\u00a0to be held as soon as September, ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, saying \u201cIsraeli society needs to renew its contract with its leadership.\u201d The month before, he had traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with US Vice President Kamala Harris in a trip not sanctioned by the Israeli government. Gantz often surpasses the prime minister in popularity, according to opinion polls.\u00a0A survey published Friday\u00a0by the Israeli Maariv newspaper showed support for Gantz at 42%, compared to 34% for Netanyahu. Gantz\u2019s resignation sparked calls from far-right members in Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, to join the war cabinet. Both men were earlier pointedly excluded from the cabinet at Gantz\u2019s behest. By dismantling the cabinet, Netanyahu may have avoided having to accede to Ben-Gvir\u2019s calls to join the cabinet, which could have further strained Israel\u2019s relations with the United States, or having to reject his demands, which could have angered the more extreme wing of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. Another interpretation is that without Gantz \u2013 and Eisenkot who also resigned \u2013 in it, there was no longer any point in keeping the war cabinet going. Instead, an Israeli official tells CNN, Netanyahu will in future hold smaller forums to discuss sensitive matters relating to the war with Hamas. It\u2019s unclear whether Ben-Gvir will be excluded from these as well. As National Security Minister, Ben-Gvir attends Israel\u2019s security cabinet alongside 12 other ministers, including Smotrich, Gallant and Foreign Minister Israel Katz. Both Ben-Gvir and Smotrich have urged that Israel sustain its assault on Gaza until Hamas is defeated completely, and threatened to topple Netanyahu\u2019s government if he accepts a peace proposal that was first publicly announced by US President Joe Biden last month. After the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Saturday announced a daily \u201ctactical pause\u201d of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed, Ben-Gvir condemned the decision. \u201cWhoever decided on a \u2018tactical pause\u2019 for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,\u201d he said. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday the dissolution of the war cabinet did not change the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cfundamental assessment\u201d of the war in Gaza, saying \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to have very direct and candid conversations\u201d with \u201cwhatever government is in place.\u201d He added that the US \u201cvery much\u201d welcomed the announcement of the \u201ctactical pause\u201d \u2013 but said the US would judge Israel \u201cby the results.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of humanitarian pauses, it\u2019s to the question of how much aid gets delivered. The pause ultimately is only a means to an end,\u201d he said. Aid groups are saying that no difference has yet been seen on the ground.

{"id": "2024_06_17_asia_japan-record-spike-stss-bacterial-infection-intl-hnk", "text": "Cases of a dangerous and highly fatal bacterial infection have reached record levels in Japan, official figures show, with experts so far unable to pinpoint the reason for the rise. As of June 2, Japan\u2019s Health Ministry had recorded 977 cases of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), which has a mortality rate of up to 30%. Some 77 people have died from the infection between January and March, the latest figures available. The ongoing outbreak in Japan has already surpassed last year\u2019s previous record of 941 preliminary infections \u2013 the highest since statistics began in 1999.\u00a0Japan\u2019s National Institute of Infectious Diseases reported 97 deaths due to STSS last year, the second-highest number of fatalities in the past six years. STSS is a rare but serious bacterial infection that can develop when bacteria spread into deep tissues and the bloodstream.\u00a0Patients initially suffer from fever, muscle pain and vomiting but symptoms can quickly turn life threatening with low blood pressure, swelling, and multiple organ failure as the body goes into shock. \u201cEven with treatment, STSS can be deadly. Out of 10 people with STSS, as many as three people will die from the infection,\u201d according to the\u00a0US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most STSS cases are caused by the group A streptococcus (GAS) bacteria, which mainly produces fever and throat infections in children. In rare circumstances, strep A can become invasive when bacterium produces a toxin that enables it to gain access to the bloodstream, causing serious illnesses such as toxic shock. Strep A can also cause\u00a0\u201cflesh-eating\u201d necrotizing fasciitis, which can lead to loss of limbs. However, most patients who contract that disease have other health factors that may lower their body\u2019s ability to fight infections, such as cancer or diabetes, according to the CDC. Invasive group A strep infections were largely curbed by Covid-19 controls, such as masking and social distancing, but after those measures were relaxed many countries reported a rise in cases. In December 2022, five European countries reported to the World Health Organization an increase in invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS), with children under 10 the most impacted. The CDC said it was also investigating an apparent increase in the disease at the time. In March, Japanese authorities warned of a jump in STSS cases. Japan\u2019s National Institute of Infectious Diseases released a risk assessment saying the number of STSS cases caused by iGAS \u201chas increased since July 2023, especially among those under 50 years of age.\u201d The CDC says older people with an open wound are at increased risk of contracting STSS, including those who have recently had surgery. \u201cHowever, experts don\u2019t know how the bacteria got into the body for nearly half of people who get STSS,\u201d the CDC said on its website. The reason for this year\u2019s rise in cases of STSS in Japan remains unclear, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. Professor Ken Kikuchi, of Tokyo Women\u2019s Medical University, told NHK the rise could be due to people\u2019s weakened immune systems following Covid. \u201cWe can boost immunity if we are constantly exposed to bacteria. But that mechanism was absent during the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d Kikuchi said. \u201cSo, more people are now susceptible to infection, and that may be one reason for the sharp rise in cases.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/asia/japan-record-spike-stss-bacterial-infection-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

It will be run in coordination with international organizations, it said, as part of efforts to increase volumes of aid reaching Gaza. But soon after announcing the move, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said \u201cthe fighting in Rafah continues,\u201d adding \u201cthere is no change in the entry of goods into the Strip.\u201d The fierce fighting that been underway in Rafah as Israel seeks to destroy Hamas in Gaza continued on Sunday, with a civil defense official in Gaza telling CNN that heavy clashes are ongoing in neighborhoods of western Rafah. On Saturday, eight IDF soldiers were killed near the city, one of the single deadliest incidents of the war for Israeli troops.  The\u00a0director\u00a0of\u00a0UNRWA\u00a0affairs\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza, Scott Anderson, welcomed the \u201ctactical pause,\u201d telling CNN \u201cwe very much hope that this long pause every day will allow us to move freely back and forth.\u201d But a spokesperson for the UN Children\u2019s Fund warned the pause could not replace a ceasefire. \u201cI just don\u2019t know unfortunately [how long the pause will last], this is a question for the the occupying power, for Israel and its military,\u201d said James Elder. Meanwhile, criticisms of the \u201ctactical pause\u201d by senior Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have raised the question of who ordered it. According to an Israeli official, Netanyahu was unhappy when he first heard about it. Netanyahu then contacted his military secretary and said the idea was unacceptable until he was assured the fighting in Rafah would continue, said the official who spoke to CNN on Sunday and requested anonymity. Israel\u2019s security minister Ben Gvir \u2013 a leading right-wing member of the cabinet \u2013 has also condemned the pause. \u201cWhoever decided on a \u2018tactical pause\u2019 for the purpose of a humanitarian transition, especially at a time when the best of our soldiers are falling in battle, is evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position,\u201d he said. Humanitarian crisis The distribution of aid announced by Israel comes as Muslims in Gaza are marking Eid al-Adha with little food. Eid ul-Adha begins on Sunday evening and ends on Thursday, June 20. Human rights groups have described \u201cunspeakable\u201d living conditions for Palestinians in Gaza following eight months of Israeli bombardment, with over 75% of the population displaced,\u00a0according\u00a0to the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). Israel\u2019s military campaign has pulverized neighborhoods, damaged health infrastructure and depleted food, water and fuel supplies. More than 37,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, according to figures from the Ministry of Health in Gaza. The conflict in the enclave began following the October 7 attacks led by the Palestinian militant group Hamas that killed around 1,200 people and captured 250 hostages in southern Israel. More than 50,000 children in Gaza now require treatment for acute malnutrition, UNRWA said in a post on X on Saturday. \u201cWith continued restrictions to humanitarian access, people in #Gaza continue to face desperate levels of hunger. Over 50,000 children require treatment for acute malnutrition.\u201d Last month, Israel pressed ahead with its ground operation in central Rafah,\u00a0which led hundreds of thousands of already displaced people to leave the area. Internally displaced Palestinians are estimated to be crammed into an area of 69 square kilometers\u00a0(27 square miles) \u2013 less than a fifth of the territory\u2019s area. Aid has been delivered to Gaza by land, sea and air since soon after the war began, but few entry points remain operational. Those are Kerem Shalom on Gaza\u2019s southern border and Western Erez in the north. Humanitarian agencies say that land routes are the quickest and most effective way of getting aid into Gaza at scale. But even when aid crosses into Gaza there are multiple issues with distributing it throughout Gaza, because convoys require Israeli approval, many roads are severely damaged and security is frequently challenging. Efforts to bring aid via sea have stuttered after the US military said Friday it would temporarily dismantle the\u00a0humanitarian pier it constructed off the coast of Gaza\u00a0due to heavy seas. It will be the second time in a matter of weeks that the\u00a0fragile\u00a0pier and causeway system, known as Joint Logistics over the Shore or JLOTS, has had to be moved back to the Israeli port of\u00a0Ashdod.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/16/middleeast/israel-tactical-pause-gaza-aid-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "washington-earthquake-tsunami-violent-earth", "text": "A catastrophic earthquake and tsunami are inevitable for the coast of the Pacific Northwest, scientists say. Planning for that means imagining a disaster unlike anything that\u2019s ever hit the modern United States. \u201c30 or 40 years ago, we didn\u2019t even know that big earthquakes were possible in the Pacific Northwest,\u201d said Diego Melgar, a seismologist at the University of Oregon. Scientists now know the 700-mile fault called the Cascadia Subduction Zone, 100 miles off the coast of Northern California stretching north to Vancouver Island, could trigger a 9.0 magnitude earthquake followed by a tsunami, which is exactly what happened in Japan 2011. New in-depth imagery of the fault was recently reported in \u201cScience Advances.\u201d Scientists say it confirmed the subduction zone is cut into 3 to 5 segments, each with its own unique geology. When the segment of the fault off Washington\u2019s coast ruptures, it has the greatest potential of triggering a devastating earthquake. No one is ready for this. Nothing built prior to 2005 was designed to withstand the long, strong earthquake Cascadia will produce, according to Corina Allen\ufeff, the chief hazards geologist at the  Washington Geological Survey. And tsunami building codes only went into effect in 2016. \u201cWe have bridges, buildings, hospitals, schools, all of this infrastructure that is located in places where a tsunami could go,\u201d Allen said. Can these facilities survive an earthquake and tsunami that will follow? \u201cThe answer is no.\u201d \u201cWhat keeps me up at night is that I know that we\u2019re not taking the steps that we need to, as fast as we should be, to protect our people,\u201d said Yumei Wang, a senior adviser of infrastructure and risk at Portland State University.  Brick and masonry buildings are the most vulnerable in earthquakes. And Wang says wood frame buildings are particularly vulnerable to tsunami forces. \u201cYou can just imagine water pushing over a typical house,\u201d she adds. The geological record of the region indicates on average, these mega earthquake and tsunami events happen every 500 years. There is no way to predict when one will happen next, but it\u2019s expected to happen again within the next 200 years \u2013 or less It will be a long process and cost billions of dollars to retrofit existing communities, Allen said. Melgar believes the effort is well worth it. \u201cMy children might not see dividends, my grandchildren might not see dividends. We\u2019re playing a really long game if we\u2019re doing it right.\u201d. For those who live and vacation along the coastal Pacific Northwest, surviving a tsunami that comes 15 to 30 minutes after an earthquake depends on how quickly they can reach high ground. But there may be no safe place to go. \u201cIn Washington, most people who actually live in the tsunami inundation zone don\u2019t have any high ground nearby,\u201d Allen said. In that case, vertical evacuation structures built within the tsunami zone are vital. These structures helped save thousands of lives in the 2011 tsunami in Japan. Only three have been built in the Pacific Northwest, and four more are planned. But Allen estimates that 50 are needed in Washington alone. Each of the three existing structures could hold 400 to 1,000 people, reach up to 76 feet tall and vary in cost.\u00a0The most expensive, at $62 million, is the Marine Sciences Center in Oregon, Wang said.  \u201cThe foundation is deeper than the building is tall, like an iceberg. And the structure itself is a little bit like a car bumper, so that very heavy, big debris can hit it.\u201d \u201cWe know enough about building codes. We know enough about early warning. We know enough about tsunami evacuation zones that it need not be that bad,\u201d says Melgar. What is less clear is whether people are willing to invest billions of dollars to prepare for something that may not happen for 200 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a costly problem to solve,\u201d says Allen. \u201cMaybe we do have more time and we\u2019re able to put the systems in place that we need to survive this event.\u201d The problem is, nobody knows how much time remains.", "source": "http://cnn.com/washington-earthquake-tsunami-violent-earth/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a news briefing Tuesday, the South Korean military\u00a0appeared to downplay the significance of the gunfire, saying the North Korean soldiers quickly retreated and\u00a0did not appear to have the intention of invading the southern side, based on information that cannot be made public. \u201cThere were no unusual movements other than the North Korean army immediately moving north after our warning shots,\u201d said Col.

Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, late Sunday warned the resumption of loudspeaker broadcasts was \u201ca prelude to a very dangerous situation\u201d and that South Korea would be subject to an unspecified \u201cnew counteraction\u201d from the North if it continued with the action.

There are many factors to consider, with cost undoubtedly high on the list. But which international city is the most expensive in the world for expats to move to? Hong Kong has once again taken the title of most costly city for overseas workers in the 2024 Mercer Cost of Living Survey, which was released Monday. The Asian city, which also topped the annual list in 2022 and 2023, was closely followed by Singapore, in second place. Much of the rest of the top 10 was taken up by Swiss cities, with Zurich, Geneva, Basel and Bern coming in third, fourth, fifth and sixth place respectively. Rising housing costs The report examined 226 cities based on the comparative cost of over 200 items in each location, including transportation, food, clothing, household goods and entertainment. New York was the highest US city, taking seventh place, while UK capital London, which was in\u00a017th place last year, jumped to eighth place. Nassau, The Bahamas took ninth place, with Los Angeles rounding out the top 10. According to the report, expensive housing markets and increased costs for transportation, goods and services are among the reasons why the cost of living in the top ranking cities is particularly high. \u201cThe cost of housing is a major factor in the Cost of Living City Ranking,\u201d reads the study, pointing out that employees who spend a significant slice of their income on rent or mortgages will have \u201cless disposable income for other expenses.\u201d \u201cBetween 2023 and 2024, there was a lot of volatility in this cost around the world, with housing rental prices varying significantly between cities.\u201d Additionally, \u201cinflation and exchange-rate fluctuations\u201d were noted to have directly impacted the \u201cpay and savings\u201d of international workers. At 92, Toronto was ranked as the most expensive city in Canada for international employees, followed by Vancouver at 101. Financial impacts While the top of the list changed little from the previous year\u2019s rankings, there were some considerably big jumps further down. Among them were Mexico\u2019s Mexico City and Monterrey, with the former moving up 46 places to number 33, and the latter climbing 40 places to 115. The study also noted that the cost of living in the US was \u201ca significant issue\u201d for 2024, with seven US cities appearing in the top 20. \u201cAs US-based companies continue to source talent globally, inflationary pressures may give some inbound foreign nationals pause to accept a position in some of the high-cost cities and metro areas in the US,\u201d says Vince Cordova, partner and mobility advisory leader at Mercer US. \u201cTherefore, we believe employers should be open about sharing the cost of living and net pay information with prospective staff so they can better understand the financial impacts of relocating to the US, and make a fully informed decision on whether or not to move ahead.\u201d The cities that ranked the lowest for living costs were Pakistan\u2019s Islamabad and Nigeria\u2019s Lagos and Abuja. However, this was said to be partly driven by \u201ccurrency depreciations.\u201d The price of a dozen large eggs, a liter of olive oil and an espresso coffee at a popular caf\u00e9 were among the 200 products taken into consideration when determining the rankings for the cost of living in each of the cities. According to the study, the price of olive oil was the most notable hike on average. \u201cCost-of-living challenges have had a significant impact on multinational organizations and their employees,\u201d\u00a0Yvonne Traber, Mercer\u2019s global mobility leader, said in a statement. \u201cIt is important for organizations to stay informed about cost-of-living trends and inflation rates and seek input from employees on these issues to effectively manage their effects.\u201d 2024 cost of living city ranking 1.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/18/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia in the Rostov region said the detainees were \u201celiminated\u201d and the\u00a0employees\u00a0who were\u00a0held\u00a0were released without any injury, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Earlier, Russian state news agency TASS reported that some of the detainees involved were being\u00a0held in pre-trial detention for cases of terrorist crimes and have links to the Islamic State, Russian state news agency TASS reported.

In one video, one man wearing the pro-Islamic Jihad logo on his forehead says the group are Islamic State. CNN cannot independently verify the videos. No group has claimed responsibility for the incident. Some anti-government bloggers have since expressed concerns that Russian operatives may have orchestrated the incident.

The\u00a0two\u00a0employees, an operational officer and an inspector-supervisor, were taken Sunday morning by the group of detainees who demanded transport in exchange for the\u00a0employees\u2019 release, TASS reported citing law enforcement.
