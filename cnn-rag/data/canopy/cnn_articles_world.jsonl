There are cryogenic chambers, touchless vibroacoustic therapy beds, and an MRI-like infrared capsule that looks clinical rather than calming. \u201cThe industry is evolving,\u201d says Desmond Cawley, hotel manager at SIRO, One Za\u2019abeel. It styles itself as Dubai\u2019s \u201cfirst fitness hotel,\u201d catering to professional athletes and their fitness-focused lifestyles, and was designed in consultation with AC Milan football club, Olympic swimmer Adam Peaty and boxer Ramla Ali. Its 2,000-square-foot gym is packed with state-of-the-art equipment that can track and analyze performance, smart scales and body composition analysis tools, and an app that helps guests customize their stay, from nutrition to training. Meanwhile, rooms feature alarm clocks linked to the guest\u2019s circadian rhythms, and anti-gravity rocking chairs; and in the recovery lab, treatments are less about relaxation and more about muscle recovery. \u201cAn example of that is the cryotherapy: great for (reducing) inflammation and kickstarting your metabolism,\u201d says Cawley, adding that people generally need to have experience with ice baths before trying the cryo-chamber, which is cooled to a crisp minus 85\u00b0C (minus 121 Fahrenheit). Another \u201ccool piece of space-age technology\u201d is the MLX i3Dome, which uses \u201cfar infrared technology for muscle soreness,\u201d says Cawley. This kind of light therapy treatment has its roots in NASA\u2019s experimentation with red light therapy in the 1990s to boost plant growth in space and help heal wounds in astronauts. Since then, it\u2019s been explored for a range of uses, including most recently, skincare. While the \u201cdome\u201d acts as a sauna, a light therapy helmet provides a touchless facial, using red light for collagen production, green light for an antibacterial cleanse, and blue light for \u201cproblem skin\u201d such as eczema, psoriasis, or acne. These are specialized therapies, rarely found outside of boutique clinics \u2014 and certainly not in most hotels, which even in the five-star category, have often treated fitness and health as an \u201cafterthought,\u201d says Cawley. But wellness is now a global, multi-trillion-dollar industry that brands like SIRO (and its parent company Kerzner International) are integrating into the foundations of their hospitality concept. Its Dubai location is just the beginning: SIRO, Boka Place in Montenegro will open later this year, and three more locations are already in the works. \u201cEveryone has a unique physiology, different wellness goals, aspirations,\u201d says Cawley. \u201cEverything (we do) is about optimizing performance, mitigating recovery times to get the individual back to doing what they love, whether that\u2019s on the football pitch, on the tennis court, or the gym.\u201d From \u2018Goopy\u2019 wellness to billionaire biohacking This tech-centric version of wellness is a marked departure from the \u201cGoopy decade\u201d of yoga, crystals and green juice detoxes, says Beth McGroarty, research director at the Global Wellness Institute. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s been popularized by the billionaire tech bros who are chasing, in some cases, $2-million-a-year regimes to try to fight death,\u201d says McGroarty of the \u201csuper medical, very high-tech, very complex\u201d hard care trend that is emerging. Known as \u201cbiohacking,\u201d the trend includes longevity clinics and weight loss drugs like Ozempic as people try to lower their biological age. One factor driving this trend is the pandemic: not only did it necessitate the need for \u201ctouchless\u201d treatments, it also drove a desire for more scientific health solutions, says McGroarty. But high-tech doesn\u2019t always equal scientific. \u201cSome of it feels quasi-scientific,\u201d McGroarty says, pointing to nutrient-boost IV drips, which have very little evidence to support their efficacy outside of a doctor-prescribed, hospital setting. \u201cSometimes I think there\u2019s a little bit of science-washing going on,\u201d she adds. SIRO isn\u2019t alone in targeting athletic travelers with high-tech therapies: fitness club group Equinox launched its high-tech flagship hotel in New York City in 2019, and is planning to open 33 properties over the next decade. Established medical-wellness retreats SHA Wellness and Clinique La Prairie are both expanding beyond their European flagships, with the latter opening an \u201curban longevity hub\u201d at One&Only One Za\u2019abeel, just a few floors above SIRO in Dubai. And at home, people might not be using cryogenic chambers every night, but data-led wellness is fast becoming the norm. Most smartwatches are now capable of gathering medical-grade information about your heart rate, sleep patterns, and blood oxygen, and these wearables \u201care only going to keep getting more sophisticated\u201d and sleeker, like the Oura ring, a discreet tracker that looks like jewelry, says McGroarty. With the increased accessibility of generative artificial intelligence, McGroarty sees even more potential for smart diagnostics \u2014 but adds that there\u2019s a need to create boundaries and evaluate where it\u2019s useful. \u201cWe underestimate the stress and anxiety of being constantly connected \u2014 to work, to news, to bad information, to social media,\u201d she adds. Hard care vs. \u2018radical simplicity\u2019 But not everyone is on board with this high-tech approach to wellness. While \u201chard care\u201d has been a growing space in wellness, so has \u201csoft care.\u201d In a rejection of the past decade of ultra-optimized, super-commodified wellness routines, McGroarty sees more people \u2014 specifically Gen-Z and Millennial women \u2014 adopting \u201csuper lo-fi, low-key wellness,\u201d that prioritizes social experiences and emotional well-being, such as \u201cbed rotting\u201d and \u201chot girl walks.\u201d \u201cPeople are maxed out spending on wellness and they want radical simplicity,\u201d she adds. Even at SIRO, with all its cutting-edge tech, Cawley has observed a surge of interest in mindfulness activities like meditation. \u201cHistorically, on group exercise timetables, there was a lot more strength or cardiovascular conditioning classes. Now you see more mindfulness classes, like yoga and sound healing,\u201d he says. Of course, at SIRO, there\u2019s even a high-tech alternative to this: \u201cvibroacoustic therapy,\u201d the sci-fi equivalent of a gong bath. Lying on a massage table with a waterbed in the center, guests wear noise-canceling headphones and listen to the carefully orchestrated sounds of waves crashing against a backdrop of hypnotic synth music. The waterbed vibrates with the sound, supposedly releasing stress in the body, and SIRO says it\u2019s designed for those experiencing sleep problems, stress, depression or anxiety. Tech to help you disconnect might seem excessive, but for SIRO, the integration of health data is the future of wellness, providing guests with a data-driven, personalized wellness program. \u201cWe want to utilize technology as an enabler, as opposed to a distraction,\u201d says Cawley.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/siro-one-zaabeel-dubai-hotel-wellness-tech-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_sport_slovakia-ukraine-poland-austria-france-netherlands-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 was an unused substitute in France\u2019s goalless draw against the Netherlands on Friday, after the striker broke his nose in his nation\u2019s opening game of Euro 2024. There had been fears the France captain would miss the Group D clash, but manager Didier Deschamps told reporters Thursday that his star man would be available. However, the decision was made to rest Mbapp\u00e9, who watched on as his teammates failed to find a breakthrough against the Oranje. In truth, Les Bleus almost lost the match. Xavi Simons thought he had scored the winner for the Netherlands in the second half, but the goal was controversially ruled out for an offside. Simons himself was clearly onside but teammate Denzel Dumfries was in an offside position and was adjudged by the video assistant referee (VAR) to have hindered France goalkeeper Mike Maignan. Without its star striker, France struggled to finish off its chances and continued to be wasteful in front of goal throughout the match \u2013 Adrien Rabiot and Antoine Griezmann were guilty of missing two notable opportunities. However, the draw is likely enough to secure France\u2019s progression into the knockout stages. Les Bleus will have the chance to win the group when they play Poland on Tuesday. The final group stage game will be another opportunity for Mbapp\u00e9 to make his return; the 25-year-old had trained earlier this week, donning a French-inspired tricolore mask. However, Mbapp\u00e9 is not allowed to wear the multicolored mask during a Euro 2024 match as UEFA\u2019s rules stipulate that \u201cmedical equipment worn on the field of play must be a single colour and free of team and manufacturer identification.\u201d Group E: Ukraine secures comeback win Ukraine, playing in its first major tournament since the war began in 2022, produced a stirring performance at Euro 2024 on Friday, securing a comeback 2-1 win against Slovakia in Group E. Goals from Mykola Shaparenko and Roman Yaremchuk rescued what would have been a devastating result for the Blue and Yellow \u2013 a loss would have put the nation on the brink of elimination from the tournament. Ukraine suffered a chastening defeat in its opening group game on Monday, producing a dour display in a 3-0 defeat against Romania. Its performance was far better against Slovakia, but the team was still second-best for much of the first half, falling behind in the 17th minute after Ivan Schranz\u2019s header. But Ukraine looked rejuvenated after the break and came out for the second half with a new sense of belief. Shaparenko kept his calm to finish off a well-worked move in the 54th minute, before Yaremchuk poked home the winner with 10 minutes left to go. Coming into the tournament, Ukraine\u2019s manager Serhiy Rebrov told CNN Sport that he wanted his team to lift the spirits of Ukrainians around the world during Euro 2024. In doing just that on Friday, Ukraine also reignited its hopes of progressing into the knockout stages of the competition \u2013 the squad now sits second in Group E with one group match still left to play against Belgium on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s very good emotions for our people of Ukraine who are really missing these emotions,\u201d Rebrov said in his post-match interview on Friday. \u201cMost important, today, we showed the spirit. In this kind of tournament, you can win, you can lose, but it\u2019s very important how you do it. \u201cWe deserve this win and I think today we really played with spirit.\u201d Group D: Poland out of Euro 2024 Earlier on Friday, Austria beat Poland 3-1 in Group D, a result which later meant the latter would exit Euro 2024. Gernot Trauner scored a brilliant header in the ninth minute to put the Burschen ahead, but Poland equalized before half-time through Krzysztof Pi\u0105tek. A draw would have left both teams facing an uphill challenge to reach the knockout stages of the tournament, so each squad went in search of a winner. It was Austria which showed most composure in front of goal and Christoph Baumgartner produced a clinical finish to hand his team the lead, before captain Marko Arnautovi\u0107 added a third from the penalty spot. France\u2019s draw against the Netherlands late on Friday meant Poland became the first team to exit the tournament.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/sport/slovakia-ukraine-poland-austria-france-netherlands-euro-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_asia_philippines-footage-south-china-sea-clash-china-intl-hnk", "text": "The Philippines has accused China\u2019s Coast Guard of launching a \u201cbrutal assault\u201d with bladed weapons during a South China Sea clash earlier this week, a major escalation in a festering dispute that threatens to drag the United States into another global conflict. Footage released by the Philippine military on Thursday showed Chinese coast guard officers brandishing an axe and other bladed or pointed tools at the Filipino soldiers and slashing their rubber boat, in what Manila called \u201ca brazen act of aggression.\u201d The Philippines and China have blamed each other for the confrontation near the Second Thomas Shoal in the contested\u00a0Spratly Islands on Monday, which took place during a Philippine mission to resupply its soldiers stationed on a beached World War II-era warship that asserts Manila\u2019s territorial claims over the atoll. The incident is the latest in a series of increasingly fraught confrontations\u00a0in the resource-rich and strategically important waterway. But the scenes captured in the latest footage mark an inflection point in the long-simmering tensions, with China adopting new, far more openly aggressive tactics that, analysts say, appear calculated to test how the Philippines and its key defense ally \u2013 the United States \u2013 will respond. China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims. Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore,\u00a0said it was unprecedented for China\u2019s maritime law enforcement to board a Philippine naval vessel. \u201cThey can be rubber boats, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that they are Philippine Navy vessels, and according to international law, they enjoy what we term as sovereign immunity,\u201d Koh said. \u201cThat is very dangerous, because, if anything, that could even be construed as an act of war.\u201d Boats \u2018looted\u2019 At a news conference on Wednesday, senior Philippine military officials said China\u2019s Coast Guard officers \u201cillegally boarded\u201d the Philippine rubber boats, \u201clooted\u201d seven disassembled rifles stored in gun cases, \u201cdestroyed\u201d outboard motor, communication and navigation equipment and took the personal cellphones of Filipino personnel. \u201cThey deliberately punctured our rubber boats using knives and other pointed tools,\u201d said Alfonso Torres Jr., commander of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Western Command. A Philippine Navy serviceman on the rubber boat lost his right thumb when the Chinese Coast Guard rammed it, Torres said. China\u2019s Coast Guard also deployed tear gas, \u201cblinding\u201d strobe lights and continuously blared sirens, the AFP said. \u201cOnly pirates do this. Only pirates board, steal, and destroy ships, equipment, and belongings,\u201d Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said in a statement. \u201cThe Chinese Coast Guard personnel had bladed weapons and our personnel fought with bare hands. That is what\u2019s important. We were outnumbered and their weapons were unexpected but our personnel fought with everything that they had,\u201d Brawner added. At a regular briefing with reporters on Thursday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry was asked to comment on the allegations from the Philippines that their vessels were damaged by Chinese coast guard personnel wielding blades and firing tear gas. Spokesman Lin Jian did not address those allegations, and instead reasserted Beijing\u2019s claims over the Second Thomas Shoal, known as Ren\u2019ai Jiao in China. \u201cThe Philippine operation was not for humanitarian supplies at all. The Philippine vessels carried not only construction materials but also smuggled weapons. They also intentionally rammed into Chinese vessels and splashed water and threw things on Chinese law-enforcement personnel,\u201d Lin said. \u201cThese actions have obviously aggravated tensions at sea and seriously threatened the safety of Chinese personnel and ships.\u201d Mutual defense treaty What happens in the South China Sea has profound implications for the US, which has a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines that dates back decades. The latest clash marks the first run-in between the two countries since a new law in China took effect Saturday to authorize its coast guard to seize foreign ships and detain crews suspected of trespassing for up to 60 days without trial. It also comes just weeks after Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr.\u00a0warned\u00a0that the death of any Filipino citizen at the hands of another country in the waterway would be \u201cvery close\u201d to an act of war. Marcos has sought closer ties with the US, which\u00a0has repeatedly stressed Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad commitment\u201d to a 1951 mutual defense treaty between the US and the Philippines that stipulates both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller\u00a0said\u00a0Monday the \u201cUnited States stands with its ally the Philippines and condemns the escalatory and irresponsible actions\u201d by China. In a phone call with his Philippine counterpart Enrique A. Manalo on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China\u2019s actions, \u201cundermine regional peace and stability and underscored the United States\u2019 ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defense Treaty.\u201d Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, a US-based think tank, said the footage released by the Philippines \u201cclearly shows a Chinese attack on Philippine military assets,\u201d which according to Washington and Manila\u2019s defense pact\u00a0would trigger mutual defense commitments. \u201cHowever, in practical terms, the Philippines itself would have to initiate a move to activate (it) before the US would intervene militarily,\u201d he said. In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines\u2019 claims in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to assert historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its maritime territorial claims, with China Coast Guard ships \u2013 reinforced by militia boats \u2013 involved in multiple clashes over the past year that have damaged Philippine ships and seen\u00a0Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. Philippine \u2018restraint\u2019 The decision by China\u2019s Coast Guard to use bladed weapons in the latest South China Sea clash has drawn comparisons with clashes between China and India on their disputed Himalayan border, where soldiers on both sides have fought fiercely with sticks, rocks and their hands. The Philippine personnel on the rubber boats are elite forces hailing from the Navy Special Operations Group, Koh said. \u201cThey are trained in combat. They did not retaliate against the Chinese because they\u2019re just simply exercising restraint,\u201d he said. \u201cThey probably have received instructions right from the top that under whatever circumstance they are not supposed to fight back against the Chinese and escalate the situation.\u201d The footage released by the Philippine military also showed another striking development \u2013 that the clash took place right next to the BRP Sierra Madre, a rusting US-built Philippine Navy landing craft that was run aground deliberately in 1999, with a national flag hoisted on board, to assert Manila\u2019s territorial claims over Second Thomas Shoal. This is the closest China\u2019s Coast Guard has come to the BRP Sierra Madre, Koh noted. \u201cUnder normal rules of engagement, the garrison would have fired warning shots,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that this incident didn\u2019t escalate further is because the Philippines exercised utmost restraint. That\u2019s a simple fact.\u201d China, Koh said, was trying to test both Manila and Washington \u201cto find out exactly where the red line is.\u201d \u201cThey wanted to see how far the US is willing to pledge its security commitment to the Filipinos. And of course, I don\u2019t think Beijing is dumb enough not to have considered the possibility of having all these actions escalate the situation, but I believe that was a risk that they, in the end, decided to take.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/asia/philippines-footage-south-china-sea-clash-china-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_americas_ecuador-nationwide-blackout-intl-latam", "text": "Ecuador was hit with an hours-long nationwide blackout on Wednesday that left the South American nation\u2019s 17 million people without power. The blackout \u2014 which affected hospitals, homes, and a major subway system \u2014 was caused by maintenance and transmission issues in the country\u2019s electrical system, authorities said. \u201cThe outages we had today were due to a lack of investment in maintenance, new electrical transmission, and the protection of the electrical transmission infrastructure,\u201d Public Infrastructure Minister Roberto Luque told a news conference on Wednesday. As of Wednesday night, energy had been restored in 95% of the country, according to the government. Ecuador has been struggling with an energy crisis for years. The latest saw Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa declare an energy emergency in April and order eight-hour nationwide power cuts amid a drought that affected power generation. In the\u00a0capital\u00a0city of\u00a0Quito, a CNN team saw two hospitals, including a children\u2019s medical center, lose power during\u00a0the blackout. Both hospitals were able to rely on electricity from their generators shortly after the cut began. In the nation\u2019s largest city of Guayaquil, the blackout also briefly affected two other hospitals. \u201cThe power was cut but we have our own (generators),\u201d a doctor from Guayaquil\u2019s Luis Vernaza hospital said. CNN reached out to the country\u2019s Health Ministry to\u00a0ask\u00a0if other hospitals were affected. Guayaquil residents\u00a0faced the outage amid 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) heat. \u201cIt\u2019s unbearable, it\u2019s so hot and humid, and we can\u2019t use an air conditioner or a fan,\u201d one resident told CNN. \u201cOn top of this, the water is not running,\u201d the resident added. Service was interrupted on Quito\u2019s subway system due to the blackout, with the capital\u2019s Mayor Pabel Mu\u00f1oz saying the outage was so \u201csignificant\u201d it had affected the subway despite it using \u201can isolated (electrical) system.\u201d Infrastructure Minister Luque said the blackout could have been avoided had Ecuador carried out an investment plan to \u201csafeguard the infrastructure in both generating (power) and the transmission\u201d\u00a0after a similar power outage took place in 2004. Wednesday\u2019s blackout is not related to the country\u2019s energy crisis from last April, Luque said. \u201cThe outages we had in April were due to lack of investment in new (power) generation and in maintenance of the (power) we have,\u201d Luque said.

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Journalist\u00a0Aydos Sadykov, head of the opposition online media B\u04d8CE and strong critic of the government of President Kassym-Jomart\u00a0Tokayev, is in hospital after a gunman ran to his car on Tuesday, shot him and fled, according to the Office of Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General. \u201cToday in Kyiv, near his own house, an attempt was made on Aydos Sadykov\u2019s life,\u201d Sadykov\u2019s wife, Natalya Sadykova, who was also in the car, said in a Facebook post after the assault. Kazakhstan is ruled by autocrat Tokayev, who has previously adopted violent methods to maintain order.

{"id": "2024_06_20_middleeast_israeli-dentist-hamas-yahya-sinwar-intl", "text": "Hamas\u2019s surprise October 7 attacks stunned Israel. But not everyone was caught unaware. When he learned the news, Dr. Yuval Bitton says he felt it was coming \u2013 and knew immediately who was behind it. \u201cI know the person who planned and conceived and initiated this criminal attack,\u201d Bitton told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour. \u201cI have known him since 1996 \u2013 not only him but the entire Hamas leadership in Gaza \u2013 and it was clear to me that this is what they were planning.\u201d Bitton\u00a0spent years\u00a0working as a\u00a0dentist\u00a0in Israel\u2019s Nafha Prison.\u00a0It was there he met \u201cthe person\u201d \u2013\u00a0Yahya Sinwar, a\u00a0Hamas militant convicted of murder who would go on to become the group\u2019s leader\u00a0in Gaza \u2013\u00a0saying he saved his life by helping diagnose a brain tumor. Bitton says he spent hundreds of hours conversing with Sinwar, providing him with rare insight into the mind of the top Hamas official. But his actions have left him tormented. Bitton blames\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0for the murder of his nephew, who was killed after Hamas militants raided his home\u00a0on October 7. In 2004,\u00a0Sinwar had come to\u00a0the prison\u2019s\u00a0clinic complaining of neck pain and losing his balance. \u201cWhen he explained to me what was happening to him, I diagnosed it as a stroke, and together with the general practitioner, we decided to take him to the hospital,\u201d Bitton said. \u201cHe arrived at the hospital, the diagnosis was that he had an abscess in the brain and he was operated on that day, thus saving his life because if it had exploded, he would have died.\u201d Sinwar was appointed leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip in 2017. Born in the Khan Younis refugee camp in southern Gaza in 1962,\u00a0to a family displaced during the Arab-Israeli war,\u00a0he joined Hamas in the late 1980s. In 1989, he was sentenced to four life sentences in Israel for the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers. After being freed in 2011 as part of a prisoner swap, he returned to Gaza where he began his rise in the militant organization, becoming notorious for the violent treatment he would dole out on suspected collaborators. Israel\u00a0has publicly\u00a0accused\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0of being\u00a0the \u201cmastermind\u201d behind Hamas\u2019 terror attack\u00a0against Israel\u00a0on October 7\u00a0\u2013\u00a0though experts say he is likely one of several \u2013 making him one of the key targets of its war in Gaza. The attack was the deadliest assault in Israel\u2019s history. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and also took some 250 people hostage into Gaza. Following his recovery, Sinwar told Bitton that he owed him his life \u2013 a sentiment he repeated when he was released in the 2011 prisoner swap, which saw Sinwar and more than 1,000 other Palestinians freed for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. \u201cHe also told me that on the day he was released in [Gilad] Shalit\u2019s deal in 2011, that he owed me his life, and one day he will repay it.\u201d But years later that connection meant nothing. \u201cAnd as you understand, he made up for it on October 7 in that he was also directly responsible for the murder of my nephew in Kibbutz Nir Oz,\u201d said Bitton. Nir\u00a0Oz\u00a0was one of several kibbutzim that bore the brunt of Hamas\u2019 attack on October 7, with many residents murdered or taken hostage. Bitton said his nephew, Tamir, was \u201cseriously injured\u201d trying to fight off the attackers. \u201cThere were only five of them, they didn\u2019t really stand a chance, and he was kidnapped while he was still seriously injured, unconscious, and died after a few hours in Gaza.\u201d A close connection Bitton\u00a0\u2013 who later joined Israeli intelligence \u2013\u00a0came to know\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0well during his time in prison,\u00a0spending\u00a0\u201chundreds of hours\u201d\u00a0talking to him. Sinwar, Bitton says, believes Jewish people have \u201cno place\u201d on \u201cMuslim lands.\u201d Bitton therefore saw it as \u201conly a matter of time and timing that they [Hamas] will act against us and try to expel us from the place where we live.\u201d Despite eight months of Israeli fighting in Gaza, which has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, Sinwar remains at large, and thought to be sheltering somewhere in the territory. Asked for his assessment of Sinwar\u2019s mindset, Bitton says the Hamas leader is mainly concerned with staying in power. He believes\u00a0Sinwar\u00a0would be \u201cwilling to sacrifice even 100,000 Palestinians in order to ensure the survival of his rule.\u201d \u201cHe is willing to pay with the lives of militants, Hamas members, civilians. He doesn\u2019t care.\u201d With this in mind, Bitton believes that Israel made a mistake by not creating an alternative to Hamas\u2019s rule, which could have undermined Sinwar\u2019s power. Bitton says that Sinwar still \u201cfeels he is in a powerful position.\u201d \u201cHe is running the negotiations while still operating from within Gaza, and still controls the areas from which the IDF evacuates, he also controls the humanitarian aid, and therefore he feels strong and won\u2019t sign an agreement to release the hostages unless the IDF withdraws from Gaza and the fighting ends.\u201d Sinwar spent his more than two decades in prison studying his enemy, including learning Hebrew. It is a lesson Israel should have taken too, says Bitton, who believes the government and intelligence service \u201cdid not know and learn Hamas well enough.\u201d \u201cOur attitude towards Hamas was arrogant. We dismissed Hamas. And Hamas said everything it intended to do, but we didn\u2019t want to listen.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/middleeast/israeli-dentist-hamas-yahya-sinwar-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Margot Friedl\u00e4nder, n\u00e9e Bendheim, was born in Berlin in 1921. According to a brief bio on the website of Berlin\u2019s Jewish Museum, Friedl\u00e4nder spent the early part of the war with her mother and younger brother Ralph after her parents separated. They had plans to flee the country but in 1943 her brother was arrested by the Gestapo. Their mother confronted the Gestapo, which led to her being deported to Auschwitz with her son, where they were both murdered. But before leaving, she left behind a message for her daughter that read: \u201cTry to make your life.\u201d Friedl\u00e4nder, then just 21 years old, went into hiding but was ultimately betrayed by \u201ccatchers\u201d and was sent to Theresienstadt camp in the then-Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia in 1944, according to the museum. In her interview with Vogue Germany, Friedl\u00e4nder said: \u201cI am grateful. Grateful that I made it. For being able to fulfill my mother\u2019s wish. That I have made my life.\u201d Vogue Germany said they\u2019d met with Friedl\u00e4nder four times this year and that the cover pictures were shot in April at the Botanical Garden in Berlin. Kerstin Weng, head of editorial content at the magazine, said that the theme of the issue was love, featuring their \u201cfavorite pieces, favorite people.\u201d The front of the collector\u2019s issue includes the word \u201clove\u201d written by Friedl\u00e4nder, as well as her signature. The multi-page piece, which includes numerous shots of Friedl\u00e4nder, covers a range of topics, from growing up in Nazi Germany to her commitment as a Holocaust survivor today. Weng said: \u201cThe most positive person I know is on this issue\u2019s cover: Margot Friedl\u00e4nder. To many she is known as a Holocaust survivor. But she not only survived the Nazis, she also overcame betrayal and loss. She would have all reason to be bitter, but remains open-minded and refuses to take sides. She stands up against forgetting and for humanity and togetherness. \u201cAt 102, she seeks to engage with the younger generation and proves that dialogue is still possible.\u201d \u2018Carry my story onward\u2019 Friedl\u00e4nder met her future husband, Adolf, while in the Nazi concentration camp, and married him soon after liberation. The pair emigrated to the US in 1946 and lived in New York for more than six decades. But in 2010, following her husband\u2019s death aged 88, Friedl\u00e4nder moved back to Berlin. Ever since, she has been campaigning as a Holocaust educator. Her tireless efforts have earnt her numerous awards, including the Federal Cross of Merit First Class. Friedl\u00e4nder told Vogue Germany that she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the growth of right-wing populism and the rise of antisemitic attacks. When addressing the issue of society becoming more polarized, she said: \u201cLook not toward what separates us. Look towards what bring us together. Be People. Be sensible.\u201d Grateful for the opportunity to pass on her message, she said: \u201cYou will carry my story onward. That this never comes to happen again.\u201d Although more than 100 years old, Friedl\u00e4nder is not Vogue\u2019s oldest cover model.

India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, all of whom have important trading relationships with Russia as members of the BRICS economic group, attended the weekend meeting but did not agree to sign the joint statement. The document reaffirmed the signatories commitment to \u201crefraining from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, the principles of sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all states, including Ukraine, within their internationally recognized borders.\u201d Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists at a news conference alongside the leaders of the European Union, Ghana, Canada, Chile and Switzerland that it was \u201cimportant that all participants of this summit support this Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity because there is will be no lasting peace without territorial integrity.\u201d More than 100 countries and organizations gathered at an idyllic lakeside resort near Lucerne to drum up support for the 10-point peace plan Zelensky first outlined late in 2022. That formula includes demands for a cessation of hostilities, the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian soil and the restoration of Ukraine\u2019s pre-war borders with Russia \u2013 terms Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to ever agree to. Among the high-level dignitaries in attendance were the leaders of Argentina, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. US Vice President Kamala Harris was also in attendance and used the occasion to announce a $1.5 billion aid package that would go toward humanitarian expenditures and help Kyiv rebuilt its battered infrastructure. \u201cThis high level attendance shows one thing. The world cares deeply about the war provoked by Russia\u2019s aggression,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. Despite the strong showing among Western democracies, there had been questions ahead of the event as to just how much could be accomplished given that neither Russia nor China, whose increasingly close trading relationship with Moscow has helped the Kremlin survive Western sanctions, were attending. The communique published on Sunday said that signatories had struck several other agreements. Among them were the principle that Ukraine to should be allowed its own nuclear power plants \u2013 including the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant \u2013 and that the Kremlin refrain from both the use of and the threat of using nuclear weapons. The sides also said that all children and civilians that were unlawfully displaced must be returned to Ukraine. On Friday, the day before the summit was set to kick off,\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin restated the Kremlin\u2019s own peace plan, which calls for Ukrainian troops withdraw from four southern and eastern regions of Ukrainian territory that Moscow said it would annex in violation of international law and demands Kyiv abandon its bid to join\u00a0NATO. While Russian forces have made modest gains in two of the regions \u2013 Donetsk and Luhansk \u2013 in recent months, they are far from occupying all four, which include Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who traveled with Harris to Switzerland, told reporters at the summit that Putin\u2019s framework \u201cdefies basic morality.\u201d \u201cHe (Putin) said, not only does Ukraine have to give up the territory Russia currently occupies, but Ukraine has to leave additional sovereign Ukrainian territory before Russia will negotiate. And Ukraine must disarm so that is vulnerable to future Russian aggression down the road.

At least 55 people have died since June 9, Chinese state media reported Friday, with dramatic footage showing urban areas submerged in water and buildings appearing to subside\u00a0as emergency responders in speedboats raced to rescue stranded residents. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported on Friday that at least 47 people have died in the city of Meizhou in Guangdong province, among the hardest hit places amid reports of record flooding along the banks of the Songyuan and Shiku rivers. The southern Guangdong province is an economic powerhouse home to 127 million people and is subject to annual flooding from April to September. But the region has faced more intense rainstorms and severe flooding in recent years as scientists warn the climate crisis will amplify extreme weather, making it deadlier and more frequent. Earlier in the week, more than 10,000 people were evacuated from Meizhou, and as many as 130,00 were left without power, with authorities in the city raising the flood control emergency response to Level-I, according to state media. China\u2019s flood control emergency response system has four levels, with Level-I being the most severe. Of those, 38 were reported dead in the city\u2019s Pingyuan county and two people were reported missing, CCTV reported, adding that over 55,000 people have been affected by the heavy rainfall and the direct economic loss is estimated to be about 5.8 billion yuan ($799 million). In the nearby southern province of Fujian, state media reported at least eight people had died, including four in Wuping county and the rest in Shanghang county, adding that heavy rainfall has affected an estimated 586,500 people across 40 counties. And in Guangxi, a neighboring southern region to the west, state media reported 48 rivers were running above flood alert levels, forcing authorities to introduce a Level-II emergency response. The Lijiang River, a famous and popular tourist destination that runs through Guilin, saw its worst flooding since 1998, resulting in more than 6,000 people being evacuated, state media reported on Thursday. The emergency response to the flooding comes as Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Tuesday called for all-out efforts to safeguard lives and property, as China grapples with extreme weather with heavy rains in the south and severe drought and record temperatures in the north.

{"id": "travel_bird-strike-plane-what-happens", "text": "Late Monday night, Virgin Australia flight VA 148 set out from Queenstown in New Zealand bound for Melbourne. Not long after takeoff, the right engine of the Boeing 737-800 jet started\u00a0emitting loud bangs, followed by flames. The pilot flew on with the remaining engine, bringing the plane\u2019s 73 passengers and crew to a safe emergency landing at nearby Invercargill airport. Virgin Australia says the dramatic turn of events was caused by a \u201cpossible bird strike\u201d. Queenstown Airport\u00a0played down\u00a0the likelihood of bird strike, saying \u201cno birds were detected on the airfield at that time\u201d. While we don\u2019t know exactly what happened, bird strike is a common and real risk for aircraft. It can damage planes, and even lead to deaths. How common are bird strikes? A bird strike is a\u00a0collision between\u00a0an aircraft and a bird. (Though the definition is sometimes expanded to include\u00a0collisions on the ground\u00a0with land animals including deer, rabbits, dogs and alligators.) The\u00a0first bird strike\u00a0was recorded by Orville Wright in 1905, over a cornfield in Ohio. Now they happen every day, with some seasonal variability due to the\u00a0migratory patterns\u00a0of birds. Perhaps the most famous migratory bird strike occurred in 2009, when\u00a0US Airways Flight 1549\u00a0encountered a flock of migrating Canadian geese shortly after taking off from LaGuardia Airport in New York. Both of the plane\u2019s engines failed, and captain Sully Sullenberger was forced to pilot it to an unpowered landing in the Hudson River. Between 2008 and 2017, the Australian Transport Safety Board recorded\u00a016,626 bird strikes. In America, the Federal Aviation Administration reported\u00a017,200 bird strikes\u00a0in 2022 alone. Where do bird strikes happen, and what are the effects? According to the\u00a0International Civil Aviation Organization, 90% of bird strikes happen near airports. In general, this is while aircraft are taking off or landing, or flying at lower altitudes where most bird activity occurs. The effect of bird strike depends on many factors including the type of aircraft. Outcomes may include shutting down an engine, as may have happened with the Virgin Australia flight. This plane was a Boeing 737-800, which has the capability to fly on a single engine to an alternate airport. In smaller aircraft, particularly single-engine aircraft, bird strikes can be fatal. Since 1988,\u00a0262 bird strike fatalities\u00a0have been reported globally, and 250 aircraft destroyed. How do manufacturers and pilots defend against bird strike? Most\u00a0bird strikes\u00a0occur early in the morning or a sunset when birds are most active. Pilots are trained to be vigilant during these times. Radar can be used to\u00a0track flocks of birds. However, this technology is ground-based and not available worldwide so it can\u2019t be used everywhere. The two largest manufacturers of passenger jets, Boeing and Airbus, use\u00a0turbofan engines. These use a series of fan blades to compress air before adding fuel and flame to get the thrust needed to take off. Bird strike in one of these engines can cause severe damage to the fan blades, causing the engine to fail. Engine manufacturers test the safety of these engines by firing\u00a0a high-speed frozen chicken\u00a0at them while the engine is operating at full thrust. The Australian Government\u2019s Civil Aviation Safety Authority\u00a0circular on wildlife hazard management\u00a0outlines what airports should do to keep birds and animals away from the vicinity of the airport. One technique is to use small gas explosions to mimic the sound of a shotgun to deter birds from loitering near the runway. In areas with high bird populations, airports may also use certain grasses and plants that do not attract the birds.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/bird-strike-plane-what-happens/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

The pact, which comes against the backdrop of Putin\u2019s grinding war against Ukraine, is the most significant agreement signed by Russia and North Korea in decades and is seen as something of a revival of their 1961 Cold War-era mutual defense pledge. It also consolidates the Kim regime\u2019s powerful link with a world power that wields a veto on the UN Security Council. On Wednesday, Putin presented Kim with an Aurus car as the pair exchanged gifts, according to Russian state media \u2013 the second time the Kremlin leader has given his counterpart this car model. According to Putin\u2019s aide Yuri Ushakov, the Russian leader also presented Kim with a tea set. Footage from KCNA showed Putin in return receiving a pair of native Pungsan hunting dogs \u2013 the same breed Kim gifted to former South Korean President Moon Jae-in in 2018 during a breakthrough in the two countries\u2019 relations. Putin\u2019s trip has been a very public display of the strong relations between Russia and North Korea, whose alignment has deepened in the face of shared animosity toward the West. The Russian leader landed in North Korea in the early hours of Wednesday morning local time, exactly 24 years to the day that he was last in Pyongyang, amid international concerns over the two countries\u2019 military cooperation. During the visit, the two leaders announced a new strategic partnership driven by Moscow\u2019s need for weapons in its war in Ukraine. In remarks ahead of talks between the two, Kim voiced his \u201cfull support and solidarity with the struggles of the Russian government, military and the people,\u201d pointing specifically to Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine \u201cto protect its own sovereignty, safety and territorial stability.\u201d Putin, for his part, hailed the countries\u2019 ties as based on \u201cequality and mutual respect.\u201d The burgeoning relationship has sparked concern in both Seoul and Washington, not only over North Korea\u2019s arms transfers to Russia, but also the prospect of Moscow transferring its superior military technology to aid Pyongyang\u2019s heavily sanctioned weapons program. After his visit to North Korea, Putin landed in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi as he continues his attempts to boost economic ties with friendly countries amid Western isolation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/europe/putin-kim-north-korea-limousine-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

It\u2019s not the only area of tropical concern looming large this week as a predicted hyperactive hurricane season kicks into gear. The system threatening the southwestern Gulf Coast has been designated Potential Tropical Cyclone One by the National Hurricane Center as it tries to get organized in the Gulf of Mexico. It will unload torrential rainfall and considerably ramp up the flood threat, not just in the US, but also in parts of Mexico and Central America. As the name suggests, Potential Tropical Cyclone One isn\u2019t quite a tropical storm yet, but is expected to become one and poses a threat to the areas in the tropical storm warning over the next 48 hours. The system had 40 mph winds Tuesday morning \u2013 strong enough that if it does develop a coherent circulation, it would be named Tropical Storm Alberto. It\u2019s forecast to by late Tuesday or Wednesday before approaching the northern coast of Mexico on Wednesday night. The system\u2019s strength will be limited by its short time over water, but it\u2019s main threat of significant rain and flooding will not: multiple days of gushing rainfall for parts of Central America, southern Mexico\u00a0and the US western Gulf Coast. Heavy rain was already ongoing Monday in parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras as the gyre churned. Double-digit rainfall totals are possible in these areas by Thursday. Rain is needed desperately in parts of Mexico and Central America that are bone-dry after weeks of unrelenting heat. But day after day of heavy rain will quickly overwhelm parched soils unable to absorb water as fast as it falls, resulting in dangerous flooding. Deep tropical moisture was also fueling storms as far north as the US\u2019s western Gulf Coast. Double-digit rainfall totals are likely in portions of coastal and southern Texas by the weekend, while other portions of the Gulf Coast could pick up several inches through midweek. A level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place for the Texas coast Tuesday and much of South Texas on Wednesday. By Wednesday, the air over the Gulf Coast will be loaded up with \u201cincredible amounts of moisture\u201d which could \u201ceasily\u201d produce flash flooding, the Weather Prediction Center warned Monday. Heavy rain isn\u2019t the most welcome sight along some parts of the US Gulf Coast. June has been drier after a drenching spring, but the soil and area rivers are still holding on to plenty of water in eastern Texas and western Louisiana. Another tropical threat could take shape Another tropical threat is stirring in the Atlantic as development gets underway in the Gulf of Mexico. An area of showers and thunderstorms a few hundred miles east of the Bahamas could be the starting point for a potential tropical system later this week. Right now, the National Hurricane Center gives it a low chance of developing into a tropical system. Multiple atmospheric factors must align for the area of stormy weather to get its act together, but the opportunity for development exists over the next few days as it slowly pushes westward. If something tropical does develop, it could approach the southeastern US by Thursday or Friday and be steered south of the heat dome roasting areas farther north. It\u2019s unclear exactly which areas could be impacted, but anywhere from Florida to the Carolinas should keep a close eye on the forecast as it comes into focus in the coming days. Drenching rain could soak parts of the Southeast coast and rough seas are possible from the Bahamas to the mid-Atlantic coasts regardless of development.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/weather/hurricane-season-gulf-coast-flooding/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_tech_openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor", "text": "Victor Miller, 42, recently filed paperwork to run for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, but it wasn\u2019t exactly for him: He listed the name of a customized AI chatbot to appear on the ballot. He argued that the chatbot, named VIC \u2013 for \u201cvirtual integrated citizen\u201d \u2013 would use technology from artificial intelligence company OpenAI to make all political decisions and help govern the city. (VIC is not affiliated with a political party.) AI has \u201chelped me in my life personally \u2026 such as helping me with my resume,\u201d Miller told CNN. \u201cI think it could add a layer to help a town. I really want to see that happen.\u201d On Tuesday, however, OpenAI told CNN it shut down Miller\u2019s access to the tool that was being used to interact with and persuade voters. Using ChatGPT in this way, according to the company, is against its policies. AI is making politics even more complicated as government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use AI tools responsibly, and the tech is advancing faster than social, legal and regulatory guardrails. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken action against these uses of our technology for violating our policies against political campaigning,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told CNN. On its website, OpenAI states it prohibits \u201cengaging in political campaigning or lobbying, including generating campaign materials personalized to or targeted at specific demographics.\u201d Miller said he was motivated to create VIC after he was denied access to city records about policies and procedures because he made his request anonymously. \u201cIf I was able to ask AI and interact with this new intelligence, it would have known the law and I would have gotten the records,\u201d he said. The city did not respond to request for comment on the denial of records, but Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray told CNN in a statement that he is \u201cclosely\u201d monitoring Miller\u2019s bid for mayor. \u201cWyoming law is clear that, to run for office, one must be a \u2018qualified elector,\u2019 which necessitates being a real person,\u201d Gray said in the statement. \u201cTherefore, an AI bot is not a qualified elector.\u201d He also suggested the chatbot is essentially a fig leaf for a Miller candidacy. Gray said he wrote a letter to the Cheyenne municipal clerk raising his concerns about the bid. Although the public-facing version of VIC has been removed by OpenAI, Miller said it still works on his own ChatGPT account. He plans to bring it, along with a microphone, to a local Cheyenne library and give voters the opportunity to directly ask it questions via its voice-to-text feature. OpenAI told CNN it also took action against another candidate in the UK who was using its AI models to help campaign for Parliament. Steve Endacott, chairman of an AI company called Neural Voice, answers questions from voters via AI Steve, a chatbot, on his site. He is running as an independent. Endacott did not respond to a request for comment. His website offered a ChatGPT chatbot where voters were able to leave opinions and help create policies. If a voter asked the tool a question about AI Steve\u2019s policies and it didn\u2019t have an answer, it would conduct a search and create a policy suggestion. (While his website continues to operate, the tool is no longer powered by ChatGPT.) \u2018Gimmick is the right word\u2019 Although AI chatbots are getting smarter, some experts told CNN the technology should never substitute for human judgment in running any part of government. \u201cWhen it comes to AI now and what it will be like in the future, it should never be used to make automated decisions,\u201d said Jen Golbeck, a professor at the College of Information Sciences at the University of Maryland. \u201cAI has always been designed for decision support \u2013 it gives some data to help a human make decisions but is not set up to make decisions by itself.\u201d The emergence of AI political candidates also comes amid growing concerns about how the spread of misinformation could impact elections. Earlier this year, for example, a fake recording of a candidate in Slovakia saying he rigged the election went viral. Golbeck said, however, that there may be a place for AI in politics when it comes to helping with various tasks, such as answering forms from constituents or directing how to get problems solved. \u201cYou may be able to train a chatbot with all of the knowledge found in an office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the decision making should always be left to humans.\u201d David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, agreed, noting the people behind an AI candidacy are leaning into \u201ca cultural moment\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. \u201cGimmick is the right word for it,\u201d Karpf told CNN. \u201cChatGPT is not qualified to run your government.\u201d Karpf said he doesn\u2019t believe lawmakers need to make formal legislation around AI chatbots running for office because \u201cno one is going to vote for an AI chatbot to run a city.\u201d Karpf believes that the timing of these cases is noteworthy, too. \u201cWe have a very serious election coming up, and I don\u2019t mind levity in it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this is: We should laugh for a minute and get back to work.\u201d But Miller said he hopes the attention around his efforts inspires more AI candidates in the months ahead. \u201cI think this can expand beyond the mayor and Parliament, and [reach the whole] world,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/tech/openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Ryan Tyler Watson of Oklahoma pleaded guilty last month to possessing four rounds of ammunition, a spokesperson for the government of Turks and Caicos said. He had been released on bail and ordered to stay on the islands while awaiting this sentence. On Friday, Watson received a 13-week suspended sentence and a $2,000 fine \u2013 $500 per bullet, a spokesperson for the Turks and Caicos Islands Supreme Court told CNN on Friday. Watson will not need to serve the 13-week sentence \u201cas long as he doesn\u2019t commit any crimes and keeps the peace in the TCI within 9 months,\u201d the court spokesperson said. Watson \u201cis now allowed to leave \u2026 as he\u2019s now cleared with the justice in the TCI.\u201d Watson is expected to return to Oklahoma City by Friday night, according to Jonathan Franks, a spokesperson for\u00a0Bring Our Families Home. \u201cWe will make payment shortly, depart TCI and anticipate being home in OKC tonight,\u201d Franks posted on X from the courthouse. Watson was visiting Turks and Caicos with his wife in April to celebrate several friends\u2019 40th birthdays. But bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d The British Overseas Territory doesn\u2019t manufacture guns or ammunition, yet the number of firearms making their way to the islands has increased, Turks and Caicos Premier C. Washington\u00a0Misick said in May. By contrast, the United States has\u00a0more guns than people. \u201cIn the\u00a0Turks\u00a0and Caicos Islands, the law stands firm and applies to everyone equally, without exception,\u201d\u00a0Misick said in a statement last month. Turks and Caicos recently revised part of its firearms law after a bipartisan group of US Congress members traveled to the islands southeast of the Bahamas and asked officials to drop charges against five Americans whom they said \u201cinadvertently\u201d had ammunition in their luggage. The new amendment clarifies when sentencing for firearms-related offenses, courts have the discretion to impose either a fine, a custodial sentence, or a mixture of both in exceptional circumstances. Previously, the law required courts to impose both a fine and a prison sentence of 12 years \u2013 though it allowed reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d Watson is the first of those five Americans to be sentenced under the amended firearms law, which went into effect Wednesday. What\u2019s happened to the other Americans At least four other Americans have recently been arrested in Turks and Caicos on charges of having ammunition. Bryan Hagerich is\u00a0back\u00a0in the\u00a0United States\u00a0after receiving a suspended 52-week sentence and a $6,700 fine.\u00a0Hagerich\u00a0was allowed to leave the\u00a0territory\u00a0and return to the US after he paid the fine, his attorney Oliver Smith said. Tyler Wenrich\u00a0pleaded guilty and\u00a0was sentenced to time served\u00a0and issued a $9,000 fine, according to court records. Michael Lee Evans pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9 mm rounds of ammunition,\u00a0and was scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday \u2013 though it is unclear based on court records if the sentencing happened. CNN has reached out to his attorney for more information. And Sharitta Shinese Grier is expected to plead guilty in court next Tuesday, her attorney Sheena C. Mairto told CNN. The Florida mother said she had no idea two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. Grier was released on bail but can\u2019t leave the islands until her case ends, the affiliate reported. She was also ordered to report to a police station weekly.

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_06_20_asia_russia-putin-kim-deal-military-assistance-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea and Russia have pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked, according to the text of a new landmark defense pact agreed by the two autocratic nations. Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed the new strategic partnership agreement Wednesday in Pyongyang during a rare state visit\u00a0by the Russian leader who described the deal as a \u201cnew level\u201d in bilateral relations. The pact, which comes against the backdrop of Putin\u2019s grinding war against Ukraine, is the most significant agreement signed by Russia and North Korea in decades and is seen as something of a revival of their 1961 Cold War-era mutual defense pledge. It also consolidates the Kim regime\u2019s powerful link with a world power that wields a veto on the UN Security Council. On Thursday, North Korean state media KCNA published the full text of the pact, which also includes political, trade, investment, and security cooperation. According to the text, Article 4 states that should either country \u201cget into a state of war due to an armed aggression\u201d the other \u201cshall immediately provide military and other assistance with all the means at its disposal.\u201d The newly released text will now raise several questions for Western observers, including whether Russia\u2019s powerful nuclear deterrent now extends to North Korea, or if the two nations will now hold joint military drills. Putin referenced the defense clause after the meeting with Kim Wednesday, saying it provides \u201cfor the provision of mutual assistance in the event of aggression against one of the parties to this agreement.\u201d Kim, meanwhile, called the new \u201calliance\u201d a \u201cwatershed moment in the development of the bilateral relations.\u201d Some analysts say the pact reads more like a formal defense treaty than a partnership agreement. \u201cIn a sense this is laying out what they have been already building up in the recent months and years,\u201d said Jo Bee-yun, Associate Research Fellow at Korea Institute for Defense Analyses. \u201cBut definitely I would say this clause is very alarming because it is somewhere near reaching say a kind of a mutual defense treaty.\u201d Yu Ji-hoon, research fellow at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses said the treaty\u2019s \u201cautomatic intervention clause\u201d\u00a0means all military assets will be mobilized, \u201cincluding the army, navy, and air force.\u201d Details on the clause are scant, however, and Yu said it was \u201cnecessary to closely monitor the provisions regarding military intervention by North Korea and Russia.\u201d For example, North Korea refers to \u201cSouth Korea-US training, or training targeting North Korea\u201d as an attack, \u201cbut it is not viewed as equivalent to war,\u201d Yu said. The agreement cements the two countries\u2019 deepening alignment in the face of their international isolation over Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine and Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile program. The US, South Korea and other countries have accused North Korea of\u00a0providing substantial military aid\u00a0to Russia\u2019s war effort, while observers have raised concerns that Moscow may be violating international sanctions to aid Pyongyang\u2019s development of its\u00a0nascent military satellite program. Both countries have denied North Korean arms exports, despite significant evidence of such transfers. Speaking after his meeting with Kim, Putin rankled against what he called \u201cthe imperialist policy of the United States and its satellites,\u201d and said Russia \u201cdoes not rule out the development of military-technical cooperation with the DPRK,\u201d referring to North Korea by its official acronym. Analysts say any strengthening of technology cooperation would enhance North Korea\u2019s military power. \u201cThis includes advancements in nuclear weapons and effective means of delivering these nuclear capabilities,\u201d Yu said. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the pact \u201csymbolizes Moscow choosing Pyongyang over the international nonproliferation regime and Russia\u2019s obligations as a member of the UN Security Council.\u201d This story has been updated.

{"id": "2024_06_20_style_milan-menswear-spring-summer-2025", "text": "There are few things more synonymous with Italy in spring and summer than its beaches. From the Adriatic to the Amalfi Coast, its colorful \u201clidos\u201d (private beach clubs) are one of the country\u2019s most iconic exports. The Italian contingent of the Milan Fashion Week schedule seemed set on paying homage to its sunny shores during a weekend of Spring-Summer 2025 shows where a reoccurring theme of backstage mood boards was Italy\u2019s beloved \u201cal mare\u201d (the sea). At MSGM, where designer Massimo Giorgetti celebrated his brand\u2019s 15th\u00a0anniversary, outfits riffed on beach-resort signatures with sun-dyed stripes, shiny swim shorts, and cutout motifs of crabs, mermaids and dolphins reminiscent of childhood toys lost in the sand. Giorgetti, originally from the beach city of Rimini \u2014 famed of its 15km stretch of umbrella-lined sands \u2014 instead used an image of his adopted seaside home, 300 miles away on the Ligurian coast\u00a0as the main motif in the collection, a place where, he said, he draws inspiration from the evocative \u201cpines, agaves, and the scent of salt and resin.\u201d Remembering the Grand Tour At Dolce & Gabbana, Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana naturally leaned into beaches frequented by the jet-set \u2014 the kind of people who arrive ashore by their yacht\u2019s tender \u2014 for its collection entitled \u201cItalian Beauty\u201d.\u00a0It was heavy on the raffia (seen on boxy jackets, shoes and satchels) and all-over coral embroidery that nodded to the twinkling keepsakes found in the \u2018goallerieas\u2019\u00a0\u00a0(jewelry stores) of Capri and Portofino that the Italians love to window-shop at sunset. \u201cSince the 19th century, the Grand Tour was a journey that had Italy as its destination, thus becoming one of the most iconic places to visit for summer holidays,\u201d relayed the designers\u00a0in show notes, adding that Italy\u2019s hotspots \u201cbecame places of pure aesthetics,\u201d a snapshot that they paid homage to with louche-cut silhouettes in luxe materials. Between the city and the beach At Gucci, where Sabato de Sarno revealed his sophomore menswear collection for the house, city-approved leather jackets and polo shirts mingled with icons of ocean culture. \u201cThis collection speaks of encounters \u2014 \u2018icontri\u2019 \u2014 between the city and the beach and among people who love life,\u201d said Napoli-born De Sarno. His sharp cuts were countered with a breezy sensibility reflected in repetitive dolphin and surfer prints that popped up on retro Cuban-collar shirts (the latter inspired by author William Finnegan\u2019s autobiography \u201cBarbarian Days, A Surfing Life\u201d). Elsewhere, toweling-style polo shirts in Neapolitan gelato shades were teamed with board shorts and rubber sea shoes \u2014 possibly de Sarno\u2019s first hype-item hit \u2014 which grounded the majority of looks. Despite what could have resulted in a presentation of derivative stereotypes, the Italians swerved gimmicks to deliver real clothes that have more to say than the popular but homogenized recent proliferation of \u201cquiet luxury\u201d collections. Against a divisive political and humanitarian backdrop, their homages to Italy\u2019s universally aspired-to dolce vita summers and throwbacks to what are now perceived as simpler times drew a collective optimism. Clothing that\u2019s both playful and useful Along similar lines, Prada looked to themes of youthful optimism, freedom and energy. For its collection, entitled \u201cCloser,\u201d the house looked to capture \u201cthe power of reality, in a world of the imaginary,\u201d\u00a0said the show notes, with closely cropped, deliberately creased shirting, off-kilter prismatic prints, and dropped-waist belts painted onto trousers in the style of tromp l\u2019oeil. Sweetly na\u00efve but at the same time reminding us that nothing is quite what meets the eye, it\u2019s easy to imagine this as a wardrobe that might find its way to the promenades of Rimini having been thrown in a hopeful ingenue\u2019s suitcase at the last minute for an invitation promising a good time. Miuccia Prada refuted it was a collection about escapism, \u201cactually, I propose something positive, I don\u2019t think we should escape from reality,\u201d she said backstage. Rather she and co-creative director Raf Simons wanted to create something \u201cplayful and useful\u201d chimed Simons. \u201cWe wanted to create clothes that have lived a life, that are alive in themselves,\u201d they relayed in the show notes. \u201cThere is a sense of spontaneity and optimism to these clothes \u2014 they reflect instinctive but deliberate choices, freedom.\u201d Celebrating a simple life The celebration of simple sensations and comfort in the familiar also popped up at JW Anderson, where designer Jonathan Anderson, who hails from Northern Ireland, sent summer knits depicting a child\u2019s drawing of quintessentially British \u201ctwo-up-two-down\u201d houses. At Moschino, where creative director Adrian Appiolaza debuted his first menswear collection, skirts came in postcard prints and blazers splashed with classic Italian tablescape scenes. \u201cEscaping the city, true individuals wear clothes that speak of the Italian countryside, of the wilds of\u00a0the jungle, and finally of a serenity \u2014 outer exploration, to find inner peace,\u201d said the brand. Fila+, headed up by Lev Tanju, staged a presentation that welcomed editors to a replica 1990s Italian home, with kids watching football in the living room, a nonna knitting a blanket in the Italian tricolor, and three men playing the card game Scopa around a kitchen table, all wearing tracksuits Tanju has reinvented from the 113-year-old Italian brand\u2019s illustrious archive. And at Fendi, Silvia Fendi based the collection on a picture of the Italian football manager wearing a Fendi suit that she found in the archive. A theme of reflective team spirit prevailed in sporty collegiate silhouettes featuring the Fendi crest comprising a squirrel, the Fendi stripe, and a Roman God. First used by previous creative director Karl Lagerfeld, it represents \u201cwho looks in two ways; one looks at the past and one looks at the future. And this is what Fendi is about, preserving techniques or but also experimenting,\u201d said Fendi backstage. Rooted in hopefulness\u00a0and experimentation, the Milan season was a collective celebration of dolce-vita.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/style/milan-menswear-spring-summer-2025/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_asia_putin-ukraine-north-korea-south-korea-intl-hnk", "text": "Vladimir Putin has threatened to arm North Korea if Western countries continue providing military aid to Ukraine, as the Russia president\u2019s new defense pact with Pyongyang sparked a series of diplomatic reverberations in the region. Putin\u2019s remarks, at the end of a state visit to Vietnam, capped off a week in which Moscow sought to rattle the West and project strength from a part of the world in which his influence still carries weight. \u201cThose who supply these weapons believe that they are not at war with us. I said, including in Pyongyang, that we then reserve the right to supply weapons to other regions of the world,\u201d Putin told reporters Thursday at the end of his trip to Hanoi, in response to a question on whether the supply of Western long-range weapons could be considered an act of aggression. \u201cWhere they will go next?\u201d he said, suggesting those countries could then sell the weapons to Western adversaries. The US called Putin\u2019s remarks \u201cincredibly concerning\u201d in a briefing on Friday. \u201cIt would destabilize the Korean Peninsula,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters, and \u201cdepending on the type of weapons they provide, might violate UN Security Council resolutions that Russia itself has supported.\u201d Russia and North Korea\u2019s signing of a mutual defense pact this week sent ripples out across the region, with South Korea summoning Moscow\u2019s envoy on Friday, and Japan and the United States voicing serious concern. The defense pact, which comes against the backdrop of Putin\u2019s grinding war against Ukraine, is the most significant agreement signed by Russia and North Korea in decades and is seen as something of a revival of their 1961 Cold War-era mutual defense pledge. The deal was inked on Wednesday during Putin\u2019s trip to Pyongyang, where he received a lavish welcome from fellow autocrat Kim Jong Un, North Korea\u2019s leader. It consolidates the Kim regime\u2019s powerful link with a world power that wields a veto on the UN Security Council and means Russia now has a defense pact with South Korea\u2019s biggest enemy. South Korea, a US ally, condemned the treaty and summoned Russia\u2019s ambassador on Friday, a rare diplomatic step that illustrates the soured tensions between Seoul and Moscow. First Vice Minister Kim Hong-kyun relayed the South Korean government\u2019s \u201cstern position\u201d on Kim and Putin\u2019s defense pact, urging Moscow to \u201cimmediately halt military cooperation\u201d with Pyongyang and abide by UN Security Council resolutions, the Foreign Ministry said. Kim told the Russian ambassador that \u201cany cooperation that could directly or indirectly help reinforce the North Korean military power is a violation of the UN Security Council resolution,\u201d adding that Russia, a permanent member of the UNSC, should \u201cact responsibly,\u201d according to the ministry. An official of the US military, which maintains almost 30,000 troops in South Korea, told CNN the closer Russia-North Korea ties were troubling. \u201cThese developments should concern any country that cares about maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,\u00a0abiding by UN Security Council resolutions, and\u00a0supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia\u2019s brutal invasion,\u201d the military official said. New threats Putin flew to Vietnam on Thursday where he renewed threats towards both Western powers and their partners in Asia. Speaking to Russian journalists at the end of the visit he\u00a0accused\u00a0NATO\u00a0of \u201ccreating a threat\u201d for Russia in Asia. \u201cAnd we see what\u2019s happening in Asia, right? The bloc system is being cobbled together in Asia.\u00a0NATO\u00a0is already moving there as a permanent place of residence. This, of course, creates a threat for all countries in the region, including the Russian Federation. We are obliged to respond to this and will do so,\u201d\u00a0Putin\u00a0said. Putin warned South\u00a0Korea\u00a0on Thursday it would be making \u201ca very big mistake\u201d if it decided to supply arms to Ukraine, claiming Seoul has \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d concerning the new strategic partnership signed by Russia and North\u00a0Korea. \u201cAs far as I know, the Republic of Korea does not plan aggression against the DPRK, which means there is no need to be afraid of our cooperation in this area,\u201d he said. But at the same time, senior Russian government officials were warning that Moscow planned to send weapons to North Korea. \u201cI wonder what the people of this country (South Korea) will say when they see the latest Russian weapons from their closest neighbors \u2013 our partners from the DPRK?\u201d senior Russian official\u00a0Dmitry Medvedev said in a post on Telegram. US and South Korean forces hold regular exercises and training in and around the Korean Peninsula, and the two allies have been working more closely with Japan, including recent exercises involving forces from all three countries. National Security Director Chang Ho-jin said South Korea would review the issue of arms provision to Ukraine, but he also noted that Seoul was willing to wait for the Russian government\u2019s explanation of the results of the meeting between Putin and Kim Jong Un. Currently, South Korea\u2019s policy is not to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine. When later asked about those comments, Putin said: \u201cAs for the supply of lethal weapons to the combat zone in Ukraine, this would be a very big mistake. I hope that this will not happen. If this happens, then we will also make appropriate decisions, which are unlikely to please the current leadership of South Korea.\u201d Reports from earlier in the war say South Korea may have provided 155mm artillery shells to the United States to replace 155mm rounds sent to Ukraine. A recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said South Korea\u2019s stockpile of 105mm howitzer rounds could give Ukraine an important battlefield boost if it were released to Kyiv. \u201cPublic reports\u00a0suggest\u00a0South Korea has around 3.4 million 105mm artillery shells,\u201d the CSIS report said. Ukraine has about 100 105mm artillery pieces, the report said. \u201cDuring the Vietnam War, these lighter howitzers proved indispensable in firebases, given their high mobility by road and air. Their light weight and mobility would allow Ukrainian artillery units to relocate quickly after firing, a crucial tactic for survivability on the modern battlefield. These howitzers would also allow Ukrainian battlefield commanders to conduct attacks on rough terrain against high-value targets,\u201d the CSIS report said Earlier on Thursday, Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi also expressed strong concern about the agreement signed by\u00a0Russia and North Korea. The fact that Putin \u201cdid not rule out military-technical cooperation with North Korea, which could be a direct violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, is a point of serious concern from the perspective of its possible impact on the security environment surrounding our country,\u201d Hayashi\u00a0said in a press conference.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/asia/putin-ukraine-north-korea-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_middleeast_hezbollah-warns-cyprus-israel-gaza-war-explainer-mime-intl", "text": "In a fiery speech this week, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah singled out nearby Cyprus, threatening to target the small, divided Mediterranean island if it aids Israel in a potential war between the Lebanese militant group and Israel. \u201cCyprus will be part of this war too\u201d if it opens its airports and bases to Israeli forces, the leader of the Iran-backed militant group said in a televised speech Wednesday, a day after Israel warned that the prospect of \u201call-out war\u201d in Lebanon was \u201cgetting very close.\u201d Responding to the comments, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides denied being involved in the war. \u201cThe statements are not pleasant, but they do not correspond in any way to what is being attempted, to present an image that Cyprus is involved in the war operations. In no way whatsoever,\u201d he said, adding that lines of communication are open with the Lebanese and Iranian governments. The European Union on Thursday came to Cyprus\u2019 defense, saying that since the island \u201cis a member state of the EU, this means the EU is Cyprus and Cyprus is the EU.\u201d \u201cAny threat against one of our member states is a threat against the EU,\u201d Peter Stano, an EU spokesperson, told reporters. Neighboring Greece also expressed its \u201cundivided solidarity\u201d with Cyprus, saying on X that \u201cthe threat to use force is a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter.\u201d In an apparent attempt to control the damage, Lebanon\u2019s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib called his Cypriot counterpart, Constantinos Kombos, expressing Lebanon\u2019s \u201ccontinued reliance on the positive role played by Cyprus in supporting stability in the region,\u201d according to Lebanese state media. While experts say war between Israel and Hezbollah remains\u00a0unlikely, the very mention of Cyprus adds a new dimension to the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. It risks drawing an EU nation into a war that has already spread across the Middle East and puts the spotlight on Cyprus\u2019s ties with Israel. Here\u2019s what we know. Why is Cyprus\u2019 location important? An island in the Eastern Mediterranean located on a geopolitical fault line between the Middle East and southern Europe, Cyprus is geographically much closer to the conflicts in the Middle East than it is to European power centers. The island is twice the size of the US state of Delaware, and it is split into two parts: a Greek-speaking southern part known as the Republic of Cyprus, and a Turkish-speaking region known as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The island\u2019s divide reflects the rivalry between regional foes Greece and Turkey. Most of the international community only recognizes the sovereignty of the Greek part of Cyprus, and that was the nation Nasrallah\u2019s threats were directed at. The Republic of Cyprus is a member of the EU but not of the NATO defense alliance that obliges member nations to come to each other\u2019s defense in case of attack. It is home to\u00a0 around 920,000 people, with Nicosia as its capital. How close are Cyprus\u2019 ties with Israel? Diplomatic relations between Cyprus and Israel started in 1960, following the island\u2019s independence from British colonial rule, but Cyprus didn\u2019t open an embassy in Tel Aviv until 1994. Relations went sour in the 1980s and 1990s over issues including Israel\u2019s close ties with Turkey and the Arab-Israeli conflict, in which Cyprus sided with Arab states and supported Palestinian statehood. Ties bounced back in the late 1990s and 2000s, as Israel began turning to the Eastern Mediterranean for economic partnerships, especially after the discovery of natural gas in the region. Experts say Israel has also looked to Cyprus as a partner to thwart regional threats, particularly from Turkey and Iran-linked groups. Israel has in recent years used Cypriot territory to train its troops on possible war with Hezbollah. Cyprus\u2019 terrain is similar to that of Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said, according to Israeli media. In 2022, the IDF conducted a joint military drill with Cypriot forces. Some of the joint training focused on fighting multiple fronts and focusing on battling Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israeli media reported. Their latest exercises were conducted in May 2023 in Cyprus. The Cypriot presidency said on X on Thursday that the country \u201chas never facilitated and will not facilitate any aggressive action or attack against any country.\u201d What has Cyprus\u2019 role been in the Gaza war? Cyprus has been keen to dispel any suggestions that it is implicated in the Gaza war, noting its humanitarian efforts that helped bring some aid into Gaza. \u201cThe Republic of Cyprus is not part of the problem. The Republic of Cyprus is part of the solution,\u201d said Christodoulides, the president. \u201cAnd our role in this, as demonstrated, for example, through the humanitarian corridor, is recognized not only by the Arab world but by the international community as a whole.\u201d In March, Cyprus began allowing aid ships to sail from its ports as part of international efforts to create a humanitarian aid route via sea toward Gaza. The first maritime shipment to Gaza carried 200 tons of food, which equates to roughly 500,000 meals. An EU logistics hub was also set up in Cyprus to facilitate the flow of aid into Gaza. Nicosia has criticized some of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, especially those that have hampered the delivery of humanitarian aid. In April, it issued a joint statement with the UAE, condemning the deadly Israeli attack on the World Central Kitchen charity group that killed seven people. It has also repeatedly condemned Hamas for its October 7 attack on Israel. What is the likelihood of Cyprus getting more deeply involved? The island has previously been caught in the crossfire of regional conflicts, a reminder of its proximity to the volatile Middle East. In 2019, a suspected Russian-made missile exploded over the region of northern Cyprus. Cypriot officials believed the missile was linked to military operations in Syria, saying it landed less than 15 (24km) miles north of the capital Nicosia. A scenario in which Israel uses Cypriot bases for its military forces, which Hezbollah warned against, would \u201ceffectively expand Gaza war into the European Union,\u201d Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran analyst and editor of Amwaj.media, wrote on X. It would mean that an EU country is, for the first time, directly involved in an expanded Gaza war. Some experts say that the prospect of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict breaking out into an all- out war is unlikely, however, as neither side want such an escalation. \u201cHezbollah\u2019s release of drone footage of sensitive positions inside Israel is meant as a deterrent to Israel,\u201d Lina Khatib, associate fellow in the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN, referring to the 9-minute drone video released by Hezbollah on Tuesday, showing civilian and military locations in and around the Israeli city Haifa. \u201cIt is normal for both Israel and Hezbollah to have military plans in place for handling a potential escalation. But as things stand, neither Israel nor Hezbollah benefits from all-out war,\u201d Khatib said, adding that \u201cHezbollah knows that war with Israel would be devastating for Lebanon and that there is no popular appetite for such a scenario in the country.\u201d The Biden administration is also unlikely to let Israel fight a two-front war on its own, she said, adding that US involvement may pull in \u201cother Iran-backed actors as well as the potential for Iran itself to be targeted.\u201d \u201cThis is a high cost that Iran wants to avoid paying,\u201d she said. \u201cThe US also does not want to find itself in another Middle East quagmire, especially with presidential elections looming.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/middleeast/hezbollah-warns-cyprus-israel-gaza-war-explainer-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_middleeast_israel-west-bank-bezalel-smotrich-settlements-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has spoken about preventing the occupied West Bank from becoming a part of an independent Palestinian state, according to leaked audio of a speech he gave earlier this month. Smotrich, a leading far right member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet, said the way to prevent a Palestinian state that would endanger the state of Israel was to develop Jewish settlements. \u201cThe goal is to change the DNA of the system for many, many years,\u201d he told the gathering. The transcript and audio of the speech were provided to CNN by the Israeli NGO Peace Now, which had a representative in the room during the speech. Israel\u2019s Supreme Court defines Israeli control over the West Bank as a temporary military occupation rather than the annexation of territory under a civilian administration. But Smotrich, who lives in a settlement himself, has opposed the creation of an independent Palestinian state. He has also long advocated for the expansion of Jewish settlements that are considered illegal under international law and by much of the international community. Smotrich\u2019s office confirmed Friday that the speech had taken place. In a press release earlier this month, his office said Smotrich would be attending an event about Jewish settlement - and the goal was \u201cpreventing a terrorist state in the heart of the State of Israel.\u201d The press release noted \u201cthe structural changes that the Minister is leading in the Ministry of Defense and the Settlement Directorate that he established in the Ministry.\u201d Smotrich was quoted then as saying: \u201cAfter October 7th it is a consensus in Israeli society. The way is to develop settlements and we are focusing on doing broad structural processes that will result in the State of Israel developing settlements in an orderly manner.\u201d In the audio, Smotrich said that a separate civilian system had been created for the occupied West Bank, even as the Defense Ministry remained in control of the area. \u201cWe created a separate civilian system, there is an office within the Ministry of Defense. There is a minister there. There is an administration there, it\u2019s like an office, there is a CEO for the administration, he is accepted as the CEO of a government office, there is a whole system within the administration,\u201d Smotrich said. As more countries call for an independent Palestinian state, Smotrich spoke about the extensive planning powers of the minister and administration and the prospect of developing mass transit and road systems in the West Bank over the next few years to encourage settlement there. \u201cThis is a revolution: this is how you bring a million people to Judea and Samaria,\u201d Smotrich said, using the term by which many Israelis describe the occupied territory. In his half-hour speech, Smotrich said he was able \u201cto convince the Prime Minister\u201d, Benjamin Netanyahu, about creating a civilian administration in the West Bank. \u201cI will say a good word about him because, to his credit, it will be said that as soon as he understood the event, he was fully with us.\u201d CNN is reaching out to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office for a response. The official position of the government is that the status of the West Bank is subject to future negotiations. Israel has expanded settlements in the occupied West Bank over decades despite signing a series of peace agreements with the Palestinians in the 1990s, called the Oslo Accords, that envisaged the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza as part of a negotiated resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/middleeast/israel-west-bank-bezalel-smotrich-settlements-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_style_gen-z-bridal-fashion-trends-bof", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Just an hour after getting engaged in Venice, Italy last year, Christyne de Quesada began scouring the internet for white dresses to wear to her many upcoming wedding-related events: An engagement party, a bachelorette weekend, a civil ceremony at a courthouse and a bigger celebration in Mexico City. But the Miami-based human resources manager had a hard time finding good quality, under $1,000 ensembles that reflected her personality. \u201cIt actually drove me a bit crazy,\u201d de Quesada said. \u201cI bought about seven things and returned all of them.\u201d Instead, she decided to look beyond classic bridal wear brands and retailers. She eventually settled on an ivory two-piece set by Shanghai-based label ShuShu Tong, which she bought from the e-tailer Ssense, for her civil ceremony, a Vera Wang gown she describes as \u201ctraditional and very princess-like\u201d for her Mexico City wedding ceremony and a bespoke ivory skirt and corset set by Florida-based bridal designer Gabriella Arango, complete with Gucci shoes, for the reception. Millennial and Gen-Z brides-to-be like de Quesada are no longer shopping for just a wedding dress, but an entire wardrobe for pre- and post-wedding events. That breadth is propelling the global bridal wear market, which is projected to grow at a rate of 3.5 percent annually and is expected to reach $83.5 billion by 2030, according to the Global Bridal Wear Market Industry report. But it\u2019s not companies like David\u2019s Bridal (which filed for bankruptcy and sold to Cion Investment Corp last year) that are benefitting. In order to find less cookie-cutter ensembles that are more reflective of their personal style, this new generation of brides are shopping outside the traditional bridal market. \u201cThe bridal industry is very much like an old boys club. They live by \u2018If it\u2019s not broken, don\u2019t fix it\u2019 and are very comfortable with the limited options that they\u2019ve given you,\u201d said Caroline Crawford Patterson, a bridal stylist and designer. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is that the consumer is different and there\u2019s a big opportunity to shake things up.\u201d New opportunities in the bridal market After the industry was brought largely to a halt in 2020, weddings returned to pre-pandemic levels last year, with couples hosting over 2 million parties\u00a0, according to The Wedding Report. But the post-pandemic bridal wear landscape is remarkably different. Historically, brides have been limited to independent boutiques, department stores and chains like David\u2019s Bridal. Now, though, brides-to-be are open to wearing any white dress and are casting a wider net. It\u2019s an evolution of a space that was stagnant for a long time. \u201cSalons could get away with offering dresses that weren\u2019t chic or suited the fashion-forward bride or weren\u2019t size inclusive and the consumer, who is already spending a lot of money, just had to bear it,\u201d said Crawford Patterson, who got married in 2021. Anthropologie was one of the first non-bridal retailers to enter the space with the launch of its Bhldn line in 2011. (It\u2019s now called Anthropologie Weddings.) Today, Reformation, Abercrombie & Fitch and Revolve all offer wedding edits on their websites, as does The RealReal. Even fast fashion brands like ASOS, Forever 21, Lulus and Shein are increasing the number of bridal styles they carry. It\u2019s not just mass retail taking advantage. New York-based designer Jackson Wiederhoeft launched a made-to-order bridal segment in 2020 and now spends up to a year and a half developing wedding dresses for clients including initial appointments, fittings, alterations and advising. Despite the investment in time and resources, Wiederhoeft says the effort is \u201cworth it,\u201d as they get to develop an intimate relationship with consumers. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a dress for many people, it is the dress,\u201d said Wiederhoeft. For an emerging designer like Wiederhoeft, bridal is something of a safety net, serving as \u201ca floating line of credit\u201d for the rest of their business. With bridal, Wiederhoeft is able to collect 100 percent of the garment\u2019s cost upfront and directly from the client in order to pay for production, material and overhead costs. A Wiederhoeft wedding dress can cost between $3,000 and $25,000 for ready-to-wear bridal garments; pricing for custom dresses starts at $25,000. And unlike ready-to-wear, the brand\u2019s bridal segment is not subject to discounting. \u201cSome of the garments I made in my apartment four years ago are still in our showroom. I still use them as sale samples, and the styles are quite evergreen,\u201d they said. \u201cWhereas ready-to-wear has the shelf life of an avocado.\u201d What today\u2019s brides want \u2014 and don\u2019t As younger Millennials and Gen-Zers, the oldest of whom turn 27 this year, approach the altar, their ceremonies can differ greatly from previous generations, including their parents. (According to the US Census Bureau, the average American woman is 28.6 years old when they get married and the average American man is 30.5 years old.) Young people today are more likely to support same-sex and interracial marriage, enter into non-traditional relationships such as polyamory, and are more likely to forgo marriage entirely in favor of cohabiting with a partner long-term, according to research from Pew Research Center. \u201cSome of my clients are trying to push against the grain of conventional weddings and are focused on spending money on a house,\u201d said Hillary Taymour, founder and creative director of Collina Strada, who said her clients are looking to splurge on pieces that can be re-worn. Taymour said that today\u2019s brides believe \u201canything can be a wedding outfit.\u201d Her clients are opting for colorful designs and unconventional jewelry, including the brand\u2019s frog ring, which typically retails for $80, that couples have commissioned as engagement or wedding bands to mark the occasion. Catering to a broader spectrum of bridal wear can be beneficial even for a business with a historic focus in the sector, said Andrew Kwon, founder and creative director of his namesake label. He launched an eveningwear line alongside bridal in 2022. \u201cOne of the main challenges with bridal is the lack of repeat clients,\u201d said Kwon. \u201cTapping into eveningwear and colored dress has allowed me to bring in non-traditional brides, their bridesmaids and even their mothers into the fold.\u201d Retailers hoping to capture this new, forward-thinking bridal consumer are updating their assortment to reflect changing attitudes towards weddings. Last month, e-commerce retailer Ssense launched its second \u201canti-bridal\u201d capsule collection which featured unorthodox gowns, flower girl dresses and accessories. \u201cWe speak to an audience that\u2019s very open-minded and fluid,\u201d said Brigitte Chartrand, vice president of womenswear buying and the Everything Else segment at Ssense. \u201cThe products we commissioned didn\u2019t feel necessarily classic \u2026 it brings that differentiation of what bridal could be.\u201d This article was originally published by\u00a0The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

{"id": "2024_06_14_tech_apple-openai-partnership", "text": "When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attended Apple\u2019s annual developer conference this week, he walked the campus, mingling with current and former executives, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Nearly an hour later, the iPhone maker announced a much-rumored partnership with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT technology to devices later this year. But Altman, who has emerged as the poster child for generative AI in the 18 months since the launch of ChatGPT, was not featured in Apple\u2019s formal presentation, neither in person or via livestream. Nor did he join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives in a private press event about privacy and security and the partnership between the two companies. \u201cI was not surprised Sam Altman did not appear on stage,\u201d said Ben Wood, an analyst at market research firm CCS Insight in an interview with CNN. \u201cApple had to manage the message carefully. OpenAI is merely the vehicle to address broader AI-powered inquiries that are not core to the Apple experience. Having him in the livestream would have only created an unnecessary level of confusion.\u201d Earlier this week, Apple showed off a handful of AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall \u2013 the majority of which are fueled by the company\u2019s own proprietary technology, called Apple Intelligence. The company will offer OpenAI\u2019s viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity, usually only when Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry. The move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continues to face concerns from researchers, industry experts and government officials around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more. The deal also comes at a time when the industry is moving quickly, and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to engage with the technology responsibly. Apple hopes that a big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales as the device has languished without a major upgrade for years and users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices as a result. An uncertain economic environment is also weighing on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was recently passed by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. In the 60 hours after Apple\u2019s Monday event, however, the company\u2019s stock price (AAPL) rose by as much as 10%, boosting Apple\u2019s market capitalization by more than $300 billion, rocketing past Nvidia and putting Apple back in contention with Microsoft for largest market value. The timing is further noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the latest buzzy technology. \u201cApple needed to deliver an AI story and Apple Intelligence should help placate nervous investors and reassure them that Apple is keeping pace with its rivals,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe partnership with ChatGPT is a major development which beefs up Apple\u2019s AI offerings, and new features like a significantly improved Siri will be welcome to users.\u201d But the partnership could also open Apple up to some vulnerability, as it has no control over OpenAI\u2019s models or what it does with user inputs. Apple alignment with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could also cause some challenges down the road. A limited partnership Although Apple has been working on its own AI program for years, a partnership with OpenAI marks a way for it to fill in the competitive gaps. When a user has a question beyond Siri\u2019s scope, ChatGPT can step in. In the demo following the keynote, Apple showed CNN how someone could upload a picture of vegetables at a farmer\u2019s market and ask what they could make for dinner. Siri may suggest that the question is better suited for ChatGPT, and provide the user with a prompt to give consent to use the service. Apple using ChatGPT as a complimentary service could potentially cut down on risks associated with the company. It\u2019s also very possible Apple could partner with other AI companies in the future too, such as Google\u2019s Gemini or more niche providers with certain expertise, such as in healthcare. \u201cI think Apple will take a pragmatic approach to the OpenAI partnership,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf Apple finds that the relationship with OpenAI starts to affect the overall user experience or worse, create challenges around security and data integrity, it might look to add further guardrails, or find other ways to deliver AI-powered content.\u201d A focus on privacy and security Apple has been vocal about how it intends to keep user data private and secure when using its own proprietary technology, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone and inputs will be kept away from a far-off server cloud. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up,\u201d he added. Apple said it will not share any personal user information with OpenAI, so inquiries made through ChatGPT won\u2019t be linked to an Apple user\u2019s account. And the repeated consent prompt to require users to opt into using ChatGPT with Siri is noteworthy too; each time Siri wants to kick over a question to ChatGPT, it\u2019ll ask for permission first. Wood believes the consent prompts and other guardrails that Apple is implementing \u201creflect its nervousness.\u201d Meanwhile, Reece Hayden, a principal analyst at ABI Research, told CNN that Apple\u2019s approach is smart because it provides customers with a choice of how to deal with their data. \u201cBy providing a phased approach that blends ChatGPT and native capabilities, users will worry less about the partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cApple can also continue to highlight their own AI capabilities and mitigate some of the risks of being associated with OpenAI, which remains in a state of flux.\u201d Industry concerns Companies like OpenAI have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but many experts, researchers and AI employees believe they should be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures. Just last week, a group of OpenAI insiders demanded that artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about the concerns over the technology they\u2019re building. So it came as no surprise when some industry watchers, including Elon Musk, were quick to react to Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI. In a post to X Monday, Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies \u2014 which include Tesla, SpaceX and X, among others \u2014 if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans. If Apple \u201cintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,\u201d Musk said that would constitute \u201can unacceptable security violation.\u201d Although concerns over how employees are using AI models is a topic of worldwide discussion at the moment across many industries, Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said Musk\u2019s reaction is a bit misdirected and the topic is not specific to iPhones. \u201cAny employee with a smartphone should follow company policies and not enter any private information into the open domain of ChatGPT,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not specific to the iPhone \u2026 or Tesla.\u201d Andrew Cornwall, senior analyst at Forrester, told CNN he thinks it\u2019s unlikely that Apple users will become loyal to ChatGPT, as many people won\u2019t use the service unless the iPhone maker can\u2019t provide an appropriate response. \u201cWhen users do query ChatGPT, Apple will track the prompts and gather metrics to improve its own models,\u201d he said. \u201cApple may switch providers or even use more than one third party \u2014 until it has mastered its own model. At that point, Apple will shut the garden gate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/tech/apple-openai-partnership/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_china_china-taiwan-quarantine-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "China\u2019s military could isolate Taiwan, cripple its economy, and make the democratic island succumb to the will of Beijing\u2019s ruling Communist Party without ever firing a shot, a prominent think tank warns. Fears the Communist Party might make good on its promise to one day take control of Taiwan, by force if necessary, have been heightened in recent years by Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s increasingly bellicose actions towards the self-ruled island. China\u2019s refusal\u00a0to condemn Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has only added to those fears. In such a scenario, analysts and military strategists have long focused on two key options available to China \u2013 a full-scale invasion or a military blockade. But a Washington think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), warns there is a third way, one that will make it far harder for the United States and other like-minded democracies to counter: Quarantine. Using \u201cgray zone\u201d tactics \u2013 actions just below what might be considered acts of war \u2013 the China Coast Guard, its so-called maritime militia and various police and maritime safety agencies could initiate a full or partial quarantine of Taiwan, possibly cutting off access to its ports and stopping vital supplies like energy from reaching the island\u2019s 23 million people, a newly released report from CSIS says. The naval, air and ground components of the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), the world\u2019s largest military force, might play only auxiliary and support roles, authors Bonny Lin, Brian Hart, Matthew Funaiole, Samantha Lu and Truly Tinsley write. \u201cChina has significantly increased pressure on Taiwan in recent years, stoking fears that tensions could erupt into outright conflict. Much attention has been paid to the threat of an invasion, but Beijing has options besides invading to coerce, punish, or annex Taiwan,\u201d the report says. At the Shangri-La Dialogue defense summit in Singapore earlier this month, Chinese Defense Minister Adm. Dong Jun warned those who support any moves for Taiwan independence will \u201cend up in self-destruction.\u201d \u201cWe will take resolute actions to curb Taiwan independence and make sure such a plot never succeeds,\u201d said Dong, speaking through a translator, while slamming \u201cexternal interfering forces\u201d for selling arms and having \u201cillegal official contacts\u201d with Taiwan. China\u2019s escalating gray zone tactics were on stark display this week as China Coast Guard vessels clashed with Philippine Navy boats in the South China Sea. Videos showed Beijing\u2019s troops threatening Filipinos with an axe and other bladed weapons, and Manila said one of its soldiers lost a thumb in a Chinese-instigated collision. The level of violence was a major step up from previous clashes near Second Thomas Shoal, where the Philippines maintains an outpost on a beached warship in waters claimed by both Beijing and Manila. Similarly, Beijing\u2019s military and economic intimidation of Taiwan, a highly developed free-market economy, has grown much more pronounced under Xi. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party claims the island as its own, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to \u201creunify\u201d with it, by force if necessary. But the CSIS report says Beijing has strong options that could not only keep the PLA out of the fight but could actually put the island democracy or its supporters like the United States in the role of initiators of military conflict to preserve Taiwan\u2019s autonomy. The report notes that the China Coast Guard \u2013 like most coast guards around the world \u2013 is considered a law-enforcement agency. This means it can stop and regulate shipping around the island in what is termed a quarantine, which differs from a blockade. \u201cA quarantine (is) a law enforcement\u2013led operation to control maritime or air traffic within a specific area while a blockade is foremost military in nature,\u201d the report says. International law considers a blockade an act of war, experts say. \u201cA quarantine led by China\u2019s coast guard is not a declaration of war against Taiwan,\u201d the report says, and would put the US in a difficult position, its authors warn. Washington is legally required \u2013 under the Taiwan Relations Act \u2013 to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and it supplies it with defensive weaponry. US President Joe Biden has gone further than the legal requirement, saying repeatedly he would use American troops to protect Taiwan, a warning that appeared to deviate from Washington\u2019s previous stance of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d and one that the White House officials have walked back. But if US military ships or aircraft intervened in what China says is a law enforcement operation, the US could be seen as initiating military hostilities. The report puts the China Coast Guard numbers at 150 ocean-going vessels and 400 smaller ones, like the PLA Navy, the world\u2019s largest force in terms of fleet size. Beijing has hundreds of more vessels in its Maritime Safety Agency and maritime militia, fishing boats integrated into China\u2019s military and law enforcement services. Taiwan\u2019s coast guard, with only 10 ocean-going ships and about 160 smaller ones, lacks the numbers to push back a quarantine effort, the report says. The CSIS authors note that quarantine actions taken by Beijing could be extremely limited and still have the effect of strangling Taiwan economically. Few operators would want to face the possibility of having their assets seized by Chinese authorities and might voluntarily stop servicing the island. \u201cDemonstrated Chinese willingness to search and seize only a handful of commercial ships could have an outsized deterrent impact and discourage similar transgressions,\u201d the report states. Limited search and/or seizure actions have an effect on flights to Taiwan as a quarantine can easily be extended to the air, the report states. Only a handful of flights would need to be warned off by Chinese aircraft to have a stifling effect on all traffic, according to the report. China regularly flies military aircraft around the island, sometimes dozens in a day. In the 24  hours ending at 6 a.m. Friday, 36 Chinese military aircraft crossed into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone, Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry says. Meanwhile, a quarantine, rather than a blockade, would not require China to close or restrict access to the Taiwan Strait, the CSIS report notes. That means Washington and its allies could lose one of their biggest claims to intervene under international law, preserving freedom of navigation in an international waterway. \u201cIf the quarantine is cast as a law enforcement operation, China can easily announce the end of the operation and claim its objectives were met,\u201d the report says. To keep things even more low-key, China might not even need to use the word \u201cquarantine\u201d to begin an operation to isolate Taiwan, the authors say. Under its claims that Taiwan is Chinese territory, Beijing could require customs declarations to be filed before vessels can call in Taiwan. For those that fail to comply, enforcement mechanisms could have a chilling effect on all shipping. \u201cChinese law enforcement vessels will be authorized to board vessels, conduct on-site inspections, question personnel, and undertake other measures against noncompliant ships,\u201d the report said. This idea allows a limited scope of operations for China. For instance, it could just target the island\u2019s busiest port, Kaohsiung, responsible for 57% of Taiwan\u2019s maritime imports and most of its energy imports, according to the study. Plausible, but still fraught with risk for China Outside analysts who reviewed the CSIS report and spoke to CNN found it plausible. But they also harbored important doubts about how things might play out. Some mentioned how the economics don\u2019t necessarily play in Beijing\u2019s favor. \u201cMaintaining the quarantine will be expensive and time consuming,\u201d said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center. \u201cTaipei won\u2019t give up in under 60 days,\u201d Schuster contends. \u201cCan Beijing sustain the effort and possible international reaction for that long?\u201d Efforts to upset the status quo across the Taiwan Strait could further erode Beijing\u2019s foreign trade, the experts warn. Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King\u2019s College in London, notes the challenges the Chinese Communist Party is already facing with an economy still struggling to recover from Covid-19 isolation that has seen growth rates plummet and new trade restrictions, like tariffs on its electric vehicle exports. Taiwan is a prominent industrialized economy, a crucial node in global supply chains\u00a0and a manufacturer of the vast majority of the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors. A quarantine on the island would have economic repercussions not just domestically, but globally. While most nations diplomatically recognize Beijing over Taiwan, the island has forged increasingly strong unofficial relations with major western democracies, deepening those ties in recent years as Beijing\u2019s threats have hardened. Taiwan and China are also deeply economically intertwined. Last year, 35% of the island\u2019s exports went to the Chinese mainland, most of which were integrated circuits, solar cells and electronic components, according to Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Economic Affairs. Imports from the mainland accounted for 20% of the island\u2019s total imports in the same year. Between 1991 and 2022, Taiwanese companies invested a total of $203 billion in the mainland, according to Taiwan government statistics, creating millions of jobs in China. Additionally, quarantines can push populations to rally with the government, rather than rise up against it, says Sidharth Kaushal, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cHistorical evidence shows that even severe blockades have limited coercive value, and a limited quarantine might result in a rally around the flag effect,\u201d he says. A quarantine could also push Taiwan\u2019s government to declare independence, something Beijing has repeatedly said would likely bring armed conflict, Kaushal warns. \u201cThis would then leave the (Communist Party) with the options of either escalation or a major setback,\u201d he says. Patalano says for China, patience is the key to realizing its goal of \u201creunification.\u201d Escalation, and certainly invasion, is not \u201ccost-efficient,\u201d he says. War costs not only lives but national wealth.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/china/china-taiwan-quarantine-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_asia_north-korea-russia-putin-visit-thursday-intl-hnk", "text": "Vladimir Putin said Russia and North Korea have ramped up ties to a \u201cnew level,\u201d pledging to help each other if either nation is attacked in a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d new partnership announced during the Russian president\u2019s rare visit to the reclusive state. Thousands of North Koreans chanting \u201cwelcome Putin\u201d\u00a0lined the city\u2019s wide boulevards brandishing Russian and North Korean flags and bouquets of flowers, as Putin kicked off his first visit to North Korea in 24 years with a finely choreographed display of influence in the dictatorship. The pair then signed the new strategic partnership to replace previous deals signed in 1961, 2000 and 2001, according to Russian state news agency TASS. \u201cThe comprehensive partnership agreement signed today includes, among other things, the provision of mutual assistance in the event of aggression against one of the parties to this agreement,\u201d Putin said after the meeting. He said the deal encompasses the \u201cpolitical, trade, investment, cultural spheres, and the security sphere as well,\u201d calling the pact \u201ctruly a breakthrough document.\u201d Putin said joint drills involving the United States, South Korea and Japan were \u201chostile\u201d toward North Korea,\u201d characterizing the US policy as \u201cconfrontational.\u201d Kim, meanwhile, called the new \u201calliance\u201d a \u201cwatershed moment in the development of the bilateral relations.\u201d But the deal between the two autocrats raised many questions, too \u2013 including whether Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent now extends to North Korea, and vice versa, or whether the two nations will now hold joint military drills. Putin greeted with fanfare Putin was met with exuberant celebrations at a welcome ceremony with his counterpart at Kim Il Sung Square in the heart of the North Korean capital, where mounted soldiers, military personnel and children holding balloons cheered against the backdrop of large portraits of the each leader. The two leaders presented their respective officials and stood together as the Russian national anthem played before riding off standing shoulder to shoulder in an open-top limousine as they smiled and waved to the crowds. The scenes of pomp and fanfare were a constant throughout the day, which closed with Kim escorting Putin to his plane late in the evening ahead of his trip to Vietnam. The staging reflected North Korea\u2019s reliance on Moscow and was likely intended as a reminder to the West that Putin still holds considerable influence in at least some corners of the world, after his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The relationship is important to Russia, too. Multiple governments have accused Pyongyang of supplying arms to Moscow for its grinding war in Ukraine, a charge both countries have denied, despite significant evidence of such transfers. On Wednesday Putin gave Kim an Aurus car when the two leaders exchanged gifts, according to Russian state media \u2013 the second time Putin has given his counterpart this car model. According to Putin\u2019s aide Yuri Ushakov, the Russian leader also presented Kim with a tea set. Ushakov did not specify what Putin received, but said they were \u201calso good gifts.\u201d Putin landed in North Korea in the early hours of Wednesday local time, exactly 24 years to the day he was last in Pyongyang, for a visit heralding the countries\u2019 deepening alignment in the face of shared animosity toward the West and international concerns over their growing military cooperation. In remarks ahead of talks between the two, Kim voiced his \u201cfull support and solidarity with the struggles of the Russian government, military and the people,\u201d pointing specifically to Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine \u201cto protect its own sovereignty, safety and territorial stability.\u201d \u201cSituations continue to be complicated and ever-changing, but I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that we will continue to strengthen and closely engage in strategic communication with the (Russian) leadership,\u201d Kim added. Putin hailed the countries\u2019 ties as based on \u201cequality and mutual respect,\u201d and said an expected new bilateral agreement would \u201cform the basis of relations between the two states for many years to come,\u201d according to Russian state agency TASS. He also added that he hoped Kim would visit Moscow for their next meeting. The burgeoning relationship has sparked concern in both Seoul and Washington, not only over North Korea\u2019s arms transfers to Russia, but also the prospect of Moscow transferring its superior military technology to aid Pyongyang\u2019s heavily sanctioned weapons program. \u2018Unwavering support\u2019 Kim, the third generation leader of a dynasty that has ruled North Korea with an iron fist, beamed visibly as he greeted Putin at the airport in the early hours of Wednesday morning, video footage of the Russian leader\u2019s arrival showed. The landmark visit marks a significant boost for Kim, who remains isolated on the world stage and has not hosted another world leader in his capital since the pandemic. It comes as tensions remain elevated on the Korean Peninsula, where Kim in recent months has ramped up bellicose language and scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea amid alarm in Pyongyang over tightening coordination between the US, South Korea and Japan. North Korea state media appeared to play heavily into the close rapport between Kim and Putin, describing them as \u201cexchanging their pent-up innermost thoughts and opened their minds to more surely develop (North Korea-Russia) relations,\u201d as rode together from the airport to the Kumsusan State Guest House where Putin is staying. Putin\u2019s trip follows\u00a0Kim\u2019s landmark visit to Russia last year, where the two leaders were widely seen as opening this\u00a0new chapter in their relations predicated on Putin\u2019s need for North Korean arms for its ongoing offensive. Russia has received more than 10,000 shipping containers \u2013 the equivalent of\u00a0260,000 metric tons\u00a0of munitions or munitions-related material \u2013 from North Korea since September, according to a US\u00a0statement\u00a0in February. Russian forces have also launched at least 10 North Korea-made missiles on Ukraine since September, a US official also\u00a0said\u00a0in March. The Russian leader is widely seen as looking to ensure this continued support, which may be especially urgent as delayed American military aid to Ukraine comes online. Putin also sought to link today\u2019s meeting to Moscow and Pyongyang\u2019s historic ties. The \u201cexploits of previous generations\u201d were a \u201cgood basis for the development of relations\u201d between the two nations, he told Kim, according to Russian state media TASS. A long history Putin made his last visit to Pyongyang in 2000 for a meeting with Kim\u2019s late father and predecessor Kim Jong Il. That trip, weeks after Putin\u2019s inauguration for his first term as president, made him the first Russian head of state to visit North Korea. The elder Kim then visited Moscow in 2001, taking a marathon nine-day rail trip across Russia for the meeting, in what was only his second overseas trip after an earlier visit to China. The two countries in 2000 also inked a new cooperation agreement. Unlike a 1961 document between the Soviet Union and North Korea, that new iteration did not include reference to mutual military defense assistance, but was seen as an important step in reviving a fraught and closely linked relationship. The two neighbors have deep ties on the Korean Peninsula. Kim\u2019s grandfather Kim Il Sung rose to power in the late 1940s as part of Soviet efforts to install a communist-controlled government in the north to rival a US-backed government in the south following the defeat of the Japanese imperial army during World War II. But tightly integrated relations frayed and transformed in the intervening decades, as the Soviet Union collapsed and the new state of Russia established diplomatic relations with Seoul and supported multiple United Nations sanctions on North Korea\u2019s weapons program. The latest raft of diplomacy comes as shared frustrations with the West have driven the two countries closer \u2013 a trend observers say has now been accelerated by the war in Ukraine and has seen North Korea gain a powerful friend in the UN Security Council.

{"id": "2024_06_21_europe_italy-indian-farm-worker-death-intl-latam", "text": "The death of an Indian\u00a0migrant\u00a0worker in Italy, who was reportedly abandoned on a road after his arm was severed at work, has sparked outrage and prompted calls for a demonstration on Saturday in the town of Latina, in the country\u2019s central Lazio region. Satnam Singh,\u00a0a 31-year-old farm worker, was left on the street\u00a0Monday\u00a0after losing his right\u00a0arm while working at\u00a0a farm near Latina, which is southeast of Rome, CNN\u2019s affiliate SkyTG24 reported. His arm was reportedly severed by a plastic wrapping machine on the farm. Singh died days later and has come to symbolize the plight of vulnerable migrant workers in the country, with several trade unions and Latina\u2019s Indian community organizing demonstrations in the following days. Italian state broadcaster RAI said Singh was hooked by the plastic wrapping machine, towed by a tractor, which severed his right arm and crushed his lower limbs. Singh was then loaded into a van and abandoned near his home, while his severed arm was left in a vegetable collection box, RAI reported. He died\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0at\u00a0the San Camillo\u00a0hospital in Rome. An investigation into farm owner Antonello\u00a0Lovato \u2013 who allegedly left the injured Singh outside his home after the incident \u2013 has now been opened over potential charges of manslaughter and failure to assist a person in danger, Reuters reported, citing lead prosecutor Giuseppe De Falco. Singh did not have a regular contract or a residence permit, according to SkyTG24, and had been working at the same company for Italy for two years. CNN has reached out to De Falco and to Lovato\u2019s lawyers for comment, as well as to the Indian government. Lovato\u2019s father, Renzo Lovato told\u00a0RAI\u00a0that Singh had been warned \u201cnot to approach the vehicle\u201d and that \u201cthere is sadness because a man died at work and it should never happen. The\u00a0family\u2019s\u00a0lawyer, Valerio Righi, told Reuters that\u00a0Antonello Lovato \u201cspontaneously went to the judicial police an hour after the events, as any decent person would do,\u201d\u00a0adding that his client was waiting for the charges to be formalized to defend himself. Responding to allegations that Singh was abandoned without calls to an ambulance, Righi said, \u201cYou will see during the proceedings that maybe help was called sooner than people think.\u201d The farm worker\u2019s death has shocked the country. Italy Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed\u00a0her condolences and\u00a0strongly condemned Singh\u2019s death at\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0cabinet meeting. \u201cThese are inhumane acts that do not belong to the Italian people, and I hope that this barbarism will be harshly punished,\u201d she said in a statement. \u2018Unprecedented brutality\u2019 Trade unions met with the Italian\u00a0Labor Minister Marina Elvira Calderone and Agriculture\u00a0Minister Francesco Lollobrigida on Friday to discuss changes needed to prevent such events from happening again. What happened to Satnam Singh is \u201cmuch more than an injury: it is an inhuman act of barbarism in which those who abandoned him demonstrated that they had no regard for the value of human life,\u201d Calderone said Thursday in an interview with RAI, calling for exemplary punishments against exploitation at work. Several trade unions have organized a demonstration for Saturday in Latina and called for a two-hour strike to demand \u201cdignity and respect for the health and safety of workers\u201d and to urge political and social forces to combat worker exploitation and inhuman work conditions. Trade unions have also organized a fundraiser to raise funds for Singh\u2019s family, with some condemning Italy\u2019s gangmastering system, which involves the illegal recruitment and exploitation of agricultural workers. In a press release on Wednesday, trade union leader Maria Grazia Gabrielli called the incident one of \u201cunprecedented brutality\u201d. She said the incident was a result of \u201cthe irregularity in which we relegate thousands of\u00a0migrants who arrive in our country in search of hope.\u201d She said migrants found themselves as \u201cslaves of contemporary society, irregular, without a residence permit, and therefore more susceptible to blackmail by those who consider work only for profit, and rights - such as that of assistance - only as obstacles.\u201d Gabrielli added that exploitation in the fields often results in \u201cstarvation wages, unsafe and inhuman working rhythms and conditions, psychological and physical violence which unfortunately also lead to terrible events like the one in Latina.\u201d The Indian community of Latina will take to the streets on June 25\u00a0 to take part in a demonstration in memory of Singh, and will deliver an open letter to the prefect of Latina, Maurizio Falco calling for action and denunciation of the incident, according to RAI. According to a report from Italy\u2019s biggest labor union, CGIL, and labor union FLAI, in 2021 there were approximately 230,000 irregular workers employed in the primary sector, which largely includes non-resident foreigners employed in agriculture.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/europe/italy-indian-farm-worker-death-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Heavy combat is underway at an aggregate plant on the northern edge of Vovchansk, according to military bloggers on both sides of the conflict. One Ukrainian squad commander,\u00a0Stanislav Buniatov, known as Osman,\u00a0described the situation in Vovchansk, east of Kharkiv and a few miles from the state border, as \u201cdifficult but controlled\u201d and said Russian troops are \u201csurrounded\u201d. \u201cOur guys are not losing their positions, occasionally conducting successful assaults, liberating positions and pushing the enemy back,\u201d Buniatov said in a post on Telegram on Sunday. Russian forces began coming across the border in numbers last month in a multi-pronged assault that the Kremlin said was designed to create a buffer zone that would prevent the Ukrainians from striking Russian cities such as Belgorod. At first they took several villages close to the border and advanced to the edge of Vovchansk, which was recaptured by Ukrainian forces in September 2022 after being occupied for several months. DeepState \u2013 a Ukrainian monitoring group \u2013 says small groups of Russian soldiers have repeatedly attempted to secure the aggregate plant, but have been repelled by Ukraine forces. Suggesting that resupply to the Russian soldiers has become difficult, DeepState says that food and water are being delivered to them by drones. Videos, geolocated by CNN, shows Ukrainian drones striking the plant in recent days. Russian military blogger WarGonzo said on Telegram that fighting in the area is \u201cfierce\u201d as \u201cUkrainian troops are carrying out counterattacks, trying to dislodge the Russian Armed Forces from their occupied positions\u201d but did not mention troops being surrounded. On Sunday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said in a statement that \u201ctroops improved the situation along the front line and defeated the manpower and equipment\u201d of Ukrainian troops in the \u201careas of the settlements of Vovchansk, Synelnykove and Vovchanski Khutory\u201d in Kharkiv region.

{"id": "2024_06_19_europe_analysis-putin-north-korea-visit-intl", "text": "Vladmir Putin\u2019s first visit to North Korea in nearly a quarter of a century\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0intensely scrutinized around the world. Russia\u00a0knew\u00a0the West\u00a0was\u00a0watching and the optics were not subtle. Putin has been left out of many global gatherings of late, and risks arrest in much of the world thanks to a\u00a0warrant from the International Criminal Court over his invasion of Ukraine. But on Wednesday, the increasingly isolated Russian president was met with a rapturous welcome in Pyongyang. Children waved Russian flags as Putin\u2019s giant picture adorned one side of Kim Il Sung square, while footage broadcast on Russian state media showed posters of the Kremlin leader lining the streets. All of it was a signal to the world that not only is Putin is not isolated, his patronage is still prized in some parts of the globe. And here, unlike in China, no one could accuse him of being the junior partner. Neither the rhetoric of the two leaders, nor the so-called \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership pact\u201d\u00a0they signed,\u00a0left any doubt that the overarching goal was to band together against what Putin described as \u201cthe imperialist policy of the United States and its satellites.\u201d The pact contains a clause similar to NATO\u2019s\u00a0Article V, providing, according to Putin, \u201cfor the provision of mutual assistance in the event of aggression against one of the parties to this agreement.\u201d According to the text of the pact, which was published on Thursday by North Korean state media, Article 4 states that should either country \u201cget into a state of war due to an armed aggression\u201d the other \u201cshall immediately provide military and other assistance with all the means at its disposal.\u201d Putin went on to accuse the West of violating its \u201cinternational responsibilities\u201d by delivering F-16s and other weapons to Ukraine, adding Russia therefore \u201cdoes not rule out the development of military-technical co-operation with the DPRK in accordance with the document signed today.\u201d In other words, the two are promising to militarily help each other at a time of escalating face-offs with their neighbors and the West.\u00a0And\u00a0this raises major questions. If this is a collective defense pact, does Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent now extend to North Korea\u2019s and vice versa?\u00a0Will that \u201cmilitary-technical cooperation\u201d include holding joint military drills and establishing joint forces to protect their borders?\u00a0Who else could join this pact in the future? \u201cIn a sense this is laying out what they have been already building up in the recent months and years,\u201d said Jo Bee-yun, Associate Research Fellow at Korea Institute for Defense Analyses. \u201cBut definitely I would say this clause is very alarming.\u201d \u201cBecause it\u2019s at the initial stage, depending on how things roll out, they would, if I were them, they would interpret the clause according to their needs.\u201d And there\u2019s the more immediate concern that the \u201cmilitary-technical cooperation\u201d could mean more shells and missiles making their way from North Korean factories to the front lines in Ukraine. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied this is happening, and yet Russia, having once backed UN sanctions that explicitly prevent North Korea from exporting weapons, used this opportunity to again denounce \u201cpolitically motivated sanction.\u201d Back in March, Russia had already used its position on the UN security council to end the mandate of a panel monitoring North Korean sanctions violations. Russian state media did not miss the opportunity to needle the West.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe West admits terrible concern around Putin\u2019s visit to North Korea\u201d\u00a0read\u00a0the headline in Moskovsky Komsomolets, a\u00a0national\u00a0daily newspaper Tuesday.\u00a0 \u201cWhat difference does it make to the Americans if we talk to our neighbor\u00a0[North Korea], why are you getting so worked up?\u201d taunted top Kremlin propagandist Vladimir Solovyov on his Tuesday night talk show, before adding, less reassuringly, \u201cwe are already living in a\u00a0Third World War\u201d. That comment perhaps speaks to another part of Moscow\u2019s strategy:\u00a0Russia may now have calculated that its own nuclear saber-rattling is no\u00a0longer\u00a0enough to prevent the West from stepping up aid to Ukraine. The meeting with Kim Jong UN, and this \u201cbreakthrough\u201d pact, come at the same time as long-awaited US weapons are starting to flow to Ukraine, and some restrictions are being lifted on using them to hit Russia. Russia also needs weapons to keep up its strategy of exhausting and destroying Ukraine into surrender. So while it still may not be in Russia\u2019s strategic interest to provide explicit funding or technology to expand the nuclear arsenal of its unpredictable neighbor \u2013 and risk upsetting China \u2013 it may at least want the West to believe it\u2019s willing to do it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/europe/analysis-putin-north-korea-visit-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_middleeast_israel-gaza-intelligence-accountability-analysis-intl-cmd", "text": "The anger across the streets of Israel has reached a new crescendo, with tens of thousands joining protests billed as a \u201cweek of disruption.\u201d Anti-government demonstrators have blocked major highways, staged walkouts, and called for a general strike. The protesters have not one but several demands: a hostage deal, new elections, military conscription for ultra-Orthodox Jews, more attention to residents of the north and more. Across Israel, signs on buildings and highways call for \u201cElections Now!\u201d and declare alongside pictures of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, \u201cYou are the leader; you are to blame.\u201d But underneath them all lies\u00a0one question which continues to echo across Israel eight months after October 7: How could the most advanced military in the region,\u00a0with its vaunted intelligence apparatus,\u00a0have failed so completely in foreseeing the Hamas terror attack? Calls for a state commission of inquiry into the security and intelligence failures that led to October 7 have grown continually louder, with the Israeli public, opposition lawmakers, the parents of slain and captive Israel Defense Forces (IDF) field observers, and the attorney general demanding an investigation into the deadliest single event in the country\u2019s history. Analysts say it\u2019s not likely to happen under Netanyahu,\u00a0however. And if it does, it may not yield the answers for which the country is searching, even as more reports come out about\u00a0what Israel knew in advance. On Monday, Israel\u2019s public broadcaster, Kan 11, added\u00a0to the growing mountain of evidence that the country\u2019s leadership could have\u00a0\u2013\u00a0or, at the very least, should have\u00a0\u2013\u00a0known an attack was possible. Kan 11 detailed a document from Unit 8200, the IDF\u2019s premier intelligence gathering division, about Hamas\u2019 plans to attack military facilities and communities, and to take between 200 and 250 hostages. The document was dated September 19, 2023, less than three weeks before the October 7 attack. It was especially startling in its accuracy on one particular point: Hamas took 250 hostages. The latest allegations add weight to reports in November from the New York Times and Haaretz newspapers that military intelligence had information\u00a0about Hamas plans to overwhelm Israel\u2019s fortifications around Gaza, allowing\u00a0militants to stream into southern Israel. In December, State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman announced he would open an investigation into intelligence failures before the October 7 Hamas attack. Months later, struggling to get cooperation from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and the Israeli military, Englman wrote in a letter to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and the IDF chief of staff that his duty was \u201cto carry out a comprehensive audit of the greatest failure in the country\u2019s history.\u201d But this week, Israel\u2019s High Court put the investigation on hold after reviewing classified arguments from security agencies \u2013 prompting an exasperated Englman to ask if his teams should \u201cput a up a sign \u2018we\u2019re on a break, will be back in two years\u2019?\u201d Separately, the IDF launched a series of internal investigations earlier this year into the failures leading up to October 7, followed by more limited examinations of individual battles on the day of the attacks. These probes would allow Israel to learn from its failures, even in an ongoing war. The first results are expected to be published in the coming weeks. What\u2019s missing is Israel\u2019s most powerful investigative\u00a0tool\u00a0- a state commission of inquiry - stymied by Netanyahu and his allies, who have tried to delay it until after the war. A state commission of inquiry is an independent body with broad powers, including the ability to compel witnesses to testify. But the primary means of launching such a commission is a government decision, and this government has made clear it\u2019s not anywhere on their\u00a0current\u00a0agenda.\u00a0 Raanan Sulitzeanu-Kenan, a professor of public policy at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, says\u00a0\u201cthe likelihood of an inquiry is very, very low.\u201d \u201cOver 17 years of Netanyahu governments, we had zero number of inquiries,\u201d Sulitzeanu-Kenan says. Historically, Israel has had a public inquiry roughly every two years, he says, but not under its present and longest-serving leader. The purchase of German submarines and surface vessels sparked an inquiry in 2022, but only during Netanyahu\u2019s 18-month spell out of office. \u201cAlthough it is very clear that one should be appointed, the political likelihood is almost zero under the current government,\u201d says Sulitzeanu-Kenan. \u201cOnce you appoint a public inquiry, you send at least an implicit message that something wrong has happened.\u201d In June, Israel\u2019s attorney general said that a commission of inquiry was the \u201cmost appropriate legal means\u201d to investigate the circumstances leading up to the October 7 attack. According to Gali Baharav-Miara, the inquiry could also supersede investigations from \u201cinternational tribunals,\u201d a reference to the International Court of Justice, which is probing Israel for potential war crimes committed during its war in Gaza. But Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet secretary responded that the country was \u201cin the midst of an intense war.\u201d \u201cThe time is not yet ripe to investigate all the events of the war and what preceded it,\u201d wrote Yossi Fuchs in response to Baharav-Miara. State commissions of inquiry can also take a tremendous amount of time, especially if there are questions of systemic failure mixed with issues of personal responsibility, said Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem-based think tank. \u201cWhen you intertwine all (of) them together, you probably might end up with nothing,\u201d Plesner said. The most likely means of understanding the failures of October 7 was by dissecting it into smaller and more manageable issues, he said, like separating intelligence failures from those of operational doctrine. \u201cGiven the complexity of the situation, the political interests involved, and the age of polarization that we live in, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re ever going to have one recognized answer to this question,\u201d said Plesner. Netanyahu told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash in November he would answer \u201call the questions that are required\u201d and \u201cthis whole question will be addressed after the war.\u201d His position has hardly shifted since, marked by\u00a0the denial of\u00a0any responsibility for the failures of October 7. The\u00a0refusal\u00a0of Israel\u2019s self-styled \u201cMr. Security\u201d to take the blame stands in stark contrast to the IDF, where senior officers have resigned over the failure to stop the worst terror attack in the country\u2019s history. Major General Aharon Haliva, who was the commander of the IDF\u2019s military intelligence, quietly announced in April that he would be stepping down. In the days after October 7, he admitted there was an \u201cintelligence failure\u201d in not detecting plans for the attack. Haliva became the first top official to\u00a0accept\u00a0responsibility\u00a0for shortcomings, but not the last. In June, the head of the IDF\u2019s Gaza division, Brig. Gen. Avi Rosenfeld, also said he would resign. In a public letter, he said: \u201cEveryone has to take responsibility for their part.\u201d It is widely expected that other senior military officials will also step down on the conclusion of the IDF\u2019s campaign in Gaza. Former IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot, a member of Israel\u2019s war cabinet until his resignation\u00a0earlier this month, said everyone in a position of leadership needed to step down, including those in \u201c(the IDF\u2019s) Southern Command, the Military Intelligence Directorate, the IDF Chief of Staff, the head of the Shin Bet, the Defense Minister, the Prime Minister.\u201d Eisenkot told Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news: \u201cThe failure is so great that none of them can stay in office.\u201d But with no clear end in sight to the war, that accountability is likely to be a long time coming.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/middleeast/israel-gaza-intelligence-accountability-analysis-intl-cmd/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

The break-in happened during the European Championship match between Italy and Spain, which Baggio was watching on TV with his family, according to local media reports. Baggio tried to defend his family and was hit on the head with a gun, reports said. The incident began around 10 p.m. local time in Italy and lasted for about 40 minutes, Baggio told reporters outside the hospital in Arzignano, northern Italy, where he received stitches on his head for the wound. He and his family members were locked in a room while the burglars ransacked the home. The total value of what was stolen has not been reported, according to local media. The villa and grounds had security cameras and police have not made any arrests yet, according to local police. \u201cFirst of all, my family and I would like to thank everyone for the great affection we have received,\u201d Baggio told ANSA in a statement. \u201cAnything can happen in situations like this, and, fortunately, the violence I suffered only caused a few stitches, bruises and a lot of fear.\u00a0Now, I have to overcome the fear.\u201d Luca Zaia, the president of Italy\u2019s Veneto region, said in a statement published by local media: \u201cI express my closeness and solidarity to Roberto Baggio and his family, and I am sure I can send him the embrace of all the Venetians who made people dream with his unparalleled skill on the grass of international pitches. \u201cI hope that the \u2018Divine Codino\u2019 [the \u2018Divine Ponytail\u2019], the symbolic champion of our football and our region, a person we feel close and friendly, can soon recover together with his family from this bad evening and from the wounds for which he was followed and treated by the staff of the health facilities in Arzignano with whom I have kept in touch.\u201d Zaia added: \u201cThe experience he lived in his home, attacked and robbed by unspeakable criminals, compares his to other families who have unfortunately suffered similar experiences and, as in all cases, we trust that the criminals can be brought to justice soon.\u201d Baggio \u2013 who played for Juventus, AC Milan, Inter Milan and the Italian national team among others \u2013 retired in 2004 and runs a small agricultural business on his expansive villa in Altavilla Vicentina, according to local media.

{"id": "2024_06_20_sport_copa-america-2024-preview-lionel-messi-argentina-spt-intl", "text": "For just the second time in the tournament\u2019s 108-year history, the Copa Am\u00e9rica will be played outside of South America. As it did in 2016 for the special centenary, the United States will host this year\u2019s expanded edition that will feature 16 teams rather than the customary 12 and will be something of a dress rehearsal for the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted in the US, Mexico and Canada. Taking part will be the 10 CONMEBOL nations as usual, plus the US, Mexico, Jamaica and Panama, which all qualified as semifinalists of the CONCACAF Nations League. Additionally, Costa Rica and Canada also qualified via the playoffs contested between the losing Nations League quarterfinalists. This year\u2019s tournament runs from June 20 to July 14. The favorite Unsurprisingly, Lionel Messi\u2019s Argentina is the favorite to lift the trophy for a record-breaking 16th time. Three years ago, Messi helped the Albiceleste to glory at the Covid-delayed 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica, beating host Brazil in the final, his first major trophy with the national team and the country\u2019s first in 28 years. That victory lifted the weight of expectation off his shoulders and more than likely acted as a catalyst for Argentina\u2019s World Cup victory in Qatar 18 months later, with Messi finally getting his hands on the one trophy he had craved most. Previously tormented by his failures with Argentina, even retiring temporarily from international football after a second straight Copa Am\u00e9rica final defeat to Chile in 2016, Messi told Argentine outlet Infobae recently that he\u2019s now \u201cachieved everything.\u201d There is the real possibility that the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica will be the last major international tournament Messi plays. After previously stating that the 2022 World Cup would be his last, Messi told Star+ in December that \u201ctime will tell.\u201d \u201cAs long as I feel I am well and that I am able to help, I will do it,\u201d Messi, who will turn 37 during the Copa Am\u00e9rica, said. \u201cToday, all I think about is to get well to the Copa Am\u00e9rica and play it. Fight for it again, as we always do, try to be the champions. \u201cIf we do well at Copa Am\u00e9rica and I can keep playing, maybe it happens.\u201d But Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni, who has overseen just four defeats in the team\u2019s last 50 games, had a message for Messi fans: Don\u2019t worry about the future, just enjoy the now. \u201cWe Argentines are too melancholic and we are already thinking about the day when he is gone while he\u2019s still playing,\u201d Scaloni said last week. \u201cSo let\u2019s enjoy him and we\u2019ll see what happens tomorrow. I think the present is so important for the whole world \u2013 not only for Argentina \u2013 because, in the end, Leo plays for everyone who likes football.\u201d One player who will definitely be making his last tournament appearance for Argentina is \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda. The 36-year-old has made 140 appearances for the national team and enjoys legendary status back home thanks to his winner in the final of the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica and a goal in the 2022 World Cup final. Di Mar\u00eda also won the U20 World Cup in 2007 and an Olympic gold medal at Beijing 2008. The best of the rest Brazil Previously thought of as one of, if not the greatest football nation on earth, Brazil currently finds itself navigating a complicated transitional period. The squad for the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica is largely inexperienced, with 15 players on less than 10 caps for their country. Only one player, West Ham\u2019s Lucas Paquet\u00e1, has reached 10 goals for Brazil, making the omissions of Casemiro and Richarlison all the more surprising. The Sele\u00e7\u00e3o is still reeling from the absence of star man Neymar Jr., who ruptured his ACL playing for the national team in October. Brazil\u2019s all-time record goalscorer and a player with the ability to change a game in an instant, Neymar will be sorely missed for his contributions on the pitch, but also his leadership and status as an icon in an inexperienced dressing room. Brazil recently suffered back-to-back World Cup qualifier set-backs for the first time in its history, before going on to lose a third in a row. That third defeat \u2013 a 1-0 loss to Argentina at the Maracan\u00e3 - was historic, too, marking the first time Brazil had ever lost a home World Cup qualifier. Interim coach Fernando Diniz was sacked in January, less than halfway through his one-year deal, and replaced by journeyman manager Dorival J\u00fanior, who has so far overseen narrow wins against England and Mexico and draws against the USA and Spain. But despite the team\u2019s recent struggles, the pressure and expectation will still be high back home \u2013 in particular with Vin\u00edcius Jr. leading the attack. The Real Madrid forward has enjoyed a sensational season for Los Blancos, helping the team to a La Liga and Champions League double and making himself the favorite to win the Ballon d\u2019Or. Uruguay Perennial overachiever Uruguay once again goes into a Copa Am\u00e9rica among the favorites to win the title. The nation of just 3.5 million people holds the joint record alongside Argentina for most Copa Am\u00e9rica titles won with 15. Under new manager Marcelo Bielsa, who took charge in May 2023, a new, youthful Uruguay has made a tremendous start to World Cup qualifying, winning four of its six matches so far \u2013 including 2-0 wins over Brazil and Argentina \u2013 to sit second in the standings. While Bielsa has called up many inexperienced and uncapped players during his tenure so far to better implement his high intensity press, national team icon Luis Su\u00e1rez made the cut and will be supported by a talented cast that includes Jos\u00e9 Gim\u00e9nez, Ronald Ara\u00fajo and Federico Valverde. The host The USA enters the Copa Am\u00e9rica off the back of winning a third straight Nations League title, beating bitter rival Mexico 2-0 in the final less than two months ago. However, preparations for the tournament got off to the worst possible start with a 5-1 hammering at the hands of Colombia in Washington. After the defeat, goalkeeper Matt Turner said the team needed to \u201cbounce back in a big way,\u201d and a much-improved performance followed in a morale-boosting 1-1 draw against Brazil. Despite boasting several talented players, including Tim Weah, Christian Pulisic, Yunus Musah and Folarin Balogun, serious questions remain about whether the US men can consistently compete against teams outside of the weaker CONCACAF bubble. Fortunately for the US, the group draw has been kind. First up is a weak Bolivia side which has endured an abysmal start to World Cup qualifying, losing five of its first six matches, before a clash against familiar CONCACAF opponent Panama. The sternest test will come last against Uruguay, but Gregg Berhalter\u2019s side should have enough quality to at least advance to the knockout stages. Anything less could be a disaster as the team attempts to drum up support across the country ahead of a home World Cup. Dark Horses Chile Only a couple of months ago, you will likely have been hard pressed to find a Chile fan optimistic enough to predict that the team would make it past the group stages. The failure to qualify for back-to-back World Cups in 2018 and 2022 has been a bitter pill to swallow for everyone involved after the country\u2019s \u2018Golden Generation\u2019 won successive Copa Am\u00e9ricas in 2015 and 2016 and reached the final of the 2017 Confederations Cup. Since Juan Antonio Pizzi was sacked as manager after the team missed out on Russia 2018, three successive coaches failed to get a tune out of the team \u2013 then Ricardo Gareca was hired. Gareca, who impressively took Peru to the 2018 World Cup and the final of the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica, has had an immediate impact on the team since taking over in January, leading La Roja to comprehensive 3-0 wins over Paraguay and Albania and pushing France close in a 3-2 defeat in Marseille. Big names such as Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Claudio Bravo remain in the squad, but there is no place for Arturo Vidal or Gary Medel. It might be a bit much to say expectations are now high, but fans are finally excited about watching La Roja playing again. Colombia Colombia arrives in the US as arguably the most in-form team in the tournament, if not the world. Los Cafeteros are currently on a 23-game unbeaten run that includes wins in their last eight matches. With three wins and three draws so far in World Cup qualifying, the team has soared to third place in the standings to put the failure of reaching Qatar 2022 behind it. Liverpool\u2019s Luis D\u00edaz will be Colombia\u2019s main man at the Copa Am\u00e9rica, supported by well-known veterans such as James Rodriguez, David Ospina and Yerry Mina. The main issue for Colombia is its brutal potential route to the final, during which it will likely have to face Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/sport/copa-america-2024-preview-lionel-messi-argentina-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2023_09_29_asia_south-china-sea-tensions-philippines-china-us-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Maritime disputes across the vast South China Sea have ratcheted up in recent years as an increasingly assertive China militarizes disputed islands and confronts its regional rivals over their competing claims in the strategically important and resource-rich waterway. Bracketed by China and several Southeast Asian nations, parts of the vital economic passage are claimed by multiple governments, with Beijing asserting ownership over almost all of the waterway in defiance of an international court ruling. Over the past two decades, China has occupied a number of obscure reefs and atolls far from its shoreline across the South China Sea, building up military installations, including runways and ports. Competing claimants, such as the Philippines, say such actions infringe on their sovereignty and violate maritime law. And the United States agrees, regularly sending its Navy destroyers on freedom of navigation operations close to contested islands, leading to fears that the South China Sea could become a flashpoint between the two superpowers. Here\u2019s what you should know.  Why does the South China Sea matter? The 1.3-million-square-mile waterway is vital to international trade, with an estimated third of global shipping worth trillions of dollars passing through each year.  It\u2019s also home to vast fertile fishing grounds upon which many lives and livelihoods depend. Much of its economic value remains untapped, however. According to the US Energy Information Agency, the waterway holds at least 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 11 billion barrels of oil. Who controls those resources and how they are exploited could have a huge impact on the environment. The South China Sea is home to hundreds of largely uninhabited islands and coral atolls and diverse wildlife at risk from climate change and marine pollution. Who claims what? Beijing claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan also hold competing claims.  In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. China has ignored the ruling: Manila says Beijing continues to send its maritime militia to Mischief Reef and Scarborough Shoal in the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone. In the southern portion of the sea is the Spratly Island chain, which Beijing calls the Nansha islands. The archipelago consists of 100 islets and reefs of which 45 are occupied by China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam or the Philippines. In the northwestern part of the sea, the Paracels \u2013 known as the Xisha islands in China \u2013 have been controlled by Beijing since 1974 despite claims from Vietnam and Taiwan.  China\u2019s ruling Communist Party also claims self-governing Taiwan as its own territory, despite having never controlled it.   What does China\u2019s naval build up mean for the sea?  China has built the world\u2019s largest naval fleet, more than 340 warships, and until recently it has been regarded as a green-water navy, operating mostly near the country\u2019s shores. But Beijing\u2019s shipbuilding reveals blue-water ambitions. In recent years it has launched large guided-missile destroyers, amphibious assault ships and aircraft carriers with the ability to operate in the open ocean and project power thousands of miles from Beijing. In addition, Western marine security experts \u2013 along with the Philippines and the United States \u2013 claim China controls a maritime militia that is hundreds of vessels strong and acts as an unofficial \u2013 and officially deniable \u2013 force that Beijing uses to push its territorial claims both in the South China Sea and beyond.  The US is not a claimant to the South China Sea, but says the waters are crucial to its national interest of guaranteeing freedom of the seas worldwide.  The US Navy regularly conducts freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea, saying the US is \u201cdefending every nation\u2019s right to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.\u201d  Beijing denounces such operations as illegal. What has China built in the sea? Most of Beijing\u2019s military buildup is concentrated along the Spratly and Paracel island chains, where sustained land reclamation saw reefs being destroyed first and then built on.  Chinese vessels have been known to encircle various atolls and islets, sending dredgers to build artificial islands large enough to harbor tankers and warships.  \u201cOver the past decade, the PRC has added more than 3,200 acres of land to its seven occupied outposts in the Spratly Islands, which now feature airfields, berthing areas, and resupply facilities to support persistent PRC military and paramilitary presence in the region,\u201d US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Lindsey Ford told a House subcommittee earlier this week, referring to China by its official acronym, the People\u2019s Republic of China.  Beijing\u2019s military construction sped up in 2014 as it quietly began massive dredging operations on seven reefs in the Spratlys.  Since then, Beijing has constructed military bases on Subi Reef, Johnson Reef, Mischief Reef and Fiery Cross Reef, fortifying its claims on the chain, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.  Those facilities, according to Ford, are now bristling with some of China\u2019s most advanced weaponry, including stealth fighters.  \u201cSince early 2018, we have seen the PRC steadily equip its Spratly Island outposts \u2014 including Mischief Reef, Subi Reef, and Fiery Cross \u2014 with an increasing array of military capabilities, including advanced anti-ship cruise missiles, long-range surface-to-air missile systems, J-20 stealth fighter jets, laser and jamming equipment, and military radar and signals intelligence capabilities,\u201d she said in a prepared statement.  China installed exploratory oil rigs in the Paracels in 2014 that sparked anti-China riots in Vietnam, a competing claimant.  More recently, cruise ships have taken Chinese tourists to the militarized reefs.    Why are tensions rising again? Under President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr, the Philippines has taken increasingly assertive steps to protect its claim to shoals in the South China Sea, leading to several confrontations with Chinese vessels in waters off the Philippine islands.  They include standoffs between Chinese coast guard and what Manila says are shadowy Chinese maritime militia boats and tiny wooden Philippine fishing vessels; Chinese water cannons blocking the resupply of a shipwrecked Philippine military outpost; and a lone Filipino diver using a knife to sever a massive floating Chinese barrier. \u201cThese recent incidents in the past year shows that China has become increasingly aggressive and confident in its actions against smaller countries like the Philippines. They\u2019re beginning to cross certain lines,\u201d said Jay Batongbacal, a maritime expert at the University of the Philippines. The Philippine Coast Guard says it remains \u201ccommitted to upholding international law, safeguarding the welfare of Filipino fisherfolk, and protecting the rights of the Philippines in its territorial waters.\u201d China\u2019s Foreign Ministry has defended the behavior of its vessels in the waterway and said Beijing will \u201cfirmly safeguard\u201d what it views as its territorial sovereignty.   What are the global implications? Since taking office in 2022, Philippine President Marcos Jr. has taken a stronger stance over the South China Sea than his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, amid the wider power struggle that has been playing out in the region for years. The South China Sea is widely seen as a potential flashpoint for global conflict, and the recent confrontations between Manila and Beijing have raised concerns among Western observers of potentially developing into an international incident if China, a global power, decides to act more forcefully against the Philippines, a US treaty ally.  Washington and Manila are bound by a mutual defense treaty signed in 1951 that remains in force, stipulating that both sides would help defend each other if either were attacked by a third party. Marcos has strengthened US relations that had frayed under his predecessor, with the two allies touting potential future joint patrols in the South China Sea. As the partners held their largest military exercise in April 2023, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned that US-Philippine military cooperation \u201cmust not interfere in South China Sea disputes.\u201d  The US, however, has condemned China\u2019s recent actions in the contested sea and threatened to intervene under its mutual defense treaty obligations if Philippine vessels came under armed attack there. \u201cThe increasingly frequent run-ins between China and the Philippines speak to the new Marcos government\u2019s willingness to stand up to Chinese bullying and coercion,\u201d said Gregory Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative. \u201cPart of that is certainly attributable to the closer US-Philippines alliance which helps given Manila the confidence that Beijing will be deterred from overt military force lest it invoke the US-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2023/09/29/asia/south-china-sea-tensions-philippines-china-us-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

The company had worked with IBM to develop and test AI-driven, voice-automated ordering at some of its restaurants. The fast food giant says it\u2019s still working on AI-related solutions at a time when its rivals are making similar investments. It plans to shut off the technology in restaurants participating in the test \u201cno later than July 26, 2024,\u201d according to reporting from trade publication Restaurant Business. \u201cIBM remains a trusted partner and we will still utilize many of their products across our global System,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in an email sent to franchisees and shared with CNN. But the company suggested it will look at AI partners other than IBM. McDonald\u2019s and IBM launched their partnership in 2021, announcing the development of Automated Order Taking (AOT) technology to create a more convenient and simplified ordering experience for its customers and restaurant teams as a part of its \u201cAccelerating the Arches\u201d growth plan. IBM said the AOT\u00a0technology that emerged from the partnership has \u201csome of the most comprehensive capabilities in the industry, fast and accurate\u201d in\u00a0demanding conditions. \u201cWhile McDonald\u2019s is revaluating and refining its plans for AOT, we look forward to continuing to work with them on a variety of other projects,\u201d IBM said in a statement. McDonald\u2019s says this is not the end of\u00a0its AI efforts. It plans to\u00a0\u201cevaluate long-term, scalable solutions\u201d for voice-ordering by the end of 2024. \u201cAI is clearly going to be a part of restaurant automation and efficiencies going forward, but the technology is still in its infancy,\u201d said David Henkes, senior principal and head of strategic partnerships at Technomic. \u201cThe McDonald\u2019s experience and commitment to AI shows the potential upside, but it also shows the limitations of the technology at the present time.\u201d McDonald\u2019s is not the only fast-food chain experimenting with AI.

Despite fast-food companies\u2019 enthusiasm to integrate AI-powered solutions into their daily operations, the technology has still hit snags.

{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_europe_france-alleged-rape-anti-semitism-intl-latam", "text": "The\u00a0alleged gang-rape of a 12-year-old Jewish girl in northern France has triggered an outcry over surging antisemitism in the country, a key issue in the looming French parliamentary elections this month. Politicians from all sides have weighed in on the alleged attack, with French President Emmanuel Macron condemning a \u201cscourge of antisemitism\u201d\u00a0that he said is\u00a0festering in French schools, and far-right leaders placing blame on the left for failing to take anti-semitism seriously enough. The Nanterre prosecutor\u2019s office announced Wednesday that it has launched an inquiry into the\u00a0alleged \u201caggravated rape\u201d of a minor, after receiving \u201creports from a 12-year-old girl\u201d\u00a0of the incident on June 15.  Three boys, aged 12 and 13, have been taken into custody, the prosecutor also said. Whether the girl was targeted for her religion is part of the probe, with two of the boys now being investigated for\u00a0aggravated gang rape of a minor, group violence against a minor for reasons of religion, death threats and insult for reasons of religion, according to the prosecutor\u2019s statement. The third boy\u00a0has been\u00a0placed under \u201cassisted witness\u201d status in relation to the alleged rape, the prosecutor added. The alleged attack took place as the girl tried to return home after meeting a friend. Two boys\u00a0approached her and attempted to block her path outside her house. After a third boy\u00a0arrived,\u00a0the group began to physically attack the girl, hurling antisemitic insults at her, BFMTV reported,\u00a0citing police sources. The girl received several death threats and one of the boys called her\u00a0a \u201cdirty Jew,\u201d according to the account reported by BFMTV. Antisemitic incidents have increased by 284% in France between 2022 and 2023, according to data from the French interior ministry. In 2023, antisemitic acts constituted 60% of all anti-religious acts, compared to 26% in 2022, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told the French Senate earlier this year. Growing fears of an antisemitism problem The incident has sparked an intense political debate on what politicians have described as a spiraling\u00a0antisemitism problem in France\u00a0linked to Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. On Wednesday,\u00a0Jordan Bardella, the far-right firebrand hoping to score big wins for his National Rally party in the upcoming elections, pledged to tackle antisemitism if elected in three weeks\u2019 time. \u201cSince October 7, an atmosphere of anti-Semitism has spread and developed in an extremely worrying manner in our country, which we must combat,\u201d Bardella told reporters. Bardella\u2019s party colleague and far-right juggernaut, Marine Le Pen said in a post on X that the attack revolted members of her party, highlighting the uptick in antisemitic incidents across the country. Le Pen said the recent surge in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war reveals a worrying \u201cstigmatization\u201d of Jewish people which \u201ceveryone should be fully aware of\u201d when hitting the ballot boxes on June 30 and July 7. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal meanwhile described the incident as a \u201cdespicable\u201d and took direct aim at his left-wing political opponent, Jean-Luc Melenchon, whom he accused of previously downplaying the severity of antisemitism in France by describing it as a \u201cresidual\u201d issue. Politicians in France have a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to ensure that antisemitic rhetoric does not become \u201ctrivialized,\u201d Attal said in an interview with TF1 Info Wednesday, warning that if trivialized it can lead young people in particular to \u201cthe worst.\u201d Melenchon for his part said he was \u201chorrified by this rape,\u201d saying in a social media post that \u201cit put under a concerning spotlight the conditioning of criminal male behavior from a young age, and antisemitic racism.\u201d Voter anger over the issue appeared clear on Wednesday, as demonstrators gathered outside Paris\u2019s city hall on, according to reporting from BFMTV. Protesters carried placards with slogans such as \u201cRaped at 12 because she was Jewish,\u201d and \u201cAnti-Semitism is not residual,\u201d and listened to speeches from Jewish rights activists in attendance. \u201cAll light must be shed on the circumstances of this crime, including its anti-Semitic nature, if this is confirmed,\u201d the main Jewish interest group in France, the Conseil repr\u00e9sentatif des institutions juives de France (CRIF) said.

China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, has made no secret of its dislike of President Lai Ching-te who took office last month, saying he is a \u201cseparatist,\u201d and staged war games shortly after his inauguration. Taiwan has complained of a pattern of ramped up Chinese pressure since Lai won the election in January, including ongoing\u00a0military actions,\u00a0trade sanctions and\u00a0coast guard patrols\u00a0around Taiwan-controlled islands next to\u00a0China. The new guidelines say\u00a0China\u2019s courts, prosecutors, public and state security bodies should \u201cseverely punish Taiwan independence diehards for splitting the country and inciting secession crimes in accordance with the law, and resolutely defend national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity,\u201d according to\u00a0China\u2019s state-run Xinhua news agency. The guidelines are being issued in accordance with laws already on the books, including the 2005 anti-succession law, Xinhua said. That law gives\u00a0China\u00a0the legal basis for military action against Taiwan if it secedes or seems about to. Sun Ping, an official from\u00a0China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security, told reporters in Beijing the maximum penalty for the \u201ccrime of secession\u201d was the death penalty. \u201cThe sharp sword of legal action will always hang high,\u201d she said. There was no immediate response from Taiwan\u2019s government. One official told Reuters they were still digesting the contents of the new guidelines. The guidelines detail what is considered a crime worthy of punishment, including promoting Taiwan\u2019s entry to international organizations where statehood is a condition, having \u201cexternal official exchanges\u201d and \u201csuppressing\u201d parties, groups and people that promote \u201creunification.\u201d The guidelines add a further clause to what could be considered a crime \u2013 \u201cother acts that seek to separate Taiwan from\u00a0China\u201d \u2013 meaning the rules can be broadly interpreted. Lai has repeatedly offered to hold talks with\u00a0China\u00a0but has been rebuffed. He says only Taiwan\u2019s people can decide their future. China\u00a0has taken legal measures against Taiwanese officials before, including imposing\u00a0sanctions\u00a0on Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan\u2019s former de facto ambassador to the United States and now the island\u2019s vice president. Such punishments have little practical effect as Chinese courts do not have jurisdiction in Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing\u2019s sovereignty claims.

{"id": "world_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-arrests", "text": "Turks and Caicos is revising part of its firearms law that recently caused legal trouble for several Americans carrying ammunition into the British Overseas Territory, House of Assembly member Edwin Astwood said in a statement\u00a0Friday. The revision comes weeks after a bipartisan US congressional delegation traveled to the islands asking for charges to be dropped for five Americans whom they said \u201cinadvertently\u201d had ammunition in their luggage. It is a crime to bring firearms or ammunition into the territory without prior permission from police. The amendment passed by the House of Assembly on June 14 clarifies that in sentencing for firearms-related offenses, courts have the discretion to impose either a fine, a custodial sentence, or a mixture of both in exceptional circumstances, the statement read. Previously, the law mandated courts to impose both a fine and a prison sentence of 12 years, although it allowed reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d \u201cThe amendment was introduced to address concerns about the rigidity of the previous sentencing framework, which mandated both imprisonment and financial penalties for all firearms offenses, regardless of the specific context or severity. This often resulted in disproportionately harsh sentences that did not always fit the nature of the crime or the circumstances of the offender,\u201d Astwood said. The mandatory minimum has not changed from 12 years, according to Sheena C. Mair, a lawyer for Sharitta Shinese Grier, an American awaiting trial.\u00a0The only change is if the court finds exceptional circumstances allowing the departure from the mandatory minimum of 12 years, they can impose a custodial sentence or a fine or both. Bryan Hagerich, one of the five Americans\u00a0arrested\u00a0for carrying ammunition, is\u00a0back\u00a0in the\u00a0United States\u00a0after receiving a suspended 52-week sentence and a $6,700 fine.\u00a0Hagerich\u00a0was allowed to leave the\u00a0territory\u00a0and return to the US once he paid the fine, his attorney Oliver Smith said. Tyler Wenrich\u00a0previously pleaded guilty to similar charges and\u00a0was sentenced to time served\u00a0and issued a $9,000 fine, according to court records. Ryan\u00a0Tyler\u00a0Watson, another American awaiting his fate after being charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition,\u00a0is expected to be sentenced Friday, a little\u00a0under a month\u00a0after he pleaded guilty. Michael Lee Evans, a Texan in his 70s, who pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9mm rounds of ammunition,\u00a0was scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday \u2013 though it is unclear based on court records if the sentencing happened. CNN has reached out to his attorney for more information. Grier, a Florida mother, said she had no idea that two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. She was released on bail but can\u2019t leave the island until her case concludes and must report to a local police station weekly,\u00a0WFTV\u00a0reported.

The IDF later sought to clarify Hagari\u2019s remarks, confirming it is committed to the government\u2019s war goals and claiming that Hagari was only referring to Hamas \u201cas an ideology and as an idea.\u201d Despite the IDF\u2019s attempt to soften Hagari\u2019s remarks, cracks appear to be deepening between the Israeli government and its military. Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from members of his government and Israel\u2019s allies, including the United States, to devise a strategy for the post-war governance of Gaza after Israel\u2019s devastating bombardment of the isolated enclave. In response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks on Israel, when militants killed more than 1,200 people and took some 250 others hostage, Israel launched its war in Gaza with the primary goals of recovering the hostages, destroying Hamas\u2019 ability to govern there and ensuring another attack could not be launched from the Palestinian territory. But after eight months of war, and with the prospect of many more to come, Hagari\u2019s comments echoed the growing fears that Israel\u2019s military campaign may be unable to achieve those aims and that the group could remain a potent ideological force, despite Netanyahu\u2019s claim to have killed more than 14,000 Hamas fighters. CNN cannot independently verify that figure. \u201cTelling the public that there will be no terror in Gaza, no military operatives, no rockets and no armed men is a lie,\u201d Hagari said in a separate interview with CNN affiliate Kan 11. \u201cThere will be terror in Gaza. Hamas is an idea, deeply rooted in the hearts of the residents of Gaza.\u00a0To replace those who handle civil services and distribute or steal food, something else needs to be established. This is a decision for the political echelon, and the army will implement it.\u201d In a sign that Israel\u2019s cabinet may be tempering its initial war aims of destroying Hamas in its entirety, government spokesperson David Mencer said that eliminating Hamas\u2019 \u201cmilitary and government capabilities\u201d does not \u201cnecessarily mean\u201d killing every member of the group. Mencer told reporters Thursday that Hagari\u2019s comments had not harmed the war effort, but stressed it was the military\u2019s responsibility to carry out \u201cthe will of the elected government.\u201d During discussions about the US-backed ceasefire plan, Netanayhu also appeared to have retreated from his maximalist rhetoric at the war\u2019s outset. A statement issued last week \u2013 reportedly from the Prime Minister\u2019s office \u2013 said Israel will not end the war \u201cbefore achieving all its war objectives: destroying Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities, freeing all the hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn\u2019t pose a threat to Israel in the future.\u201d The statement did not reference Netanyahu\u2019s oft-repeated promise of total victory, nor the elimination of Hamas in full. Hagari\u2019s comments sparked the latest in a growing series of public disagreements between Israel\u2019s government and military. Last weekend, the IDF announced a daily \u201ctactical pause\u201d of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed \u2013 a decision that rankled Netanyahu, an Israeli official told CNN. Netanyahu contacted his military secretary and said the idea was unacceptable, but later backed down after being assured the fighting in Rafah would continue, according to the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The IDF\u2019s decision to implement tactical pauses also drew fierce criticism from the increasingly rancorous far-right wing of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said whoever made the decision \u201cis evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position.\u201d An IDF spokesperson later told CNN the decision for the \u201ctactical pause\u201d was approved by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. While Israel has had some success in returning those abducted on October 7 \u2013 both through a ceasefire-for-hostage deal in November and a daring rescue operation to retrieve four people earlier this month \u2013  hope that Israel will be able to return the hostages may also be dwindling. A senior Hamas official told CNN he has \u201cno idea\u201d how many of the 120 remaining hostages in Gaza are still alive, and that any deal to release them must include guarantees of a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/middleeast/hagari-netanyahu-destroy-hamas-israel-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_style_amiri-menswear-paris-fashion-week", "text": "Few cities have been so adamantly idealized, mythologized and captured on film and in photographs as Los Angeles and Paris. Inside the majestic\u00a0botanical garden\u00a0of \u201cJardin des Plantes\u201d\u00a0at the heart of Paris earlier this week, Mike Amiri, founder of\u00a0the\u00a0eponymous Californian label, brought these two worlds together in a cinematic show that brought Hollywood to the legendary \u201cRive Gauche\u201d of the\u00a0River\u00a0Seine. Accompanied by the tunes of\u00a0south London musician Yussef Dayes,\u00a0what emerged was\u00a0a collection about \u201cModern jazz, meaning both the music and and attitude\u201d\u00a0according to the show notes. Among influences,\u00a0the designer references Miles Davis\u00a0(who himself\u00a0had a special relationship with the City of Lights), as well as Duke Ellington and his Big Band\u00a0and\u00a0Dizzy Gillespie, all\u00a0of whom\u00a0fascinated him both for their stage presence and their off-stage life. These inspirations translated into\u00a0pieces in\u00a0faded, sun-washed teal, blue, gray and vintage-inspired knits. Formal tuxedos with d\u00e9grad\u00e9 beadings were fused with slouchier lines and flared pants as a nod to skate culture,\u00a0or\u00a0elevated with crystal-pinstripes. Like a golden thread running through the collection, models wore drum bags featuring a guitar pick as a lock, or music notes as brooches holding together a silk foulard. Interested both in craft and attitude,\u00a0Amiri, 47, sought\u00a0to be \u201coptimistic, not loud,\u201d as he put it\u00a0during a meeting a few days before the show. In the midst of model castings and fittings, he was calm and elegant, multi-tasking as his son Ryan, 13, came to join him in putting\u00a0the\u00a0final touches to the collection in a\u00a0temporary\u00a0studio set up near Paris\u2019s Avenue Montaigne. Amiri\u2019s two other children and wife were also in the city and present at the show. Since its launch in 2014, Amiri has looked to musicians as well as Americana\u00a0for a transcontinental discussion\u00a0of\u00a0luxury\u00a0\u2014\u00a0mixing thrifting with subcultures\u00a0such as\u00a0rock\u2019n\u2019roll, garage and skate. Having grown up in Hollywood to \u00e9migr\u00e9 Iranian parents, two blocks away from Hollywood Boulevard, Amiri was also deeply impacted by the stark cultural differences between LA neighborhoods such as Silver Lake, Venice Beach and the styles\u00a0that came with\u00a0that. Today, the designer has made a name for himself for the quality of his garments\u00a0and\u00a0his fluid, creative approach\u00a0that\u00a0walks a line between elegance and hype. The people he dresses all \u201cwant to have personality, but they don\u2019t want to look like they\u2019re faking young, it\u2019s a fine balance between looking modern and faking youth\u201d he said. Despite the recent announcement of South Korean musician Kim Sunwoo of K-pop band \u201cThe Boyz\u201d becoming a brand ambassador, many of Amiri\u2019s stars find\u00a0their\u00a0way to the independent\u00a0label organically, rather than by way of paid endorsements, the brand said. Perhaps because the world of celebrity is one Amiri is comfortable in, having been to\u00a0school with Angelina Jolie and Lenny Kravitz\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who he recently dressed (alongside\u00a0a diverse roster of celebrities such as like Ryan Gosling, Omar Sy, Lena Waithe and Barry Keoghan).\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s important not to chase everything, let it be organic,\u201d he said at the studio while examining final runway looks.\u00a0\u201cThe right people find you.\u201d In an age of hyper-visibility,\u00a0Amiri\u00a0appears\u00a0to be rethinking luxury\u00a0\u2014 or\u00a0\u201cmaking ordinary things extraordinary\u201d as he put it. This includes focusing on detail so fine it might not appear on camera, such as couture-level craftsmanship infused with DIY\u00a0techniques, twisting and reworking denim, leather and seemingly mundane textiles. To James Sleaford, editor-in-chief of men\u2019s fashion magazine ICON France, Amiri has fine-tuned chic, offering a fusion of American cool and technical know-how: \u201cPeople recognize a lot of what he does, the ripped jeans, but what you see when you look at the shows is pretty different, he is very cultured, and very into his tailoring\u201d he said. \u201cHe has brought\u00a0a real element of luxury to\u00a0American cool.\u201d Today, with a flagship boutique on Rodeo\u00a0Drive, the \u201cAmiri Prize,\u201d an award to \u201cencourage, nurture and showcase up-and-coming talent,\u201d a second retail space in Dubai and a pop-up store in Saint Tropez,\u00a0Amiri is\u00a0pursuing a worldwide dialogue.\u00a0\u201cIn a world where everything is shared and visible, there is definitely a blending of cultures\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not through geography, but the things people gravitate towards,\u201d he said. \u201cIf\u2026\u00a0people connect to your story, your aesthetic, maybe it\u2019s something about them they find in there,\u201d he continued.\u00a0\u201cSomething they want to bring out in themselves.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/style/amiri-menswear-paris-fashion-week/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

The MV Tutor is thought to be the second ship sunk by Houthis since March, when the British-registered vessel Rubymar was downed after being struck by ballistic missiles fired from Houthi territory in Yemen. The rebels have launched dozens of missile and drone attacks directed at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following the Hamas-led October 7\u00a0attacks. Since then, tensions have spiked across the Middle East, with key regional actors fiercely condemning the humanitarian crisis caused by more than eight months of Israeli bombardment of Gaza. Israel launched its military offensive\u00a0in October\u00a0after militants led by Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza have since killed at least\u00a037,396\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a085,523\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there.

{"id": "2024_06_21_weather_heat-wave-new-york-i-95-corridor-new-mexico-wildfires", "text": "Extreme summer weather continues to impact much of the US on Friday and into the weekend with a dangerous heat wave ratcheting up in New York and the I-95 corridor, deadly and destructive wildfires still burning in New Mexico and potential tropical threats. Here\u2019s the latest: \u2022 Heat escalates this weekend: More than 100 million Americans, including those in the  highly populated I-95 corridor, are under heat alerts through the weekend. A heat emergency was in effect for Washington, DC, where upper 90s and even triple-digit temperatures for the first time since 2016 will be possible. \u2022 Search for \u201cmore loss of life\u201d in New Mexico fires:\u00a0In New Mexico, authorities reported\u00a0that at least two people\u00a0died, 1,400 structures were destroyed and and more than 8,000 residents were evacuated as a result of\u00a0wildfires. The mayor of hard-hit Ruidoso, New Mexico, said they were preparing for more fatalities in the fires and bringing in dogs to help the search for \u201cmore loss of life.\u201d The South Fork and Salt fires have together burned an estimated 24,000 acres and were still 0% contained as of Friday. Evacuations are still in effect for Village of Ruidoso and City of Ruidoso Downs residents and additional evacuation orders have been issued in at least seven more areas. \u2022 Flood threat in fire zone: A flash flood warning was issued for Ruidoso and other New Mexico areas burned by the South Fork Fire after 0.5 inches of rain fell in the morning. More rain was expected into the late afternoon hours. Rain earlier in the week created a flash flood emergency with water rescues as a torrent of mud and water rushed from burned areas. Ground charred by fire, also known as a burn scar, loses its ability to effectively absorb water and more easily floods. \u2022 Tropical threats brewing: The National Hurricane Center\u00a0is monitoring two areas with a medium chance of tropical development in the next 48 hours. One could become a tropical depression off the North Florida and Georgia coasts Friday. The other could take a nearly identical track to Tropical Storm Alberto. \u2022 FBI investigating origins of New Mexico fires: FBI special agents have joined the investigation into the cause of wildfires in New Mexico, the agency said Thursday. \u201cI can confirm that the FBI is assisting our local, state, federal and tribal partners in the ongoing investigation of the fires in Ruidoso NM,\u201d said a spokesperson with the bureau\u2019s Albuquerque field office. President Joe Biden is \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d wildfires in New Mexico, the White House said Thursday. The administration has also approved an expedited major disaster declaration from New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, \u201cunlocking further federal support and FEMA assistance to the impacted communities.\u201d \u2022 California firefighters brace for 100-degree heat: California is heating up Friday, with triple-digit temperatures expected in some areas. Heat alerts span parts of southern and central California, including in Colusa County, where firefighters are working to rein in the Sites Fire spanning over 19,100 acres. High temperatures between 100 and 106 are expected and could hinder firefighting efforts. California is seeing an active early fire year, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Since the start of the year, 89,784 acres have burned, compared to 5,747 acres during the same period last year. Early-season heat wave intensifies this weekend More record daily high temperatures are possible through the weekend as heat expands into new areas and intensifies in others. A stagnant heat dome over the eastern US is fueling some of the most unusually intense heat over portions of the Ohio Valley and the mid-Atlantic. Heat will build in Washington, DC, Friday and threaten triple-digits Saturday and Sunday. The extreme heat and humidity will combine to push the heat index \u2013 or how hot it feels \u2013 to 100 to 105 degrees over a widespread area, with 110 degrees possible in the southern mid-Atlantic. Record overnight low temperatures will increase health risks by reducing the ability for people to cool down at night. The heat wave\u2019s prolonged nature is another serious concern. New York City could experience 90-degree temperatures or higher for seven days straight into week. The  stretch would be the longest ever in June in the city. Heat is also returning in full force in the West following a brief break. Heat alerts are already in place for portions of California, Arizona and Utah. Temperatures are expected to jump back up to 10 to 15 degrees above normal for Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Sacramento and Bakersfield, California, through the weekend. Hurricane season heating up, too Two tropical systems could develop quick on the heels of Alberto. The first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season made landfall as sprawling tropical storm in Mexico, but brought heavy rain and storm surge to much of the western Gulf of Mexico. A system with a medium chance of tropical development could mimic Alberto\u2019s track through the southwestern Gulf of Mexico and into northeastern Mexico this weekend. A broad area of low pressure near the Yucatan Peninsula is forecast to strengthen as it moves into the southwest Gulf of Mexico this weekend. This system has a medium chance of developing into a tropical system. in the next several days and will also bring more rain chances to South Texas. While this system is not expected to be as large as Alberto, it would bring more rain chances to South Texas and trigger new flooding concerns there and along the Gulf Coast. Texas isn\u2019t the only area watching for a potential tropical system. Those in Florida and Georgia should also watch closely as a tropical depression could develop Friday with little time before it makes landfall Friday night. The National Hurricane Center on Friday morning increased the odds of the storm system developing after finding signs it was organizing. It has a medium chance of a last-gasp development, according to the NHC. The designation would largely be ceremonial as some heavy rain, high surf and gusty winds are expected regardless of the system\u2019s final form.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/weather/heat-wave-new-york-i-95-corridor-new-mexico-wildfires/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_middleeast_hajj-deaths-mecca-extreme-heat-intl-latam", "text": "The official death toll from this year\u2019s Hajj pilgrimage has soared to almost 500 and the true toll could be more than double that as reports emerged that as many as 600 Egyptian worshipers perished on the route to Mecca amid extreme heat. At least 14 Malaysians, 165 Indonesians, 75 Jordanians, 35 Pakistanis, 49 Tunisians, 11 Iranians and 98 Indians have died, according to authorities in each country. A further 27 Jordanians are hospitalized and around 14 are still missing, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said. The US State Department said multiple US citizens died during the Hajj pilgrimage but did not provide a number. \u201cWe can confirm the deaths of multiple U.S. citizens in Saudi Arabia.\u00a0We offer our sincerest condolences to the families on their loss,\u201d the State Department spokesperson said, adding that the agency stands ready to provide consular assistance. Dozens of Iranians have also been hospitalized due to heatstroke and other conditions, the Iranian Red Crescent said Wednesday, according to Iran\u2019s semi-official Tasnim news agency. According to a CNN tally, this brings the latest official death toll for this year\u2019s pilgrimage to at least 480. The death tolls are expected to rise much further, as Saudi Arabia and Egypt have yet to release official figures. Additionally, the governments are only aware of pilgrims who have registered and traveled to Mecca as part of their country\u2019s quota \u2013 more deaths are feared among unregistered pilgrims. The pilgrims made this year\u2019s journey in dangerously high temperatures of up to 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit). According to the Egyptian presidency, the crisis unit will be headed by Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly,\u00a0and will \u201cprovide support for families of the deceased.\u201d Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has also instructed the unit on \u201cspeedy coordination with Saudi Arabian authorities to facilitate the return of the bodies\u201d of those who died, the statement added. The official number of dead Egyptians stands at 28, according to an Egyptian cabinet statement Thursday. However, it is being widely reported by Reuters news agency and other outlets that as many as 500 to 600 Egyptians perished on the route. Egyptian officials said they were working to gather an accurate tally of victims and missing persons.\u00a0The discrepancy stems from vast numbers of unregistered pilgrims who are not accounted for among those who have registered and traveled to Mecca as part of their country\u2019s quota. Thousands more have been treated for heatstroke after an estimated crowd of 1.8 million Muslims contended with the high temperatures. The Saudi Ministry of Health implemented safety measures including cooling stations along the official route, and urged pilgrims to use umbrellas and stay hydrated, The Associated Press reported. Despite this, this year\u2019s event was overshadowed by tragedy, raising questions over whether more could have been done to ensure people\u2019s safety. It also highlights the dangers posed for the many unregistered worshipers who want to fulfil their religious duty despite not obtaining a Hajj permit, and who don\u2019t have access to the official facilities. Of the dozens of Jordanians who died of heatstroke while performing Hajj rituals, at least 68 pilgrims have been granted burial permits to be laid to rest in Mecca on the wishes of their families, the Head of the Jordanian Directorate of Operations and Consular Affairs, Sufian Qudah, said. Malaysia\u2019s Minister for Religious affairs, Dr Mohd Na\u2019im Mokhtar, said most of its pilgrims died from \u201cheart disease, pneumonia and blood infection,\u201d according to state-run Bernama News Agency. The\u00a0Bernama\u00a0report did not specify if the dead were members of the country\u2019s official\u00a0Hajj\u00a0delegation. A spokesperson for India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs announced the death of the 98 Indian nationals on Friday, saying: \u201cThese deaths have happened on account of natural illness, natural causes, chronic illness, also old age.\u201d On Saturday, the day when Muslims gather at Mount\u00a0Arafat and where the Prophet Mohammed is believed to have delivered his last sermon, six Indian nationals died amid extreme heat and another four died due to \u201caccidents,\u201d the spokesperson said, without giving further details. The fallout from the deaths saw Tunisia\u2019s President Kais Saied fire the country\u2019s minister of religious affairs. Prior to his dismissal, Ibrahim Chaibi had acknowledged the possibility\u00a0of\u00a0negligence in the care\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0pilgrims. \u201cThe negligence may have occurred. It will be present, and we will evaluate it at the ministry level, and whoever fails will be punished,\u201d Chaibi said Friday. The Saudi government said on Monday that more than 2,700 people had been treated for heatstroke. Meanwhile, hundreds of people have taken to social media to post about their loved ones being unaccounted for. More than\u00a01.8 million people\u00a0are taking part in this year\u2019s Hajj, one of the world\u2019s largest religious gatherings, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. While deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year\u2019s gathering is being held amid particularly high temperatures. Hajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia advised pilgrims against performing the \u201cstoning of the devil\u201d ritual between certain hours after temperatures reached an extreme 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit). Hajj officials asked pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated amid the harsh conditions while the Saudi army deployed more than 1,600 personnel with medical units specifically for heatstroke and 30 rapid response teams. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers took part. Performing Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life. The pilgrimage includes numerous detailed rituals including wearing a special garment that symbolizes human equality and unity before God, a circular, counter-clockwise procession around the cube-shaped Kaaba building, and the symbolic stoning of evil. A source of prestige and revenue The Hajj is a source of prestige for Saudi Arabia\u2019s king, who holds the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques as the guardian of Islam\u2019s holiest sites. But the pilgrimage is also a significant source of revenue for the Saudi economy. Soon after\u00a0King Salman bin Abdulaziz\u00a0took power in 2015, Saudi Arabia launched a\u00a0$21 billion project\u00a0to expand the Grand Mosque in Mecca to accommodate 300,000 additional worshippers. A year later, then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman identified the pilgrimage as a key component of a plan to\u00a0diversify the Saudi economy\u00a0by 2030. Experts say that with oil sales generating close to a billion dollars a day for the kingdom, the pilgrimage\u2019s economic benefit is marginal by comparison. But its great, untapped potential could bring significant riches to the kingdom in the long term. Pilgrimage revenues were forecast to average about\u00a0$30 billion a year\u00a0and create 100,000 jobs for Saudis when the kingdom attracted around 21 million worshippers annually during the 10-day Hajj as well as the yearlong Umrah pilgrimage, according to official data cited by Reuters. The government is targeting 30 million pilgrims by 2030. This story has been updated with additional information.

And now, as an incoming college freshman, he\u2019s listed at 7\u20199\u2019\u2019 \u2014 and poised to be the tallest college basketball player ever. Olivier Rioux, once the record holder as the tallest teenager in the world, is now listed on the University of Florida\u2019s men\u2019s basketball roster after committing to the Gators last fall. At the time, according to recruiting site 247sports, the Montreal native and three-star recruit was just 7\u20196\u201d. At 18, he may still be growing. Rioux\u2019s listed height tops former record bearer Paul Sturgess, who was 7\u20198\u201d and played for both Florida Tech and Mountain State from 2007 to 2011. And, if Rioux makes it to the NBA, he\u2019ll become the tallest NBA player ever, too. Rioux hasn\u2019t publicly commented on the record, but he has been open in the past about enjoying his tall stature. In an interview with Guinness as a 16-year-old, the Canadian said he likes being noticed and interacting with people because of his height. He sees everything from a higher angle, he said, which \u201cgives me an advantage during a game.\u201d \u201cI was always taller than the rest of my friends at school or teammates,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what nature planned for me. I learned to be peaceful and happy about it.\u201d Rioux comes from a tall family, making his height slightly less of an outlier. His dad is 6\u20198\u201d and his mom is 6\u20192\u201d, according to Guinness. \u201cWe\u2019re still not\u00a0100%\u00a0sure why I\u2019m so tall \u2026 doctors could only explain it with the genetics that my family has,\u201d he said. Still, there are some downsides to his towering over the rest of society. He has some trouble finding clothes, he said, and has banged his head on a few door frames. Ouch. Rioux started playing basketball at the age of 5, and even then his height led opposing teams to question his age. In high school, his opponents didn\u2019t hold back during games, he said \u2014 sometimes challenging Rioux more because of his size. Yet even at his lofty height, Rioux still isn\u2019t the tallest man in the world. That honor belongs to Sultan K\u00f6sen, a Turkish farmer. He stands almost 8\u20193\u201d.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/sport/olivier-rioux-tallest-college-basketball-player-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Around 270 million people in the US will experience temperatures at or above 90 degrees this week as an impressive heat dome parks over the eastern US. Hundreds of records could be tied or broken this week. Multiple all-time June high temperature records could fall as the heat rises to levels normally seen only on the hottest July days. Parts of the Midwest to the Northeast could endure the longest heat wave they\u2019ve seen in decades, the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center said. Scientists have warned that heat waves will become increasingly severe as the climate crisis intensifies. Tens of millions of people who live as far north as Maine and aren\u2019t used to heat this intense will be sweating in temperatures well into the 90s this week. It will feel even hotter than that as humidity helps drive heat index values \u2013 how temperatures feel to the body \u2013 into the low 100s. Read more: Search continues for US tourist and two others missing amid Greek heat wave An extreme heat risk is in place from the Great Lakes into the Northeast this week, according to the National Weather Service. Wednesday and Thursday will be the hottest days of the week, but the surrounding days will only be slightly less brutal. Heat will reach dangerous levels in many places including the major metropolitan areas of Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, New York City and Boston. Temperatures soared 15 to 20 degrees above normal Monday afternoon and remained at elevated levels overnight. A few dozen temperature records fell as a result, including daily record highs in Chicago and Cleveland, and daily record warm low temperatures in places like Des Moines, Iowa. Temperatures will rise up to 25 degrees above normal through the rest of the workweek. Some areas, including Montpelier, Vermont; Syracuse, New York; and Pittsburgh, haven\u2019t seen heat like this in about three decades. \u201cLast time we saw heat in Pittsburgh like what we\u2019re expecting next week was 30 yrs ago (almost to the day) when it reached 95\u00b0F or warmer for 6 straight days (June 15-20, 1994),\u201d the local weather service office said on X. \u201cThat stands as the longest stretch of 95+ (degree) days on record. We have a shot at tying or beating that.\u201d Some affected areas have started to activate heat protocols. Cooling centers will open across New York City starting Tuesday and cooling kits will be distributed to people working outdoors, Mayor Eric Adams said Monday. Burlington, Vermont, will also activate cooling centers starting Tuesday, according to the city. Recreation centers in Cleveland will be open for extended hours this week to serve as cooling centers, city officials said Monday. The city also suspended all playground programs for the week as temperatures soar. Heat domes like the one fueling this week\u2019s intense conditions trap air in place and bake it with abundant sunshine for days on end, making each day hotter than the last. The oven-like conditions mean overnight temperatures often don\u2019t cool down enough to offer relief for overheated bodies, posing increased risks for heat-related illness. \u201cWarm overnight temperatures only dropping into the mid-70s will offer little to no relief, especially to those without adequate or reliable cooling,\u201d the Weather Prediction Center said.   Humidity will also join forces with extreme heat to create triple-digit heat indices \u2013 measurements of how hot the human body feels \u2013 in some areas. Chicago residents could feel\u00a0heat indices between 95 and 105 degrees through next week, the NWS in Chicago warned. Parts of eastern New York and western New England could see indices as high as 107 degrees. The NWS in Detroit, where the heat index could reach 100 degrees, urged residents to practice heat safety in the coming days, including limiting strenuous outdoor activities, staying hydrated, and checking up on neighbors who are elderly or don\u2019t have A/C. Heat-related illness is a concern in severely impacted areas, particularly for the elderly, young children and outdoor workers.

{"id": "2024_06_18_middleeast_hezbollah-drone-video-israel-haifa-intl-latam", "text": "The leader of Lebanese militant group Hezbollah threatened Wednesday to target the European island of Cyprus if war breaks out between Israel and Lebanon. \u201cCyprus will be part of this war too\u201d if it opens its airports and bases to Israeli forces, Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised address that came just a day after Israel warned the powerful Iran-backed militant group that the prospect of \u201call-out war\u201d was \u201cgetting very close.\u201d The comments by the Hezbollah leader are the first time he has threatened Cyprus, a member of the European Union that lies in the Mediterranean sea, roughly 125 miles (200 kilometers) from Lebanon, and which has held joint military exercises with Israel since 2014 and as recently as last year. Nasrallah\u2019s threat came as part of a fiery response to Israel\u2019s warning that saw him boast of his group\u2019s growing capabilities and threaten to \u201cshake the pillars\u201d of Israel if a war \u201cwere to be imposed on Lebanon.\u201d Tensions between Hezbollah and Israel have been rising since the October 7 Hamas attacks and the ensuing military campaign by the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza. In recent weeks, the intensity of cross-border attacks between the two has increased, raising concerns over the prospect of a full-blown war. Those prospects took a turn for the worse Tuesday, when Hezbollah flaunted a 9-minute video filmed by a drone showing civilian and military locations in and around one of Israel\u2019s largest cities, Haifa. The video prompted Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz to warn of an \u201call-out war\u201d in which \u201cHezbollah will be destroyed, and Lebanon severely beaten.\u201d On Wednesday, Nassrallah celebrated the video as evidence of its growing ability to gather intelligence. \u201cThe enemy knows that no place in the entire (state) is safe from our missiles, and it won\u2019t be arbitrary. Everything will be deliberately targeted,\u201d Nasrallah said in his speech. \u201cWe have long hours of footage of Haifa, of the outskirts of Haifa, and what comes after Haifa, and after after Haifa,\u201d Nasrallah said, in an apparent reference to a Hezbollah slogan from the 2006 war with Israel, when the group\u2019s rockets hit Haifa for the first time. In response to the threat by Nasrallah, Cyprus\u2019 President Nikos Christodoulides said the island was in \u201cno way involved in the war conflicts.\u201d \u201cThe Republic of Cyprus is not part of the problem. The Republic of Cyprus is part of the solution,\u201d Christodoulides said. \u201cAnd our role in this, as demonstrated, for example, through the humanitarian corridor, is recognized not only by the Arab world but by the international community as a whole.\u201d What the drone footage shows Parts of the Hezbollah footage, filmed in the daytime, claimed to show Krayot, a cluster of \u201chighly populated\u201d residential cities north of the Israeli city of Haifa and 28 km (17 miles) south of the Lebanese border, along with malls and high rises. Other parts claimed to show a military complex near Haifa belonging to Israeli weapons manufacturer Rafael \u2013 including Iron Dome batteries, missile storage sites and radar sites \u2013 and military boats, ships and oil storage depots in the port of Haifa.  CNN analysis has geolocated the video to a number of locations around Haifa. Those locations include a number of sensitive areas, including at least two military installations: a base in northern Haifa and the port of Haifa. The drone also flew over the oil tanks that sit north of Haifa, the Haifa airport and several residential areas. CNN also analyzed the shadows in the videos, which indicate the drone mission over Haifa lasted multiple hours, or took place over multiple days. The analysis shows parts of the video have been sped up. Weapons expert Wim Zwijnenburg, project leader for humanitarian disarmament at the Dutch peace organization PAX, told CNN that a drone visible in the footage appears to be \u201can Iranian-origin model of a Qasaf-2k, possibly manufactured locally.\u201d \u2018Psychological terror\u2019 The mayor of Haifa, Yona Yahav, has described the video as \u201cpsychological terror\u201d and demanded a protection plan for his city, criticizing IDF commanders for not having visited Haifa since the October 7 Hamas attack. \u201cI demand that the government present a plan for the massive defense of Haifa and find a military solution to eliminate the threat posed from the north,\u201d Yahav told Israeli radio station\u00a0Reshet Bet. Hezbollah has claimed the video was the \u201cfirst episode,\u201d suggesting more videos would surface from deep inside Israeli territory. A Hezbollah lawmaker in the Lebanese parliament who referenced the video in a social media post has also suggested more is to come. \u201cThis is what the party [Hezbollah] announced and you saw, but what is hidden is greater and greater and greater! Haifa and beyond, beyond, and beyond Haifa,\u201d Ibrahim Mousawi said in the post. His message appears to be a reference to a phrase coined by Nasrallah during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, when he said the militant group would fire rockets at Haifa \u201cand beyond Haifa\u201d. However, Israeli government spokesman David Mencer called the drone video the usual \u201cmischief making propaganda\u201d and said \u201cwe know precisely how to deal with [Hezbollah] one way or the other \u2013 diplomatically or through military means.\u201d Israeli military increasing readiness Israel has been preparing for the possibility that diplomatic efforts to reduce hostilities with Hezbollah could fail. The release of the footage comes as Israel\u2019s military says it has \u201capproved and validated\u201d operational plans for an offensive in Lebanon and made decisions on increasing the readiness of troops in the field. The plans were approved by the commanding officer of the Northern Command and the head of the Operations Directorate during a joint situational assessment to prepare for the continuation of combat, the IDF said in a statement. The approval of the operational plans does not mean a war between Israel and Hezbollah is imminent \u2013 but it does signal that Israel intends to be ready for such a scenario. In response to the Hezbollah video, the IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi said Wednesday that the Israeli military was \u201cpreparing and coming up with solutions to deal with these and other capabilities. \u201cWe have many more forces in the IDF that are engaged in an offensive against Hezbollah,\u201d Halevi said in a conversation with Israeli troops at an aerial defense battery along Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon. \u201cI believe the enemy knows only a little about the capabilities we have and will face them, when necessary, at the right time,\u201d Halevi added. Hezbollah has fired more than 5,000 rockets, missiles and drones at northern Israel since October 7, claiming that its attacks are in solidarity with the Palestinian people. Hezbollah has said in the past that it will only stop firing on Israel if Israel stops the war in Gaza. For its part, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Lebanon and evacuated approximately 60,000 residents from the northern border. More than 90,000 Lebanese have also fled their homes in the area. The US has sought a diplomatic off-ramp to avoid a wider war that could spread to the region, sending special envoy Amos Hochstein to Israel and Lebanon this week to try to ease tensions. Israel and Hezbollah exchanged more cross-border fire on Wednesday in the latest round of hostilities on the combative border, a day after the visit by the Biden aide ended. Hezbollah revealed that four of its fighters from southern Lebanon were killed without specifying when or how they died. The Iran-backed group also announced it had targeted Metula and Kryat Shmona in northern Israel with drones. Videos shared by Lebanese media close to Hezbollah showed plumes of smoke rising from the southern Lebanese village of Burghalia after an Israeli strike, with more strikes on other Lebanese villages including Mais Al-Jabal, Talat Al-Awaida, Al-Khiyam and Hula, according to the state-run news agency NNA.

The two had been talking online for months and built a close relationship. Eventually, Jessie convinced Dennis to invest in crypto. Dennis complied. Without ever meeting Jessie in person, he spent everything he had, and when he had nothing left, she demanded more. Until one day the money disappeared, leaving him in ruin. In early March, Dennis\u2019 children scheduled a meeting to help their father get back on his feet after the scam. The plan was for him to move in with Adrianne and her family. \u201cWe wanted him to know that he was going to be taken care of,\u201d Matt said. But the morning of the meeting none of them could reach Dennis. Matt drove to Dennis\u2019s apartment but he wasn\u2019t home, and all calls went straight to voicemail. They figured he must be out on one of his long runs. An hour later, police knocked on Matt\u2019s door to inform him that Dennis had taken his own life. Dennis was one of countless victims of a massive global criminal operation predominantly run by Chinese gangs who have built a multibillion-dollar scam industry in Southeast Asia. There, they\u2019ve assembled an army of scammers, many held against their will in guarded compounds and forced to con people all around the world out of their life savings. It\u2019s theft at a scale so large that investigators are now calling it a mass transfer of wealth from middle-class Americans to criminal gangs. Last year, the FBI estimates, pig butchering scams stole nearly $4 billion from tens of thousands of American victims, a 53% increase from the year before. While the crime takes place online, its real-world consequences are devastating. Law enforcement sources predict that losses will continue to grow in the next year, and as the criminals remain out of reach, money and lives will continue to be lost. \u2018Victims victimizing victims\u2019 Santa Clara county prosecutor Erin West has dedicated the last few years to fighting pig butchering scams. \u201cI\u2019ve been a prosecutor for over 25 years, I\u2019ve done all kinds of different types of crime. I spent nine years in sexual assault. And I\u2019ve never seen the absolute decimation of people that I\u2019ve seen as a result of pig butchering,\u201d she says. Being in the heart of the tech industry in California\u2019s Bay Area, Erin and her team were some of the first to begin investigating pig butchering scams. \u201cWe\u2019ve got victims victimizing victims and the only winners are Chinese gangsters,\u201d she says. Shawn Bradstreet, US Secret Service special agent in charge of the San Francisco field office, told CNN that some of the money stolen from American victims is spent on expanding the scam operations and the massive compounds that house them and other illicit activities. West and Bradstreet are part of a small group of US law enforcement agencies working to find ways to tackle a crime that largely takes place online and overseas. Social media is flooded with scammers hunting for victims, on WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn and, increasingly, dating apps such as Bumble and Tinder. \u201cThe unfortunate reality is that scammers may pull on the heartstrings on those looking for love or connection - on dating apps and on all online platforms,\u201d a spokesman for Match group, which owns Tinder, said in a statement. Match, Bumble, Facebook and Whatsapp parent company Meta told CNN they are working to prevent scammers from using their platforms, by flagging suspicious language and educating their users. In a statement to CNN a Bumble spokesperson said they have introduced AI to help identify spam, scam and fake profiles \u201caiming to take action before such profiles have the opportunity to interact with members.\u201d CNN has reached out to LinkedIn for comment. In May, a group of tech companies including cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase, Meta, Match group and the anti-scam charity organization GASO announced the \u201cTech Against Scams Coalition,\u201d acknowledging that scams \u201care a pervasive issue across the entire tech landscape.\u201d But West says that\u2019s not enough. She recently set up a task force called Operation Shamrock to bring together law enforcement, social media, crypto exchanges and traditional banks to tackle crypto scams. A 2023 CNN investigation revealed that many of the scammers are themselves victims of human trafficking. Lured to Southeast Asia with promises of white-collar jobs, they are instead trafficked into Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and other destinations. Since a 2021 military coup, Myanmar has become Asia\u2019s scam capital where criminals can operate freely under the cover of a bloody civil war. Today, city-sized compounds loom over the Myanmar side of the border with Thailand, with nothing but a dried-out river separating the two countries. Inside are what can only be described as scam factories \u2014 offices full of hundreds of slaves, working 16-hour days to befriend victims and convince them to invest in cryptocurrency on fake platforms that mimic legitimate crypto exchanges. Those kept inside tell stories of torture and abuse, of scammers who don\u2019t bring in enough money being beaten with electrical sticks and forced to do hundreds of squats as punishment. Rakesh, an Indian national, was trafficked to a compound called Gate 25 in Myanmar after applying for an IT job in Thailand in late 2022. There he signed a scamming contract under threat of execution, and was trained to scam. For 11 months he posed as \u201cKlara Semonov,\u201d a Russian investor based in Salt Lake City. To avoid gruesome punishments inflicted by his captors, he said he sent romantic messages to victims like Dennis to convince them to invest their money. \u201cSeventy to 80% fall for fake love,\u201d he said. Rakesh was eventually released in 2023 when his contract ended. He believes he was let go because he simply wasn\u2019t good enough at scamming. \u201cThey (were) treating us like slaves,\u201d he told CNN days after his release in 2023. Conveniently located on the border, the compounds use telecoms services from the Thai side. In November 2023 Thai Justice Minister Tawee Sodsong said they were working to cut off the compounds. Pachara Naripthaphan of the Thai National Broadcasting Transmissions Commission has since told CNN that in May they instructed all telecom operators to shut off wireless services in proximity to any areas bordering Myanmar, Laos or Cambodia. Despite that, their data shows that illicit activity has continued at a baseline level as criminals adjust to using other means of connecting to the internet such as Starlink. Even here on the border, where the physical distance is reduced to nothing but a narrow river, the criminals remain out of the reach of law enforcement, either locally or internationally. \u201cMany of these perpetrators are beyond my reach. And in order to establish deterrence, we need to prosecute some individuals who are running these operations in Southeast Asia,\u201d Santa Clara district attorney Jeff Rosen says. According to FBI data, out of nearly $5 billion dollars lost to cryptocurrency fraud in 2023, $3.96 billion was stolen in pig butchering scams. While Rosen\u2019s office and the Secret Service have had some success in retrieving millions of dollars in stolen funds, no American law enforcement agency has been able to arrest a single suspected scammer. \u2018Hard to believe\u2019 Carina, who asked CNN to only use her first name, met \u201cEvan\u201d on Bumble in May 2023. His photos showed a blond man with piercing blue eyes. He claimed to be Dutch and showed off his wealth \u2014 expensive cars and Rolexes, though none of that appealed to Carina, a chemistry PhD and triathlete. Their relationship moved fast. Right away he suggested they move their conversation to WhatsApp and delete the Bumble app to focus on getting to know each other. A few days later he started calling her \u201choney.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re doing that already?\u201d Carina asked, in a text conversation seen by CNN. Evan claimed he had made his money running a company with his uncle and investing in crypto. He told her she could pay off her student loans in a matter of months by investing. Carina was hesitant at first but eventually agreed to put in $1,000. He told her not to use the official app of the Kraken crypto platform, and instead sent her a link to a parallel website which they used to trade in the coming months. As their investments grew, so did their relationship. The two made plans for the future, romantic weekend getaways and family introductions, though they were yet to meet in person. \u201cI\u2019ve never met anyone like you before. Hard to believe I\u2019m falling for a man I have never seen or spoken to,\u201d Carina told him just a few weeks in. The first red flag emerged when Evan pressured Carina to enter an \u201cevent\u201d where she would have to invest $150,000 by the end of July to make extra profit. If she failed to reach the target, her account and money would be frozen. Scared to lose the money she had already put in, Carina panicked. She took out a high-interest loan and borrowed money from friends and family to meet the deadline. Despite all his purported wealth, Evan refused to help her, instead lying and telling her he was struggling to meet his target of $500,000 and needed her help, she said. At one point, Carina found herself consoling her scammer, telling him the money didn\u2019t matter as long as they loved each other. \u2018Major psychological stunt\u2019 After Dennis took his life, his adult children were left piecing together what happened by going through his Facebook messages. There, they learned for the first time what Dennis had been dealing with. \u201cI have been having dark thoughts about my life and it being over. Certainly it looks like my financial life is done,\u201d Dennis messaged his scammer in the months before his death. \u201cAnd the ultimate pain here is that I have betrayed family trust. This is unbearable,\u201d he writes in screenshots of their conversation seen by CNN. \u201cWhat\u2019s most heartbreaking is reading through these messages. He was talking about having signs of a nervous breakdown. And so these were all shared with the profile,\u201d Adrianne says. \u201cInstead of sharing with us,\u201d Matt adds. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing here is that these scammers overseas have figured out a way that they can get victims to trust them over their own families,\u201d West says. \u201cIt\u2019s a major psychological stunt that they\u2019re pulling on the rest of the world.\u201d Carina didn\u2019t tell her family about what had happened and the stress she was under until the very final moment. After hitting their event targets, Carina tried to withdraw some of her money, but was unable to do so, having violated platform rules by investing in the same account as Evan. After months of hiding it, Carina told her family, who suggested she speak to Kraken directly. The next morning she called Kraken customer services, who informed her there was no account under her name.  \u201cI realized I had been scammed at that point. And I broke down,\u201d Carina says. \u201cIt was all fake. It was a fake profile. It was a fake story. The amount of time that he spent grooming and getting to know me was incessant.\u201d Reading through their conversations a year later, Carina barely recognizes herself. \u201cIt\u2019s actually heartbreaking for me to see the state that I was in,\u201d she says. The emotional and financial entanglement had taken a toll on her, and she was left reeling from a breakup and bankruptcy at the same time. In the aftermath, Carina had to move back in with her mother. It will take her at least a decade to repay her debts. \u2018Playing on emotions\u2019 Their grief still raw, Adrianne and Matt are only now starting to understand what happened to their father. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t up against one person. It\u2019s a multibillion-dollar criminal organization with a playbook that\u2019s playing on the emotions \u2026 It was almost like he was brainwashed to some extent,\u201d Dennis\u2019 daughter Adrianne says. As the criminals\u2019 tactics continue to evolve and law enforcement struggles to find a way to stop them, there will be more victims in 2024, and more people like Matt and Adrianne, who suffer a loss far greater than money. \u201cHe died embarrassed, ashamed, financially devastated, heartbroken. And if sharing our story helps somebody else or another family, then it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Adrianne says.

{"id": "2024_06_13_style_lagos-fashion-lgbtq-inclusivity", "text": "Since its inception in 2011,\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week has been a twice-yearly highlight of the African fashion calendar, a multi-day\u00a0showcase attracting the continent\u2019s top design\u00a0houses, big name sponsors, as well as an international audience. In a deeply religious and conservative Nigeria,\u00a0where\u00a0LGBTQ\u00a0people suffer extremely high\u00a0levels of homophobia, intolerance, and even violence,\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week quickly established itself as an inclusive space for marginalized communities and unconventional brands to be seen and heard. For more than a decade, Nigerian label Orange Culture has staged catwalk shows featuring male models in skirts, makeup, or wearing ribbons down the runway as a way of provoking conversations about how fashion can be used to break down gender norms. Maxivive \u2014\u00a0which\u00a0describes\u00a0itself\u00a0as \u201ca\u00a0Lagos-based fashion organization founded\u2026 on ideas of nonconformity and the subversion of norms\u201d \u2014\u00a0has\u00a0also made waves showcasing graphic, gender-bending pieces addressing issues around sexuality and identity over consecutive seasons. Over the past few years however, members of the\u00a0LGBTQ community\u00a0in Nigeria say\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week\u2019s inclusive stance has come under pressure amidst a growing culture of hostility towards non-binary and gay people in the country. In 2014, despite widespread international condemnation, Nigeria \u2014 Africa\u2019s most populous nation \u2014\u00a0adopted the SSMPA law (Same Sex Marriage Prohibition Act)\u00a0which bans gay marriage, same-sex relationships and membership of gay rights groups with punishments including a prison term of up to 14 years for those convicted. Gay\u00a0rights\u00a0activists say these sentiments are filtering down into what was one of Nigeria\u2019s most open-minded industries: Fashion. Kayode Timileyin is the founder of Queercity Media and Production, one of the leading non- governmental\u00a0queer organizations in Nigeria as well as being the festival manager for\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Pride, a week-long celebration in June to commemorate Pride month in Nigeria. \u201cThere is a history of anti-queerness when it comes to fashion week in Nigeria,\u201d he told CNN. Activists point to the city\u2019s Spring-Summer 2022 showcase, featuring the late Fola Francis \u2014 the first-ever transgender person\u00a0to be cast by labels to model on the city\u2019s catwalk.\u00a0 Francis tragically drowned in December 2023. While her debut was hailed as a watershed moment in both African fashion and for the queer community at large (she walked twice, for labels Cute-Saint and Fruch\u00e9), it also sparked controversy. At the time, Francis said she faced a public backlash from some sections of Nigerian society\u00a0and pointed out that despite her boundary-breaking appearances, no images of her were posted on\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week\u2019s social media accounts.\u00a0In\u00a0an interview with digital LGBTQ magazine Xtra\u00a0shortly after the event in November 2022, Francis said \u201cI heard the\u00a0Lagos Fashion Week\u2019s team decided not to post any of my pictures from the runway or include (them) in any press releases. Why am I not surprised?\u201d (The magazine said they approached\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week at the time, who did not respond to their requests for comment.) After casting non-binary models to walk on its catwalk during the Spring-Summer 2023 shows, subversive fashion house Maxivive had its show cancelled by organizers just days before it was meant to go ahead. While brand founder Papa Oyeyemi told CNN he would prefer not to talk about the cancellation, discussion within the industry centered around the presentation having been deemed \u201ctoo gay\u201d by organizers. \u201cFor the presentation to get cancelled at the last minute was very disheartening,\u201d one non-binary model booked to walk for Maxivive told CNN (they wished to remain anonymous for their safety). \u201cQueer people exist in Nigeria and fashion is meant to be expressive, not restrictive.\u201d Tosin Ogundadegbe, a Lagos-based fashion stylist\u00a0known as \u201cThe Style Infidel\u201d on social\u00a0media said that the fashion industry in Nigeria still has a long way to go when it comes to\u00a0inclusivity. \u201cThe traditional fashion schedule suffers from (a lack of) inclusivity on the runway \u2014 we only see representation of marginalized communities at private shows.\u201d Finding the freedom to be who you are Indeed, amid what\u2019s perceived as a growing pressure for organizers to adhere to anti-gay laws and increasingly divisive politics around gender, sexuality and inclusivity in Nigeria, an increasing number of fashion labels have chosen to show \u201coff-schedule\u201d via \u201cunderground\u201d private presentations where they feel they can be more free to embody the ethos of their brands, rather than in the glare of\u00a0Lagos\u00a0Fashion Week. From labels such as\u00a0Tzar Studios,\u00a0a \u201cvisually provocative contemporary menswear brand\u2026 inspired by the ethos of the metrosexual man,\u201d to\u00a0ready-to-wear brand\u00a0Weiz Dhurm Franklyn, these\u00a0clandestine, \u201cinvite only\u201d shows are curated by designers who keep locations discreet and hand-pick trusted journalists, influencers, celebrities and fashion industry figures to sit in the audience. Udiahgebi, a fashion brand known for its androgynous pieces, has successfully hosted private shows in this way. The house\u00a0cast five non-binary models to walk in its first-ever runway show in 2022 to a positive reception, brand creative director Chiemerie Udiahgebi Ugwoke told CNN. \u201cThe feedback after my show was\u00a0alarmingly good,\u201d they wrote over email. \u201cI was not expecting positive reviews from the attendees because\u2026 I took gender-neutral clothes (featuring see-through fabrics, animal prints and cut-outs) and played with them in a way I felt was more likely to attract negative reviews\u00a0considering the society we live in.\u201d \u201cI see fashion as art, it is meant to start a conversation and also provoke thought,\u201d said Kayode Timileyin. \u201cHowever, over the years, (Lagos) Fashion Week continues to hush down and limit these conversations.\u201d While championing an inclusive future for the artists and fashion designers of Africa cannot solely be done behind closed doors; for now, many designers believe it is the only \u2014 and an essential \u2014 way to be able to freely express who they are. Lagos Fashion Week did not respond to CNN\u2019s repeated requests for comment.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/13/style/lagos-fashion-lgbtq-inclusivity/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_chance-encounters-airplane-romance-airport-kiss", "text": "Amy Osmun assumed she\u2019d never see Mike Gilberstadt again. They\u2019d met only 10 hours before. Now they were standing in Amsterdam\u2019s Schiphol Airport, facing one another, both putting off the farewells. But time was ticking. They were both set to catch connecting flights \u2013 Amy to Scotland, Mike to Greece. \u201cI guess we have to say goodbye,\u201d said Amy, reluctantly. In a gesture of farewell, Mike leaned in to hug Amy. He kissed her, briefly, on the cheek. Then Mike readied to leave, adjusting the bag on his shoulder. He was about to turn away when Amy spoke: \u201cIs that all I\u2019m going to get?\u201d she said, smiling. Even as she said it, Amy knew this was a moment she\u2019d remember. \u201cThat\u2019s when he gave me a real kiss,\u201d Amy tells CNN Travel today. \u201cIt was absolutely electric.\u201d For a moment, Amy and Mike stood, kissing, amid the crowds of travelers at the airport. And then it really was time to say goodbye. Mike took Amy\u2019s number, writing down her details on a scrap of paper. Then they went in different directions. As Amy walked away from Mike, she tried to make sense of what had just happened. She never usually spoke to strangers while traveling, let alone kissed them. And she couldn\u2019t figure out how her airport embrace with Mike fit into the wider context of her life. Was Mike just a stranger she\u2019d quickly forget? Would this become a funny story someday? Would she always wonder what could have been? Or would she look back and feel sadness, regret? As Amy lined up at her gate, she tried to shake herself out of her reverie and swipe Mike from her mind. After all, she wasn\u2019t just traveling to Scotland for a vacation \u2014 she was visiting someone. And not just anyone: her boyfriend. Mike couldn\u2019t be someone, Amy told herself, because she already had her someone. An airplane encounter Amy and Mike met on March 23, 2006, on an airplane about to depart Los Angeles International Airport. Back then, Amy was a 24-year-old trainee dietician at California State University, flying to Scotland for spring break. She\u2019d ended up with the middle seat \u2013 an unenviable prospect for a long-haul flight. But while there was someone sitting next to Amy by the window, there was no one sitting in the aisle seat. \u201cIt looked like I had an empty seat next to me for the long-haul flight \u2013 so I was pretty excited,\u201d Amy recalls today.\u00a0 \u201cAnd then I swear, right before the plane doors closed, he came sauntering down the aisle.\u201d \u201cHe\u201d, of course, was Mike \u2014 who is, by his own admission, \u201cnot a punctual man.\u201d He was the last person to board the plane, and he bounced into the empty seat next to Amy, who couldn\u2019t help but roll her eyes. \u201cI was not impressed in the moment, as I faced a 10-hour flight squished in a middle seat,\u201d Amy recalls. But then Mike apologized \u2013 half jokingly, half sincere \u2013 for ruining Amy\u2019s flight. And then, noting her eye mask and travel neck pillow already wrapped around her head, Mike \u2013 half jokingly, half sincere \u2013 offered Amy his shoulder to sleep on instead. Amy smiled despite herself. Later, once they were in the air, when Amy\u2019s food choice arrived and looked less-than-edible, Mike insisted she help herself to his meal tray. As she picked food off his plate, Mike and Amy started chatting \u2013 realizing they were a similar age, both living in Southern California, both interested in travel. Amy thought Mike was funny and self-assured \u2013 and while she noted he tried to mask it under his jokes and bravado, he seemed kind. Feeling comfortable in his presence \u2013 and desperate to sleep \u2013 Amy accepted Mike\u2019s offer of sleeping on his shoulder. Several hours later, Mike and Amy landed in Amsterdam. As they disembarked the airplane, Mike suggested they grab a coffee together. First in the coffee line, and later as they walked through the airport, Amy and Mike continued chatting. Amy noted how easy conversation was \u2013 even though they barely knew one another and were both bleary-eyed from the overnight flight. And then, somehow, they ended up kissing in the middle of Amsterdam Schipol Airport. \u201cI thought I\u2019d never see him again,\u201d says Amy. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Why not go out there a little bit?\u2019\u201d From long haul to phone calls As for Mike, he\u2019d liked Amy from the moment she scowled at him, eye mask perched on her head, as he boarded the plane at LAX. Throughout his time in Greece, Mike regularly replayed the airport kiss in his mind, hoping he\u2019d see Amy again, wondering if and when he should get in touch. Meanwhile Amy was enduring a \u201cdisastrous\u201d visit with her long-distance boyfriend. She left Scotland single. The break-up wasn\u2019t really anything to do with Mike, says Amy today. She just realized this particular guy wasn\u2019t right for her. Back in California, Amy returned to her classes and doubled down on her studies. From time to time, Amy\u2019s thoughts drifted to Mike \u2013 on their immediate rapport, on the airport kiss \u2013 but when he unexpectedly phoned her one day and asked her out, Amy said no. She was still reeling from her break-up and didn\u2019t want to jump into anything new too quickly. But over the next several weeks, Mike kept calling. Soon, Amy and Mike were chatting on the phone for hours at a time. Mike\u2019s roommates teased him about these lengthy calls, but Mike laughed off their jokes. He enjoyed talking to Amy, and she liked talking to him too. \u201cMike was still just as charming as he was on the plane and at the airport,\u201d says Amy. \u201cSo I finally took him up, and we went on our first date.\u201d That first evening, Amy and Mike met up for sushi and then went for a walk on the beach which turned into Mike giving Amy a piggyback ride. They collapsed onto the sand, laughing. Later, back at Mike\u2019s apartment, Amy marveled at the fact Mike\u2019s television set had TiVo \u2013 a recording device that allows viewers to record live television to watch later. Right away, Amy wrote down a list of her favorite TV shows and asked Mike if he could record them on her behalf. Amy was genuinely excited at this prospect \u2013 but it was also a bit of a ruse: if Mike was recording Amy\u2019s favorite TV shows, she\u2019d definitely be returning to watch them. A week or so later, Amy and Mike enjoyed their second date at the themed dinner entertainment venue Medieval Times. Afterward, back at Mike\u2019s apartment, they caught glimpses of distant fireworks illuminating the skies at Disneyland. Over the next weeks, Amy and Mike continued meeting up regularly. \u201cA month or so in I had met his parents,\u201d recalls Amy. This felt especially significant because Amy had never met her previous boyfriend\u2019s family or friends. There were other signs that Mike was in it for the long haul. \u201cHe let slip that he had told a friend that he thought he was going to marry me,\u201d recalls Amy. Nevertheless, Amy worried her happiness with Mike had an enddate. She was set to leave the US for the UK for several months as part of her dietetics degree. Amy worried her new relationship wouldn\u2019t survive this distance, and she debated what to do, eventually ending things with Mike before she left for the UK. Or, possibly, Mike ended things with Amy. \u201cHe still maintains that he was the one that broke up with me, but I distinctly recall having a conversation with a friend just before about if I should break up with him,\u201d says Amy. The truth was both Amy and Mike were concerned about the impact of long distance on their fledgling relationship. Mike didn\u2019t want Amy to leave, but Amy wasn\u2019t going to abandon a great career opportunity. They both \u2013 reluctantly \u2013 came to the conclusion the relationship must have run its course. \u201cSo we broke up,\u201d says Amy. \u201cBut we stayed in touch.\u201d Staying in touch As soon as Amy left, Mike was flooded with regret. He found himself wishing he could have gone to the UK with her, and he thought about her often. Amy missed Mike too. They kept up to date on one another\u2019s lives via email and the occasional phone call. Social media was still in its infancy back then, so Mike also resorted to old school methods, sending heartfelt cards to Amy across the Atlantic. Today, Mike jokes that this \u201cnever happened.\u201d He\u2019s not generally prone to putting pen to paper, and rarely sends cards to anyone on any occasion. But Amy has the proof \u2013 she kept all Mike\u2019s long distance correspondence, including a Valentine\u2019s Day card sent to her in February 2007. \u201cIt was fate I met you,\u201d reads Mike\u2019s message in the card. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t tied to Orange County, I would follow you anywhere. But most of all I wish you all the happiness in the world. You\u2019ll always be my Valentine.\u201d Not long after Amy returned home to California that spring, she reunited with Mike. They picked a pointedly non-romantic spot for the reunion: Target, in San Diego. Amy was shopping with a friend of hers, and Mike came along too. The group walked around, browsing, laughing and joking. \u201cIt was one of those Targets with two floors,\u201d recalls Amy. \u201cSo you have a cart elevator \u2013 I was super excited about that.\u201d Amy was also excited to see Mike again. And it was clear he felt the same way. The two kept stealing glances across the Target aisle. Within days, Mike and Amy were a couple again. Moving forward From then on, Amy and Mike\u2019s relationship was unwavering and solid. \u201cOnce we got back together, we were together,\u201d is how Mike puts it. Amy finished her studies and started working as a dietician in a hospital. She and Mike moved in together. Then, in late 2007, Amy and Mike went on a trip to Ireland and Italy. While on a stopover in Venice, Mike asked Amy to marry him. \u201cWe get in that gondola and then under the Rialto Bridge he popped down on his knee on the gondola and proposed,\u201d Amy recalls. She wasn\u2019t expecting the proposal at all, but Amy was thrilled, and said yes immediately. \u201cIt was a fun surprise,\u201d says Amy. \u201cAnd we got to spend the rest of the trip engaged, which was fun.\u201d Amy remembers excitedly phoning her parents and sister, discovering Mike had let them know his intentions before the trip. They were thrilled for her too. Back home in the US, Mike and Amy started planning their wedding for the following year. That\u2019s when they realized their parents shared a wedding anniversary: November 1. As a nod to that coincidence, Amy and Mike got married on November 2, 2008. Amy took Mike\u2019s name, becoming Amy Gilberstadt. During their ceremony, Amy and Mike toasted their parents\u2019 long marriages and their own future. The heartfelt speeches from friends and family also included several references to Amy and Mike\u2019s cinematic airplane meeting. Right after their wedding, Amy and Mike boarded another plane together \u2013 traveling to Hong Kong and then India for their honeymoon. \u201cWe had a lot of fun,\u201d says Amy of the trip. This kickstarted a pattern \u2013 each year, Amy and Mike committed to two big vacations a year. They\u2019ve since traveled to destinations including Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand and Tahiti. \u201cEven when our son was born, he was only six months old and we were in the United Kingdom for a trip,\u201d recalls Amy. Amy and Mike welcomed their son in 2010. They were both delighted to become parents. \u201cI\u2019d always wanted children \u2013 I wanted to have a son and named him after me, which I\u2019ve done, so that they could know my pain of having their calls answered and their mail opened,\u201d says Mike, laughing. Mike and Amy later welcomed a daughter in 2013. The couple describe their two kids as \u201cpretty darn fabulous.\u201d Over the years, Amy and Mike have enjoyed watching one another find their footing as parents. \u201cI can keep the play dates, the organizational stuff going. But I was not, and I\u2019m still not, very good at playing,\u201d says Amy to Mike. \u201cYou\u2019re really good at that. I would give myself about five minutes of playing Barbies and I was like, \u2018I\u2019ve got to go do something else.\u2019 And you could be up there for ages with our daughter.\u201d \u201cWe had a whole world going on,\u201d says Mike of his years playing Barbies with his daughter. In recent years, Amy and Mike have also supported each other through tougher times. In 2020, Amy\u2019s aunt passed away suddenly and her mother became extremely ill with Covid-19. That same year, Mike\u2019s mother was diagnosed with lung cancer. \u201cThat was a really tough time,\u201d says Amy. She and Mike rallied together around their loved ones and \u201csurvived loss and illness,\u201d as Amy puts it. \u201cWe\u2019re still going strong,\u201d she says. Going strong Today, Amy and Mike are forced on family, travel and adventures. The Gilberstadts recently headed to Alaska to catch the Northern Lights and then on to Vermont to see April\u2019s solar eclipse. \u201cI had never seen a total solar eclipse before. So I wasn\u2019t expecting much from that. But that was way more amazing than I thought it would be,\u201d says Mike. \u201cIt was quite a celestial trip.\u201d \u201cWe had a blast,\u201d says Amy. Later this year, Amy and Mike hope to take their kids to Japan \u2013 an 11 hour plus flight from LAX. Amy and Mike joke that they still operate on long haul flights very similarly to how they did on that first flight over 18 years ago: Amy tries everything and anything to get some sleep, while Mike will always offer her his shoulder or lap. The main difference is Amy and Mike have since perfected \u201cplaying with travel points,\u201d as Mike puts it, and like to travel in the premier cabins if they can. And they always avoid the middle seat \u2013 even though it\u2019s what brought them together all those years ago. Today, Amy and Mike look back on their first meeting with a mix of joy, surprise and gratitude. For Amy, it makes her a little \u201cteary-eyed\u201d as she puts it, to reflect on their random meeting and everything they\u2019ve been through since. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she says. As for Mike, he possibly said it best in one of his other rare forays into card writing \u2013 on Amy\u2019s first Mother\u2019s Day in 2010: \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought all these things would happen,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHopping on that flight to Greece was the best and most rewarding thing I have ever done.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/chance-encounters-airplane-romance-airport-kiss/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

Gordon Black, has appeared in court in the Russian city of Vladivostok, as his trial got underway on Monday. Black did not admit to charges of threatening to kill a Russian woman, but partially admitted guilt to theft charges, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Black was arrested in May on charges of theft in Vladivostok, where he traveled to visit the woman, believed to be his girlfriend. He is accused of stealing 10,000 rubles (roughly $112) from her when he visited Russia in April after meeting her in Korea, state news agency TASS reported. The US soldier is additionally of assaulting her during a quarrel. He was not authorized by the US Defense Department to travel to Russia and did not request official clearance to do so when he left his unit in South Korea earlier this year, according to Army spokesperson Cynthia Smith. The trial comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow, as\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u00a0rages on. There are a number of Americans being held in Russia, including two who have been declared as wrongfully detained by the US State Department \u2013 Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich\u00a0and former Marine\u00a0Paul Whelan. Speaking to the Pervomaisky District Court on Monday, Black said he took the 10,000 rubles (roughly $112) from the woman\u2019s purse, but the next day transferred $125 to her. He said he spent the money on food and three nights in a hotel, according to RIA. He also said the woman was to collect a deposit of 10,000 rubles from the landlord after the end of the lease of the apartment for which he was paying, RIA said. The female victim also spoke in court on Monday, saying she was not yet ready to\u00a0reconcile with the suspect since the damage had not yet been compensated. The next hearing is scheduled for June 19, according to RIA.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/europe/us-soldier-gordon-black-trial-russia-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}

The suspect had threatened officers in Hamburg\u2019s famous St. Pauli district and was shot in the leg, according to Hamburg police. The suspect is receiving medical treatment. While the incident took place 700 meters (0.4 miles) away from a Euro 2024 fan zone, police said it was not related to the upcoming match between Poland and the Netherlands. Supporters of the Dutch side had participated in a \u201cfan walk\u201d near the scene of the incident earlier in the day, but by the time the man began threatening police officers, the walk was finished and few fans remained in the area, according to a police spokesperson. Police also said the incident is not considered to be linked to terrorism. Germany is hosting hundreds of thousands of foreign fans at the the month-tournament, which began on Friday.

The body of the man was found Sunday on a rocky, fairly remote beach on the island of Mathraki by another tourist. He had been reported missing Thursday by his host, a Greek-American friend. The tourist had last been seen Tuesday at a cafe in the company of two female tourists who have since left the island. No further details about the victim, including a name or hometown, were immediately available. Mathraki, which has a population of 100, is a 3.9-square-kilometer (1.2-square-mile) heavily wooded island, west of the better-known island of Corfu. This was the latest in a string of recent cases in which tourists on the Greek islands have died or gone missing. Some, if not all, had set out on hikes in very hot temperatures. A 74-year-old\u00a0Dutch tourist\u00a0was found by a fire department drone on Saturday lying face down in a ravine about 300 meters (330 yards) from the spot where he was last observed last Sunday, walking with some difficulty in the blistering heat. Dr.\u00a0Michael Mosley, a noted British television presenter and author, was found dead last Sunday on the island of Symi. A coroner concluded that he had died the previous Wednesday, shortly after going for a hike over difficult, rocky terrain. On Friday, two French tourists were reported missing on Sikinos, a relatively secluded Cyclades island in the Aegean Sea, with less than 400 permanent residents. The two women, ages 64 and 73, had left their respective hotels to meet. On the island of Amorgos, also in the Cyclades, authorities are still searching for a 59-year-old tourist reported missing since Tuesday, when he had gone on a solo hike in very hot conditions. US media identified the missing tourist as retired Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Albert Calibet of Hermosa Beach, California.

{"id": "2024_06_19_asia_vietnam-russia-putin-visit-intl-hnk", "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi on Wednesday, fresh from a rare meeting in North Korea\u00a0with counterpart Kim Jong Un in which the two leaders agreed a new strategic partnership driven by Moscow\u2019s need for weapons for its war in Ukraine. Considered a pariah by the West, Putin is looking to boost economic ties with friendly countries and show that Western isolation is not having an impact. Communist-run Vietnam appears to be a natural choice with its foreign policy of non-alignment and close historical ties to Moscow, and few countries can successfully host the leaders of the United States, China and Russia with such fanfare as Vietnam. Putin\u2019s two-day visit to Vietnam has rankled the United States, with a State Department spokesperson saying, \u201cno country should give Putin a platform to promote his war of aggression and otherwise allow him to normalize his atrocities.\u201d \u201cIf he is able to travel freely, it could normalize Russia\u2019s blatant violations of international law and inadvertently send the message that atrocities can be committed in Ukraine and elsewhere with impunity,\u201d the spokesperson added. The Russian leader met with Vietnamese leadership including Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and new President To Lam, according to Russian state-run news agency TASS, citing the Kremlin. Putin told Lam on Thursday that \u201cstrengthening a comprehensive strategic partnership with Vietnam is always one of our priorities,\u201d TASS reported. At the start of his talks with Lam, Putin invited him to Victory Day celebrations in Moscow next year. \u201cWe will be glad to welcome you to the celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War in Moscow,\u201d TASS quoted Putin as saying. Much like his visit to Pyongyang, Putin\u2019s trip to Hanoi could signal deepening relations between the two nations as the Russian leader looks to garner concrete support amid international sanctions over his grinding war in Ukraine. Ahead of the visit, Putin\u00a0thanked Vietnam for its \u201cbalanced position\u201d on Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in an article for the Vietnamese Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, according to the Kremlin. \u201cWe are grateful to our Vietnamese friends for their balanced position on the Ukraine crisis and their desire to facilitate the search for practical ways to settle it peacefully. All of this is fully in line with the spirit and nature of our relations,\u201d\u00a0Putin\u00a0said. Vietnam\u2019s Ambassador to Russia Dang Minh Koi told the Vietnam News Agency that the state visit will strengthen Hanoi-Moscow ties, and be \u201can opportunity for the leaders of the two countries to discuss and propose concrete measures to boost bilateral trade and economic cooperation,\u201d TASS reported. A joint statement is expected to be adopted and numerous agreements announced on cooperation in sectors including \u201ctrade and economic, scientific, technological and humanitarian areas,\u201d according to Russian presidential foreign policy aide Yury\u00a0Ushakov, TASS reported. Vietnam\u2019s balancing act Moscow has been a major supplier of weapons to Vietnam since the Soviet era and analysts say arms and energy talks could feature on the agenda. The visit also showcases Vietnam\u2019s foreign policy balancing act, which like India, enables the\u00a0country to be on friendly terms with rival major powers including Russia, the United States and China \u2013 all vital trading partners. Last year, Vietnam hosted both Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden. That trip resulted in the US and Vietnam upgrading diplomatic ties to a \u201ccomprehensive strategic partnership,\u201d in a historic sign of improving relations between the former foes. The two nations have accelerated trade in recent years and the US is currently reviewing an upgrade to Vietnam\u2019s market economy status that would allow Hanoi to benefit from lower tariffs on goods imported into the US. Vietnam is center to US efforts to counter rising Chinese influence in the region and a key part of Washington\u2019s Indo-Pacific strategy. Vietnam in turn is keen to benefit from American efforts to diversify supply chains outside of China as well as US concern over China\u2019s military build-up in the South China Sea. The two countries have built up their partnership just decades after fighting a devastating\u00a0war that decimated the country. \u201cFrom the Vietnamese perspective, Russia is still seen as an important partner with deep historical ties and important roles to play in Vietnam\u2019s defense and security policy,\u201d said Le Hong Hiep, senior fellow of the Vietnam Studies Program at\u00a0Singapore\u2019s ISEAS \u2013 Yusof Ishak Institute. But he said, \u201cVietnam is also careful not to be seen as being too close to Russia\u2026 The US and its allies play a much more significant role in Vietnam\u2019s security and economic development.\u201d While Vietnam may risk disappointing the US and its allies by hosting Putin, \u201cthe country is showing its partners that Vietnam will not sacrifice its ties with one power just to meet the expectations of others,\u201d said Le.\u00a0\u201cIt is not about taking sides. It\u2019s about maintaining its foreign policy of diversification and pursuing a strategy of autonomy.\u201d Putin faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for an alleged scheme to deport Ukrainian children to Russia. Vietnam and Russia are not members of the ICC. Putin\u2019s push for a new world order Vietnam was among several Southeast Asian countries that abstained from joining a global summit on Ukraine in Switzerland last week. But Western hopes of an isolated Russia appear to not be bearing out as Putin ramps up his outreach to friendly countries and efforts to establish a new global order in opposition to the West. In May, Putin met Xi in Beijing \u2013 his symbolic first overseas trip since starting a\u00a0new term as Russia\u2019s president \u2013 where the two leaders vowed to deepen their strategic partnership in opposition to the US. Now, Putin is visiting two of China\u2019s neighbors in what US national security spokesman John Kirby on Monday called a \u201ccharm offensive\u201d following the leader\u2019s re-election. Crucially, Moscow assumed the rotating presidency of the China and Russia-backed\u00a0BRICS economic group this year and will welcome member and observer nations to its southwestern city of Kazan in October. More than three dozen countries are seeking entry into the bloc and Russia will be the first member to oversee the body since it significantly\u00a0expanded its global footprint\u00a0at the start of the year, when Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Egypt formally joined. For Moscow and Beijing, the expansion is widely viewed as a drive to forge a new world order by turning the loose economic grouping into a geopolitical counterweight to the West \u2013 and Western institutions dominated by the US, such as the G7. Malaysia is the latest country preparing to join the group, according to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, as reported in Chinese media on Tuesday. Vietnam\u00a0has expressed interest in BRICS, with a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman saying in May \u201cwe pay attention to the process of the BRICS membership expansion,\u201d according to Vietnamese state media. Last week, Vietnam sent a delegation led by its Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs to attend the BRICS Foreign Ministers\u2019 Summit in Russia. Analysts say Russia is likely to get more out of the visit than Vietnam, and Hanoi may even suffer reputational damage by hosting Putin following his trip to North Korea. \u201cIf no substantive deals are made, the visit will mainly be symbolic and a means for Putin and Russia to show the world that Western sanctions against Russia are not working,\u201d said Le. \u201cThat symbolism is very important to Putin.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/asia/vietnam-russia-putin-visit-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/22/2024", "section": "world"}}
