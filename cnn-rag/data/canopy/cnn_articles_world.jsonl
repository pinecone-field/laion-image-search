{"id": "2024_05_24_middleeast_israel-isolation-deepens-icj-gaza-rafah-analysis-intl", "text": "It\u2019s been a tumultuous month for Israel. Never before has the Jewish state come under such intense and sustained international pressure from multiple fronts for its policies towards the Palestinians. This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu joined the ranks of world leaders branded as international pariahs when he became the target of the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against him and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant for suspicion of war crimes and crimes against humanity during Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The court has previously sought warrants against the likes of Sudan\u2019s Omar Al Bashir, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and Libya\u2019s Moammar Gadhafi. And on Friday, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, saying the humanitarian situation there is \u201cdisastrous\u201d and expected to \u201cintensify further.\u201d Seven months after Hamas attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, Israel\u2019s retaliatory war has failed to achieve its goals. Top Hamas leaders remain at large and 125 hostages remain captive in the enclave. Gaza is now in ruins and more than 35,000 Palestinians have died during Israel\u2019s onslaught. Pressure on Israel to end the war is mounting from all sides: US college campuses, international courts, American celebrities, Israel\u2019s Western allies, and even the families of the Israeli hostages. But the most significant of those may be the legal and diplomatic action taken against Israel this month. Israeli officials are scrambling to contain the fallout. They have accused critics of antisemitism and vowed not to relent in the face of international pressure. \u201cEven if Israel is forced to stand alone, we will stand alone, and we will continue to strike our enemies powerfully until victory,\u201d Netanyahu declared in a fiery speech at the opening ceremony of Holocaust Remembrance Day this month. Palestinian statehood For years, Israeli officials have opposed unilateral recognitions of Palestinian statehood, fearing it would enable the Palestinians to bring Israel before international courts and weaken its position in future peace negotiations. The Palestinians have therefore failed to gain full membership at the United Nations due to objections from the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally and primary defender on the world stage. However, a non-binding vote at the UN General Assembly on May 10 showed overwhelming international support for an independent Palestinian state, leaving the US and a few of Israel\u2019s allies isolated. Israel and the US maintain that a Palestinian state should only be established through a negotiated settlement. But as Israel continues to reject the prospect of Palestinian independence, some states have chosen to act independently. This week, Ireland, Spain and Norway\u00a0announced\u00a0plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state, saying they hope the move would prod other European nations to follow suit. \u201cWe live in a time in world history where doing the bare minimum is both heroic and insufficient. That is why we cannot stop,\u201d Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda D\u00edaz said in a video posted on her X page. \u201cPalestine will be free from the river to the sea,\u201d she added, using a pro-Palestinian protest slogan that Israel says calls for its destruction, a charge rejected by those who use it. The move prompted swift condemnation from Israel, which recalled its ambassadors from all three countries. Aside from international efforts to end the war, Netanyahu is also under intense pressure domestically to strike a deal with Hamas to bring back the hostages. With hostage-ceasefire talks stalled, relatives of the captives are pressing the prime minister to return to negotiation. This week, the families of seven female Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas released graphic footage of their abduction to pile pressure on the government to secure their release. But there were signs that the talks may resume. On Thursday, the Israeli war cabinet directed the country\u2019s negotiating team to resume talks, without saying when they\u2019ll take place, and CIA Director Bill Burns has traveled to Europe to try to get the deal back on track, a US official told CNN, adding that the Israelis are \u201cvery engaged.\u201d Quandary for Israel\u2019s allies The cases brought before the ICJ and ICC have tested Western states\u2019 commitment to the rules-based international order as they struggle to navigate the increasing legal actions against their ally in these courts. This has created a rift between Israel\u2019s Western allies and a growing coalition of Global South countries spanning Asia, Africa, and South America that are increasingly vocal in their calls for Israel to be held accountable for its actions in Gaza. In a recent case at the ICJ, Germany was compelled to defend its arms sales to Israel against allegations of \u201cfacilitating genocide\u201d brought by Nicaragua. Despite the pressure, the court rejected the demand for an immediate halt to Germany\u2019s arms exports to Israel. Meanwhile, the ICC\u2019s decision to pursue arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant has divided Israel\u2019s Western allies. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Karim Khan, the ICC\u2019s prosecutor, recounted a conversation with a senior leader who remarked: \u201cThis court is built for Africa and for thugs like Putin,\u201d underscoring the complexities surrounding international legal proceedings. While the US and the United Kingdom have denounced the move, European nations such as France, Germany, and others have affirmed the independence of the court and have not ruled out the possibility of arresting Israeli officials if they enter their territory following the issuance of a warrant. The court is also\u00a0pursuing warrants against three top Hamas officials: Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, and Mohammed Deif. A panel of judges at the ICC is still deliberating on whether to issue these warrants. The response to the warrant request has been particularly fierce in the US Congress, where a bipartisan effort to penalize the ICC is underway, potentially including sanctions.\u00a0US Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to work with Congress on legislation to penalize the ICC. \u201cIf they do this to Israel, we\u2019re next,\u201d Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who has led the efforts against the ICC in Congress, told a Senate hearing this week \u2013 a reminder that however much pressure Israel is under, it still has one very powerful friend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/middleeast/israel-isolation-deepens-icj-gaza-rafah-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

The delegation is expected to assess this week whether equipment and facilities for the foreign police forces are ready \u2014 an assessment which will be decisive in determining a timeline for the deployment, a source with knowledge of the preparations told CNN. Members of the delegation are also expected to meet with US and United Nations officials in the country, sources said. The UN Security Council\u00a0last year\u00a0authorized a multinational mission to support Haiti\u2019s National Police in battling deadly gangs that have seized control of much of the capital Port-au-Prince. Despite strong support from the US and other regional powers, however, the mission has been mired in uncertainty and legal challenges for months. It was further delayed following the resignation of former Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry in March, until the creation of a transitional governing council. The council said Tuesday that it met with top Haitian police brass to discuss the multinational mission. \u201cHaiti, through the Haitian National Police, will have overall control of all aspects of the field mission,\u201d including the mission\u2019s composition, aims, rules of engagement and health precautions, it emphasized in a statement on X. Kenya is currently finalizing preparations for the mission, the country\u2019s principal secretary of foreign affairs\u00a0Korir Sing\u2019Oei said Sunday, citing the successful creation of the council and other institutions in Haiti as key conditions. \u201cIn view of that and in view of the decision of the courts in our republic essentially guiding how Kenya should be able to carry out this deployment, lots of reciprocal agreements were entered into between Kenya and Haiti, which facilitates Kenya\u2019s ability to deploy. And we are in the process \u2014 our government is in the process of finalizing preparation to deploy.\u201d The mission is scheduled to launch by the end of this month. A UN-managed trust fund for the mission currently contains $21 million, provided by Canada ($8.7 million), France ($3.2 million), Spain ($3 million) and the United States ($6 million). Personnel for the mission have been offered by the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Chad and Jamaica, in addition to Kenya. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday defended US funding for the mission in a Senate Foreign Relations hearing, warning that Haiti is \u201con the precipice of becoming an all-out failed state\u201d without international support. \u201cI understand some of the skepticism that exists about another mission in Haiti, but I think what we have going for us is this: first, a general revulsion of the people at the direction that the country has taken, including gangs that are dominating Port-au-Price and trying to undermine governance, a democratic trajectory that\u2019s been disrupted by failing to have a government that actually has a clear mandate and all of that has also had the effect of interrupting development assistance, other forms of assistance that people so desperately need,\u201d he said. Haiti\u2019s National Police have already \u201ctaken back control of the airport and other critical infrastructure,\u201d he added. \u201cIn fact, today, commercial flights resumed in Haiti, and we anticipate that American carriers will begin flying again in the days ahead.\u201d US President Joe Biden will welcome Kenyan President William\u00a0Ruto and first lady Rachel\u00a0Ruto\u00a0to the White House on Thursday, with Haiti high on the expected agenda.

Heinrich XIII Prince Reuss, 72, is accused of leading the plot, which would have led to him becoming Germany\u2019s head of state. The prince appeared at a specially erected high-security courtroom in Frankfurt alongside eight other defendants, including former judge Birgit Malsack-Winkemann, who was allegedly ready to become minister of justice. In total, nine ringleaders accused of treason are believed to have planned the resurrection of the German Reich, or empire, through violence, by storming the Bundestag, the national parliament, and kidnapping President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Tuesday marks the opening of the second of the three trials across Stuttgart, Frankfurt and Munich, forming one of the biggest anti-terror cases in modern German history. With 27 defendants in total, the case was split into three trials for logistical reasons. In addition to the five judges, two others will be on standby for the Frankfurt trial in the event of a long-term absence. Around 260 witnesses will be summoned and up to 45 officers will ensure security on site. Malsack-Winkemann, an ex-lawmaker for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, allegedly led several co-defendants around the Reichstag building scouting the location. The defendants also include former army officers Maximilian Eder and Ruediger von Pescatore, who allegedly shared \u201ca deep aversion to German state institutions and to the democratic basic order,\u201d the Hesse higher regional court said in a statement. The plot by the terror organization to overthrow the German government and install martial law was uncovered in 2022. The group had planned to replace the government with a cabinet-like council and a military wing since August 2021, according to the charges. The plotters amassed almost $550,000 in funds and had access to a massive armory, according to the Public Prosecutor.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/europe/germany-far-right-plot-heinrich-xiii-prince-reuss-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall", "text": "Microsoft\u2019s buzziest new AI feature is raising concerns that it could potentially be misused in the wrong hands. This week, the company showed off a new tool called Recall for Windows computers that acts as a personal \u201ctime machine,\u201d allowing users to quickly pull up anything that\u2019s ever been on screen, such as documents, images and websites. It\u2019s different from a keyword search; the tool regularly saves screenshots of the user\u2019s screen and stores them directly on the device. It then uses AI to process the data and make it searchable. For example, if someone previously searched for a green dress or the name of a local ice cream shop, they can ask the feature to \u201crecall\u201d anything in their history that was shown on screen. Although so-called semantic search is a big step forward for AI, it comes at a time when the industry is moving so quickly and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use the technology responsibly. Jen Golbeck \u2013 a professor of AI at the University of Maryland who focuses on privacy\u00a0\u2013 said the recall feature could pose a potential \u201cnightmare\u201d if the device falls into the wrong hands. \u201cStuff may stay on your device, but that doesn\u2019t mean people can\u2019t get to it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou won\u2019t have an option to protect yourself even if you use incognito mode or clear your history because the tool has access to everything that\u2019s been on your screen.\u201d The UK\u2019s independent regulator for Data Protection and Freedom of Information, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), told CNN it is investigating the tool \u201cto understand the safeguards in place to protect user privacy.\u201d \u201cWe expect organisations to be transparent with users about how their data is being used and only process personal data to the extent that it is necessary to achieve a specific purpose,\u201d the ICO said in a statement. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CEO Satya Nadella told The Wall Street Journal in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s launch that web searches must only be done on Microsoft\u2019s Edge web browser and that the screenshots never leave the user\u2019s computer. \u201cYou have to put two things together: This is my computer and this is my Recall \u2013 and it\u2019s all being done locally,\u201d he said. Geoff Blaber, CEO of market research firm CCS Insight, said that makes the issue less concerning. \u201cThe backlash by some to this feature isn\u2019t surprising, but it\u2019s an overreaction given that the data stays exclusively on the device and the user has full control,\u201d Blaber said. Someone can decide whether to turn the feature on during the device setup process and can customize and blacklist which apps and websites Recall can access. \u201cThese controls suggest the feature has been built with security and privacy at its core,\u201d he said. \u201cRecall won\u2019t appeal to everyone but the utility provided is likely to be significant.\u201d Potential for malicious uses But Golbeck cited times when that protection might not be enough, such as a journalist in a hostile country, a person trying to get out of an abusive relationship, someone searching for sensitive medical information or an employee whose boss wants to track them. She believes issues around the tool will likely impact the workplace the most. \u201cWe know jobs monitor what we\u2019re doing on their devices, but a lot of people will do a personal thing on their work computer and all of that will be archived and visible to an IT department, even if it just stays on device,\u201d she added. Golbeck said technology, despite the benefits, is too often developed without the consideration of malicious uses. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the last 15 years is every single one of those potential malicious use cases comes to fruition in some way or another,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will want to use this cool feature without understanding the privacy risk \u2013 that there will be a permanent record of everything you do.\u201d Similar reactions to features such as biometric passwords, such as fingerprints, facial recognition and iris scans, have emerged in the past. Blaber said to overcome some of the initial concerns, Microsoft and its partners will need to prove the value, security and privacy of the product in the real world. Still, Michela Menting, a senior research director at ABI Research, believes the feature is a \u201cstep backwards\u201d for privacy. \u201cThe argument that hackers need physical access to even be able to manipulate Recall is short-sighted at best because there are plenty of highly ingenious ways threat actors could exploit such a valuable tool,\u201d she said. \u201cAll it takes is time and effort to find a way.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/microsoft-ai-tool-privacy-recall/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_uk_uk-early-elections-sunak-conservatives-intl", "text": "UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a snap general election for July\u00a04 in a statement outside Downing Street on Wednesday evening, as his Conservative Party faces an uphill struggle to extend its 14 years in power. Sunak said\u00a0outside Downing Street\u00a0that he had informed King Charles III of the rare summer poll, firing the starting gun on a\u00a0six-week\u00a0campaign that is almost universally expected to conclude in the demise of his Conservative government. Soaked by a downpour as he spoke, Sunak said: \u201cNow is the moment for Britain to choose its future.\u201d He also attacked his opponents, saying that by voting for the Labour Party, Britain would \u201crisk going back to square one.\u201d But he admitted: \u201cI cannot and will not claim that we have got everything right.\u201d Sunak was required to hold a vote by January 2025, and had long resisted calls to be specific about his plans. But a fall in inflation rates, announced earlier Wednesday, provided the backdrop for his announcement. The move\u00a0will be welcomed by the buoyant Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, which is soaring in the opinion polls and has sought to present itself as a reformed and moderate group that is ready for power. In the wake of the announcement, Buckingham Palace said the British royal family would postpone engagements \u201cwhich may appear to divert attention or distract from the election campaign.\u201d The King and Queen\u2019s D-Day memorial engagements in June are expected to go ahead as scheduled. In his speech, Sunak sought to paint external factors such as Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine as the context to Britain\u2019s economic struggles, saying the two factors combined represented \u201cthe most challenging times since the Second World War.\u201d But he battled heavy rain that soaked his suit in just minutes, and he was almost drowned out by a loudspeaker outside the Downing Street gates, through which a protester blared D:Ream\u2019s \u201cThings Can Only Get Better,\u201d the theme song of Labour\u2019s big election win in 1997. Starmer was quick to respond to Sunak\u2019s announcement. Speaking at an indoor news conference, the opposition leader said: \u201cTonight the prime minister has finally announced the next general election.\u201d He framed the vote as a \u201cchance to change for the better \u2013 your future, your community, your country.\u201d \u201cIt will feel like a long campaign, I\u2019m sure of that, but no matter what else is said and done, that opportunity for change is what this election is about,\u201d he said. Current polling is dire for Sunak; Labour begins the campaign around 20 points up on average, with the Tories often closer to third-party challengers such as Reform and the Liberal Democrats than they are to Labour. When converted to a projection of seats in parliament, those figures indicate either a comfortable Labour win or a potential electoral wipeout for the Conservatives. Sunak will hope that a shrewd campaign could result in a spectacular upset for Labour and extend a period of Tory rule which began in 2010 and has overseen austerity economics, Brexit, the Covid pandemic and a cost of living crisis. He is the fifth Tory leader to serve during that time, taking over from the ill-fated Liz Truss, whose disastrous term imploded just six weeks after it began and exacerbated the financial woes crippling the United Kingdom. Sunak\u2019s party will likely put his efforts to tackle illegal migration at the center of his campaign; a recent move to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda finally became law last month, and the first flights could potentially leave during the campaign. But Labour will seek to highlight the government\u2019s struggles to ease soaring prices, the state of Britain\u2019s over-stretched healthcare service, and the sleaze scandals that have tanked the Tories\u2019 reputation among a large swath of British voters. Smaller parties could upend the designs of the two dominant groups, even if it is virtually impossible for them to return a government. The new, anti-migration Reform Party and the centrist Liberal Democrats will look to challenge Sunak in some of his party\u2019s historical strongholds, complicating his efforts to hold power. North of the border, the pro-independence Scottish National Party will hope to hold off a Labour challenge and regain its dominance in Scotland\u2019s politics despite a rocky period and the recent ascension of its third leader in 15 months. The Conservatives under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a healthy majority in the last UK-wide vote, in December 2019, pledging to push through Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union \u2013 an issue that had transfixed politics in the country for more than three years. But Johnson\u2019s premiership collapsed after a string of scandals, paving the way for his then-finance minister Sunak to emerge as a frontrunner for the leadership. Adding to the sense that the Conservatives are nearing the end of their time in power, dozens of Tory MPs \u2014 including former cabinet ministers and ex-Prime Minister Theresa May \u2014 announced they would not seek re-election. But recent election and referendum campaigns have proved volatile, and Tories still publicly hopeful of success have pointed to mixed levels of enthusiasm for Labour\u2019s offering. The vote will take place on\u00a0Thursday July 4\u00a0in all of the UK\u2019s 650 parliamentary constituencies,\u00a0and counting will occur overnight, with the two main parties seeking to cross the 326 mark needed for a majority. A government will be formed as soon as that mark is crossed, and take charge immediately, pending the symbolic approval of King Charles III.

{"id": "2024_05_23_europe_new-caledonia-tourists-stranded-australia-intl-hnk", "text": "When Maxwell Winchester and his wife arrived in the South Pacific island of New Caledonia nearly two weeks ago, they were excited for what would be their first child-free holiday since becoming parents. But what was supposed to be a romantic getaway has instead left the Australian couple stranded and far from their children back in their home state Victoria,\u00a0after deadly riots broke out across the French territory sparked by electoral changes\u00a0from the national government. \u201cWe are sheltered in place because it\u2019s largely been too dangerous to leave. We\u2019ve had barricades, riots \u2026 shops looted, burnt to the ground. Our suburb near us basically has nothing left,\u201d he told CNN on Thursday. In the hotel where they\u2019re staying, food and medicine are running low, he said, and there is no sense of when help is arriving; evacuations for foreign nationals have paused on Thursday due to French President Emmanuel Macron arriving for talks. \u201cWe have people who have run out of medicine \u2026 People are running out of food. Other Australians stranded have had to go scrounge coconuts to eat,\u201d he said. Now, the couple and other foreign nationals stuck on the island are desperately trying to find a way home, with commercial flights canceled and the main international airport closed. \u201cOur embassy went AWOL the first day, and we only first heard from (them) last night for the first time for a welfare call,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re frustrated with it all \u2026 What I\u2019m hoping is that our government will evacuate us promptly.\u201d Australia and New Zealand began sending government planes to evacuate nationals\u00a0starting Tuesday, with the Australian embassy in New Caledonia saying on Facebook that 108 Australians and other tourists were successfully transported from the island to Brisbane on two flights on Tuesday. \u201cWe continue to work with partners to support the departure of all Australians who want to leave,\u201d it said in a post on Wednesday. But Winchester said he and other tourists have no sense of when it might be their turn. The local government estimates there are around 3,200 people waiting to leave or enter the island. Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) says on its website it is \u201ccommunicating directly with registered Australians in New Caledonia about departure options from New Caledonia,\u201d and has instructed Australians on the island to register their details on the agency\u2019s online portal. Deadly unrest Lying some 930 miles (roughly 1,500 kilometers) to the northeast of Brisbane, New Caledonia has long been a popular destination for both Australians and New Zealanders looking for some Pacific sunshine and beaches. But it is also a hangover of France\u2019s colonial past, a territory on the other side of the globe where many indigenous inhabitants suffer from entrenched poverty and have long chafed under Paris\u2019 rule. The latest protests, the worst since the 1980s, were sparked by anger among indigenous Kanak people over a constitutional amendment approved in France that would change who is allowed to participate in elections, which local leaders fear will dilute the Kanak vote. The unrest has killed at least six people, and has left a trail of burned cars and looted stores, with road barricades restricting access to medicine and food. The situation got so bad that Macron has been forced to fly some 16,000 kilometers (10,000 miles), landing on an island seething with resentment from indigenous community leaders, business owners and stranded tourists. Macron arrived in New Caledonia on Thursday, telling reporters that \u201ca return to peace\u201d was his top priority \u2013 but that\u00a0French security forces will stay in the territory\u00a0for \u201cas long as necessary, even during the Olympic Games.\u201d Three thousand French security forces have already been deployed, with a number of those still arriving Thursday, he said. He added that he believes that the state of emergency \u201cshould not be extended,\u201d provided that all political forces on the island issue a \u201cclear call for the roadblocks to be lifted.\u201d As part of his visit, Macron will \u201cset up a mission\u201d in\u00a0New\u00a0Caledonia, government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot said at a press conference earlier this week. The visit comes as France prepares for the Paris Olympic Games, which will be held from July 26 to August 11. Roads barricaded But Macron\u2019s arrival was little solace for Winchester and his wife, who are staying at a resort outside the city center. They described the anxiety and desperation inside among hotel guests and staff alike. The resort has barricaded all roads leading to the hotel, leaving just one entrance that is guarded 24/7, he said. And among the stranded tourists, frustration is growing over what they say is a lack of assistance or clear instructions from their governments. The Australian government is only notifying its nationals of evacuation plans 30 minutes before the flight \u201cfor security reasons,\u201d said Winchester \u2013 meaning \u201ceveryone is constantly on edge, and they\u2019re frightened to leave the hotel rooms in case they get a call telling them (to get on the plane).\u201d When contacted by CNN for comment, DFAT pointed to a statement online by Australia\u2019s Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong on Wednesday. \u201cThe Australian Government stands ready to assist more tourists out of New Caledonia and has planes ready to fly. We have not been given clearances for additional flights. We know this is frustrating for the Australians who remain,\u201d she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \u201cWe are working to ensure flights tomorrow.\u201d With the international airport closed, evacuation flights can only leave from the domestic airport, located close to the city center \u2013 which is largely inaccessible to people staying further away, like Winchester and other guests at their resort, due to roadblocks and gun violence on the main highways. \u201cMy wife and I don\u2019t have a car, so we have no way to get to the city if we\u2019re put on a flight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to come and evacuate us from the location we\u2019re in or not. But to drive through to the city is very dangerous in the moment.\u201d New Zealand nationals on the island are in a similar predicament \u2013 with their governments instructing them to drive to the city and leave their cars at a hotel to avoid being hijacked, before being picked up there for evacuations, he said. \u201cAnd with Macron\u2019s visit, it could get worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThe French government has not handled this well. And if (Macron) says the wrong things and then goes back to France, it could all kick off again \u2013 that\u2019s our fear.\u201d In the meantime, stranded foreign nationals continue searching for a way out \u2013 while racking up hefty bills, with Winchester describing tourists spending tens of thousands of dollars on food, accommodation and supplies. The couple is now trying to travel into the city with some New Zealand nationals, and find a flight out with them \u2013 hoping for safety in numbers on the perilous drive. \u201cFrom our own government now, their position is the French will fly us out, and we\u2019re not confident in the French government\u2019s ability to keep us safe,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/europe/new-caledonia-tourists-stranded-australia-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_uk_uk-election-explainer-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl", "text": "Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has taken the biggest gamble of his troubled premiership by calling an early general election that almost everyone in Westminster believes he will lose. We\u2019ll know soon enough whether the decision was a masterstroke or a misfire. A frenetic six-week campaign will dominate airwaves in the UK \u2013 once again putting political battles front and center in a country fatigued by a turbulent stretch for the state. If, as current polls indicate, the opposition Labour party triumph, it will finally bring down the curtain of a 14-year era of Conservative rule, ushering in a center-left government led by former barrister Keir Starmer. Any other outcome would mean Sunak has orchestrated a shocking victory that even many in his own party believe is beyond reach \u2013 and would result in the Conservatives extending a political dynasty toward the two-decade mark. Here are some key questions answered. Why did Sunak call an election now \u2013 and is it a gamble? Sunak was obliged to call an election by December and hold it by the following month, but until that deadline \u2013 five years on from the last vote \u2013 the decision of when to stage a poll is in the gift of the prime minister. Sunak told journalists at a drinks reception in December that it would be in 2024, not January 2025, and has more recently said his \u201cassumption\u201d is that it would happen in the second half of the year \u2013 which 4 July is, just about. But beyond those clues, he has been tight-lipped while he weighed his options \u2013 feeding frenzied speculation in Westminster for months. The main problem facing him is that no good options existed. Sunak is down around 20 points in opinion polls, and that deficit hasn\u2019t budged all year. The economy is gloomy, and one line of thinking among his aides is that waiting until October or November would give it time to settle. But on the other hand, Sunak has placed much of his political capital into his pledge to stop small boat crossings to the UK by asylum seekers. He has recently passed a controversial law to process some claims in Rwanda, though nobody has yet been deported and further legal challenges may await the plan. Meanwhile, the warmer summer months are expected to see a huge number of such journeys across the English Channel, hurting a major pillar of his campaign message. Ultimately, hours after some rare good economic news \u2013 a healthy month-on-month reduction in the rate of inflation \u2013 Sunak decided that Wednesday was the least bad time to pull the trigger. Who\u2019s expected to win? The near-universal expectation is that Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party will lose the election. Labour have been leading in general election opinion polls since late 2021, and that lead has been huge for the entirety of Sunak\u2019s premiership. They are around 20 points up on average, with the Tories often closer to third party challengers like Reform and the Liberal Democrats than they are to Labour. When converted to a projection of seats in parliament, those figures indicate either a comfortable Labour win or a Labour win so huge it would spell a near-wipeout for the Conservatives. The Conservative brand was damaged by Partygate and a number of other scandals that led to the demise of Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, and then the shambolic six-week tenure of his successor Liz Truss, whose fiscal agenda sent markets into turmoil. But for Sunak\u2019s team, some deeper numbers provide some comfort. While Keir Starmer leads Sunak in polling on the question of who would make a better prime minister, that lead is much smaller than the overall party voting gap \u2013 suggesting Sunak will seek to keep the focus on a \u201cme versus him\u201d message. Some polling experts also suggested that recent local elections may indicate a slimmer Labour win than polling does, but it is notoriously difficult to extrapolate nationwide forecasts from local votes in only some parts of the country. Sunak may also take heart from an unlikely source: the left-wing former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who started the 2017 general election facing a similar deficit and eventually forced a hung parliament, in a narrow loss to Theresa May. Nonetheless, Sunak hasn\u2019t been able to move the polls in his favor since he became leader \u2013 he has just six weeks left to do so to claim a stunning upset victory. What happens next? Party leaders are already on the campaign trail, but parliament has a few days to wrap up any pressing issues before it is officially dissolved, 25 days before polling day. Once that happens, the parliament that was formed in the previous, 2019 general election ceases to exist \u2013 and all sitting lawmakers are no longer MPs. Sunak\u2019s government will continue to run the country, albeit in a skeleton format. The main priority for every party will be the weeks-long dash around the country, where party leaders will seek to be pictured knocking on doors, standing in hi-vis jackets and meeting members of the public. A series of TV debates will likely be organized too, when Sunak and Starmer will go head-to-head. Then on Thursday, July 4, Britons will vote between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time, and as soon as polls close, votes will be counted. A winner is usually declared in the early hours of Friday morning. Who is Keir Starmer? Rishi Sunak\u2019s rival for power is Labour leader Keir Starmer, who is heavily favored to become Britain\u2019s new prime minister in July. A former, well-respected human rights lawyer who then served as Britain\u2019s most senior prosecutor, Starmer came into politics late in life. He became a Labour MP in 2015 and less than five years later was the party\u2019s leader, following a stint as shadow Brexit Secretary during Britain\u2019s protracted exit from the European Union. Starmer inherited a party reeling from its worst electoral defeat in generations, but he prioritized an overhaul of its culture \u2013 staring down left-wing supporters of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, and apologizing publicly for a long-running antisemitism scandal that had tainted the group\u2019s standing with the public. He has attempted to lay claim to Britain\u2019s political center ground, and is described by his supporters as a principled, serious leader with a focus on tackling the systemic issues facing Britain. But his opponents, on both the left of his own party and the right of the political spectrum, say he lacks charisma and ideas, and charge that he has failed to set out an ambitious and broad vision for the nation. Who else is standing? Only Sunak or Starmer have a realistic chance of becoming prime minister, but their plans could be disrupted by a number of smaller parties. Sunak is especially vulnerable to the success of the Reform Party \u2013 a right-wing group attempting to outflank him on immigration \u2013 and the Liberal Democrats, a centrist, pro-European group who have chipped away at Conservative support in affluent, southern parts of England. Given Labour\u2019s standing in the polls, Starmer is more equipped to take the fight to other groups. North of the border, he will look to end the Scottish National Party (SNP)\u2019s generation-long dominance at the ballot box, capitalizing on a rocky period in the party\u2019s recent history that has seen them replace two leaders in just over a year. But he will need to be mindful of the Green Party, which has challenged him from the left and has attracted some younger liberal votes as a result. In recent local elections, there was evidence too that Labour\u2019s stance on Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza had harmed the party in majority-Muslim areas. How does voting work? In the UK, voters don\u2019t elect a prime minister directly. Instead, they elect a member of parliament (MP) to represent their local constituency. The leader of the party that wins a majority of the UK\u2019s 650 constituencies automatically becomes prime minister, and can form a government. That means 326 is the magic number for an overall majority. If there\u2019s no majority, they need to look for help elsewhere, ruling as a minority government \u2013 as Theresa May did after a close 2017 result \u2013 or forming a coalition, as David Cameron did after 2010. The monarch has an important role; King Charles III must approve the formation of a government, the decision to hold an election and the dissolution of parliament. But this is a formal role only; the King won\u2019t contradict his prime minister or overrule the results of an election. What issues will decide the election? The answer to that question will go some way in deciding the night\u2019s winner. Labour will be keen to define the election as a referendum on 14 years of Conservative rule,  seizing on public fatigue with a party that has produced five prime ministers in that span and overseen Brexit, a stuttering economy and a series of sleaze scandals. In particular, Starmer will talk plenty about the cost of living hitting British families, and the state of the country\u2019s overstaffed and stretched National Health Service (NHS). Sunak, by contrast, will want to focus on migration \u2013 his pledge to \u201cStop the Boats\u201d hasn\u2019t yet worked, but his flagship Rwanda policy has at least become law. And he will attempt to convince voters that the economy has turned a corner, and can\u2019t risk a change in governance. Early signs also show he is attempting to make the question of leadership central in voters\u2019 minds \u2013 highlighting his time as finance minister during the Covid-19 pandemic in his first speech, and criticizing Starmer\u2019s record.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/uk/uk-election-explainer-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

Andreas Pernerstorfer made the incredible discovery while renovating his wine cellar in the village of Gobelsburg, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) northwest of Vienna, in March. The find has been described as the most significant of its kind in more than a century, with researchers from the Austrian Academy of Sciences (OeAW), who are now recovering the bones, describing it as an \u201carchaeological sensation,\u201d according to a Wednesday press release. Pernerstorfer had decided to carry out some work to level the floor in the cellar, archaeologist Hannah Parow\u2013 Souchon, a researcher at the OeAW, told CNN in a video call Thursday. \u201cHe wanted to level the floor of his wine cellar because it was sloping and he removed some concrete in the center,\u201d she said. \u201cMore or less immediately he found the bones, which he initially thought were wood. Then he looked more closely and remembered a tale from his grandfather who in the sixties extended the cellar and found some mammoth molars.\u201d Pernerstorfer reported the find to the Federal Monuments Office, which referred him to the OeAW because, as Parow-Souchon told CNN, \u201cwe are experts on the Stone Age.\u201d She and her team of fellow archaeologists embarked on an excavation at the start of May. \u201cIt quickly became apparent that it wasn\u2019t just a few mammoth bones but very many mammoth bones,\u201d she said. Parow-Souchon said they have \u201cat least 300 bones,\u201d which were found densely packed together. \u201cWe think we have mostly the complete animals. They\u2019re not in anatomical connection but we do have probably all parts,\u201d she said, adding that the recovered haul includes some rare finds, including a lingual (tongue) bone.\u201d The archaeologists believe the bones are from three separate mammoths. The site they excavated was just 12 square meters (129 square feet) big, but they are hoping to return in August to continue with their search. \u201cI love being an archaeologist. I\u2019ve excavated lots of exciting things but I always wanted to excavate a mammoth,\u201d said Parow-Souchon, adding that the mammoth bone discovery was a first for her. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled, I can\u2019t deny it,\u201d she said. Comparable sites elsewhere in Austria and in neighboring countries were mostly excavated more than 100 years ago, which means they are not available for modern research. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve been able to investigate something like this in Austria using modern methods. It is a unique opportunity for research,\u201d said Parow-Souchon in the press release. The excavations, funded by the Federal Monuments Office and the province of Lower Austria, raise many questions, including whether these animals were killed by Stone Age hunters. \u201cWe know that humans hunted mammoths, but we still know very little about how they did it,\u201d said Parow-Souchon, adding that a trap for the animals may have been set at this site. Once the researchers complete their work, the bones will be passed to the Natural History Museum Vienna for restoration.

{"id": "world_americas_mojave-desert-seed-bank-mdlt-california-climate-c2e-spc", "text": "Inside a Mojave aster flower, a tiny bee is fast asleep. At night, the pale lavender petals close, providing a safe resting place. In the morning, as birdsong rings out across the desert, the flower opens, revealing its tenant. Here in southern California, in the middle of the Mojave Desert\u2019s vast and arid landscape, it\u2019s just one of many natural treasures hidden from view. In long sleeves, pants, and wide-brimmed hats to guard against a harsh sun in a cloudless blue sky, a team of four led by Madena Asbell crouches in the dirt, looking for another treasure. They are searching for a plant called erodium texanum, (common names Texas stork\u2019s bill or heronbill), a type of herb native to California. More specifically, they are looking for its seeds. \u201cThere\u2019s so much life here,\u201d Asbell says, \u201cbut it\u2019s easy to not realize that when you\u2019re in the desert.\u201d Asbell is the director of plant conservation for the Mojave Desert Land Trust (MDLT), a non-profit land conservancy that works to preserve and protect the Mojave and Colorado desert landscapes of California. A quarter of the state is desert, home to roughly 2,400 plant species, according to MDLT. Eight years ago, Asbell had an idea. What if there was a way to preserve the ecosystem, centered around the seeds that facilitate all the life here? The result was the Mojave Desert Land Trust seed bank. \u201cThe goal is to preserve this amazing genetic diversity that we have and make it available for restoration or reintroduction of species, should there be a disaster that wipes out a population,\u201d Asbell says. \u201cPlants are the foundation of most ecosystems, so when we protect these plants, we\u2019re protecting everything that depends on them, like desert tortoise, burrowing owls and pollinators.\u201d Five million seeds, and counting In an ever-changing climate, the seed bank was just the type of \u201cproactive\u201d idea the organization was looking for, says Kelly Herbinson, executive director of MDLT. \u201cAs a land trust, we\u2019re realizing that just protecting land or buying land to protect it wasn\u2019t going to be enough \u2013 that we had to take extra steps to really invest in that land,\u201d Herbinson says. In 2016, Mojave Desert Land Trust officially launched the seed bank project, which has since been described as a \u201cNoah\u2019s Ark\u201d for southern California. Three white refrigerators at MDLT headquarters in Joshua Tree, California, house the collection. There are over 5 million seeds from nearly 250 species and counting, according to the land trust. Seeds come in from the field teams and undergo a \u201ccut test\u201d to determine viability \u2013 confirming the seed pods are full, and that there hasn\u2019t been too much damage from insects or mold, making the seeds worth saving. They then go into paper bags on racks to dry out, before going into jars in the refrigerators for long-term storage. All types of jar shapes and sizes pack the shelves inside, from small, donated Gerber baby food jars to larger pickle jars \u2013 each adorned with white labels including seed name, number of jars in the collection, and number of seeds. Much like the desert itself, the seed bank contains all kinds of variation. Some seeds are light and wispy; some are skinny or round. Others are denser, like peppercorn, while another resembles pumpkin seed. There are shades of brown, red and olive green. Asbell says that work at the seed bank includes scouting, collecting, processing and database management. Last year, MDLT received a $3.2 million grant from the state of California\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Board to help expand the project. \u201cWe\u2019ve already been able to provide seed to researchers who are studying the effects of climate change on specific species that we have in our seed bank,\u201d Asbell adds. \u201cAnd knowing not only what you\u2019ve collected, but where it has come from in a really specific way is very important for restoration. \u201cYou can\u2019t just throw any seeds on the ground \u2026 You need to know where that seed has come from, what population, what elevation, and make sure that it\u2019s the right seed for the right place. Those are things that we are able to do through the work that we\u2019re doing.\u201d Helping the future of the Joshua tree There is an increased urgency to that work. California has felt the impacts of climate change, from more frequent and intense wildfires, says Herbinson, to an influx of invasive grasses that are not only choking parts of the desert landscape but acting as fuel for the wildfires. \u201cClimate change brings drought and more prolonged drought, which really stresses desert ecosystems, even though they are adapted for aridity,\u201d Asbell says. \u201cWe\u2019re facing really unprecedented challenges that threaten our existence and to be able to preserve the genetic diversity of the planet for a future time when it may be needed is really amazing \u2013 it\u2019s really critical work,\u201d she adds. The desert itself is \u201cthe kind of place where you can pass it by and look at it and think there\u2019s nothing there,\u201d Herbinson says. \u201cBut in reality, it\u2019s incredibly biodiverse and full of so much life. It\u2019s just secret and hidden in ways that aren\u2019t obvious.\u201d That means it\u2019s not as well protected as other ecosystems, she adds, such as rainforests or oceans \u2013 which come with more colorful trees and wildlife. Yet the Mojave Desert boasts an iconic tree of its own: the Joshua tree. \u201cWe have this incredible endemic species that\u2019s very charismatic and has this very kind of unusual structure to it,\u201d Asbell says. \u201cIt\u2019s widespread across the landscape, but also very threatened and so we\u2019re very concerned about the future of the Joshua tree and working really hard to protect it.\u201d A type of yucca, the twisted, Dr. Seuss-like tree, which lends its name to a national park in the same area is \u201cnot likely to persist through our changing climate,\u201d Herbinson agrees, \u201cbecause their seeds are dispersed largely by rodents.\u201d To survive, there will likely come a time when the trees will need to migrate to a more \u201csuitable habitat,\u201d she adds \u2013 ideally cooler and at higher elevation. But that distance is beyond the range of the rodents, who only disperse seeds up to 100 feet from the tree. That\u2019s where the seed bank could help. \u201cIt means we can help the Joshua tree migrate potentially faster than it would naturally, and have that species survive the changing climate well into the future in a way that it wouldn\u2019t if we weren\u2019t doing that work,\u201d Herbinson says. Roughly 70,000 Joshua tree seeds are currently preserved in the seed bank, some of which could be planted in cooler locations, if needed. The key, according to Asbell, is balance: taking just the right amount to sustain a restoration project in the event of an emergency, but not so much as to disrupt the natural ecosystem. \u201cThis is an ancient landscape, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty profound to think about how long-lived a lot of these organisms are, and how much history they\u2019ve experienced.\u201d \u201cSeeds are life,\u201d Asbell adds, \u201cand I don\u2019t know that anything brings me as much pleasure as growing a seed. \u2026 It\u2019s life affirming. And in the world we live in today, you have to really hold onto that and keep that close.\u201d CNN\u2019s Adeline Chen contributed reporting.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/americas/mojave-desert-seed-bank-mdlt-california-climate-c2e-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_style_and-just-like-that-carrie-bradshaw-fashion-lotw", "text": "Carrie Bradshaw, the lead character played by Sarah Jessica Parker in the 1998-2004 TV series \u201cSex and the City,\u201d has always been more of a fashion daredevil than a fashion darling. From the time she wore a floating belt fastened across her bare midriff (season 4 episode 15) to the cowboy hat, python-print bandeau and striped sarong (season 2, episode 17), Parker\u2019s on-screen persona has never shied away from making a bold style statement. Bradshaw\u2019s sartorial abandon has long been part of her quirky allure. The Instagram account, @everyoutfitonsatc, has provided a diligent digital archive of the character\u2019s best looks for its 746,000 followers. Many of the early SATC outfits documented are met with pure adoration by a throng of Carrie apologists ready to jump to her defense in the comments, even for the more visually challenging ensembles. \u201cThis is one of my favorite Carrie looks! Something only she could\u2019ve pulled off,\u201d wrote one fan under an image of Bradshaw in a clashing neon pink and green Betsy Johnson tulle dress \u2014 complete with abstract printed leggings. \u201cShe\u2019d look fabulous wearing anything.\u201d But since the launch of the series reboot \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026\u201d in 2021, Bradshaw\u2019s wacky wardrobe has drawn more criticism than kudos. (HBO and Max, which airs \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026,\u201d are also owned by CNN\u2019s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) As filming for the show\u2019s third season continues around New York City, Bradshaw has so far been spotted in ensembles including wearing a sheer, rose-stuffed frock from the Irish designer Simone Rocha (pictured above), as well as a vintage color-blocked Ossie Clark dress and an oversize floppy Maryam Keyhani gingham sun hat. These looks have seemingly fallen flat with some viewers of the show. \u201cDefinitely too much,\u201d read one critique under @everyoutfitonsatc\u2019s post of Jessica Parker in the latter look. \u201cThis was not Carrie\u2019s style\u2026 This is trash,\u201d read another. (Commentary surrounding the Simone Rocha-designed look was somewhat kinder, however, with dedicated followers of Bradshaw\u2019s fashions showing appreciation for the nod to the character\u2019s love of florals \u2014 and a visible bra. So was the response to the first new look Jessica Parker was spotted in while filming in recent weeks: A pair of prissy vintage pastel separates from YSL and Ralph Lauren respectively.) The departure of Patricia Field, longtime stylist on \u201cSex and the City,\u201d has given some sartorially-minded viewers of \u201cAnd Just Like That\u2026\u201d a scapegoat for their grumblings. But Field plowed her own absurdist furrow when curating her characters\u2019 wardrobes (and beyond). \u201cFollowing fashion trends? It\u2019s a waste,\u201d she told The Guardian in February. \u201cTo me, fashion is a cousin of art. And like art, originality is what counts. When it starts to feel intimidating, it\u2019s time to change.\u201d It\u2019s an instinct that the show\u2019s current stylists, Molly Rogers and Danny Santiago, have honored with Bradshaw\u2019s melting pot of patterns and silhouettes \u2014 but one that has gone under appreciated. So has Bradshaw\u2019s style really changed, or have we? Are audiences less tolerant towards an off-beat dresser in her late 50s, when compared to one in her 30s? It seems like a ripe topic for the character\u2019s newspaper column, and one Jessica Parker has thoughts on too. \u201cThere\u2019s so much misogynist chatter in response to us that would never. Happen. About. A. Man,\u201d the actor told Vogue in 2021. \u201cEspecially on social media.

Factor-Druk publishes around a third of the nation\u2019s books and 10% of its newspapers, the company says on its website. The Ukrainian state railway network was also attacked in the early morning, according to a statement from the company. Six employees were wounded, the company said. A CNN team travelling in the area saw two craters and smoke from impacts near a railway line. Civilians have also been trapped by a new swell of violence engulfing the region. On May 15, Russian forces fired on people desperately trying to flee the town of Vovchansk and killed a woman being pushed in a wheelchair by her husband, Ukrainian prosecutors reported. \u2018Extremely brutal\u2019 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the \u201cextremely brutal Russian attack\u201d on Kharkiv and the town of Lyubotyn, drawing attention to the fragility of Kyiv\u2019s air defenses in the face of Moscow\u2019s renewed assault. \u201cRussian terrorists are taking advantage of Ukraine\u2019s lack of sufficient air defense protection and reliable capability to destroy terrorist launchers at their exact locations, which are close to our borders,\u201d Zelensky posted on X. Earlier this month, the US approved a $400 million package of air defense munitions and other weapons to Ukraine. But senior officials in Kyiv have warned that recent flush of aid will not be enough to fend off further Russian advances. CNN journalists in the town of Lyptsi, around 20 miles north of Kharkiv city, saw troops using aging and inadequate weaponry, in an attempt to repel highly-equipped Russian units bolstered by drones. Zelensky is growing increasingly exasperated by a condition imposed by Washington and other Western allies that the weapons they provide to Ukraine cannot be used to launch munitions into Russia. \u201cI don\u2019t think there should be any restrictions, because this is not about the Ukrainian army using Western weapons on Russian territory for offensive,\u201d Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv earlier this month. \u201cThis is defense.\u201d White House officials earlier this month said their stance on the issue remained. \u201cWe do not encourage nor do we enable attacks using US-supplied weapons systems inside Russian territory,\u201d US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said during a press briefing on May 17.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s the policy.\u00a0That has not changed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/europe/russian-strikes-kharkiv-ukraine-may-23-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

Another civilian was also\u00a0killed\u00a0during the shooting, which took place on May 15, the\u00a0Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office said, as intense battles between Ukrainian and Russian forces for control of the border town continue. Russia has ramped up its offensive\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Kharkiv region\u00a0in\u00a0recent weeks, launching its most surprising operation\u00a0in\u00a0more than two years of war on May 10, when\u00a0Russian\u00a0forces\u00a0crossed the\u00a0border\u00a0and subsequently took control of close to a dozen villages. The 70-year-old husband told prosecutors the situation in Vovchansk had become unbearable because of the heavy fighting, so he found a wheelchair for his wife who was experiencing health issues, and the two left their home in the early hours of the night. What followed adds to the repeating horrors that residents in the town and battlefield areas face daily, as Russia continues its push to claim control of more Ukrainian land. Husband shared details of the shooting The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office said the husband, who \u201cmiraculously survived\u201d the shooting in Vovchansk, shared the painful details of the harrowing ordeal. The man said there was heavy shelling around 2 a.m. local time, and he told his wife they should evacuate, according to the\u00a0investigation. Another resident of the embattled\u00a0town joined them. \u201cThe man found a\u00a0wheelchair\u00a0and put his wife\u00a0in\u00a0it because she had been having problems with her legs for a long time. The three of them set off\u00a0in\u00a0the direction of Kharkiv,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office said. \u201cWhen the civilians were near the local hospital, the occupiers opened fire on them. The man who joined the couple and the\u00a0woman\u00a0died on the spot.\u201d The Russian military had opened fire on the evacuees from a five-story building, the husband told prosecutors. \u201cThe wheelchair got stuck, I was pulling it by the handles,\u201d he told prosecutors. \u201cI leaned down and there was a machine gun burst,\u201d he said. \u201cI immediately shouted, what are you doing, we are civilians.\u201d Then\u00a0he said he\u00a0turned around and saw that his wife and the other resident were killed. He started screaming and didn\u2019t know how to proceed. He started pushing the\u00a0wheelchair\u00a0towards the hospital where he knew there were emergency personnel. A man at the hospital shouted at him, urging him to leave the body of his wife and come\u00a0inside the building. But the man continued moving further with the body of his wife towards a flooded bridge, where he realized the two had to part ways. \u201cShe stayed in the wheelchair,\u201d the man told prosecutors. The man managed to reach the outskirts of the Vovchansk, where he met Ukrainian soldiers who took him to Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city. Situation in Vovchansk worsening for civilians Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly urged civilians to evacuate from Vovchansk and frontline areas because of the heavy fighting. Ukrainian officials have previously said\u00a0Russian\u00a0forces\u00a0have captured dozens of civilians\u00a0in\u00a0Vovchansk, and a top regional police officer has accused them of\u00a0using civilians as \u201chuman shields.\u201d CNN is unable to\u00a0independently verify the claims that Russia is using civilians as human shields and has contacted the\u00a0Russian\u00a0Defense Ministry for comment. Russia has not commented on whether its troops use civilians as human shields or target those trying to evacuate. The Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u00a0is \u201ctaking measures for a comprehensive\u00a0investigation\u201d\u00a0into the shooting of civilians\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0border\u00a0town, it said.

Born to a Filipino mother and African American father, the 24-year-old\u2019s win was celebrated on social media as helping to \u201cshatter\u201d traditional beauty ideals long held in the country. \u201cChelsea\u2019s win challenges our ingrained preference for Eurocentric beauty (features) and lighter complexions in our nation,\u201d wrote one user in response to an Instagram post of the win on Miss Universe Philippines\u2019 official account. \u201cFilipino beauty standard shattered into pieces,\u201d read another. Representing Bulacan, a province to the north of Manila, Manalo beat out 52 other contestants from around the archipelago and overseas. The competition was held at the SM Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay. As the competition narrowed down to the top five finalists, Manalo was asked on stage how she would use her beauty and confidence to empower others. \u201cAs a woman of color, I have always faced challenges in my life. I was told that beauty has standards, actually,\u201d she said, adding that she was taught to \u201cbelieve in my mother, to always believe in yourself, uphold the vows that you have.\u201d \u201cBecause of these, I am already influencing a lot of women who are facing me right now,\u201d she said, gazing out to the packed arena. Manalo\u2019s win is part of a wider conversation about diversifying notions of beauty in the Philippines, a country where certain Western ideals have long persisted, shaped in part by the country\u2019s colonial past. Lighter-skinned actors and models typically star in major TV shows, movies and fashion campaigns and as common in other Asian countries, skin lightening treatments and products are pervasive. Manalo, who began modeling at 14, described her own insecurities growing up, in a YouTube video on Empire Philippines, which livestreamed the event. \u201cI grew up having insecurities as I was always bullied because of my skin and my hair type,\u201d she said, crediting her friends and family for helping her \u201crealize that I am beautiful in my own extraordinary way.\u201d Manalo will represent the Philippines in the Miss Universe pageant to be held in Mexico in September. She is vying to earn the fifth title for the country, following the footsteps of Gloria Diaz in 1969, Margie Moran in 1973, and Pia Wurtzbach in 2015 (after host Steve Harvey initially declared the wrong winner.) Catriona Gray was the last Filipino to win the title in 2018. Over 100 countries will be represented at Miss Universe 2024. This year will see the competition remove any upper age limit set for its contestants \u2014 previously, those competing were required to be between the age of 18 and 28. The Miss Universe organization has come under scrutiny in recent weeks, as the parent company of the Miss USA organization. Both Miss USA and Miss Teen USA resigned from their roles earlier this May, amid allegations of mismanagement, a toxic work environment, and conditions that impacted their mental health.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/style/chelsea-manalo-miss-universe-philippines-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_21_europe_ukrainian-drone-unit-russia-intl-latam", "text": "Dusk brings an urgent race to hide before dark. The \u201cCode 9.2\u201d drone unit, from the 92nd assault brigade, are moving into a new launch position from where they\u00a0are about to\u00a0conduct a rare and\u00a0potent\u00a0mission: flying drones into Russia and dropping mines onto key roads inside enemy territory. Twilight provides a moment of opportunity to set up new equipment and unload their Humvee before dark makes these complex tasks impossible. They can only hope the grey, fading light shields them from the endless stream of Russian drones that fly overhead, looking for something to strike. A Starlink dish, a longer range drone antenna, dozens of battery packs, and two huge \u201cVampire\u201d quadcopters\u00a0are\u00a0dumped into trenches and bunkers, set up, and in use within 30 minutes. It is only when the dark has set in that their work can begin. And immediately the threat is apparent. Before operators Andrey and Artem can leave the bunker to begin work, a noise sends them rushing back in for cover. \u201cSssshhh,\u201d Andrey hisses. \u201cOrlan.\u201d The only way to protect yourself from being seen by an Orlan \u2013 a spotter drone that can also have thermal cameras enabling it to see in the dark \u2013 is to hide. And to silently listen for it to pass. \u201cThey will be flying all night,\u201d he says. The horizon is peppered with flashes \u2013 distant explosions.\u00a0Across its center twinkles the Russian city of Belgorod, now repeatedly hit by Ukrainian strikes. Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed his week-old offensive into Kharkiv region in Ukraine is partially aimed at creating a buffer zone along the border to protect a population whose safety was never in doubt when he launched his invasion in February 2022. The bunker is quickly turned into an operations hub, the team finding it hard to adjust to the silent open fields of their new home, after months of fierce battles around Bakhmut. In the silence, Artem says, \u201cyou don\u2019t know, will you get hit or not.\u201d He points out the difference with Ukraine\u2019s failed defense last year of Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetsk region \u2013 and their work tonight, about\u00a0four miles from the border. Here\u00a0the heavy foliage, lack of fixed front lines and proximity to Russia means \u201creconnaissance groups enter and can get anywhere.\u201d They joke they could wake up to a Russian soldier standing over them. For Artem though this fight is intensely personal. His parents still live in a partially destroyed village a short drive away. For 18 months he deceived them\u00a0by saying\u00a0he was stationed at a peaceful checkpoint, when he was really fighting on the front lines. Now they know he is nearby, and the feeling of fighting for his actual home leaves him feeling unsettled. \u201cAnxiety,\u201d he says of the main feeling. \u201cMy parents are right here so if, God forbid, we fail somehow, if there is a breakthrough\u2026 it\u2019s a big responsibility.\u201d Dark has set in, punctured only by the flashes of artillery strikes and the near-full moon. The team move to work fast. Artem and Andrey race to attach the mines to the drone, using only red lights. Suddenly, a tiny whining noise is audible. \u201cRun,\u201d says Andrey, and they take cover in a nearby bunker. Spotted once, the trenches could become a target for airstrikes and artillery all night, and there is little chance to escape: they have no vehicle and racing across open ground on foot is perilous too. A few minutes pass. Flares illuminate an adjacent field. Battles are raging elsewhere too. The team resumes work. Zip ties prime fuses. Masking tape readies explosive. Then again, another drone passes close by, and they race again for shelter. Interrupted twice, and a little breathless from racing\u00a0for\u00a0cover, the team are finally ready to launch. Back in the bunker, the pilot Sasha can see fields flow below the Vampire on its night vision camera. He points out the border line, and then adds: \u201cNow, we are already in Russia\u201d. \u201cDid you bring your passport?\u201d quips Artem. \u201cI can go without a visa,\u201d replies Sasha. Being funny used to be the third team member\u2019s job, before the war dragged Ukrainians of disparate professions into trenches. Andrey was a comic, and briefly worked with Volodymyr Zelensky \u2013 long before his days as a politician and Ukrainian president when he was a TV producer and actor \u2013 on his comedy show. \u201cHonestly, he had one of the best vibes among the people I met,\u201d he says. \u201cThe strongest energy. It is always interesting with him. We spent a lot of time together, one on one.\u201d It is a peculiar trait of the Ukrainian force, compared to their enemy: it is unlikely any of Putin\u2019s troops spent time on stage with the Kremlin head cracking jokes before the war. The drone flies deeper into Russia, and then warning messages ring out loudly in the bunker, on grating repeat, signalling that GPS jammers are at work. Sasha is briefly concerned they may lose the drone. The livestream cuts. He thumbs the controls agitatedly. But then minutes later, the signal is restored: the drone has flown through the interference, kept on course, and can now continue towards the target. Moments later, two packages drop from its underbelly. The mines sit on the road, and later the next day, the unit says, hit one armored car and a soft skin vehicle. As the drone approaches, the team have two problems. Firstly, its GPS system appears damaged and it crashes unceremoniously into the field, upside down. Secondly, they think they can see an Russian Orlan that appears to have followed the drone back into Ukraine, perhaps seeking their launch position. The team stay in shelter a few minutes, hoping the threat passes. Shells whistle overhead and crash into nearby fields. They retrieve the drone, but must rely on their spare until dawn, when daylight will give them a chance to assess the damage. The sorties continue, the team saying they hold the record for the most Vampire flights in one night of 24. But their target now is Russia itself, a powerful symbol of Kyiv\u2019s decision to take the fight back to Moscow, and the new, dangerous escalatory turns this conflict is taking in its third year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/europe/ukrainian-drone-unit-russia-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

Dangerous storms and searing heat will impact vast portions of the United States this Memorial Day weekend and could disrupt outdoor plans and travel.

Most of the daytime Saturday should be storm-free in the Plains before dangerous storms rumble to life in the evening in parts of western Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. Storms will expand in both scope and strength in the evening and overnight and move east into the Mississippi Valley. A Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place Saturday for a large swath of Kansas and Oklahoma, including Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Wichita, and far western Missouri. \u201cViolent tornadoes, extreme hail and corridors of widespread wind damage\u201d are most likely within this area, according to the SPC, but could extend beyond it. Anywhere from Texas through Nebraska to the Mississippi Valley could encounter storms unloading strong wind gusts, hail and tornadoes. Robust thunderstorms will continue over parts of the Mississippi Valley through Sunday morning before gradually losing their strength. But a new round of damaging storms is expected to arrive quickly after. Thunderstorms will develop over portions of the Midwest by Sunday afternoon and develop farther south and east through the evening and overnight hours. Powerful storms could ultimately stretch from the Great Lakes to the South Sunday night. Damaging wind gusts and hail will be the main hazards with any severe thunderstorm Sunday, but some could produce tornadoes. At this time, the greatest tornado threat is in parts of the Midwest, especially during the afternoon and evening. The travel hubs of Chicago, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Nashville could have to contend with damaging storms, leading to delayed or cancelled flights. Thunderstorm activity will likely continue for Memorial Day Monday and could disrupt outdoor plans and travel for a large part of the East. Some of these thunderstorms could become severe, but it\u2019s not yet clear how widespread the threat will be. Even in the absence of damaging wind gusts, hail or tornadoes, lightning is a serious threat for any outdoor plans like picnics, pool parties or beach trips. Unofficial start of summer will officially feel like summer While severe storms pound inland areas this weekend, some coastal areas will face a different threat. A heaping serving of summerlike heat is on the menu as many head to the beach to celebrate the unofficial start of summer. It\u2019s already been record hot in parts of the South this month, especially in South Texas and South Florida, the type of extreme heat made more likely by human-caused climate change. Record heat will expand over the weekend and jeopardize daily high temperature records in jeopardy from Texas through the Southeast as air temperatures soar well into the 90s. Houston, New Orleans, Miami, Mobile, Alabama, Tampa, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, are just a few cities along the Gulf and southeast Atlantic coasts where it\u2019ll feel more like July than late May through Memorial Day. The heat index, which measures what the body actually feels, could approach triple-digits along the southern tier of the US, raising health risks from weather\u2019s deadliest threat. For those out in the heat, it\u2019s important to stay hydrated and be vigilant for signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Heat index values skyrocketed well into the 100s this week in southern Texas and could climb higher into seriously dangerous territory through Monday. The heat index is expected to max out between 110 and 120 degrees in southern Texas, including in Corpus Christi and Laredo, according to the National Weather Service.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/weather/memorial-day-weekend-forecast/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

Chusovitina revealed on Instagram on Thursday that she had suffered the injury while training for the Asian Gymnastic Championships, which are currently being held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Per Olympics.com, Chusovitina needed to compete and finish as the highest eligible athlete in the all-around standings in order to qualify for Paris 2024 and make a record-equaling ninth straight Olympic appearance. \u201cMy dear friends, fans and everyone who loves Gymnastics! Unfortunately, I have some sad news for you,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYesterday, while training on the podium of the Asian Championships, which is taking place in Tashkent and is a qualifying event for the Olympic Games in Paris, I was injured during the floor exercise. \u201cI will not be able to take part and I am very upset as I have been preparing for this competition for a long time. I started doing all-around and I wanted to perform in our country, in front of our fans. But, unfortunately, tomorrow you will not see me among the participants. \u201cI would like to express my gratitude to all of you, but you can come and support our girls. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do tomorrow!\u201d she added. Chusovitina made her Olympic debut in 1992 in Barcelona as a member of the \u201cUnified Team.\u201d The delegation was made up of former Soviet republics \u2013 aside from the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia \u2013 which had elected to compete as one unit after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. She won a gold medal in the team all-around competition that year and has competed in every Summer Games since then. Chusovitina\u2019s second and only other medal came in 2008 in Beijing in the vault. She competed as a German athlete \u2013 the third different team she had represented at the Games \u2013 on that occasion and subsequently in London in 2012 after obtaining citizenship. She switched back to Uzbekistan for the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. Chusovitina won the Uzbekistan all-around title in April in what was a boost to her Olympic hopes at the time, besting Lobar Amrillaeva, who was born in 2006 \u2013 the 48-year-old had appeared at her fourth Summer Games two years prior. However, even if she had qualified for Paris 2024, she would not have been a record holder for very long. The title currently belongs to Georgian shooter Nino Salukvadze, who has competed at every Summer Games since first appearing in Seoul in 1988, where she won a gold medal on debut. The 54-year-old Salukvadze secured a qualifying spot last year, meaning that she will extend her record in Paris and become the first athlete ever to qualify for 10 consecutive Olympics.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/sport/oksana-chusovitina-gymnast-olympics-paris-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_middleeast_raisi-funeral-analysis-intl", "text": "From his days as a clerical student, to overseeing executions as part of the judiciary, Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s life has been intimately tied with Iran\u2019s tumultuous modern history. Yet after all that, his presidency was notably unremarkable. Unlike previous Iranian presidents, Raisi seemed content to serve as an empty vessel that carried out the reactionary policies of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,\u00a0the final arbiter on policymaking. He showed none of the subtle pushback of his predecessor, the moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani. He also lacked the charisma of conservative former presidents who were happy to do Khamenei\u2019s bidding\u00a0\u2013\u00a0such as the firebrand Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but who sought to carve out autonomy for the position of the presidency. So, when foreign dignitaries from a whopping 68 countries gathered for Raisi\u2019s funeral on Thursday, they may not have been preoccupied with thoughts of the late president. This was not a game-changing death like the 2020 assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, the military mastermind credited with creating a strategic stranglehold over much of the Middle East and helping to put the US on the backfoot. Raisi\u2019s absence, in contrast, is unlikely to be felt. Yet his untimely death could hardly have come at a more pivotal time for Iran. \u201cForeign dignitaries will be trying to get a read of the country,\u201d Washington-based Iran analyst and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute Trita Parsi told CNN. \u201cThis is also an opportunity for many of them to manifest how their relationship with Iran has changed.\u201d Iran is deeply enmeshed in the war in Gaza, with Tehran-back armed groups engaged in a low rumbling tit for tat with Israel and its allies across four different countries. In April, it launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel from its territory after an apparent Israeli airstrike on Tehran\u2019s consulate in Damascus. In this fraught moment for the region, leaders from Turkey to India and China \u2013 many of which declared days of national mourning for the late president \u2013 appear keen not to ruffle feathers. The deaths also come after years of diplomatic efforts to achieve a rapprochement with former regional nemeses, such as\u00a0Gulf powerhouses Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,\u00a0both of which were represented at the funeral. Qatar\u2019s emir, as well the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait attended the funeral. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who the International Criminal Court is seeking an arrest warrant for alongside Israeli leaders, was also in attendance. Tens of thousands flocked to the streets to mark the funeral, throwing flowers at the coffins. It was a strong show of support for the regime, and a demonstration of its powerbase. Iran\u2019s populace is deeply polarized, but the regime showed that it could still mobilize a critical mass. Iran today seems not to be the pariah state that former US President Donald Trump almost turned it into in 2018 when he pulled out of a landmark Obama-era nuclear deal that exchanged sanctions relief for curbs to Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cThis (funeral) is a way for countries to show the progress they have made in repairing relations with Iran,\u201d said Parsi. \u201cWe have missed how Iran\u2019s relations in the region have gone through a significant transformation.\u201d Foreign dignitaries are likely engaged in sideline chats to try to get a read on Khamenei\u2019s opaque and sometimes unpredictable thinking on domestic policy\u00a0that could have repercussions for the region. Constitutionally, a presidential election must be held within 50 days of the demise of a sitting president. That is a relatively short time to prepare for a race charged with consequence for Iran\u2019s theocratic leadership. The election will have ramifications for the question of the succession plans of the ailing 85-year-old Khamenei, who is only the second Supreme Leader to rule the Islamic Republic. Moreover, the race can\u00a0either appease or, conversely, fuel the tensions brought on by\u00a0the\u00a0youth-led\u00a0nationwide uprising that rocked the country less than two years ago. Khamenei has ultimate sway over elections through the country\u2019s Guardian Council, which consists of jurists appointed by the Supreme Leader, and which is tasked with vetting election candidates. In the 2021 presidential election, the council disqualified most viable candidates besides Raisi, paving a clear path to his presidency. The race was widely seen as heavily engineered and produced a record low voter turnout. The leader may orchestrate a repeat of that race. He could also decide to change tack, opening it up so that Iran\u2019s next president enjoys broad popular support. \u201cThe election can be a watershed moment for Iran,\u201d Mohammad Ali Shabani, Iran analyst and editor of\u00a0Amwaj.media,\u00a0told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson. \u201c(Khamenei) has a golden opportunity to reverse course in a face-saving way, make a U-turn, open up the space and allow people to run.\u201d During his tenure, Raisi made only feeble attempts to dispel the notion of him as a fig leaf president. He was widely criticized for presiding over the hollowing out of what remains of Iran\u2019s institutions. Legislative elections this March had a record low turnout of 41%.\u00a0The 2022 nationwide uprising posed the biggest domestic threat to the regime in decades. Since the brutal crushing of those protests, the bridge between the regime and its young and largely disgruntled population has grown ever wider. \u201cKhamenei has put the Islamic Republic on a path in which it will only be able to remain in power by increasing repression,\u201d said Parsi. Choosing to open up the election may appease the country\u2019s frustrated young population buckling under continued economic and political strains. That may set Iran on a course to stabilize its restive domestic situation. It may also pave a path for a more Western-friendly administration like that of Rouhani, which presided over the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, albeit within the confines set by Khamenei. Yet analysts say this remains wishful thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see why Khamenei would change course at this point. It would necessitate that he recognizes that he is on a path that is not good for him, but that\u2019s not the conclusion the regime has come to,\u201d said Parsi. \u201cBecause of the succession (of the Supreme Leadership), the regime wants the status quo. They\u2019re going to choose a direction that keeps everything as-is.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/middleeast/raisi-funeral-analysis-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_asia_china-military-drills-taiwan-punishment-intl-hnk", "text": "China has launched two days of large-scale military drills surrounding Taiwan\u00a0in\u00a0what it called \u201cpunishment\u201d for so-called \u201cseparatist acts,\u201d days after the self-ruling island swore in a new democratically elected leader who called on Beijing to cease its intimidation tactics. As part of the drills, dozens of Chinese fighter jets carrying live ammunition conducted mock strikes against \u201chigh-value military targets\u201d of the \u201cenemy\u201d alongside destroyers, frigates and missile speedboats, according to China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV. The exercises, which started early on Thursday and will encircle Taiwan, pose the first real test for newly elected Lai Ching-te as he attempts to manage relations with the island\u2019s powerful authoritarian\u00a0neighbor. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary. China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) said it launched joint military drills involving the army, navy, air force and rocket force in areas around Taiwan at 7.45 a.m. on Thursday. The drills are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 a narrow body of water separating the island from mainland China \u2013 as well as north, south and east of Taiwan. They are also taking place in areas around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off China\u2019s southeastern coast, the PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command said in a statement. PLA Naval Colonel Li Xi, spokesperson for the command, called the exercises \u201ca strong punishment for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces and a serious warning against interference and provocation by external forces.\u201d A senior official responsible for Taiwan\u2019s security affairs told CNN that as of noon Thursday, the island detected about 30 Chinese aircraft, most of which crossed the Median Line into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone (ADIZ).\u00a0The Median Line is an informal demarcation point in the Taiwan Strait that Beijing does not recognize but until recent years had largely respected. The Chinese military also deployed about a dozen Chinese warships around Taiwan, as well as a dozen Coast Guard vessels near Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands,\u00a0according to the official. Taiwan has deployed its own warships to monitor the situation, the official said, adding no Chinese aircraft carrier were involved in the drills so far. \u2018Irrational provocations\u2019 Taiwan\u2019s Lai is detested by Beijing as a \u201cdangerous separatist\u201d for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. He succeeded two-term president Tsai Ing-wen to start an unprecedented third consecutive term in power for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Beijing has denounced Lai\u2019s inauguration speech, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan. Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry has condemned China\u2019s drills as \u201cirrational provocations and actions that undermine regional peace and stability.\u201d In a statement Thursday, the ministry said it had dispatched sea, air and ground forces in response to the drills. \u201cWe stand by with firm will and restraint. We seek no conflicts, but we will not shy away from one. We have the confidence to safeguard our national security,\u201d it said. Taiwan\u2019s presidential spokeswoman Karen Kuo said in a statement: \u201cIt is regrettable to see China threatening Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom and regional peace and stability with unilateral military provocations.\u201d \u201cIn the face of external challenges and threats, we will continue to defend democracy and have the confidence and ability to protect national security,\u201d Kuo added. In a statement on Thursday, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was following developments in the Taiwan Strait closely, and urged all parties to \u201crefrain from acts that could escalate tensions in the region.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people have long become used to the threat of China\u2019s war drills, and Thursday life continued as normal in the capital Taipei. While Taiwanese news outlets were reporting on the Chinese drills, it was far from the only headline on their agenda, which also included recent political bust ups in the legislature, and even information on filing taxes during the tax season. Taipei\u2019s main stock index, the TAIEX, was 0.26 percent up in mid-afternoon trade. Propaganda push China\u2019s military drills are as often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally. China\u2019s military and state media churned out propaganda and highlighted coverage of the drills, which remained a top trending topic Thursday on tightly controlled Chinese social media platforms. Footage of the drills released by the PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command showed a guided missile frigate, the Nantong, and a pilot climbing into a fighter jet at a military base. The rhetoric coming from Chinese state media and the PLA portrayed the exercises as a practice run for encircling Taiwan, and even threatening small outlying islands that lie close to China\u2019s mainland. China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV said multiple destroyer and frigate formations of the Eastern Theater Command Navy \u201cmaneuvered at high speed in multiple directions in the waters surrounding Taiwan, creating an omnidirectional approach in pushing toward the island.\u201d Meanwhile, the command\u2019s air force dispatched dozens of fighter jets to Taiwan\u2019s main island and outlying islands, according to CCTV. \u201cUnder the support and cover of the Army and the Rocket Force, multiple types of aircraft were organized and loaded with live ammunition, flew to the predetermined airspace to establish multiple strike positions, and coordinated with destroyers, frigates, and missile speedboats to simulate attacking the \u2018enemy\u2019s\u2019 high-value military targets and reconnaissance and patrol aircraft,\u201d the report said. In another report, CCTV published a series of posters of what it calls \u201cthe magic weapons killing separatists\u201d promoting Taiwan independence. They include the J-20 and J-16 fighter jets, the Type 052 destroyer and Type 071 amphibious transport dock, and the Dongfeng ballistic missile. Though the report did not specify if they were being used in the ongoing drills. Carl\u00a0Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center, said Beijing was trying to stress Taiwan\u2019s older and less numerous hardware. For instance, \u201cTaiwan\u2019s F-16s are over 20 years old and every flight hour tasked to those air frames draws the fuselage and equipment ever closer to refurbishment, which takes them out of service for 1-4 months. It also stresses the force overall, keeping them on edge,\u201d he said. Schuster said in addition to the drills around Taiwan\u2019s main island, the pressing of China\u2019s Coast Guard and other forces into waters close to the outlying islands controlled by Taipei is \u201cprovocative.\u201d \u201cIt puts Taiwan on the spot. If they react militarily or forcefully, they risk triggering a conflict,\u201d he said. Rising tensions Under leader Xi Jinping, China has grown more assertive and ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on Taiwan as the island democracy tightens informal ties with the United States. Officials in Washington have been anticipating for several months the prospect of Chinese\u00a0provocations around the inauguration and had been having contingency conversations as part of their planning, according to officials. Periods of higher tension, like the swearing-in of a new president in Taiwan, are areas where US officials frequently brace for a Chinese show of force, officials say. \u201cThere\u2019s no surprise whenever there\u2019s an action that highlights Taiwan in the international sphere the Chinese feel compelled to make some kind of form of statement,\u201d Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Stephen Sklenka, the deputy commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command told the National Press Club of Australia on Thursday. In August 2022, China staged massive war games around Taiwan to show its displeasure with then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei. Beijing fired missiles into waters surrounding the island and simulated a blockade with fighter jets and warships, in its largest show of force in years. A similar encirclement exercise was also held in April 2023. Chinese warplanes now regularly fly into Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) and across the Median Line in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 an informal demarcation point that Beijing does not recognize but until recent years had largely respected. Beijing has also exerted pressure on Lai in the lead-up to his inauguration. On May 15, days before Lai took office, Taipei said it detected 45 Chinese military aircraft around Taiwan, the highest single-day number this year. Evan A. Feigenbaum,\u00a0vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, calls China\u2019s latest drills \u201can intimidation tactic, part of a pattern, not a sign of imminent war.\u201d \u201cBeijing has a robust coercion kitbag from which it will mix and match, ratchet up and back and up again to signal its range of options to coerce and inflict pain,\u201d he wrote on social platform X. Some defense experts noted that the name of China\u2019s latest military exercises \u201cJoint Sword-2024A\u201d suggests another round of drills could follow later this year. Drew Thompson, a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, noted the drills were part of a pattern. \u201cIt is not a surprise, nor is it a tactical response to President Lai\u2019s speech. These exercises are part of the PLA\u2019s long-term, strategic preparations to fight and win a war over Taiwan,\u201d he told CNN.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/asia/china-military-drills-taiwan-punishment-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-american-sentencing", "text": "The first of several Americans recently charged with possession of ammunition in Turks and Caicos was heading home Friday after getting a suspended 52-week sentence and a $6,700 fine, his representatives said. But four other Americans still await their fate. In recent months, all were arrested and accused of bringing in various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. In the Turks and Caicos, possession of firearms or ammunition carries a minimum 12-year sentence, though the law allows reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d the local governor said. Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania had pleaded guilty to the charge, the Turks and Caicos government said. On Friday, he got a 52-week sentence that was suspended for one year, meaning he would not face immediate incarceration, Hagerich\u2019s attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel, told CNN. Hagerich was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory and return to the United States once he paid the fine, Smith said. He would have to serve the full 12-month sentence if the fine was not paid. Hagerich flew back to the US Friday afternoon, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign. The organization helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. \u201cVery grateful to the Court for giving two very special kids their dad back. Even more grateful to the numerous (Turks and Caicos Islands) nationals who helped along the way,\u201d Franks posted to X along with a picture of Hagerich boarding a plane. Smith said his client was \u201cpleased, he\u2019s relieved\u201d by the outcome. \u201cThe sentence, in all its circumstances, is reasonable and fair,\u201d Smith said. After Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said justice \u201chas been served as the law intended.\u201d \u201cAs we have said, The Firearms Act includes consideration for exceptional circumstances,\u201d Misick said, \u201cand today\u2019s decision reflects our commitment to judicial independence along with upholding the law. Residents and visitors can be confident that the Turks and Caicos Islands are dedicated to safety and compassion as we protect the safety and rights of all.\u201d The four other Americans charged have been released on bail while they await their court dates, Misick\u2019s office said in a statement. One was allowed to return to the US for medical reasons, and the rest are staying in Turks and Caicos. US lawmakers tried to get Americans freed A US congressional delegation traveled to the islands this week and asked for charges to be dropped for the five Americans whom they said \u201cinadvertently\u201d had ammunition in their luggage. Hagerich\u2019s sentencing came after the US officials expressed disappointment over their attempted intervention. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward,\u201d Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said in a statement this week. In addition to Hagerich, two other Americans \u2013 Michael Lee Evans and Tyler Wenrich \u2013 have pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the territory\u2019s government. Evans was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, Smith said. A fourth American, Ryan Tyler Watson, will have a hearing Tuesday to determine if he will enter a plea or go to trial, Smith said. A fifth American, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, director of communications in the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. Turks and Caicos: No special treatment should be given to any group Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said the mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms or ammunition is in place to protect those on the islands, and judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said. \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly,\u201d Misick said. And US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick said Thursday. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date. Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Misick said. By contrast, the United States has more guns than people. Now, bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d While the US and Turks and Caicos collaborate in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d But at least one appointed member of the opposition, Alvin Garland, expressed concern about the American citizens\u2019 arrests. Garland said the islands\u2019 governor is correct in not interfering with the ongoing court cases in order to adhere to the government\u2019s separation of powers, but added he believes most, if not all, of the cases involving American tourists will fall into the \u201cexceptional circumstances category\u201d and sentences could be shorter than the mandatory 12-year minimum.

Not only can the inquisitive creatures count, but they can match the number of calls they make when shown a numeral, according to a new study, led by a team of researchers with the University of T\u00fcbingen\u2019s animal physiology lab in Germany. The way the birds recognize and react to numbers is similar to a process we humans use, both to learn to count as toddlers and quickly recognize how many objects we\u2019re looking at. The findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, deepen our growing understanding of crow intelligence. \u201cHumans do not have a monopoly on skills such as numerical thinking, abstraction, tool manufacture, and planning ahead,\u201d said animal cognition expert Heather Williams via email. \u201cNo one should be surprised that crows are \u2018smart.\u2019\u201d Williams, a professor of biology at Williams College in Massachusetts, was not involved in the study.

In attempting to woo mates, some male frogs count the number of calls from competing males to match or even one-up that number when it\u2019s their turn to croak at a female. Scientists have even theorized that ants retrace their paths back to their colonies by counting their steps, though the method isn\u2019t always accurate. What this latest study showed is that crows, like young humans, can learn to associate numerals with values \u2013\u2013 and count out loud accordingly. Can crows count much like toddlers do? The research was inspired by toddlers learning to count, said lead study author Diana Liao, a neurobiologist and senior researcher at the T\u00fcbingen lab. Toddlers use the words of numbers to tally the number of objects in front of them: If they see three toys in front of them, their counting could sound like \u201cone, two, three\u201d or \u201cone, one, one.\u201d Maybe crows could do the same, Liao thought. She was inspired, too, by a June 2005 study on chickadees tailoring their alarm calls to a predator\u2019s size. The larger a predator\u2019s wingspan or body length, the fewer \u201cdee\u201d sounds the chickadees used in their alarm call, the study found. The opposite was true for smaller predators \u2013\u2013 the songbirds would use more \u201cdee\u201d sounds if they encountered a smaller bird, which could be greater threats to chickadees since they are more agile, Liao said. The authors of the chickadee study couldn\u2019t confirm whether the small songbirds had control over the number of sounds they made or if the number of sounds were an involuntary response. But the possibility piqued Liao\u2019s curiosity \u2013\u2013 could crows, whose intelligence has been well-documented over decades of research, show control over their ability to produce a certain number of sounds, effectively \u201ccounting\u201d like toddlers do? The crows planned their number of caws Liao and her colleagues trained three carrion crows, a European species closely related to the American crow, over more than 160 sessions. During the trainings, the birds had to learn associations between a series of visual and auditory cues from 1 to 4 and produce the corresponding number of caws. In the example researchers provided, a visual cue might look like a bright blue numeral, and its corresponding audio could be the half-second song of a drumroll. The crows were expected to perform the same number of caws as the number represented by the cue \u2013\u2013 three caws for the cue with the numeral 3 \u2013\u2013 within 10 seconds of seeing and hearing the cue. When the birds had stopped counting and cawing, they would peck at an \u201center\u201d key on the touchscreen that presented their cues to confirm that they were done. If the birds had counted correctly, they\u2019d receive a treat. It appeared that as the cues continued, the crows took longer to react to each cue. Their reaction times grew as \u201cmore vocalizations were impending,\u201d Liao wrote, suggesting that the crows planned the number of caws they were going to make before they opened their beaks. The researchers could even tell how many calls the birds planned to make by the way their first call sounded \u2013\u2013 subtle acoustic differences that showed that the crows knew how many numbers they were looking at and had synthesized the information. \u201cThey understand abstract numbers \u2026 and then plan ahead as they match their behavior to match that number,\u201d Williams said. Even the mistakes the crows made were somewhat advanced: If the crows had cawed one too many times, stuttered over the same number or submitted their responses with their beak prematurely, Liao and her researchers could detect from the sound of the first call where they went wrong. These are the \u201csame kinds of errors humans make,\u201d Williams said. We\u2019re still learning how smart crows are Birds and many other animals were previously thought to make only on-the-spot decisions based on stimuli in their immediate environments, a theory popularized by the 20th century animal behaviorist B.F. Skinner. But the latest research by Liao and her colleagues provides more evidence about crows\u2019 ability to synthesize numbers to produce a sound and suggests that the skill is within their control. The study team\u2019s findings are highly specific but still significant \u2013\u2013 they challenge the once common belief that all animals are merely stimulus-response machines, said Kevin McGowan, a researcher at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York, who has spent more than two decades studying wild crows in their habitats. McGowan wasn\u2019t involved in the study. The study, McGowan told CNN, demonstrated that \u201ccrows aren\u2019t just simple nonthinking machines out there reacting to their environment \u2013\u2013 they\u2019re actually thinking ahead and have the ability to communicate in a structured, preplanned way. It\u2019s sort of a necessary precursor for having a language.\u201d Crow intelligence has been studied for decades. Scientists have investigated New Caledonian crows creating their own compound tools to access food. The birds appear to establish rules, according to a November 2013 study coauthored by the University of T\u00fcbingen lab\u2019s lead researcher, Andreas Nieder. Crow language has confounded scientists for decades, too, with its widely varying tones and expressions, McGowan said. The study by Liao and her colleagues isn\u2019t even the first to consider whether crows can count. That research began with Nicholas Thompson in 1968, animal cognition expert Irene Pepperberg noted. A research professor of psychological and brain sciences at Boston University, Pepperberg is best known for her work with an African grey parrot named Alex. Thompson hypothesized that crows could count based on their caws, the duration and number of which the birds appeared to control in a given burst of sound. The crows\u2019 counting abilities \u201cseem to exceed the demands which survival makes for such abilities,\u201d he wrote. Another University of T\u00fcbingen study on crows\u2019 counting abilities from September 2015 trained the birds to recognize groupings of dots and recorded the activity of neurons in the part of the crows\u2019 brains that receives and makes sense of visual stimuli. The researchers found that the crows\u2019 neurons \u201cignore the dots\u2019 size, shape and arrangement and only extract their number,\u201d the university said in a statement at the time. \u201cSo, crows\u2019 brains can represent different quantities, and crows can quickly learn to match Arabic numerals to those quantities \u2013\u2013 something humans usually explicitly teach their children,\u201d Williams said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/world/crows-can-count-study-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_africa_south-africa-elections-explained-intl", "text": "South Africans go to the polls on May 29 for what will likely be the most pivotal general election since the end of apartheid. Polls show the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party could lose its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led the party to power in 1994. While polling can be challenging in South Africa, most analysts believe that the ANC faces its stiffest challenge yet with a population deeply frustrated by the country\u2019s direction. This is the seventh general election South Africa has held since the end of white minority rule 30 years ago. A record 27.79 million people are registered to vote \u2013 the highest number to date, according to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC.) The slide in popularity mirrors the challenges of liberation movements that have transitioned into governing parties across the continent. What could happen? If support for the ANC drops below 50% for the first time, the party will be forced to enter into a coalition government. A loss of a simple majority would put significant pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa within his party, as he promised a \u201cnew dawn\u201d when he took over leadership in 2018 from disgraced former president Jacob Zuma. Support for the ANC has been on a slow downward trend over the decades but at the last election in 2019 it dropped below 60% for the first time, with the party earning 57.50% of the vote. What\u2019s gone wrong for the ANC? South Africans have a lot to grumble about. Violent crime is on the rise. Murder is at a 20-year high; with someone killed in the country roughly every 20 minutes, according to the most recent quarterly police crime statistics. Many have lost faith in the police as part of a larger breakdown in trust in government. The Rainbow Nation has the highest sustained rate of unemployment in the world \u2013 and it\u2019s growing.Meanwhile, rolling electricity blackouts, water outages, a crisis in education, and a lack of service delivery all weigh on the population. But high on the list of issues are the allegations of corruption and mismanagement that continue to damage the ANC. When Ramaphosa \u2013 Mandela\u2019s favorite to succeed him as leader \u2013 replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma as president, he pledged \u201cto work very hard not to disappoint the people of South Africa.\u201d But in 2022, Ramaphosa was himself forced to deny stealing money. \u201cCorruption has wounded our democracy and shaken people\u2019s faith in our institutions,\u201d he admitted in a November speech. \u201cIf corruption is not arrested, the greatest damage will not be in the funds stolen, the jobs lost, or the services not delivered. The greatest damage will be to the belief in democracy itself,\u201d he added. This year South Africa received its lowest score on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index. The index scores countries from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean). South Africa received 41 \u2013 worse than China and Cuba at 42. What are the other key parties? The country\u2019s main opposition party, the centrist Democratic Alliance (DA), is led by John Steenhuisen and is seen by many as a party for White South Africans. For this election, the DA has formed a coalition bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. If the polls are to be believed, the ANC may have to make the choice between forming a coalition with the Zuma-backed party \u2013 uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK) \u2013 and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) or the DA. Steenhuisen, for his part, has not ruled out going into coalition with the ANC if it were to keep the EFF and MK out of government. The EFF is a populist far-left party led by former ANC youth leader Julius Malema. It began as a splinter party of the ANC and espouses expropriation of land without compensation and sweeping state nationalism. The EFF has shown support for the MK party and Malema recently said that he intends to \u201cgive the EFF vote to the ANC\u201d if it doesn\u2019t get 50% \u2013 on the condition that his deputy, Floyd Shivambu, becomes Minister of Finance. Steenhuisen has described an ANC-EFF-MK pact as a \u201cdoomsday coalition.\u201d Talking of Zuma\u2026 The former president continues to be a thorn in Ramaphosa\u2019s side. After a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court after failing to appear before a corruption inquiry, the 82-year-old is now the leader of the MK party \u2013 and was up until this week top of their parliamentary list. The country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled Monday he is not eligible to run for parliament\u00a0until five years have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. The unanimous ruling capped months-long speculation and legal wrangling on whether he could stand for the country\u2019s top legislative body. His party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Zuma had been campaigning against what he perceives as Ramaphosa\u2019s failures and disillusioned ANC voters were lapping it up, according to polls. An April poll by the Johannesburg-based Social Research Foundation poll found the ANC may get 37% of the vote, while MK may garner 13%. However, the most recent polling from the same foundation puts support for the MK party at 10.5% and\u00a0the ANC at 44.8% on Monday.\u00a0This suggests the ANC may be winning back support and may only need a small coalition partner.  When will we know the final result? The final election results will be announced on Sunday 2 June, the IEC said. However, projections should give a sense of the result a day or two after polls close and the final result could be announced sooner if vote counting is completed earlier.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/africa/south-africa-elections-explained-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

The drills are the largest in more than a year and come just days after Taiwan swore in its new president, Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. Beijing has denounced Lai as a \u201cdangerous separatist\u201d and decried his inauguration speech on Monday, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan, which has grown much more pronounced under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The PLA, which dwarfs Taipei\u2019s outgunned military, kicked off the exercises on Thursday morning, sending warships and fighter jets around Taiwan and its outlying islands in\u00a0what it called \u201ca strong punishment for separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces.\u201d On Friday, the PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command said it was continuing the drills on both sides of the Taiwan island chain to \u201ctest the ability to jointly seize power, launch joint attacks and occupy key areas.\u201d China\u2019s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. The vast majority of Taiwanese have no desire to live under Chinese rule. But Xi, China\u2019s most authoritarian leader in a generation, has made clear the island\u2019s \u201cinevitable reunification\u201d with the mainland cannot be put off indefinitely. The two-day exercises, involving joint operations of China\u2019s army, navy, air force and rocket force,\u00a0are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 a narrow body of water separating the island from mainland China \u2013 as well as north, south and east of Taiwan, according to the PLA. For the first time, the PLA drills also involved China\u2019s Coast Guard, operating in areas around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off the southeastern coast of China. CCTV aired footage on Friday that shows PLA soldiers moving mobile artillery and missile systems into position, though it did not show any live fire. Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry has condemned China\u2019s military exercises as \u201cirrational provocations\u201d and dispatched its own sea, air and ground forces in response. Between 6 a.m. Thursday and 6 a.m. Friday, the ministry detected 49 Chinese aircraft, including 35 that crossed the Median Line, an informal demarcation point in the Taiwan Strait that Beijing does not recognize but until recent years had largely respected. A total of 19 Chinese warships and seven coast guard vessels were detected near the Taiwan Strait, according to the ministry. Taiwan\u2019s presidential office said Thursday it is \u201cregrettable to see China threatening Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom and regional peace and stability with unilateral military provocations,\u201d adding Taiwan has the \u201cconfidence and ability to protect national security.\u201d First week in office Lai has had a busy and politically turbulent start to his presidency after taking over from two-term leader Tsai Ing-wen, to kick off a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The PLA\u2019s drills pose the first real test for the veteran politician in managing tensions with Beijing, which has refused his offer to talk and to resume cross-strait tourism and student exchanges. On Friday, China\u2019s Defense Ministry accused Lai of pushing Taiwan into \u201ca dangerous situation of war\u201dand \u201cplaying with fire.\u201d \u201cThose who play with fire will burn themselves,\u201d ministry spokesperson Wu Qian told reporters, using rhetoric China frequently deploys for Taiwan\u2019s government. \u201cWhenever \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 (forces) provoke us, we will push our countermeasures forward until the complete reunification of the motherland is achieved.\u201d Domestically, Lai is facing chaos in the legislature, where opposition parties who favor closer ties to China hold a majority, and have pushed to subject his administration to tighter scrutiny. Thousands of mostly young people have taken to the streets to protest the opposition\u2019s attempt to fast-track the proposed bills to grant the parliament more power. But despite Beijing\u2019s large show of force, life continued as normal in Taiwan, whose 23 million people have become used to China\u2019s military threats, even as they become more regular and prominent in recent years. \u201cWe are not scared of the Chinese Communist Party, and we have confidence,\u201d\u00a0an 88-year-old retiree, who gave his surname Liu, told CNN. \u201cIf the Chinese Communist Party does attack Taiwan, it won\u2019t be easy for them to take Taiwan. Taiwanese people are not afraid of war.\u201d A 42-year-old mother, who gave her surname Tsai, said she wasn\u2019t even aware the PLA drills were taking place. \u201cI believe leaders will prioritize people\u2019s happiness, so I\u2019m not worried. I think peace will be maintained,\u201d she said. \u2018Blockading Taiwan\u2019 China\u2019s military drills are often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally, and state media has ramped up coverage of the drills. Zhang Chi, a Chinese military expert, told China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV that the PLA\u2019s exercises focused on \u201cpracticing a new mode of blockading Taiwan.\u201d \u201cTaiwan is an isolated island, suspended in the sea with weak self-sufficiency. Taiwan\u2019s economy is export-oriented, and most of its energy consumption relies on imports. Once besieged and blockaded, it can easily lead to economic collapse, turning it into a dead island,\u201d he said. The exercises to the south of Taiwan are crucial for the blockade, targeting Kaohsiung port, Taiwan\u2019s largest port and an important base for the island\u2019s navy, Zhang said. Meanwhile, drills to the east of Taiwan are designed to practice cutting off the island\u2019s energy imports, the escape routes for \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d forces and the support line from the US and its allies, he added. The US maintains close but informal relations with Taiwan and is bound by law to supply the island with weapons to defend itself. Zhang also noted that the drills had achieved \u201ca new breakthrough\u201d by entering waters near Wuqiu\u00a0and Dongyin, which hold significant geographical importance. \u201cThe Taiwanese military views them as the front outposts for Taiwan Strait defense operations. This exercise further squeezed the activity space of the Taiwanese military,\u201d he said. Analysts said the China Coast Guard movement close to and around the outlying islands was an important new aspect of the current drills, which follow previous encirclement exercises in August 2022 and April 2023. \u201cThe pressing of Coast Guard and other forces into waters close to those offshore islands is provocative,\u201d said Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center. He said he expected such Chinese activities to continue and that they \u201cwill become the norm,\u201d with Beijing at any point able to then turn an exercise into a real military operation. Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said China\u2019s pattern of exercises around Taiwan does not signal an imminent invasion threat. \u201cThese drills aid in blurring the lines between peace and war, so much so that future exercises could be used as a pretext for an actual invasion,\u201d Singleton said. But Singleton and others say the exercises are sending a bigger political message than a military one. \u201cJoint Sword - 2024A aims at reactivating the military pressure lever to assert a degree of influence on the new (Taiwan) administration and its narrative,\u201d said Lionel Fatton, assistant professor of international relations at Webster University in Geneva, using China\u2019s name for this week\u2019s drills. Beijing will use the pressure of the drills to try to increase divisions within Taiwan, which could \u201cweaken\u201d the island from the inside, he said. \u201cConstant and visible\u00a0military pressure on the island will also help polarize the political apparatus, if not the social fabric itself,\u201d Fatton said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/asia/china-military-drills-taiwan-second-day-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_24_africa_djibouti-releases-gene-modified-mosquitoes-intl", "text": "Genetically engineered mosquitoes have been released in the tiny East African country of Djibouti to combat a surge in malaria infections caused by an invasive vector. This initiative started on Thursday, comes as Djibouti, one of\u00a0Africa\u2019s smallest nations\u00a0with just over a million residents, grapples with a dramatic increase in malaria cases, skyrocketing\u00a0from just 27 in 2012 to\u00a0more than 70,000\u00a0in recent years, according to the WHO. The\u00a0health body attributes the spike\u00a0to the arrival of\u00a0Anopheles stephensi, an invasive Asian mosquito species that transmit the deadly disease. The\u00a0mosquito species has also been detected in Ethiopia and Somalia, Djibouti\u2019s neighbors in the Horn of Africa, posing a significant regional threat. Unlike most malaria-transmitting mosquitoes in Africa that breed in rural areas, Anopheles Stephensi thrives in urban environments, intensifying the public health challenge for predominantly urban Djibouti. \u201cThis mosquito poses a huge threat to our fight against malaria,\u201d said Grey Frandsen, CEO of US-owned biotechnology firm Oxitec, which developed the gene-modified mosquitoes released in Djibouti. \u201cAnopheles\u00a0stephensi\u00a0evade conventional tools, are resistant to insecticides and daytime-biters, reducing the efficacy of bed nets,\u201d he said. Djibouti health minister Ahmed Robleh Abdilleh told CNN that his nation was trying out the new technology developed by Oxitec and believes it could be a \u201cgame changer\u201d in reducing malaria spread. \u201cWe are in the pilot phase, but we believe in the technology. We are sure it will be the game changer,\u201d\u00a0Abdilleh\u00a0said. \u2018Using mosquitoes to fight mosquitoes\u2019 Dubbed a method that \u201cuses mosquitoes to fight mosquitoes\u201d, Oxitec\u2019s genetic technology targets female mosquitoes, which are predominantly responsible for malaria transmission. The technique involves releasing genetically engineered male mosquitoes into the wild, which then mate with females. The introduced gene prevents female offspring from surviving to adulthood, effectively reducing the population of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Male mosquitoes do not bite and therefore cannot transmit malaria. Frandsen said Oxitec\u2019s genetic technology, which is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has been effective in reducing other mosquito-borne viral diseases such as dengue fever in other parts of the world. \u201cOur technology is already proven to reduce populations of dengue-spreading Aedes aegypti\u00a0mosquitoes\u00a0by upwards of 95%\u00a0in urban communities in Brazil, and we are committed to delivering impact in urban communities in Djibouti and beyond,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe are still at the early stages of this program, but we\u2019re hopeful of the impact this can have in driving down malaria-spreading mosquitoes,\u201d he added. Although the rollout of genetically modified mosquitoes in Djibouti is only the second in Africa,\u00a0the idea is drawing more interest on the continent. In 2019, a team of scientists released Africa\u2019s pioneer batch of gene-modified mosquitoes to gather data on the potency of the technique in Burkina Faso where malaria is a leading cause of death. According to vector control research alliance, Target Malaria, the mosquitoes released in the west African country were\u00a0\u201cgenetically modified\u00a0to be sterile, so it can mate but cannot produce offspring.\u201d It added that an estimated 14,850 gene-modified male mosquitoes were released and 527 were recaptured. \u201cAfter recapturing them, the researchers found that the genetically modified mosquitoes were less mobile than their non-transgenic siblings and had lower survival rates,\u201d the alliance said of its findings, adding that a\u00a0second trial phase was being planned in the country. Uganda\u2019s President Yoweri Museveni announced in early January that his country is partnering with Oxitec to combat malaria. Africa bears the brunt of the global malaria burden, accounting for 96% of malaria deaths worldwide in 2021, according to the World Health Organization.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/africa/djibouti-releases-gene-modified-mosquitoes-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_airplane-etiquette-tips", "text": "Planes are going to be crowded. Patience will be tried. Some level of aggravation is all but inevitable. Throw in a seat-kicker, a tipsy stranger and someone who\u2019s blissfully barefoot, and the summer odyssey becomes a little more challenging. And this summer is poised to be a record-setter for air travel. Industry trade organization Airlines for America expects US airlines to carry a record 271 million passengers from June through August. It\u2019ll all go more smoothly if every passenger brings some common courtesy along for the ride, so CNN Travel spoke with experts about the best approaches to airplane etiquette. The missing ingredient, in many cases, is self-awareness. People tend to get wrapped up in their own journey and forget that there\u2019s a whole planeload of other passengers. \u201cIt\u2019s always kind of mind-blowing to see that because it\u2019s my bag, and my overhead bin, and my seat, and my flight, my connection and, you know, my drink, and it\u2019s very me me me when it comes to just how people behave on an airplane. \u201cAnd it\u2019s like, there\u2019s hundreds of you,\u201d said Rich Henderson, who\u2019s been a flight attendant for about a decade. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be aware of your surroundings, you\u2019ve got to be respectful of the people around you.\u201d It starts with \u2018hello\u2019 Be polite to the flight crew greeting you. \u201cIt goes a long way when you\u2019re pleasant to the first person you see on the plane,\u201d said Diane Gottsman, an etiquette expert and owner of The Protocol School of Texas. Andrew Henderson, a flight attendant with 20 years of experience, seconds that notion. \u201cA simple \u2018hello\u2019 or \u2018thank you\u2019 or acknowledgment of our existence is polite. I think that\u2019s some of the etiquette that\u2019s being lost these days with all the noise-canceling headphones and devices we\u2019re on. We\u2019re all so busy that we forget that humans exist in the world,\u201d said Andrew Henderson. He is married to Rich Henderson and together they run the website and social media accounts Two Guys on a Plane, where \u201cthe sass is complimentary.\u201d About those headphones Earbuds and noise-canceling headphones are a double-edged sword: great for blocking out the world when it\u2019s intrusive, but not so great for paying attention when it matters. \u201cWe\u2019re there primarily for safety reasons as flight attendants and you know we often joke, but it\u2019s not really a joke, that if there was an emergency situation, half the people would still be on the plane because they have noise-canceling headphones on and they\u2019re in their phones and they\u2019re not paying attention to what\u2019s going on around them,\u201d said Rich Henderson. \u201cAnd it\u2019s kind of scary to think about.\u201d Passengers lost in their own world also tend to miss things like beverage service and then get annoyed that they\u2019re skipped. \u201cIf you see a cart, a flight attendant approaching your row, take your headphones off, look up, acknowledge that they\u2019re there so that we don\u2019t have to have challenging situations in the future,\u201d said Andrew Henderson. But noise canceling devices, which Gottsman called \u201cthe universal sign of \u2018I don\u2019t want to be bothered,\u2019\u201d obviously come in handy. Neighbor talking your ear off? Put on headphones. And they\u2019re a savior when babies are crying. So put them on your ears and be kind. Kids on planes \u201cI feel like we really need to give grace to traveling parents because we all know \u2026 it\u2019s not the baby\u2019s fault, and it puts the parent in such an uncomfortable situation to see people rolling their eyes,\u201d said Gottsman. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the baby to cry any more than we do.\u201d But kids-gone-wild scenarios are another story. Inattentive parents frequently make lists of the most annoying behaviors on planes. \u201cThe flipside of that is parents \u2014 much like in any public space \u2014 should be expected to keep an eye on their children,\u201d Gottsman said. \u201cIf they\u2019re at a restaurant, if they\u2019re in a grocery store, certainly when they\u2019re in an airplane, for the safety of the child, for the comfort of fellow passengers. You know, be attentive to them kicking the seat in front of them.\u201d Seat-kicking and other conflicts Seat-kicking is a frequent passenger complaint, along with armrest-hogging and a laundry list of other grievances. \u201cI think that we all just have to be a little kinder to each other. If someone\u2019s kicking your seat, you have to be an adult and turn around and speak to the person,\u201d said Andrew Henderson. These situations require communication to head off frustration before it happens. \u201cSo, if I know I\u2019m a passenger that wants to have the window shade closed the whole flight, I\u2019ll turn to my neighbor and say, \u2018Does anyone want the window shade open? It\u2019s my preference to have it closed,\u2019\u201d he said. And if someone else would like it open, there\u2019s room for negotiation. Maybe they like having it open to see out during takeoff and landing but otherwise are fine having it closed. Samantha Brown, TV host and travel expert, takes a more unilateral approach to the window shade question: The window seat occupant decides. \u201cIf they would like the shade up, they keep the shade up. The aisle seat person cannot tell the window seat person to put the shade down,\u201d she told CNN recently, and emphatically. Andrew Henderson cautions against such an approach. \u201cIf you just get on and are self-absorbed and \u2018It\u2019s my window, I\u2019m going to close it if I want to,\u2019 of course you\u2019re going to start a fight that way,\u201d he said. Proceed carefully, window seaters. The rule on armrests As for armrests, Gottsman said the middle seat gets priority. \u201cI always say the middle person gets both armrests \u2013 gets to choose, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d she said, adding that the middle seat\u2019s occupant should be able to decide which way they want to lean. Samantha Brown said the middle seat occupant definitely gets both armrests. \u201cThe middle seat \u2014 they get anything they want.\u201d A measured approach to the seat-reclining question The seat-reclining question certainly cannot be resolved here. To recline or not to recline is a hot-button issue with many travelers on both sides. But bringing courtesy to whichever way you lean is key. Leaning backwards? \u201cIf you\u2019re going to recline your seat back, it\u2019s important to look backwards first and see if somebody\u2019s knees are up against the seat, see if the tray table is down, see if they\u2019ve got food [on the tray table],\u201d said Gottsman. Rich Henderson believes in reclining, with a caveat. \u201cAs a general rule, I feel like a person should be able to use their seat the way that it\u2019s designed to be used,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d on a flight that offers meal service is to put your seat forward during that time. Boozing it up Some of the most egregious air rage incidents of the past few years have involved alcohol. A passenger who\u2019s had a few drinks at the airport bar and has a few more on the plane may not make the best seatmate or customer. Some end up facing hefty fines. \u201cI think that it\u2019s important to drink in moderation,\u201d said Gottman. \u201cIf you are going to drink, and that\u2019s fine, don\u2019t over imbibe.\u201d Smelly food, smelly people There\u2019s no escaping unpleasant odors in tight quarters, so be conscious of what you choose to bring on a plane. Think twice about fish and hard-boiled eggs, for example. \u201cWhat\u2019s smelly food to me is not smelly food to someone else, so if you hear people grumbling about your food, maybe the airplane isn\u2019t the best place to eat your fish tacos,\u201d said Andrew Henderson. \u201cOr, know that you have fish tacos and apologize to the group around you that that\u2019s what sounded good to you, \u2018I\u2019ll be as quick as I can with eating it.\u2019\u201d Do your personal grooming at home \u2014 do not clip your nails en route to grandma\u2019s house. But do tend to your personal hygiene pre-flight. Smelly passengers \u2013 from poor hygiene or too much perfume or cologne, are a common complaint, surveys say. Smelly feet \u2013 or any feet, really Gottsman urges passengers to choose a pair of shoes that will be comfortable throughout the flight \u2014 even if your feet swell. \u201cIt\u2019s not OK to kick off your shoes and take a little nap,\u201d she said. \u201cThe nap is fine, but shoes should stay on. And you don\u2019t want to walk up and down the cabin, to the restroom and back, barefooted or in socks.\u201d Do not, under any circumstance, put your bare feet on another person\u2019s armrest. This happened to Brown in what she called \u201cthe most annoying passenger experience I have ever had.\u201d \u201cRight away I feel no problem just turning around and saying, \u2018Please don\u2019t do that,\u2019 but first, you need to document,\u201d she said, showing CNN viewers photos of the offending passenger\u2019s bare feet (yup, both feet) with red toenails. That also gave the other passenger\u2019s partner time to say, \u201cUh, you should remove your feet. She\u2019s taking pictures of them.\u201d Bottom line? \u201cWe could all do a little bit better to be nicer to each other,\u201d said Rich Henderson, \u201cespecially in such tight quarters.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/airplane-etiquette-tips/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_20_style_park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli", "text": "Everyone knows the familiar shapes that make up New York\u2019s skyline. There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_19_europe_life-goes-on-in-kharkiv-cmd-intl", "text": "CNN visited Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, on May 10-11, 2024, to speak to people about the war. The visit coincided with a major Russian push across the border. Thirty miles to the north, Russian forces are invading again. But in Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, life cracks on. Upstairs at the Che champagne bar on Sumska Street, girlfriends arrive in twos and threes, dressed to impress. They take photos of each other, backlit in pink and gold, and framed by floor-to-ceiling shelves of Mo\u00ebt & Chandon. \u201cWe are all 1654,\u201d it says on the wall and on the sugar sachets,\u00a0a reference to the year the city was founded. The last two\u00a0years\u00a0have been among the toughest. Just across the street from Che is the regional government headquarters. On March 1, 2022 - the sixth day of Russia\u2019s war \u2013 CCTV caught the moment it was struck by two missiles. Today, the windows are boarded up, but the exterior is in surprisingly good order. A huge poster hangs over the front bearing words all Ukrainians know. Keep fighting \u2014 you are sure to win! God helps you in your fight! For fame and freedom march with you, And right is on your side! When we meet\u00a0businessman\u00a0and philanthropist,\u00a0Yuriy\u00a0Sapronov, outside a caf\u00e9 after lunch, he has just been updated about\u00a0the battlefield situation by\u00a0soldiers along the border. The news is not good. Russians have pushed through in two areas in a four-battalion effort.\u00a0Sapronov\u00a0reckons the aim is to draw Ukrainian forces away from positions defending Chasiv Yar in the Donbas region to the southeast. He draws a map on the paper place-setting in front of him explaining how far Russia needs to advance to get its artillery in range to hit the city. He\u2019s confident they won\u2019t succeed because Ukraine has moved combat-hardened brigades to defend\u00a0those\u00a0positions. Not that it will stop Russia sending S-300 missiles and guided aerial bombs towards Kharkiv. The fastest of them will make impact within a minute of being launched, so close is the city to Russia. \u201cEveryday genocide,\u201d\u00a0says\u00a0Sapronov. The businessman\u00a0was born in Kaliningrad, now a part of Russia, then a part of the Soviet Union, more than 60 years ago.\u00a0His father was in the Soviet air force and when the time came for him to step into the reserves, he was told he could move his family to almost any location he wanted. He chose Kharkiv\u00a0for its universities,\u00a0to give Yuriy and his sister a good place to study. Sapronov\u00a0himself became a businessman after abandoning his job as a chemistry teacher in the chaos of the Soviet Union\u2019s demise. He traded in metals, oil and computers, before later moving into construction. \u201cMoney was just lying at my feet back then,\u201d he says. It is\u00a0very\u00a0different now. His businesses have ceased. Instead, he raises money for the army, and chips in himself. Anything from drones to generators, from motor vehicles to power banks. Local brigades tell him what they need; he pays for some of it and secures financing for the rest. We ask\u00a0Sapronov\u00a0why he is still here. As a man\u00a0older than\u00a0fighting age, he could leave the country, or at least move to a quieter part of Ukraine. But his mind was clear from the very beginning, he says. His wife asked him the day after the war began what they were going to do. He told her they were staying\u00a0put. \u201cIn my passport it is written that I am Russian by nationality. But I am not Russian, I am Ukrainian,\u201d\u00a0Sapronov says. Hotel manager Olha Sokolenko Olha Sokolenko is not a Kharkiv native either. The hotel manager\u00a0came\u00a0to the city\u00a0from Kyiv 15 years ago. On December 30 last year, she was leading her team at the Kharkiv Palace Hotel, getting ready for a New Year\u2019s Eve party the next day. At 7 p.m., a Russian missile crashed into the building\u2019s fitness center on the 11th floor, exploding three floors down. She shows us a massive hole left by the missile as it passed through a bedroom floor. Fifteen rooms were occupied at the time of the attack, all on lower floors for safety. About 20 staff were on duty. Remarkably, no one was killed and only one person was injured and needed treatment. Olha herself was among the most fortunate. She was right there on the 11th floor when the missile struck, but on the other side of the building. \u201cIt seems my work on this earth isn\u2019t done,\u201d she says wryly, when we suggest she must feel very lucky. The memory will never leave her, though, especially\u00a0the sound of the missile strike.\u00a0\u201cTerrible, like a very strong lightning strike,\u201d\u00a0she recalls. It was only a few hours afterwards that rescuers recovered her phone, covered in dust but still working. There was a load of missed calls, not just from friends and family, but from people all over the world \u2013 one-time guests at the hotel, checking she was OK. Russians hit the building, she says, because they claimed there were important decisions being taken by people inside. In fact, Olha says, there were only civilians in the building \u2013 mostly journalists and people preparing to celebrate New Year with their families. \u201cThis hotel has been my life\u2019s work,\u201d she says. \u201cPeace will come, and guests will return to Kharkiv.\u201d FC Metalist Kharkiv Matviy\u00a0Kolotay\u00a0is 15 years old and his favorite player is Cristiano Ronaldo. It is an opinion widely held among the boys of the academy of FC Metalist Kharkiv, who have piled into a small room after Saturday training to watch the first team in action against Hirnyk Sport. Matviy has been with the club since 2021 but he amazes us when he explains that while he lives in Kharkiv, his family lives in Kremenchuk, about\u00a0140 miles (225 kilometers)\u00a0away in the safer center of the country. \u201cMy parents are worried for me, but the main thing is that I am playing football,\u201d he says. The war is not something he likes to talk about. \u201cMe-ta-list! Me-ta-list!\u201d the boys roar. They are led by Mikhaylo Galushko, one of the coaches. Every club needs a man like him. Someone to get the chant going, a man who claps his hands together with such force you can feel the audio peaking inside your head. FC Metalist play their games in Uzhhorod, the farthest point you can get from Kharkiv without leaving Ukraine. It takes more than a day to get there on the train. The boys shout at the screen like football supporters everywhere, appealing every dodgy decision by the referee. \u201cEven in this difficult time, the children come here, and we give them the attention they deserve. Thanks to sport, thanks to our attention, they are distracted [from the war] and forget about everything that is going on,\u201d\u00a0Galushko\u00a0says. It is no easy task. An air raid siren the day before had lasted the entire day and all training was canceled. If the alarms go off halfway through a session, the boys are taken to the bomb shelter. The banter resumes the moment they are inside. \u201cAll conversations are turned into jokes, so the boys are not afraid.\u201d We tell Galushko that one of the CNN team supports English football club Everton. \u201cAh, you remember, the match?\u201d he says, referring to a UEFA Cup tie between the teams in 2007. \u201cWe let you win!\u201d Had he at any point thought of leaving Ukraine in the last two years? \u201cWe never went anywhere. When the war started, my younger son was at a tournament in Poltava. While everyone was leaving Kharkiv, he was coming back to Kharkiv on an empty train,\u201d\u00a0Galushko\u00a0says. \u201cMy family is all in Kharkiv. Two children, both play football. I do not want to go anywhere. This is my homeland.\u201d Kharkiv\u2019s mayor The city\u2019s mayor\u00a0Ihor Terekhov speaks slowly and quietly, pausing to allow his translator to render\u00a0carefully\u00a0his Ukrainian into English, sentence by sentence. The war started just a few months after he was elected mayor at the end of 2021. We are talking just a few hours after Russia began its latest\u00a0offensive, immediately to the north. What President\u00a0Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky would later that day call a new wave of counteroffensive actions comes after months of increased Russian air strikes on the city. By the end of March, they had knocked out the entire region\u2019s power generating capacity, as well as all its electricity substations. Street lights are now completely switched off and there are rolling blackouts from\u00a0one\u00a0neighborhood to\u00a0another. The underground rail network is still running, one train every 20 minutes. Pre-war, they ran every two to three minutes. Still, it works. For the mayor of Kharkiv, one message matters more than any other: the people of his city are staying put. Russia will not drive them out. \u201cAs we can see [today], the Russian aggressors have intensified their actions on the border in several directions [..] But, despite everything, you can see the city is alive, that no one is running away,\u201d\u00a0Terekhov\u00a0says, through his translator. \u201cThis is the main thing. There is no panic.\u201d Most people though will tell you the city has lost people in recent months. Not like the first few months of the war, when the population shrunk from about 1.5 million to 300,000, before many returned as Ukraine\u2019s fortunes improved later in the year. But some families are\u00a0now\u00a0choosing to move to safety\u00a0again\u00a0as the Russian threat re-emerges. Even so, the mayor shakes his head when we ask him if numbers have declined since the start of the year. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, before\u00a0correcting himself. \u201cThere was a slight decrease. A few people have left. A few others have returned.\u201d Caf\u00e9 Snidanishna A large Hyundai generator sits just inside the door of Caf\u00e9 Snidanishna, which lies about a mile north from the city center. It is off when we arrive because the power in the city is switched on. Co-owner Borys Lomako explains they only really need it to keep the lights and the coffee machine working. The oven is wood fired. It is a gem of a place. We order chicken liver pate, served with red berries, and freshly made bread, toasted. Along with two friends,\u00a0both\u00a0fellow entrepreneurs, he opened the caf\u00e9 three months ago.\u00a0Revenues from some of their other interests, predominantly a confectionery business, help to support it. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a business model, it\u2019s primarily about keeping my life in Kharkiv. To send signals both to Kharkiv residents who stay here that life goes on, and signals to those outside of Kharkiv that Kharkiv is a Ukrainian city and people live here.\u201d Lomako\u00a0explains that he and his partners traveled across the country to collect local recipes and techniques. There is gombovtsi on the menu \u2013 a sweet dough from the\u00a0Carpathian Mountains\u00a0in Ukraine\u2019s far southwest. And kachina kasha - porridge made from rolled millets dipped in egg and flour, from the Naddniprianshchyna region, along the Dnipro River. Preparing the dish is time-consuming,\u00a0Lomako\u00a0says, and that is the point. It takes time. It is hard work. \u201cEven just choosing to eat Ukrainian food means that we are choosing Ukraine,\u201d he says. He articulates the existential threat most Ukrainians feel about Russia\u2019s invasion, the certainty that Russians want to wipe out their history and their culture. When we are talking, a little after\u00a09 a.m., Kharkiv is already on its third air raid siren of the day, and the cross-border offensive is into its second day and making progress. \u201cAs I see it, this is a choice of life. Every day we can choose death or life. And choosing to eat, choosing to go to restaurants, choosing to cook for people is a choice to live, not to die. Yes, this is resistance for me, it is creative resistance.\u201d Dmytro Gurov\u2019s destroyed printing house Walking through the burned-out wreckage of Dmytro Gurov\u2019s 5,000-square-meter printing business is an almost overwhelming experience. Twisted metal girders and air vents, plaster and ceiling tiles gone, all windows blown out. Everywhere, remnants of the puzzles, children\u2019s card games, books and magazines that once rolled out of machines here. Cutting machines, printing machines, laminating machines. A million bits of torn paper. All covered in dust. And the taste of the blast and the fire that followed\u00a0are\u00a0still clear on the tongue, almost two months on. The weapon that did all this was originally designed to sink ships. It flew low around the city, evading air defenders, before ending its flight right here, killing five and wounding 20. We ask\u00a0Gurov\u00a0if\u00a0he is angry over\u00a0what has become of the business he started back in 2007. It would feel like a reasonable response. \u201cIt is not going to help. There is no time to sit around crying and blaming someone for something. The question here is: what do we do next? If we are going to recover, then how?\u201d Government assistance should bring in about\u00a0$200,000, but the cost of the strike runs into millions, he says. In fact, rebuilding began immediately. Employees came in the next day offering to work for nothing. Some machines could be salvaged and the first of those cleaned up and moved to another workspace were working again within a month. \u201cLike a phoenix,\u201d\u00a0Gurov\u00a0says. Kharkiv theater goes underground A small theatre audience watches as the female character on the roof says she is ready to jump. But the man, a stranger, isn\u2019t so sure. \u201cJust look down there, it\u2019s a right mess, there is rubbish everywhere,\u201d he says ironically. The Kharkiv State Theater should be playing in front of 900 people. Now the actors perform in a basement club with just enough space for six rows of audience. Since the start of the year, it has become one of several city institutions forced underground by the war. Schools, too, are slowly going subterranean. Big productions with large casts are\u00a0impossible in such a small space, director Oksana Stetsenko says. But at least they no longer need to pause the play and exit the playhouse whenever the sirens go off. \u201cWe have to adjust, adapt, but still do our job. We must do our job,\u201dStetsenko\u00a0says. She chose the play,\u00a0\u201cSuicide of Loneliness,\u201d\u00a0by Ukrainian playwright Neda Nezhdana, because it is about people making choices. \u201cWe are all individuals.\u201d She is thinking of the soldiers, too. \u201cThere are individuals at the front. They are not a biomass. An individual makes his or her own choice, thinks, draws conclusions, and says to himself or herself: I want beautiful things, I want eternal things, I want peace, I want well-being for my family, for my children.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/19/europe/life-goes-on-in-kharkiv-cmd-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_sport_travis-kelce-harrison-butker-controversy-spt-intl", "text": "Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has spoken about the controversial comments Harrison Butker made at a commencement speech earlier this month, saying he does not agree with \u201cjust about any\u201d of Butker\u2019s views but did \u201ccherish\u201d him as a teammate. In an address to graduates at\u00a0Benedictine College, a small Catholic school in Atchison, Kansas, Butker called Pride Month a \u201cdeadly sin\u201d and said that a woman\u2019s accomplishments in the home are more valuable than any academic or professional goals, among other things. \u201cI cherish him as a teammate. I think Pat [Mahomes] said it best where he is every bit of a great person and a great teammate,\u201d\u00a0Kelce said on the latest episode of the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast he hosts with his brother, Jason. \u201cHe\u2019s treated friends and family that I\u2019ve introduced to him with nothing but respect and kindness and that\u2019s how he treats everyone. When it comes down to his views and what he said at Saint Benedict\u2019s commencement speech, those are his. \u201cI can\u2019t say I agree with the majority of it or just about any of it outside of just him loving his family and his kids and I don\u2019t think that I should judge him by his views, especially his religious views, of how to go about life. That\u2019s just not who I am.\u201d His comments echoed what Chiefs teammate and three-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Mahomes told reporters on Wednesday. Mahomes said that Butker was a \u201cgood person,\u201d despite \u201cnot necessarily agreeing\u201d with his comments. Jason Kelce added: \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be opinions that everybody shares that you\u2019re going to disagree with. \u201cAnd make no mistake about it, a lot of the things he said in his commencement speech are not things that I align myself with. But, he\u2019s giving a commencement speech at a Catholic university, and, shocker, it ended up being a very religious and Catholic speech. \u201cTo me, I can listen to somebody talk and take great value in it, like when he\u2019s talking about the importance of family and the importance that a great mother can make, while also acknowledging that not everybody has to be a homemaker if that\u2019s not what they want to do in life.\u201d Travis Kelce said he was grateful for his \u201cbeautiful upbringing\u201d in Cleveland Heights, surrounded by \u201cdifferent social classes, different religions, different races and ethnicities.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I love Cleveland Heights for what it was,\u201d he added. \u201cIt showed me a broad spectrum, just a broad view of a lot of different walks of life. And I appreciated every single one of those people for different reasons, and I never once had to feel like I needed to judge them, based off of their beliefs.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/sport/travis-kelce-harrison-butker-controversy-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_middleeast_israel-icj-gaza-rafah-south-africa-ruling-intl", "text": "The United Nations\u2019 top court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, further increasing international pressure on Israel over its war against Hamas. \u201cIsrael must immediately halt its military offensive and any other action in Rafah which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part,\u201d Judge Nawaf Salam, president of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), said on Friday. The court considers the humanitarian situation in Rafah to be classified as \u201cdisastrous,\u201d he said, adding that UN officials have indicated that the situation was set to \u201cintensify even further\u201d if the Israeli operation in Rafah continues. Israel began a limited ground offensive in Rafah on May 7, defying calls from the international community, including the United States, not to proceed. More than a million Palestinians were taking shelter in Rafah before Israel started its operation, but the court noted that around 800,000 have since been displaced. Upon entering Rafah, the military\u00a0seized the city\u2019s border crossing\u00a0with Egypt, which has remained shut since. The crossing was a vital entry point for humanitarian aid. The court ordered Israel to open the Rafah crossing for humanitarian assistance and said it had found that the evacuation and living conditions provided by Israel are not \u201csufficient to alleviate the immense risk, which the Palestinian population is exposed\u201d to.  Rulings by the court are final and binding, but the ICJ doesn\u2019t have a mechanism to enforce them, and they have been ignored in the past. Israeli officials have condemned the ICJ\u2019s ruling. Yair Lapid, leader of Israel\u2019s opposition party Yesh Atid, said that \u201cthe fact that the ICJ did not even directly connect the end of the military operation in Rafah to the release of the hostages and to Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against terror is an abject moral failure.\u201d Naftali Bennett, who was the 13th\u00a0Prime Minister of Israel, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201cThe International Court of Justice just provided every terror organization on earth with THE PERFECT METHOD TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER.\u201d Hamas welcomed the order in a statement, but said it had expected it would be for the entire Gaza Strip, emphasizing that the situations in Jabalya and other cities are equally dire and warrant similar attention. South Africa filed an urgent request on May 10 for additional measures against Israel, accusing it of using forced\u00a0evacuation orders\u00a0in the southern Gaza city of Rafah to \u201cendanger rather than protect civilian life.\u201d The request was part of a larger case brought by Pretoria against Israel in which South Africa accuses Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians during the seven-month-long conflict. Israel\u2019s Deputy Attorney General for International Law Gilad Noam denied the allegations in his opening remarks at the ICJ last week and asked the court to \u201crespect the predicament\u201d Israel is in. Two interpretations Following the ruling, a joint statement by the Israel\u2019s National Security Council and Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Friday that Israel \u201chas not carried out and will not carry out military activity in the Rafah area that creates living conditions that could lead to the destruction of the Palestinian civilian population.\u201d In response to other orders by the ICJ, including keeping the Rafah crossing open, the statement said that Israel will \u201ccontinue its efforts to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip\u201d and \u201creduce as much as possible the harm to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip.\u201d Eliav Lieblich, a professor of international law at Tel Aviv University, told CNN that the text of the ruling had some ambiguity. \u201cThe order can be understood in two ways: either that Israel has to halt the offensive in Rafah; or specifically components that may lead to conditions of life that could bring physical destruction,\u201d he said. What is clear, however, is that in the eyes of the court, \u201cthe operation cannot continue in the same way, because it found that as it is now the situation is a risk to the rights protected by the (genocide) Convention,\u201d Lieblich said, adding that it is hard to tell whether Israel will comply with the ruling. \u201cI\u00a0hope that it doesn\u2019t argue that the order means that nothing has to change, because that clearly isn\u2019t the case,\u201d he added. The development comes as Israel faces mounting international and domestic pressure to end the war in Gaza. This week, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC), a separate court in The Hague, sought arrest warrants for Hamas leaders as well as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. Families of Israeli hostages held in the territory also stepped up pressure on Netanyahu to bring the captives home, releasing graphic footage of female members of the Israel Defense Forces before they were abducted. Unclear how US will respond It is unclear how the US, Israel\u2019s closest ally, will respond to the ICJ\u2019s order. The Biden administration has spoken out strongly against the genocide case against Israel, but it has repeatedly warned Israel that Washington will not support a major ground offensive in Rafah unless it sees a credible plan to ensure the safety of civilians. This month, the US halted arms shipments to Israel for the first time out of fear that they could be used in Rafah to harm civilians. In an interview with CNN, US President Joe Biden acknowledged that American bombs had been used to kill civilians in Gaza, in a stark recognition of the US\u2019 role in the war. The US is Israel\u2019s biggest weapons supplier. The move by the ICJ is likely to add to mounting pressure on Israel to scale down its war in Gaza, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that his country will defend itself even if \u201cforced to stand alone.\u201d Israel says that Rafah is the last bastion of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that led an attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. Israel\u2019s subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 35,000 people, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. \u2018Unprecedented\u2019 pressure The international pressure facing Israel is \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, told CNN. \u201cBecause this war is unprecedented, and the way Israel conducts the war is unprecedented.\u201d While there has always been criticism of some of Israel\u2019s actions, such as the expansion of settlements, \u201cthis is on a different scale, a different universe altogether,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current Israeli government does its best to make Israel a pariah state.\u201d The ruling could also undermine Israel\u2019s own judiciary, according to Neve Gordon, professor of human rights law at Queen Mary University of London. In response to the ICC\u2019s decision to seek arrest warrants against top Israeli officials, Israel\u2019s Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and State Attorney Amit Aisman were cited by the Times of Israel as backing the Israeli military and said the judicial system is capable of handling such cases. \u201c(The) ruling would serve yet another blow to Israel\u2019s judicial system, and particularly the attorney general and the Supreme Court, since the subtext would be that it is not doing its job in ensuring that Israel abide by international law,\u201d said Gordon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/middleeast/israel-icj-gaza-rafah-south-africa-ruling-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_sport_ncaa-settlement", "text": "The National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Power Five conferences have agreed to a settlement, paving the way to allow schools to pay student-athletes, a profound moment ushering in a new age in college sports. The NCAA, the governing body for college sports, and the leaders of the Big Ten, Southeastern, Pac-12, Atlantic Coast and Big 12 conferences\u00a0announced\u00a0the settlement Thursday night. According to multiple reports citing unnamed sources, the agreement\u00a0to settle\u00a0three antitrust cases includes the payment of more than $2.7 billion in damages to past and current student-athletes. Per ESPN, sources said the parties have agreed to a revenue-sharing plan which will allow each school to share up to \u201croughly $20 million per year with its athletes.\u201d All Division I athletes who have played since 2016 are eligible to receive a share. In exchange, any athletes who receive\u00a0a share cannot sue the NCAA for other potential antitrust violations and drop their complaints in the three antitrust cases \u2013 House v. NCAA, Hubbard v. NCAA and Carter v. NCAA,\u00a0according to ESPN. Reports added Judge Claudia Wilken, who is presiding over the three antitrust cases, must\u00a0still\u00a0approve the settlement terms, which could take several months and once approved, schools can begin revenue sharing in the fall of 2025. The settlement, if accepted by Wilken, represents a turning point in college athletics, which have traditionally competed under the guise of amateurism, allowing a seedy underbelly of hidden payments and compensation to flourish. Numerous college programs have been punished by the NCAA for their players being compensated in some way for their exploits on the field, from thousands of dollars being paid to star players under the table to a coach buying a recruit a hamburger on a visit. As the business of college sports took off, the veil of amateurism had begun to seem absurd to many observers: Schools and conferences began raking in millions upon millions of dollars, coaches were preaching austerity and amateurism before leaving their players to take a new job with a massive pay raise and TV networks helped reshape the landscape of the sport to maximize their own profits. At the same time, the players on the field were being paid nothing, even though they were the ones playing in the games dring what had become a multibillion-dollar industry. The House vs. NCAA lawsuit sought to change it. Filed by Grant House and Sedona Prince, two college athletes, against the NCAA and the Power Five conferences \u2013 the Pac-12, Big Ten, Big 12, Southeastern and Atlantic Coast \u2013 the lawsuit focused on the eight-year, $8.8 billion extension the NCAA signed to broadcast coverage of the March Madness basketball tournament, as well as seeking backdated damages for payments the suit calls wrongly withheld. While an NCAA rule change allowed for players to be paid for the use of their name, image and likeness, often through sponsorships and advertisements, the suit argued the NCAA restricts how much student athletes can earn outside employment. For example, the suit says one NCAA bylaw, regulating jobs athletes can hold at their universities,\u00a0\u201cspecifically prohibits athletes from receiving any remuneration for value or utility that the student-athlete may have for the (outside) employer because of the publicity, reputation, fame or personal following that he or she has obtained because of athletics ability.\u201d Ohio State University Athletics shared a message from NCAA president Charlie Baker on its website Friday providing details on the settlement agreement. The message was sent to all Division I member schools, the NCAA told CNN. \u201cWe have managed to negotiate the total back damages for these cases down to nearly $2.78 billion, to be paid over 10 years, equating to approximately $280 million annually,\u201d Baker\u2019s statement reads. \u201cTo address this obligation, we have developed a plan where the NCAA will contribute $1.2 billion over 10 years, representing 42% of the total back damages. The remaining 58% will be distributed among the Division I conferences based on their distributions over the past nine years,\u201d the statement from Baker continues. \u201cThis translates to an annual contribution of $165 million, or a 20% total reduction in distributions.\u201d In a joint statement, the leaders of the five conferences and the NCAA said they hoped the settlement could be an important moment in the reform of the college sports world. \u201cThis settlement is also a road map for college sports leaders and Congress to ensure this uniquely American institution can continue to provide unmatched opportunity for millions of students. All of Division I made today\u2019s progress possible, and we all have work to do to implement the terms of the agreement as the legal process continues. We look forward to working with our various student-athlete leadership groups to write the next chapter of college sports,\u201d read the statement, which was attributed to Baker, ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips, Big Ten Commissioner Tony Petitti, Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark, Pac-12 Commissioner Teresa Gould and SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey. While it\u2019s unclear what immediate effect the settlement will have on college sports, it\u2019s been clear for some time a reckoning was coming \u2014 particularly in the wake of the rule change around NIL compensation in 2021. The rule change, combined with a softening of the transfer rules, have led to players bouncing from school to school in search of a better NIL deal when in the past they would be forced to stay at their original school for their four years of eligibility or risk sitting out a year following a transfer. Athletes\u2019 increased use of the transfer portal, the commissioners said, has become problematic in college sports, particularly for student-athletes\u2019 quest to get a degree. They said college boosters have taken advantage of the current patchwork of laws to help their universities recruit the top athletes by promising big paydays \u2014 to the detriment of colleges in other states forced to play by a different set of rules. The lack of regulation around NIL has made for a sort of Wild West atmosphere in college sports the NCAA will now hope to curtail in some way. The reported revenue-sharing plan could help smaller schools that may not have rich NIL collectives stay on a more level playing field with the big-name schools that do.

{"id": "travel_trans-siberian-railway-romance-chance-encounters", "text": "Marie-Claire Martineau couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Elaine Comerford. It was late summer 1991. Marie-Claire was back in her home country of France after a couple of years working in Japan and a stint traveling across Europe by rail. Now Marie-Claire was 29 and felt listless \u2013 uncertain what the future held, uncertain where she might live, uncertain what she might do with her life. She played back her time with Elaine like a movie in her head. Those first moments together on the Trans-Siberian railway, speeding through Eastern Europe. Finding one another in Budapest. Sharing dreams and growing closer in Vienna. Now, Elaine was just a disembodied voice on the other end of a landline, a signature on a scrawled postcard with a Boston, Massachusetts, postmark. A couple of months passed. One day, Marie-Claire received a letter from Elaine explaining she was leaving her parents\u2019 home in Boston and moving to New York City. \u201cWhat are we?\u201d Elaine\u2019s letter read. \u201cWhat are we going to do? Are we going to continue this?\u201d All through their travels together Marie-Claire and Elaine lived in the moment, too busy enjoying the now to contemplate the future \u2013 especially when translating their vacation romance into the real world felt near impossible. Marie-Claire read and reread Elaine\u2019s words. It still felt impossible. On one of their grainy transatlantic phone calls, Elaine broached the topic directly \u2013 maybe Marie-Claire could come to the US? Maybe they could make a proper go of what they\u2019d started? Marie-Claire paused. Then she said no. Hanging up, she told herself once again that what she\u2019d shared with Elaine was \u201cjust a vacation romance.\u201d But that night, Marie-Claire couldn\u2019t sleep. \u201cI thought about it, and I missed her so much,\u201d Marie-Claire tells CNN Travel today. \u201cThe next day I bought my flight and I flew to New York to see her.\u201d First meeting Marie-Claire and Elaine\u2019s story first started on a bus in Beijing, China. The bus was ferrying travelers to the train station to board the Trans-Siberian railway. The Trans-Siberian railway spans 5,000 miles of track, comprising several routes including the Trans-Mongolian line, which winds from Beijing to Moscow via Mongolia. Marie-Claire and Elaine were among two dozen or so travelers who\u2019d signed up to the same organized tour \u201cstopping in Mongolia for a week and then taking the Trans-Siberian train all the way to Russia,\u201d as Marie-Claire recalls it. Elaine happened to board the bus first, with a gang of friends in tow. Like Marie-Claire, Elaine had been working in Japan for a while, teaching English. Then she\u2019d entered what she calls an \u201cin-between phase\u201d \u2013 traveling with friends from east Asia through Europe. \u201cYou know, young 20s, seeing a little bit of the world and enjoying some time with friends. That\u2019s where I was,\u201d Elaine tells CNN Travel today. Elaine and her friends were excitedly chatting on the bus when Elaine spotted Marie-Claire for the first time. She was instantly struck by this blonde stranger. \u201cMarie-Claire got on the bus and was walking down the middle, towards the back,\u201d Elaine recalls. \u201cI thought, \u2018Hmm, okay. This is somebody I might want to speak to.\u201d Marie-Claire was also traveling with a friend \u2013 kind of. \u201cShe was an ex-girlfriend, actually, although at that point it was platonic,\u201d Marie-Claire explains. Flirting in Mongolia As the travelers decamped the bus and boarded the train, introductions were made. Elaine and Marie-Claire spoke to one another for the first time. \u201cI don\u2019t remember exactly what the first conversations were,\u201d says Elaine. \u201cJust probably \u2018getting to know you\u2019 comments \u2013 \u2018Where are you coming from?\u2019 \u2013 And I\u2019m sure we talked about Japan at some point, because we\u2019d both lived in Japan.\u201d On board the train, the entire tour party stuck together \u201cgetting to know each other, hanging out, playing some cards,\u201d as Elaine recalls. Once the group arrived in Mongolia, they were split in two. Elaine maneuvered herself to make sure she ended up in Marie-Claire\u2019s half. Then over that week exploring Mongolia, Marie-Claire and Elaine grew closer. The polite pleasantries on the train somehow seamlessly switched to in-jokes, laughter and constantly gravitating to one another\u2019s side. \u201cWe started flirting,\u201d says Marie-Claire. Back on the train, over the several days traveling from Mongolia to Russia, the spark between Marie-Claire and Elaine became impossible to ignore. \u201cWe were on the train, going through Siberia when we first kissed,\u201d says Elaine. Elaine was sharing a train car with two of her friends. They were in the bottom bunk, asleep, while Elaine was in the top, restless. \u201cThen Marie came to my bunk,\u201d Elaine recalls. \u201cWe kissed,\u201d says Marie-Claire. They both knew \u201cit was heading that way,\u201d as Elaine puts it. And from there, Marie-Claire and Elaine were pretty inseparable. They stole moments together whenever they could \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t always easy to do so. \u201cYou\u2019re on a train with a lot of people,\u201d Marie-Claire recalls. \u201cSo to find a moment alone was very hard \u2013 it was literally six days on a train.\u201d Still, falling for each other as the train sped through the Siberian countryside was exciting. \u201cThe train was fun,\u201d says Elaine. Each time the train pulled up at a station, the travelers would lean out the windows and purchase food and drink from local sellers. At one station, Elaine and one of her friends got off to buy something. Then the train unexpectedly started to leave the station. \u201cSo the train started pulling away,\u201d recalls Elaine. \u201cAnd me and my friend Steve were running for the train and jumped on, we made it.\u201d When the train arrived in Moscow, locals met the travelers at the station, offering rooms for accommodation. It was an \u201cold-school version of Airbnb,\u201d says Marie-Claire. Elaine, Marie-Claire and their friends all opted for the same accommodation \u2013 a tiny apartment where the host squeezed in eight mattresses on the floor. Marie-Claire and Elaine took mattresses next to each other. \u201cWe lay next to each other,\u201d says Marie-Claire. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got a room full of mattresses, you can\u2019t do much.\u201d But in the night, Marie-Claire and Elaine reached out across the dusty floor to hold hands. By then, the two knew \u201cwe had this romance that was budding,\u201d says Elaine. But Marie-Claire and Elaine didn\u2019t tell anyone else about their feelings for one another. \u201cWe\u2019d all have dinner at a restaurant and we would meet in the bathroom to kiss,\u201d recalls Marie-Claire. \u201cI\u2019m sure it was so obvious,\u201d says Elaine, laughing at the memory. They kept their connection on the down low in part because Marie-Claire was traveling with her ex-girlfriend. And it was 1991 \u2013 It was \u201ca different time back then,\u201d as Elaine puts it. \u201cSame sex relationships weren\u2019t as accepted,\u201d she says. \u201cMy friends wouldn\u2019t have cared. But at that point, it was still a big thing to come out to people.\u201d Back home in the US Elaine was only out to \u201cclose friends.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody in my family knew at that point,\u201d she says. Marie-Claire also wasn\u2019t open about her sexuality at that time. \u201cNobody knew I was gay,\u201d she says. Next travels After the organized tour concluded in Moscow, the travelers were left to their own devices. Some went home. Meanwhile, Elaine and her friend Diane headed to Germany, and then visited Turkey and Greece. Marie-Claire briefly returned to France, then reunited with Elaine and Diane in Budapest, Hungary. By then, Elaine had told Diane about her relationship with Marie-Claire. \u201cDiane knew at this point,\u201d says Elaine. \u201cSo we traveled a bit together. And then Diane went back home. And Marie-Claire and I went on to Vienna.\u201d In Austria, Marie-Claire and Elaine were alone together for the first time. It was thrilling and terrifying. \u201cIt was the first time that we were going to be just the two of us,\u201d says Elaine. \u201cIt was exciting to be able to finally have some time to ourselves. But we were also nervous.\u201d In Vienna, Marie-Claire and Elaine grew even closer. They both felt like they were falling for each other. But there was no long-term plan. \u201cIt was very much in the moment,\u201d says Elaine. \u201cYou know, \u2018Let\u2019s meet up and have fun and travel around.\u2019\u201d So Elaine returned to the US, and Marie-Claire to France. That\u2019s when the period of letter-writing and grainy phone calls started. And then came Marie-Claire\u2019s spontaneous decision to travel to New York and find Elaine. She booked her flight, a piece of paper with Elaine\u2019s Queens address in her pocket. Elaine told Marie-Claire to meet her in Manhattan, where she was now working. But when she landed Marie-Claire struggled to figure out how to phone Elaine, unfamiliar with the US area code system. She ended up deciding to travel to the Queens address in the hope she\u2019d find Elaine waiting there. Meanwhile, Elaine wondered what had happened. \u201cThree hours later, she ended up at the door,\u201d says Elaine. \u201cShe had somehow managed to get from the airport to Midtown, and then managed to get on the train and find this address in Queens.\u201d In a pre-Google-Maps age, this was pretty impressive. \u201cAnd so I moved in with Elaine. I just stayed,\u201d says Marie-Claire. She\u2019d brought next to nothing with her, but Marie-Claire was used to living out of a backpack. \u201cJust as long as I have enough underwear and bras,\u201d she says. From there, Marie-Claire and Elaine settled in a New York routine together. They loved living together. And as time went on \u2013 as Marie-Claire tried to work out a way to stay in the US\u00a0permanently \u2013 the couple started working together too. They ended up starting a vacation rental company together. In time, Marie-Claire got a real estate license and a work visa. When Marie-Claire rang her parents in France and told them she had no plans to return, they didn\u2019t try and convince her otherwise. Marie-Claire\u2019s German mother and French father met abroad, and they\u2019d always encouraged Marie-Claire to travel the world and embrace adventure. But Marie-Claire still wasn\u2019t comfortable telling her parents that she was staying in New York because she\u2019d fallen in love for a woman, although over time her parents realized the two were together. As for Elaine, she decided when Marie-Claire moved in that she would tell her parents they were together. She also shared the news with her extended network of New York friends. \u201cSoon she met a lot of my friends in the city, and at some point met my family,\u201d recalls Elaine. The friends who\u2019d traveled on the Trans-Siberian railway with Elaine and Marie-Claire were especially delighted for them \u2013 and admitted that they\u2019d suspected what was going on the whole time. A life together Over the next several years, Marie Claire and Elaine\u2019s real estate business grew, becoming a company called Maison Internationale. Working together came easily to the couple. \u201cEven at the end of the day, even if we\u2019d been in the office together, we\u2019d still have something to talk about at the end of the day, because she would do different things than I do,\u201d says Marie-Claire. Elaine and Marie-Claire were content with their life together. They \u201cnever thought about getting married,\u201d says Elaine. It was off the cards. And for similar reasons, Marie-Claire and Elaine didn\u2019t think they\u2019d ever have a child together. But as time moved on, society started to shift. Adopting a child as a same-sex couple became a possibility. In the summer of 2006, Elaine and Marie-Claire were on vacation together in Provincetown, Massachusetts, celebrating 15 years since they first met. \u201cAnd we got the call on our anniversary that a baby boy was born, and that the mother had chosen us,\u201d says Marie-Claire. \u201cWe drove the next morning to meet him.\u201d Marie-Claire and Elaine welcomed their son, Marcello, that year. They loved becoming parents and committed to passing on a love of travel to Marcello, taking him to a different destination every year. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to Thailand together. We\u2019ve been to Vietnam, we\u2019ve been to Colombia, Ecuador, down to the Galapagos, to Europe and across the United States,\u201d says Elaine. In 2015, when gay marriage became legal across all US states Marie-Claire and Elaine decided to get married. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a priority for us,\u201d says Elaine, of marriage. \u201cAnd then once it became federal, I think things changed. It was like, \u2018Oh, we can get married. So we decided to.\u2019\u201d The wedding took place on Anna Maria Island, Florida, on a glorious sandy beach, with some 70 guests in attendance. \u201cIt was fun and emotional, but mostly fun,\u201d says Elaine. Over the course of the wedding celebrations there were several nods to Marie-Claire and Elaine\u2019s origin story. Each table had a little train car as the centerpiece. At the reception, one of the friends who was on the train with Marie-Claire and Elaine when they met wrote a poem about their romance. \u201cThat was special,\u201d says Elaine. \u201cIt all kind of tied it back.\u201d The wedding day poem is framed and hangs on Elaine and Marie-Claire\u2019s wall to this day. \u2018An adventure of the heart\u2019 Today, Elaine and Marie-Claire split their time between New York and Florida. Their son is now 18 and recently graduated high school. The family still love traveling together. It\u2019s 32 years since Elaine and Marie-Claire shared the kiss on the train that kickstarted their romance. \u201cI believe it was meant to be,\u201d says Marie-Cliare. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer of past lives and that chance encounters happen. We most probably knew each other in our past life. And we found each other again.\u201d As for Elaine, she thinks their story began with a \u201ctravel adventure\u201d but it was also \u201can adventure of the heart\u201d \u2013 an adventure that\u2019s continued over the past three decades. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I take for granted,\u201d says Elaine of their years of happiness. Elaine, Marie-Claire and their son Marcello have a family motto, based around their shared initials, EMC. The motto is \u201cEvery moment counts.\u201d That mantra is interwoven into their love story, says Elaine. \u201cOur story has evolved over the years from when we first met and to where we are now,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s just not taking that for granted. And remembering all of the different pieces of your life, and your times together that make you who you are today, as both individuals and as a couple.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/trans-siberian-railway-romance-chance-encounters/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_africa_earthranger-track-wildlife-kenya-spc", "text": "It\u2019s early morning in Sera Community Conservancy in Northern Kenya and sunlight beats down across this expansive semi-arid landscape. Birds calling and boots crunching are the only sounds for miles as a team led by Kenyan wildlife veterinarian Dr. Mukami Ruoro-Oundo carefully tracks white rhinos \u2014 the first of their kind to be found here in Samburu County. Once common in the area, by the early 1990s Northern Kenya\u2019s rhino population was decimated by poaching. But the country\u2019s black rhino population has more than doubled since 1989, and by December 2022 there were 1,900 black rhinos and white rhinos in total, according to Kenya Wildlife Services. Sera Conservancy has championed the country\u2019s community-led rhino conservation efforts. In 2015 it established East Africa\u2019s first community rhino sanctuary with the introduction of 10 critically endangered black rhinos. Today, that number has grown to 21 black rhinos which freely roam across 107 square kilometers (41 square miles) of designated sanctuary land, and in February 2024, they were joined by four white rhinos from the nearby Lewa Conservancy. As she searches on foot, Dr. Ruoro-Oundo spots two of the female white rhinos. One, called Sarah, looks heavily pregnant but as the vet creeps closer she notices something is very wrong. Mindful of not encroaching too long on the rhinos\u2019 territory and reluctant to intervene unnecessarily, she opts for a different approach; through a conservation technology tool called EarthRanger she can monitor Sarah\u2019s movements in real time from a distance.\u00a0 Prior to translocation, each of the four white rhinos was fitted with a GPS tag in its horns and ears, which sends a real-time location to remote devices like mobile phones, or to the conservancy\u2019s operations center, where Dr. Ruoro-Oundo is able to monitor Sarah\u2019s location and movements. As EarthRanger\u2019s co-founder Jake Wall tells CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s exactly like a \u2018Find my Friends\u2019 for rhino.\u201d Sparse internet connectivity means Dr. Ruoro-Oundo cannot get a clear signal from Sarah\u2019s transmitter but thankfully Sarah is not alone; a female rhino named Arot has never left her side and through Arot\u2019s transmitter Dr. Ruoro-Oundo can see that Sarah has barely moved in hours, suggesting her condition is deteriorating. By using a drone to take photos of her, the team is able to confirm that Sarah urgently needs help. \u201cWe noticed she has a fecal impaction, it was quite huge and had made the rectal and vulvar area swollen,\u201d says Dr. Ruoro-Oundo. \u201cShe\u2019s in a lot of pain because she could not put down her tail, and you could see she was a bit sluggish, she really wanted to spend her time lying down. So in such a case we really need to intervene for her comfort, to relieve her of the distress and the pain.\u201d An emergency intervention is immediately put into action, led by Kenya Wildlife Services and Sera Conservancy\u2019s management and rangers. Air, ground and additional veterinary support are mobilized within hours \u2014 potentially saving not only Sarah\u2019s life but that of her unborn calf too. For Dr. Ruoro-Oundo, the key to safeguarding Kenya\u2019s wildlife is a balance between community and technology. \u201cI think you cannot separate technology from conservation in the future,\u201d she says.\u201d The human element can never be removed, but technology will always come to assist where we cannot reach.\u201d A global effort Now used in 70 countries, EarthRanger\u2019s story started in Kenya when co-founder Wall was researching elephants there. \u201cIn about 2012, we had a real crisis with poaching in Kenya, so we wanted a way that we could pick up on elephants that were getting killed, and the sign for us was that the collar stopped moving for more than about five or six hours, which is the longest sort of period that an elephant rests for,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I wrote the algorithm that could work out whether an elephant had stopped moving or not, and then (the collar) would send an SMS if it had. So that was kind of the beginning.\u201d He adds that the system has evolved quite significantly since then, and Sarah is one of 9,000 animals \u2014 including elephants, lions, giraffe, tortoises, sea turtles and 1,200 rhinos \u2014 that EarthRanger is currently tracking in Kenya alone. Wall says the system can integrate data from more than 100 different devices \u2014 \u201canything from elephant trackers to ear tags for rhino, to collars for lions, tail tags (for giraffes), devices that glue onto the shell of a turtle.\u201d It can also receive information from sources such as vehicle trackers, satellites, and remote sensing alerts for things like deforestation and fire. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling it all into one platform, where it can be readily visualized, analyzed and then acted upon,\u201d Wall adds. \u201cAnd all of that\u2019s giving the operators and managers a bird\u2019s eye view of the situation as it\u2019s happening, with real-time tools.\u201d According to the EarthRanger, all of these devices are designed to be lightweight, durable and inconspicuous ensuring they don\u2019t impact on the animals\u2019 natural behavior or cause them discomfort. For rhinos, Dr. Ruoro-Oundo says that attaching a tracker is the equivalent sensation of a human getting their ears pierced. Samuel Lekimaroro, a wildlife protection manager for the Northern Rangelands Trust, which includes Sera Conservancy, uses this kind of data to live-track terrestrial and marine wildlife across 6.5 million hectares. For Lekimaroro it has become a powerful tool in translocating wildlife, data collection and security operations, including identifying hotspots for human-wildlife conflict. \u201cThanks to EarthRanger, trophy poaching has been on a steady decline for the last five years, from a high of 120 elephants poached in 2012, to zero in the last four years in (our) member conservancies,\u201d he says. Wall says its potential to securely collect and share data from different EarthRanger sites from across the world is revolutionary. \u201cIf organizations are doing, say, joint patrolling, or monitoring of a species, then they can also share that information,\u201d he says. \u201cBy storing information on EarthRanger we can pull that data from different sites and combine it in ways that was never possible before. So it\u2019s really enabling the analysis and the reporting in a way that just never existed before.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/earthranger-track-wildlife-kenya-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2013_07_26_weather_mount-st-helens-fast-facts", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at Mount St. Helens, the most active volcano in the Cascade Mountains in Washington. Facts Mount St. Helens is located in Washington, about 55 miles northeast of Portland, Oregon, and 95 miles south of Seattle.  It is administered by the National Forest Service, not the National Park Service.  Over the last 500 years, Mount St. Helens has had at least four major explosive eruptions and many minor eruptions. Mount St. Helens was named by Commander George Vancouver for British diplomat Alleyne Fitzherbert, whose title was Baron St. Helens.  Timeline 1792-1794 - The mountain is named while Commander Vancouver is surveying the northern Pacific coast. 1835 - Is first recognized as a volcano. 1857-1980 - Is inactive. May 18, 1980 - Erupts. Fifty-seven people are killed. Damage caused by the blast costs $1.1 billion. Hot ash causes forest fires. Snow melt from the top of the mountain causes floods. Volcanic ash spreads across the Northwest. More than 900,000 tons of ash are cleaned up from areas around Washington. 1980-1986 - Many small eruptions occur. September 2004 - Several days of unusual seismic activity lead seismologists to believe that an explosion resulting from steam buildup is likely to occur. October 2004 - Several small steam and ash explosions occur. March 8, 2005 - Releases a column of smoke and ash nearly six miles high, leaving a plume visible for more than 50 miles. January 2008 - Eruptions that have occured continously since October 2004 cease. July 2014 - Final preparations begin for what geophysicists call the \u201cequivalent of a combined ultrasound and CAT scan\u201d of the inside of the volcano. The joint project by scientists at Rice University, the University of Washington, the University of Texas at El Paso and others involves placing 3,500 seismic sensors around the volcano. The project will take four years and aims to improve volcanic monitoring and advance warning systems. November 3, 2015 - Scientists investigating the interior of the volcano present the first results at the Geological Society of America convention, saying there is not only a magma chamber directly below Mount St. Helens, there are other chambers east of the mountain that appear to be connected, with magma flowing between them.  Spring 2016 - Over the course of eight weeks, more than 130 small earthquakes occur beneath the surface of Mount St. Helens. October 2018 - Ranks No. 2 on the US Geological Survey\u2019s report of the most threatening volcanoes in the United States. The volcano is deemed a \u201cvery high threat\u201d based on hazards posed to people and infrastructure.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2013/07/26/weather/mount-st-helens-fast-facts/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_asia_singapore-airlines-flight-spinal-injuries-intl", "text": "More than 20 people aboard a Singapore Airlines flight that hit severe turbulence on Tuesday remain in intensive care with spinal, brain and skull injuries, according to a Bangkok hospital that treated some of the passengers. Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in the Thai capital is treating 22 patients with spine and spinal cord issues, six with skull and brain injuries, and another 13 for bone, muscle or soft tissue complaints, its director Adinun Kittiratanapaibool told reporters on Thursday. The doctor added that 17 patients had undergone surgery, including procedures from stitches to spinal operations. One person died in the incident. Passengers who spoke to the media after the plane made an emergency landing in Bangkok described how some passengers and crew were thrown around the cabin, their heads smashing into the overhead baggage cabins, and seeing people in shock with bloody wounds on their faces. Josh Silverstone, one of the passengers on the Singapore Airlines flight, described feeling \u201chappy to be alive\u201d as he was leaving the hospital on Wednesday evening. Speaking with journalists on his way out, the 24-year-old British citizen said he had suffered a cut on his eye and a chipped tooth in the turbulence, but that several passengers were in a much worse physical state than he is. Silverstone described the aftermath of the emergency landing in Bangkok, saying he started vomiting,\u00a0which prompted him to look for medical care. Flight SQ321 from London to Singapore was cruising at 37,000 feet on Tuesday when the plane\u00a0dropped sharply before climbing\u00a0several hundred feet, according to flight tracking data. It then repeatedly dipped and ascended for about a minute. Many passengers were having breakfast at the time of the incident. Video and images from inside the aircraft after its emergency landing in Bangkok showed the extent of the damage, with overhead compartments smashed open and emergency oxygen air masks dangling above the seats. A photo of one galley showed a section of the ceiling open with parts of the plane\u2019s interior hanging down. Trays, containers, plastic bottles and hot beverage pots can be seen strewn across the floor. After the incident, the plane \u2013 which was carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew \u2013 was diverted to Bangkok, where ambulances and emergency response teams were waiting. Those injured on the flight included citizens from Australia, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Spain, the United States and Ireland, the hospital previously said. Of the total 104 passengers who were reported injured on the flight, 55 people remain in hospital. A 73-year-old British man with an existing heart condition died on board, though hospital officials haven\u2019t confirmed his cause of death. The man was later identified as Geoff Kitchen, who was described as \u201calways a gentleman with the utmost honesty and integrity\u201d by the Thornbury Musical Theatre Group, an establishment where he worked for more than 35 years. Of the passengers and crew on board the original flight, 143 were flown to Singapore on a relief flight sent by Singapore Airlines on Wednesday morning.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/asia/singapore-airlines-flight-spinal-injuries-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_21_middleeast_israel-netanyahu-interview-icc-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied allegations that he was starving Palestinians in Gaza as a method of war in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday, saying an arrest warrant application currently under review in the International Criminal Court (ICC) is based on a \u201cpack of lies.\u201d ICC prosecutor Karim Khan announced Monday that he had requested arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders and two Israeli politicians \u2013 Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s Defense Minister Yoav Gallant \u2013 on allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the October 7 attacks in Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza. Khan said the accusations against Netanyahu and Gallant include \u201ccausing extermination, causing starvation as a method of war, including the denial of humanitarian relief supplies, deliberately targeting civilians in conflict.\u201d Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu called Khan a \u201crogue prosecutor that has put false charges and created false symmetries that are both dangerous and false\u201d and insisted that Israel has been allowing food and medical aid to enter Gaza, where aid groups say that the blockaded Palestinian enclave is currently at risk of famine. Israel has allowed 20,000 trucks of aid into Gaza, Netanyahu said \u2013 a fraction of what would have entered in the same period under normal times. Israel\u2019s ongoing siege of Gaza, following Hamas\u2019 October 7 terror attacks, has reached its seventh month and left more than 34,000 people dead. Serious questions about the Israeli military\u2019s long-term strategy have been raised both inside and outside of Israel after the Israeli military sent troops back into areas of northern Gaza, an area it had previously declared clear of Hamas. Last week, Israel\u2019s defense chief Gallant\u00a0called on Netanyahu\u00a0to publicly rule out Israeli governance over the Gaza Strip and to lay out his\u00a0post-war plans for civilian rule in Gaza, warning that he opposes Israeli rule in the Palestinian enclave. When Netanyahu was asked by Tapper if he would rule out the Israeli occupation of Gaza, the Israeli politician said that \u201cresettling\u201d the Palestinian territory was out of the question. \u201cYou mean resettling Gaza? Yeah. It was never in the cards, and I said so openly [and] some of my constituents are not happy about it, but that\u2019s my position.\u201d The prime minister also reaffirmed his commitment to eradicating Hamas, which governs Gaza, before considering demilitarizing the Strip, in the interview. With more than 100 hostages still believed to be held in Gaza, pressure has been growing for a deal that would see hostages released in exchange for a ceasefire. But when asked about public polling showing that a majority of Israelis believe freeing hostages is a higher priority than military action, Netanyahu said you could not have one without the other. \u201cMilitary action that we take against Hamas is in fact the way to get these hostages because without military pressure, basically, without, you know, squeezing them, Hamas is not going to give up anything,\u201d he told Tapper. Netanyahu is deeply unpopular in Israel, where he is also facing an ongoing corruption trial. Critics have accused the Prime Minister of being beholden to members of his far-right coalition and prolonging the war to maintain his grip on power. Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu rejected accusations that he avoids Israeli media in favor of international press, saying he has done up to 20 press conferences with Israeli journalists. \u201cThat\u2019s simply not true,\u201d he said. \u201cI speak to them and I speak to you and I welcome the opportunity to tell the truth and dispel the lies in both in both mediums.\u201d \u2018No equivalence\u2019 The ICC\u2019s application for warrants over the war in Gaza marked the first time the international court has targeted the top leader of a close ally of the United States. Israel and the US are not members of the ICC, but the court\u00a0has said that it\u00a0has\u00a0jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court\u2019s founding principles in 2015. A panel of ICC judges will now consider Khan\u2019s application for the arrest warrants. An ICC warrant would compel more than 100 member-nations of the court to arrest Netanyahu if he traveled in their territory. France was among the countries that have supported the ICC decision alongside international rights groups. Human rights organization Amnesty International has\u00a0hailed the arrest warrant request as a\u00a0\u201ccrucial step towards justice.\u201d But Israel\u2019s allies have roundly condemned\u00a0Khan\u2019s\u00a0move, with US President Joe Biden calling it \u201coutrageous.\u201d\u00a0\u201cThere is no equivalence - none - between Israel and Hamas,\u201d\u00a0Biden said.\u00a0\u00a0Several US lawmakers have threatened to levy sanctions against the ICC, and\u00a0Secretary of State Antony\u00a0Blinken\u00a0has said\u00a0he is open to legislative action against the court. The\u00a0Biden administration said earlier this month\u00a0that\u00a0it is \u201creasonable to assess\u201d that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0in ways that are \u201cinconsistent\u201d with international humanitarian law \u2013 but\u00a0stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law. Speaking to Tapper, Netanyahu likened himself to President Franklin Roosevelt, claiming the arrest warrants were like putting Nazi leader Adolf Hitler on the docks alongside the American wartime president who oversaw the US\u2019s mobilization\u00a0during World War\u00a0II. Khan previously told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour that he had received international pressure over his investigation of Israel. \u201cThis court is built for Africa and for thugs like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,\u201d Khan described one senior leader telling him. This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/middleeast/israel-netanyahu-interview-icc-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_middleeast_palestinian-statehood-spain-norway-ireland-intl", "text": "Ireland, Spain and Norway have announced plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state next week, in a move that is likely to bolster the global Palestinian cause but further strain relations between Europe and Israel. The three European nations say their landmark decision is the best way to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, but it sparked swift condemnation from Israel, as its foreign minister ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors from those countries. Most of the world already recognizes Palestinian statehood. More than 140 out of 193 member states of the United Nations have made their recognition official. But only some nations in the 27-member European Union are among them. Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris told a Wednesday news conference in Dublin: \u201cToday, Ireland, Norway and Spain are announcing that we recognize the state of Palestine. Each of us will now undertake whatever national steps are necessary to give effect to that decision.\u201d \u201cThere is never a wrong time to do the right thing,\u201d Harris later said, speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiana Amanpour on Thursday. \u201cIt was my government\u2019s preferred position to recognize a two-state solution as part of a peace process to bring that about, but sadly, unfortunately, such a comprehensive peace settlement now seems, in many ways, further away than it has ever been,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe believe you can\u2019t say you\u2019re in favor of a two-state solution and not recognize the very existence of two states,\u201d he added. The recognition will come into force in all three countries on May 28, according to Irish Foreign Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. Norway\u2019s\u00a0Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said that a Palestinian state was \u201ca prerequisite for achieving peace in the Middle East.\u201d \u201cThere will be no peace in the Middle East without a two-state solution,\u201d St\u00f8re said in a statement. \u201cThere can be no two-state solution without a Palestinian state.\u201d Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez sought to characterize the decision as one that was not anti-Israel. \u201cThis recognition is not against the people of Israel and certainly not against the Jewish people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in favor of Hamas. It\u2019s in favor of co-existence.\u201d The announcement was welcomed by Palestinian officials. \u201cThis step reflects Spain\u2019s keenness to support the Palestinian people and their inalienable and legitimate rights to their land and homeland,\u201d the office of the president of the Palestinian Authority said in response to Madrid\u2019s decision, as reported by Palestinian news agency Wafa. Hamas, the militant group which governs Gaza, urged other countries to follow suit and \u201crecognize our legitimate national rights, support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence, and end the Zionist occupation of our land.\u201d But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said recognizing a Palestinian state would be a \u201creward for terror.\u201d \u201cThis will be a terror state, which will attempt to perpetrate the onslaught of October 7 time and again, and to that we shall not agree,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding, \u201cthis evil must not be given a state.\u201d As Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors to Spain, Norway and Ireland, he said, in a statement: \u201cI am sending a clear message today \u2014 Israel will not hold back against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security.\u201d \u201cAfter the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has seen, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state,\u201d Katz added. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza\u00a0on October 7\u00a0after militants led by Hamas killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israel has come under fierce criticism for its war. Earlier this month, a panel of independent UN experts condemned \u201cthe continued and systematic onslaught of violence committed against Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d The agency has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages taken by Hamas. Israeli attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Gaza have since killed at least\u00a035,647\u00a0Palestinians and injured another\u00a079,852\u00a0people, according to the Ministry of Health there. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures. Two-state solution All three European leaders stressed the importance of having Palestinian statehood in reaching a two-state solution in the Middle East, a decades-long goal that the international community has failed to achieve. Ireland\u2019s Foreign Minister Martin said the decision came amid \u201cgrowing impatience\u201d with Israel\u2019s lack of political will for a two-state solution. \u201cThe integrity of that two-state solution has been undermined in recent years by the strategy of the Israeli government and, in particular, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has declared opposition to it,\u201d Martin told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest during a live interview. Meanwhile, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told CNN\u2019s Becky Anderson that Israel was wrong to see recognizing Palestinian statehood as rewarding Hamas. \u201cWe are sending the opposite signal. We are supporting the Palestine authorities which spring out of the PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization] who renounce violence and who many decades ago promised to leave the violent struggle behind and work for peaceful settlement with Israel \u2014 a promise they have kept by the way,\u201d Eide said. Senior officials in the United States, a close ally of Israel, have insisted the only way to bring peace and stability to the region is through the creation of a Palestinian state with guarantees for Israel\u2019s security. Lawmakers in Israel have long rejected those calls. Reacting to the news on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesperson told CNN that US President Joe Biden \u201cis a strong supporter\u201d of a two-state solution. The spokesperson added, however: \u201cHe believes a Palestinian state should be realized through direct negotiations between the parties, not through unilateral recognition.\u201d France, meanwhile, said that now is not the \u201cright time\u201d for it to join its European neighbors in recognizing a Palestinian state. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Stephane S\u00e9journe, added that such a decision is not merely a \u201csymbolic issue or a question of political positioning\u201d but rather a \u201cdiplomatic tool\u201d in the service of a two-state solution. Germany, another one of Israel\u2019s staunchest allies, also questioned the decision. Michael Roth, the chair of the parliament\u2019s\u00a0Foreign Affairs Committee, posted on X: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that the recognition of Palestine as a sovereign state is an appropriate measure after the horrific massacres (by) Hamas (on) October 7 last year.\u201d Qatar, a key mediator in stalled ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, said it hopes \u201cfor more countries to recognize the State of Palestine,\u201d according to a statement from the foreign ministry. The foreign ministry of Saudi Arabia, another regional actor, called on \u201cmore countries to swiftly take the same stance.\u201d Ireland has a long history of being openly supportive of the Palestinian cause, consistently criticizing Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank and Gaza before Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack in Israel. Since then, Israel\u2019s war in response has shredded huge parts of the Gaza Strip and drained critical supplies, exposing the entire population of more than 2.2 million people to the risk of famine. \u201cI can say this to the people of Israel: we recognize the state of Israel. We recognize the state of Israel\u2019s right to live in peace and security. That is their right. The people of Palestine also must have an equivalent right to peace and security,\u201d Harris told Amanpour on Thursday. \u201cAnd let me also say this to the people of Israel: the Irish people know what it\u2019s like to have their national identity hijacked by a terrorist organization. The IRA was never the people of Ireland and Hamas is not the people of Palestine.\u201d \u201cWe have been clear and unequivocal that we condemn Hamas, that we condemn the most horrific barbaric massacre that Israel experienced on the 7th\u00a0of October. We call for the unconditional and immediate release of all hostages. But it is entirely possible to say what I have just said and also say the next bit which sadly some refuse to say: that what is happening in Palestine, what is happening in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe, that children are being starved, are being deprived of food and that there are children who will go to sleep in Gaza tonight not sure if they will wake in the morning,\u201d he added. A source familiar with the matter told CNN the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently considering further diplomatic steps against the three countries. Steps under consideration include cancelling visits of officials from these countries to Israel and revoking visas from diplomats, which will limit their ability to visit areas in the West Bank under control of the Palestinian Authority, the source said. Another step under consideration by Israel is to reach out to the US to seek diplomatic support in providing clarification from Norway, Ireland and Spain on their intended decision, and to ask the US to try and convince other countries to not follow suit. Pressure on Israel The planned recognition adds pressure on Israel after seven months of fighting, according to H.A. Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies in London. \u201cFor individual Palestinians on the ground in the Occupied Territories, it\u2019s not going to mean anything at all in the short term, perhaps in the medium term,\u201d Hellyer told CNN. \u201cIt is obviously political recognition by states that don\u2019t have a presence on the ground.\u201d Hellyer added that Israel risks becoming an \u201cinternational pariah\u201d given that Western nations are now beginning to recognize a Palestinian state.  Israel captured Gaza from Egypt in the 1967 war, then withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005. The territory, home to some 2 million Palestinians, fell under Hamas\u2019 rule in 2007. After Hamas took control, Israel and Egypt imposed a strict siege on the territory, which is ongoing. Israel also maintains an air and naval blockade on Gaza. These severe restrictions have been fiercely criticized by international bodies, including Amnesty International,\u00a0who say\u00a0Israel has violated international law. The vast majority of the population in Gaza are descendants of 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were\u00a0forcibly expelled\u00a0from their homes during what Palestinians call\u00a0al-Nakba, or \u201cthe catastrophe,\u201d of the 1948-49 war, in what is now Israel.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/middleeast/palestinian-statehood-spain-norway-ireland-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_americas_turks-and-caicos-americans-ammunition-charges", "text": "Turks and Caicos officials have slammed remarks from US lawmakers who traveled to the islands earlier this week to press for the release of the Americans who were arrested there \u2013 and could possibly face 12-year sentences. In a House of Assembly address, the islands\u2019 Premier Washington Misick said, \u201cThe accusation of congressman (Guy Reschenthaler) against the government and people of the Turks and Caicos Islands are nothing more than diabolic falsehoods.\u201d The comments come after Reschenthaler said in an interview with ABC News earlier this week that, \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now, (where) every third week an American is being detained wrongfully and Turks and Caicos.\u201d Reschenthaler told CNN this week that the prison on Turks and Caicos has been flagged by the UN for humanitarian concerns. A US congressional delegation traveled to the islands to meet with officials earlier this week to press for the release of the\u00a0detained Americans\u00a0charged with the possession of ammunition. Three of the Americans \u2013 Michael Lee Evans, Bryan Hagerich and Tyler Wenrich \u2013 have pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the Turks and Caicos government. Hagerich is set to be sentenced on Friday at 10 a.m. ET, his lawyer Oliver Smith told CNN. A fourth person, Ryan Tyler Watson, will have a hearing on May 28 to establish if he will enter a plea or go to trial, Smith said. A fifth person, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, director of communications in the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. The five Americans were each arrested in recent months in the British Overseas Territory, where\u00a0carrying firearms is prohibited.\u00a0Each is accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, southeast of the Bahamas. On Monday, Reschenthaler told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that he wants to see a \u201cresolution here where the Americans get zero amount of jail time. They should be given time served and be sent home to the United States.\u201d Reschenthaler continued: \u201cThey were innocent mistakes. Any other nation would handle this with a fine in sending that person back to the country of origin. Here, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d The Americans face a fine for violating the government\u2019s firearm ordinance in addition to the possible 12-year sentences, but the court could give lighter sentences if it determines there are exceptional circumstances relating to the offense, according to Smith, who also represents Evans. Evans is currently out on bail and was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, Smith said. The court is also expected to decide on a legal challenge Smith presented over the constitutionality of the legislation as it relates to how defendants can be sentenced, according to Smith. The group of American lawmakers who traveled to Turks and Caicos this week to push for the charges to be dropped said the arrested Americans had the ammunition in their luggage \u201cinadvertently.\u201d One of the US lawmakers, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, said in a statement on Monday, \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today.\u201d Reschenthaler said the minimum 12-year sentence that ammunition charges carry is \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and that the Americans brought the ammunition unknowingly. Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratna said in a news release on Wednesday that Turks and Caicos values its relationship with the US and that the two countries work in \u201cstrong partnership to tackle shared threats in the region.\u201d The statement said Turks and Caicos did not target US citizens and called Reschenthaler\u2019s remarks about the congressional delegation\u2019s trip to the islands to meet with officials \u201chighly regrettable.\u201d \u201cHis characterisation of our meeting is not one we recognise,\u201d the statement read. \u201cOur discussions were professional and respectful with a focus on clarifying the legal position and the well-being of the individuals,\u201d the statement continued. The governor added that the mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms and/or ammunition is in place to protect those in the islands and that the law provides discretion in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d for the judge to impose a reduced sentence. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date, according to the statement. Premier: \u2018Law must be applied even-handedly\u2019 Misick said out of a total of 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the last six years, only seven were US citizens.\u00a0The premier said Thursday no special treatment should be given to any group. \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly,\u201d Misick said. Bringing firearms or ammunition, including stray bullets, into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden,\u201d according to a statement from its government, CNN previously reported. People who violate the law face a minimum 12 years imprisonment, the US Embassy in the Bahamas said in an April advisory. While the US and Turks and Caicos work together in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d The government of Turks and Caicos, Misick said, would take \u201cdecisive and comprehensive action to preserve the safety and security of our nation,\u201d adding while the country does not manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding its way to the islands has increased. The appointed member of the opposition, Alvin Garland, expressed his concern over the American citizens who have been arrested in Turks and Caicos for possession of ammunition over the last six months. Garland said the islands\u2019 governor is correct in not interfering with the ongoing court cases in order to adhere to the government\u2019s separation of powers, but added he believes most, if not all, of the cases involving American tourists will fall into the \u201cexceptional circumstances category\u201d and sentences could be shorter than the mandatory 12-year minimum.

{"id": "2024_05_22_weather_iowa-tornado-damage-storm-forecast-wednesday", "text": "The destructive tornado that ravaged the town of Greenfield, Iowa, on Tuesday has left four dead and at least 35 injured, the Iowa State Patrol said in a Wednesday evening\u00a0news release. Authorities are not releasing the names of the deceased at this time pending next of kin notifications. In addition to the fatalities reported in Greenfield, at least one person was killed as storms passed through nearby Adams County, local officials said earlier. The Iowa State Patrol said the number of those injured from the Greenfield twister \u201cis likely higher, but these numbers reflect only those patients treated for their injuries at designated alternate care sites.\u201d At least 14 patients were taken to medical facilities outside of the county, the release added. The\u00a0tornado that carved through Greenfield \u2013 about 50 miles southwest of Des Moines \u2013\u00a0was\u00a0an EF4,\u00a0the National Weather Service in Des Moines said Thursday, and\u00a0is\u00a0the deadliest of the year. The tornado had peak winds of\u00a0175 mph to\u00a0185 mph,\u00a0was\u00a0more than a half-mile\u00a0wide\u00a0and was on the ground for 44 miles,\u00a0according to the National Weather Service in Des Moines. More than 100 first responders were combing through the wreckage of the town Wednesday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said. The city\u2019s hospital sustained damage and some patients were moved to other facilities in surrounding areas. At least four medical airlift flights occurred. A \u201cmakeshift hospital\u201d was set up in the city\u2019s lumberyard Tuesday right after the tornado tracked out of the area, State Rep. Ray Sorensen said Wednesday. Sorensen lives in the area and assisted with recovery efforts in the immediate aftermath. \u201cWe pulled a guy from the rubble and put him on a little makeshift stretcher that we made for him on the back of a truck,\u201d Sorensen recalled. Video taken by CNN affiliate KCCI shows homes and other structures were obliterated and the community is blanketed with heaps of debris, tossed cars and uprooted trees. \u201cIt\u2019s horrific,\u201d Reynolds said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe until you can actually see the devastation.\u201d At least three tornadoes were reported in Iowa on Tuesday \u2013 part of a torrent of storms that left widespread power outages, structural damage and flooding across the US this week. Tornado reports have skyrocketed well-above average in recent weeks as the typically busiest period of severe weather season unfolds. The more than 800 tornadoes reported so far make 2024 one of the most active years for twisters on record. Greenfield, home to just over 2,100 residents, must now recover from the damage of the deadliest tornado in a year that\u2019s recorded fewer deaths from twisters than 2023. Despite the number of tornadoes this year, there had been 17 deaths from the beginning of 2024 until Tuesday, while 65 people died due to tornadoes during the same period last year. Nearly 15,000 homes and businesses were in the dark across Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us. On Wednesday, a tornado hurtled through Temple, Texas \u2013 about 35 miles south of Waco \u2013 causing widespread power outages and making many roads dangerous or impassable. First responders were flooded with emergency requests and were prioritizing life-saving calls Wednesday night, the city said in a release announcing a disaster declaration. \u201cCurrently, no life-threatening injuries or fatalities have been reported,\u201d the release said. More than 125,000 homes and businesses in Texas were without power Thursday morning, including nearly 55,000 in Bell County, where Temple is located, according to PowerOutage.us. More than 200 homes destroyed in Iowa The governor expanded her disaster declaration from 15 counties to 32 on Thursday, and said state officials are working with the FEMA to get the federal declaration approved, citing \u201ca lot of destruction and damage across the state.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to process it as quickly as we can,\u201d said FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell. More than 200 homes were destroyed in Iowa, Reynolds said. Greenfield and other parts of western Iowa bore the brunt of the storms\u2019 catastrophic impacts: In Greenfield\u2019s county, Adair, 153 homes were either damaged or destroyed, according to Reynolds. A tornado also toppled a hulking wind turbine just south of Greenfield in Prescott, Iowa, and more than two dozen homes were damaged or destroyed in Montgomery County, including some \u201ccritical public facilities,\u201d emergency management officials said. No injuries have been reported but damage assessments are still ongoing. But Greenfield is the epicenter of Tuesday\u2019s event. \u201cThere is basically nothing left,\u201d Clel Baudler, a former Iowa state representative who lives a half mile from Greenfield, told CNN on Tuesday. Valerie Warrior, a Greenfield resident, pleaded with God to protect her home and her family before she rode out the storm in her basement, she told KCCI. \u201cI was in the furnace room and then I heard (the storm) like a train,\u201d she said, describing insulation flying off of basement windows. \u201cI heard it, and I knew it was hitting.\u201d Warrior said the scale of damage is devastating to see, but she is confident residents will pull each other through the crisis. \u201cThey\u2019ll get through it. You already see people out helping each other, working together. And that\u2019s what they do, people come together when a tragedy happens. People come together to support and encourage each other.\u201d Fighting back tears, Warrior looked out the rubble strewn across her neighborhood and tried to crack a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll rebuild.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jessica Jordan, Sara Smart, Amy Simonson, Andy Rose and Brad Parks contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/weather/iowa-tornado-damage-storm-forecast-wednesday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_tech_fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads", "text": "The Federal Communications Commission is taking initial steps toward new rules that could require political ads on TV and radio to include disclaimers about the use of artificial intelligence. On Wednesday, FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel called on other agency commissioners to support such regulations amid growing fears that AI-generated deepfakes could disrupt elections. \u201cAs artificial intelligence tools become more accessible, the Commission wants to make sure consumers are fully informed when the technology is used,\u201d Rosenworcel said in a news release.\u00a0\u201cToday, I\u2019ve shared with my colleagues a proposal that makes clear consumers have a right to know when AI tools are being used in the political ads they see, and I hope they swiftly act on this issue.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s proposal aims to open a rulemaking process at the FCC that would likely take months to play out. The proposal calls for new rules governing broadcast TV and radio, as well as cable and satellite providers. Under the proposed rules, political advertisers on those mediums would have to make on-air disclosures if their ads contain AI-generated content. The FCC does not regulate internet-based media such as streaming video services or social media. As part of the proposed rule, political advertisers would also have to provide written disclosures in the files that broadcasters are\u00a0required to make available\u00a0to the public. The FCC move seeks to fill\u00a0a yawning gap\u00a0in the regulation of artificial intelligence in political advertising. Existing US election law prohibits campaigns from \u201cfraudulently misrepresenting other candidates or political parties,\u201d but whether this prohibition extends to AI-generated content is an open question. Last summer,\u00a0Republicans on the Federal Election Commission blocked\u00a0a move that could have made clear the law extended to AI-created depictions; the FEC has since agreed to revive the discussion, but it has not reached a decision on the matter. In the meantime, some US lawmakers have proposed legislation that could clamp down on AI in elections. In March, a bipartisan proposal by Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski unveiled the\u00a0AI Transparency in Elections Act, which could require AI disclaimers on political ads. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, has stressed the urgent need for Congress to create guardrails for artificial intelligence, particularly for elections. Last week, he and a bipartisan group of senators\u00a0released a blueprint\u00a0for legislative action. But many\u00a0policy analysts doubt\u00a0that Congress can pass meaningful AI legislation during an election year. Online platforms such as Meta have taken their own steps to address AI in political ads,\u00a0requiring campaigns\u00a0to disclose the use of deepfakes and banning the use of its\u00a0in-house generative AI tools\u00a0for political advertising.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/tech/fcc-weighs-ai-rules-political-ads/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_style_parties-monaco-grand-prix-f1", "text": "The Monaco Grand Prix gets underway this weekend in Monte Carlo with its heady combination of glamor and adrenaline, not only for the tens of thousands who descend on the pristine principality, but for the millions watching across the world. Even those who are typically indifferent to motorsports can find themselves enraptured, or at least intrigued, by the sheer spectacle of Formula One cars hurtling along the country\u2019s winding streets. It is also where you will find celebrities happily jostling their way through the crowds and cameras. \u201cIt is unlike anything I have ever been to, it is electric,\u201d exclaimed Spider-Man actor Tom Holland while walking last year\u2019s grid. And of course, there is plenty of wealth on display. Monaco is nicknamed \u201cthe billionaires\u2019 playground\u201d for good reason. Here, designer stores, supercars, multi-million-dollar yachts and astronomically priced restaurants are \u2018la norme\u2019, but during the three-day Grand Prix, the eye-watering ostentation increases three-fold. When demand is high and options are limited, it is all to play for among the world\u2019s wealthiest who are keen to revel in the race\u2019s iconic location and party \u2018til dawn. If they are not using their own superyacht as a base, they might book into a private villa on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur or check-in to Fairmont Hotel, H\u00f4tel Hermitage or H\u00f4tel de Paris in Monte Carlo itself. A pioneer of Grand Prix party culture Of course, it is not only about finding the finest suites to rest your head, but the premium spots for dining and clubbing, whether it is the top table at Cipriani, Sass Caf\u00e9 or Caf\u00e9 de Paris or the best booth at exclusive night spots such as Jimmy\u2019z or Amber Lounge. The latter has the distinction of being the go-to destination for the F1 fraternity, including Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, while previous guests have included Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Minogue and Prince Albert of Monaco. Established in 2003 by former racing driver Eddie Irvine\u2019s sister Sonia as a \u201cpost-race destination\u201d for drivers and VIP guests, Amber Lounge is regarded a pioneer of the Grand Prix party culture. Notably, it will be marking its 20-year milestone (there was a year off during Covid) as \u201cthe most exclusive party in the world\u201d with panache over the Monaco weekend with three nights of events costing just over \u20ac1.5m ($1.6m) to produce. There will be after parties at an Amber Lounge beach club on the terrace of Le Meridien Beach Plaza (the only hotel in Monte Carlo with its own private beach), as well as VIP viewing of the race from aboard a 108ft superyacht moored just feet from the circuit\u2019s famous Tabac corner. \u201cThe size of the yacht also means we are as close to the action as you can get, unlike the larger yachts that are pulled back (from the coast). It also feels more intimate and exclusive on board. We have a lot of repeat clients (typically from the US, UK and Middle East) who want to network and build relationships,\u201d said Lauren Green, Managing Director of Amber Lounge who oversees logistics of the three-day pop-up event in Monaco, as well as other F1 locations including Singapore, Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi. Unsurprisingly, a ticket to one of the most coveted trackside spots does not come cheap. A one-day VIP viewing package for the race itself on Sunday costs \u20ac3,500 ($3,800) per person \u2014 and the 65 available tickets sold out within two weeks of going on sale in May 2023. While the dress code is \u2018Riviera chic,\u2019 shoes, however expensive, must be discarded on embarking so as not to ruin the yacht\u2019s teak decking. Tickets include free-flowing beverages, including champagne, wine and signature cocktails, as well as food, a DJ and dancers before tenders return to shore at 6.30pm. \u2018The center of the universe for a weekend\u2019 At the club\u2019s after parties held over the race weekend, a small army of waiting staff serve ever-flowing drinks for a 1000 strong crowd on Saturday and Sunday nights. On arrival, guests ring a bell and a gloved hand appears through a flower wall proffering a glass of champagne. Attendees have paid anything from \u20ac600 ($650) for entry to the afterparty on Saturday (the F1 qualifying day) to \u20ac800 ($870) on the Sunday (race day) in the hope they can party alongside drivers, celebrities and guests of high net worth, away from the public gaze. For \u20ac40,000 ($43,400), partygoers can book what\u2019s known as a \u201cdiamond table package\u201d for 10 people \u2014 a prime table with unobstructed views of the stage and DJ booth (Fatman Scoop and Jax Jones are the acts for 2024), as well as cirqus-themed performances, and Methuselahs of champagne (6-liters) and premium vodka. Add an extra \u20ac10,000 ($10,800) on for a Salmanazar \u2014 a nine-liter bottle of champagne that requires a team of four to carry it to the table, or \u20ac20,000 ($21,600) for a 12-liter Balthazar-sized bottle. The top-tier tables also have their own \u201chosts,\u201d who act as a concierge; liaising with VIPs\u2019 assistants or drivers to ensure guests can be greeted and escorted along the black carpet without having to queue. Amber Lounge might be one of the most exclusive and expensive events taking place during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend, but Monte Carlo itself is a veritable party hub. It\u2019s common for champagne glasses and bottles to be cleared from the track from the previous night\u2019s revelry ahead of that day\u2019s qualifying or race sessions. \u201cThe C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur is one of the truly exceptional global destinations, and Monaco is at the heart of it. The scenery, the sophistication, and the opulence are unmatched,\u201d said Bruce Bundrant, Senior Vice President of Business Development for rEvolution, a global sports marketing agency who lived in Monaco for three years as Commercial Director for AS Monaco FC. \u201cAs a former resident, I can tell you there are two sides to the F1 Grand Prix arriving in Monaco. On one side, your town is now the center of the universe for a weekend where the top 1% of the 1% from all over the world arrive and engage in outrageous parties and events on yachts, at luxury hotels suites, and in hilltop mansions,\u201d Bundrant explained. \u201cOn the other, it\u2019s the hybrid of the arrival of a hurricane and New Year\u2019s Eve. A week out from the race, grocery store shelves are emptied as locals know it\u2019s impossible to move around the principality when the F1 circus is in town. During the Grand Prix, your quiet, regular neighborhood bar has a line around the corner, charges a $100 cover charge, and a drink that typically costs $20 will be $50. But it\u2019s a truly unforgettable weekend, with an unreplicable buzz and energy. Sure, it\u2019s expensive, but come the Monday, things are back to normal.\u201d As normal as it can ever be in a place as excessive as Monaco. As the jet set move onto their next port of call, and the racetrack is dismantled, so too is the Amber Lounge club as preparations continue for their next F1 event, which will be Singapore in September. \u201cThere is no rest at Amber Lounge,\u201d Green quipped. \u201cJust a lot of adrenaline. And a lot of coffee.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/style/parties-monaco-grand-prix-f1/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_summer-2024-air-travel-hurdles", "text": "If you\u2019re expecting to take to the skies this summer, you should also expect lots and lots and lots of companionship. And a few hurdles, too. Memorial Day weekend, the traditional launching pad of the summer travel season, is shaping up to set a scorching pace. The Federal Aviation Administration has forecast the holiday to be its busiest in 14 years. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 18 million passengers and crew between Thursday and Wednesday \u2013 up more than 6% over last year.\u00a0TSA says it\u2019s prepared for its busiest summer ever. American Airlines and United Airlines are both expecting about 10% more passengers over the holiday weekend than last year. United is expecting the biggest Memorial Day and summer travel season in the airline\u2019s 98-year history, according to Andrew Nocella, United\u2019s executive vice president and chief commercial officer. When it comes to navigating the flocks of fellow flyers, don\u2019t look for much of an ease-up after Memorial Day weekend. US airlines are predicted to carry 271 million passengers around the world from June 1 to August 31, according to industry trade organization Airlines for America. That\u2019s a 6.3% increase from last summer, and a new record for US airlines. To meet the higher demand, Airlines for America said that US carriers will offer more than 26,000 scheduled flights a day \u2013 up nearly 1,400 a day from summer 2023. While US airlines have staffed up and the TSA says it\u2019s ready for the summer crush, an air traffic controller crunch, hot weather and crowded airports could bring flight disruptions and pain points. Air traffic controller shortage Despite a surge in hiring last year, air\u202ftraffic\u202fcontrol stations nationwide are still about 3,000 controllers short, according to new FAA numbers. The numbers show the challenge of filling the gap that led to flight delays and concerns that fatigue contributed to a series of near collisions on runways last year. The current understaffing means controllers at many facilities are regularly working overtime to cover gaps. The shortage is a concern of\u202fairlines, controllers and watchdogs alike. Scott Keyes, founder of travel site\u00a0Going,\u00a0said that because of the way air traffic control maps are divvied up, airports in New York City metro area and in Florida have a slightly higher chance of being affected by air traffic control issues. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t, you know, not take that trip to New York or to Miami because of air traffic control,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN Travel. People flying in and out of those markets should try to get early morning flights and nonstop flights to help minimize problems if they come up. \u201cI was flying to New York a couple days ago and my flight to New York got delayed by four hours,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cIt was a pain in the butt \u2013 don\u2019t get me wrong. But that just meant I arrived in New York four hours later. \u201cIf I had had a connection in Chicago and my flight was delayed by four hours, I would have missed that connection. And then it\u2019s a much more hairy situation.\u201d Hot weather and hurricanes Much of the United States is looking at varying probabilities of having higher temperatures than the average for summer \u2013 especially in the Northeast and desert Southwest. Extreme heat can do more than make you feel miserable. It also affects airlines\u2019 abilities to carry out normal schedules, according to a report from Embry\u2011Riddle Aeronautical University. \u201cHot air is thin air. While this reduces the lift on which planes rely for takeoff, the main impact is felt on engine thrust. Aircraft engines will produce less thrust during takeoff and ascent as a result,\u201d said Bob Thomas, assistant professor of aeronautical science.\u00a0\u201cThe only way to make a takeoff possible on shorter runways would be to lower the weight of the aircraft.\u201d He said airlines generally reduce weight by removing baggage or passengers, especially as temperatures reach the triple digits. Cancellations are even possible. The report suggested trying to book early morning and late evening flights when you expect to fly in hot weather zones. Experts also warn that as the effects of climate change increase, passengers can expect longer periods of turbulence during flights in coming years. Says one professor of atmospheric science: \u201cThe seat belt sign will be switched on a lot more.\u201d And if you haven\u2019t heard, meteorologists warn we\u2019re phasing out of an El Ni\u00f1o cycle in the equatorial Pacific (with warmer waters) and phasing into a La Ni\u00f1a period (with cooler waters). And La Ni\u00f1a can sometimes generate increased hurricane activity along the US Gulf and Atlantic coasts. In fact, forecasters predict a \u201chyperactive Atlantic hurricane season\u201d with eight to 13 hurricanes. They think four to seven of them could reach at least a strength of Category 3, which have sustained winds of 111 to 129 mph. (The hurricane scale goes up to Category 5, which has sustained winds of 157 mph or more.) Bottom line, especially as summer progresses into peak hurricane season: Keep your eye on the forecasts if you\u2019re scheduled to fly. Crowded airports Passengers will need to pay attention to their ground game this summer, said Keyes. \u201cHere\u2019s how I put it: Airports are going to be extremely full. Airplanes are only gonna be pretty full.\u201d Keyes said new plane deliveries and additional flights will ease the load factor. \u201cThere\u2019s about 10 to 15 percent more capacity this year than there was a year ago. And \u2026 more seats mean there\u2019s going to be more elbow room for folks this summer even during the busy travel season.\u201d That won\u2019t help in the crowded airports, though. He has a couple of tips to mitigate that. First, get TSA PreCheck and/or Fast Track so you can at least bypass possible security line bottlenecks. Secondly, Keyes says he likes to find a quieter, more restful pocket of the airport away from his gate in which to hang out before his flight. He downloads the airline\u2019s mobile app, which notifies him just before boarding is about to start. Silver lining for flyers For those flyers who must carefully consider every dollar they spend, they could find the summer of 2024 to be a less expensive one than last year. Travel site Kayak reports that summer fares should be lower. For US domestic flyers, fares should drop an average of 13% compared with 2023. Mexico is seeing an even bigger drop with fares averaging 16% less. And if Australia is a dream trip of yours, those fares are falling an average of 14% (though the average price is $1,509, Kayak says). For people scared off from Europe last summer by the crowds and high prices, Keyes had some good news. \u201cI think a lot of that pent-up demand [from the pandemic] has been exhausted. I think you\u2019re going to see higher supply, lower demand and cheaper fares to Europe this summer as a result.\u201d Kayak is showing a 7% dip in Europe fares compared with last summer. While hardly typical, Keyes said he\u2019s recently spotted some round-trip mega-bargains that were almost nonexistent last summer: Paris for $570, Iceland for $475 and Dublin for $457.

The body of 40-year-old Joshua Cheruiyot Kirui was found about 20 meters from the summit of the world\u2019s highest mountain, an official of Nepal\u2019s Department of Tourism told CNN. \u201cHis sherpa is still missing and the expedition agency is still searching for him,\u201d the official Khim Lal Gautam also told CNN by phone, was speaking from the foot of the mountain. Kirui, a banker based in Nairobi, and the 44-year-old guide Nawang Sherpa were reported missing early Wednesday after going out of radio contact. A rescue team then began searching for them in camps and trails along the expansive mountain, Gautam told CNN. Kirui\u2019s body was discovered on Wednesday night local time in Nepal, at about 28,970\u00a0feet (8,830 meters) above sea level. His employer KCB Bank called him \u201ca passionate athlete and mountaineer,\u201d saying he was \u201cthe second Kenyan to ever summit Mt Everest\u201d in an post on X. Kirui documented his brave attempt to climb to the peak of Everest without supplemental oxygen in his\u00a0last post on Instagram. \u201cA no-oxygen attempt comes with its special preparations and risks, physically my body is ready,\u201d he wrote, also laying out the precautions he was taking. He listed drugs he was bringing along for any potential illnesses or frostbite and said his guide would also carry an emergency bottle of oxygen. \u201cAnd so after heavy investment physically, mentally, timewise (this expedition is taking more than a month from a regular 8 to 5 banker), financially (the amount of zeros needed to make this happen means I declare bankruptcy immediately I land back in Kenya)\u2026 it\u2019s now the moment of truth,\u201d he wrote. Congratulatory comments and good luck wishes on the Instagram post were soon replaced by condolence messages as word spread that his body had been found. Kirui was a lover of the outdoors, who ran ultramarathons and climbed some of the world\u2019s most daunting mountains, according to colleagues. \u201cHis indomitable will and unwavering passion for mountaineering led him to conquer the world\u2019s most awe-inspiring landscapes,\u201d KCB Group CEO Paul Russo wrote of him. \u201cHis recent triumphs on Mt Manaslu and Mt Everest are a testament to his adventurous spirit and determination.\u201d Mount Everest, the highest peak in the Himalayan mountain range, is also the tallest mountain on Earth, rising 29,035 feet (8,850 meters) above sea level on the border between Nepal and Tibet \u2014 an autonomous region in China. More than 300 people are known to have\u00a0died on the mountain. Spring is the prime time to climb Everest, although some mountaineers might climb in the less favorable autumn season. Most climbers try to ascend the peak in May. There\u2019s a brief window of time \u2013 usually after mid-May \u2013 when temperatures are warmer, and the high-altitude winds known as the jet stream have moved away from the mountains.

{"id": "travel_rome-metro-line-c-underground-museum", "text": "Rome, as it\u2019s often said, wasn\u2019t built in a day. And nowhere is that more evident than its state-of-the-art Metro Line C, an ambitious project meant to help relieve the Italian capital\u2019s renowned traffic hellscape and celebrate its rich archeological history with a unique-in-the-world underground museum. The \u20ac700 million line ($757.7 million) was originally envisioned for the Catholic Jubilee of 2000 as a vital link between Rome\u2019s San Giovanni Cathedral and Vatican City\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, making it easier for visiting pilgrims to collect indulgences by walking through the churches\u2019 holy doors. Rome\u2019s major basilicas open their holy doors only during Jubilee years, allowing Catholics from all over the world to make pilgrimages to the city to walk through them, symbolizing an openness to receive mercy and reconciliation. But the 2000 dream never happened, thanks to a series of problems ranging from a corruption scandal in the city government and the sheer number of archeological objects \u2013 40,000 in all, from petrified peach pits to pottery and vases and even the walls and mosaics of Emperor Hadrian\u2019s 2,000-year-old military barracks \u2013 found with each shovel full of dirt during the initial preparations. Now the hope is to have the line\u2019s showcase Piazza Venezia stop, featuring an eight-story underground museum, ready in 10 years, according to engineer Andrea Sciotti, who is in charge of the metro museum complex. This will allow them to open around the Jubilee of 2033, which will mark 2,000 years since the death of Jesus Christ.\u201cIt\u2019s true, 10 years seems like a long time, but we aren\u2019t just dealing with the engineering issues,\u201d Sciotti told CNN inside the construction site.\u00a0\u201cThis station will be judged as the most beautiful in the world \u2026 we don\u2019t have to rely on museum items being brought in, the museum station is in its original context in ancient Rome.\u201d Displayed where they were found During the initial phases of work carried out in the last five years, Sciotti said all of the artifacts were removed from the site for restoration. Each will be placed exactly where it was found inside the metro museum, which is being dug some 85 meters (280 feet) deep, encompassing eight stories below the modern city of Rome. Over the millennia the modern city has been built over covered ruins. Only around 10% of ancient Rome has been excavated, with the rest still buried some nine meters (30 feet) below the current city, according to Rome\u2019s tourist bureau. The city dates back to the stone age and construction work is notoriously hampered by the discovery of ruins that are too plentiful to even excavate and are often reburied to preserve them. Even simple infrastructure work, like sewage repairs, have to be attended by archeologists who have the power to stop the work if something is found. There will be 27 escalators, six elevators and 66,000 square meters of archeological exhibit space. Ancient walls found during excavations will be placed \u201cin situ\u201d in the modern station and the ancient Via Flaminia that ran through the ancient city to the nearby Roman Forum and Colosseum. The station\u2019s three main entrances will connect the three museums around the square: the Vittoriano, the Palazzo Venezia and the outdoor ruins of the Roman Forum anchored by the Colosseum at the far end, which has its own metro station that will also feature museum and exhibit space. Several of the archeological sites will have access points from inside the metro museum, meaning commuters and tourists alike can exit the station by rambling through historically significant ruins like Hadrian\u2019s Auditorium, which was discovered when the initial archeological investigation into the project started and was meant to be the location of the station entrance. Since then, they moved the site and excavated the ruins, which are currently only visible looking down from street level. \u2018Top down\u2019 excavation system To secure the site as they dig, engineers are using a \u201ctop down\u201d excavation system, which has never been used in Italy but was an integral part of the Jubilee line in London. Cross walls and diaphragms are being buried deep into the soil to form the perimeter of the underground complex, with the dirt taken out recycled and enhanced to be used in the building materials, Sciotti said. The train tunnels themselves are not the issue since they will be more than 100 feet below ground. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to that level that we have to wade through the artifacts that causes the delays,\u201d he said, noting that they are passing through Medieval and Renaissance eras. The Venezia station museum stop is not the only treasure on the new line. In 2016, archeologists working on the site of the Porta Metronia (previously known as the Ambra Aradam) station found a 39-room complex that spanned more than 9,700 square feet that has been incorporated into the underground station, which will open by the end of 2024. In 2025, the new Colosseo-Fori station, complete with a four-level underground museum to showcase artifacts including 25 archaic wells unearthed when it was built, will also open after activation tests, meant to begin in October, are completed. The entire 26-kilometer C-line will be Italy\u2019s first fully automated driver-less subway system and will reduce road traffic by 400,000 vehicles a day, meaning CO2 emissions will be reduced by some 310,000 tonnes a year, according to the WeBuild group, which is the main contractor for the project. The original plans from the 2000 Jubilee have been modified to eliminate several stations in the historical center that would have simply been too difficult to excavate.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/rome-metro-line-c-underground-museum/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_middleeast_israel-idf-hostage-video-hamas-intl", "text": "Families of seven female Israeli soldiers captured by Hamas during the October 7 attacks have released graphic footage of their abduction as they pile pressure on the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure their release. The video shows the women \u2014 all Israel Defense Forces (IDF) personnel \u2014 lined up against a wall, their hands bound. The faces of some of the women are bruised and bloodied. The footage was previously released by Hamas, according to the Hostages Families Forum. The campaigning group obtained it from the IDF, which had previously edited the video to exclude the most disturbing scenes. \u201cEvery new testimony about what happened to the hostages echoes the same tragic truth \u2013 we must bring them all back home, now,\u201d the Hostage Families Forum said in a press release Wednesday. The\u00a0women were\u00a0kidnapped during a Hamas raid on Israel\u2019s Nahal Oz military base, near the northern Gaza Strip, as part of the militant group\u2019s attacks on Israel that left around 1,200 people dead and saw more than 250 captured and taken hostage in the enclave. Following the attack,\u00a0Israel\u00a0launched a war in Gaza that has killed\u00a0more than 35,000 Palestinians\u00a0over the past seven months, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. The\u00a0kidnapped\u00a0women were working as IDF observers, a role that involves monitoring Israel\u2019s border security. Video of the ordeal has been made public as pressure mounts on Netanyahu to secure the release of the Israelis still held by Hamas,\u00a0which his government has made a key goal of the Gaza offensive. Numerous attempts to strike a hostage-for-ceasefire deal with Hamas have faltered in recent months, infuriating those in Israel campaigning for the return of the captives. \u201cThe State of Israel cannot accept a reality where its citizens constantly feel their lives are threatened and suffer from unrelenting fear and anxiety,\u201d the Hostages Families Forum\u00a0said\u00a0as it publicized the video on Wednesday. \u201cWith each passing day, it becomes more challenging to bring the hostages back home \u2013 the living for rehabilitation and the murdered for proper burial. The Israeli government must not waste another moment; it must return to the negotiating table today!\u201d Netanyahu\u00a0said Wednesday he is \u201chorrified by the video showing the abduction of our dear field observers.\u201d He said Israel will \u201ccontinue doing everything to bring them home\u201d and the \u201ccruelty of Hamas terrorists only enhances my determination to fight forcefully until the destruction of Hamas, to ensure that what we\u2019ve seen this evening will not happen ever again.\u201d War cabinet minister Benny Gantz said when he first watched the video it made his \u201cstomach turn.\u201d However, Gantz said, \u201cthe responsibility of leaders is not only to look reality in the eye \u2013 it is to create a different reality even when it comes to difficult decisions. And that is our responsibility.\u201d \u2018For the world to see\u2019 One of the women shown in the video, Ori Megidish, was\u00a0rescued by the IDF in a special operation\u00a023 days after being taken. Another, Noa Marciano, an IDF Corporal, was\u00a0killed while in Gaza\u00a0and her body was returned to Israel in November. But five of the seven \u2014 Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Agam Berger, Daniela Gilboa, and Naama Levy \u2014 remain in captivity, more than seven months after being taken across the border. The mother of Naama Levy told CNN on Wednesday that bringing them home is not\u00a0a top priority of the Israeli government, saying some members of the government did not even watch the video. \u201cMinisters and\u00a0members of the government were asked to watch a version of this video in their meetings, and some of them refused and said we want to sleep OK at night,\u201d Ayelet Levy Shachar said, adding, \u201cSo if this is the reaction when it\u2019s their duty to watch these materials, this is their job, so they can make correct decisions, then we think that we should put it out there for our citizens, for the world to see.\u201d More than 100 hostages were freed during a release deal in November, but the IDF believes there are still around 130 people being held in Gaza. Efforts to reach a deal that would pause the war in Gaza and allow the release of hostages have repeatedly been dashed. Earlier this month, Hamas said Israel\u2019s rejection of a ceasefire plan submitted by mediators at negotiations in Cairo had sent hostage release talks back to \u201csquare one.\u201d The statement came a day after the latest round of Gaza truce and hostage deal talks ended in Cairo, without a deal.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/middleeast/israel-idf-hostage-video-hamas-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

High-profile meetings on Thursday hinted at once-high expectations. In the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, the country\u2019s governing Transitional Presidential Council posted photos of its meeting with a Kenyan delegation. In Washington, US President Joe Biden and Kenyan President William Ruto touted their nations\u2019 collaboration on the mission (largely equipped by the US) at a joint press conference. Peace and security in Haiti are the \u201ccollective responsibility of all nations,\u201d Ruto said, warning that Kenya will \u201ctake that responsibility along with the Haitian police\u201d and \u201cbreak the backs of gangs and criminals.\u201d But for now, armed groups continue to rampage in capital city Port-au-Prince, extorting residents and controlling the movement of vital fuel, food and medical supplies. On Thursday evening, a young US missionary couple were attacked by gangs at a church in the city and later killed, their family said. Who are Haiti\u2019s gangs? Originally created as enforcers for Haiti\u2019s political and business elite, Haiti\u2019s rival gangs have in recent months formed a broad coalition known as \u201cViv Ansamn,\u201d or \u201cLive together,\u201d and are now coordinating attacks on government institutions like police stations and prisons. Haiti\u2019s National Police have been battling the gangs block by block, but they are understaffed and under-equipped. Since the assassination of then-President Jovenel Moise in 2021, the gangs\u2019 grip has expanded from an estimated 50% of the city to 80% today. Law enforcement sources in Haiti now liken the urban battlefield to quicksand, telling CNN that they need reinforcements to hold and defend territory. Complicating the situation is a torrent of smuggled guns and ammunition arming Haiti\u2019s gangs, despite an arms embargo on the island. Earlier this week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken defended US backing for the international mission, warning a Senate Foreign Relations hearing that without foreign support, Haiti is \u201con the precipice of becoming an all-out failed state.\u201d What is the Multinational Security Support mission? Haiti\u2019s government has been asking for international military assistance since 2022. In October last year, the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) was finally greenlit by the United Nations\u2019 powerful Security Council. Designed to coordinate closely with Haiti\u2019s National Police, the MSS is expected to focus on securing the city\u2019s airport, seaport and key roads, according to people with knowledge of the mission\u2019s planning. Kenya, which volunteered to lead the mission, has committed 1,000 police officers. Most of those are Kenyan border police, chosen for their experience in dealing with armed non-state actors such as Al Shabaab and in operating in foreign contexts such as Somalia, Sudan and Congo, according to Bill O\u2019Neill, the UN expert on human rights in Haiti. According to documents seen by CNN, the mission will be helmed by a Kenyan police commissioner and a Jamaican police lieutenant, with other top posts filled by Kenyan staff. The Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Chad, and Jamaica have also promised to contribute personnel to the mission. Although the MSS was approved more than seven months ago, it has been mired in complications, including court challenges in Kenya and political tumult in Haiti. In March, a surge of gang violence forced then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry to resign shortly after inking a deal with Kenya for the mission; Ruto\u2019s administration has since found a new partner in Haiti\u2019s Transitional Presidential Council, established last month. During the Thursday press conference, journalist Ayub Abdikadir from Kenya\u2019s Citizen TV questioned Ruto on the strategy of sending forces to a crisis in the distant Caribbean while security problems endure in Kenya\u2019s North Rift region. \u201cWhy are you committing to Kenya when we have a problem back home?\u201d he asked. Kenya\u2019s responsibility is broader than its own borders, Ruto responded, underlining that troops and police had already been deployed to \u201csort out the banditry problem\u201d in the North Rift. A UN-managed trust fund for the mission currently contains $21 million, provided by Canada ($8.7 million), the United States ($6 million), France ($3.2 million) and Spain ($3 million), according to the UN. The US and Canada have also committed more, much of it expected to take the form of equipment and other resources. Why hasn\u2019t the MSS begun yet? (A shortage of medevac helicopters, in part) May 23 had been the working deadline for a first instalment of 200 Kenyan police officers to arrive, according to documents seen by CNN. Several dozen Jamaican officers were expected to arrive in Haiti by mid-June, with more trickling in through the summer. This week, a Kenyan team including several police commanders visited Port-au-Prince to assess whether facilities were ready to accommodate a deployment. A base for the MSS near Toussaint Louverture airport in Port-au-Prince is close to completion \u2013 boasting a medical facility and a trauma surgeon already on site \u2013 but the Kenyan delegation concluded that some equipment was insufficient. They were particularly concerned by a lack of helicopters for medical evacuations, multiple sources said, citing confusion over which nation would provide them. Kenyan authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Documents seen by CNN show that El Salvador had been floated as a potential provider of medevac helicopters, which Salvadoran Vice President Felix Ulloa played down as unlikely in comments to CNN. \u201cWe would like to be part of the solution, but we would need a mandate clearly from the United Nations and the acceptance of the host country,\u201d he said, adding that El Salvador could potentially offer its highly trained helicopter pilots and experts to oversee air operations for the MSS if called upon. More equipment, including armored vehicles and radios, is expected to arrive in Haiti for the MSS over the coming days and weeks. What now? Experts on the ground say the Haitian government also has more work to do to lay the groundwork for the mission, particularly in communicating with the public \u2013 and even the gangs \u2013 about how it will work. One source with experience in dealing with Haiti\u2019s gangs said the Transitional Presidential Council should be developing messaging to the gangs themselves about potential \u201coff-ramps\u201d from outright confrontation with the MSS, potentially by turning themselves in or otherwise seeking nonviolent resolution. Haitian police union SPNH17 meanwhile told CNN that plans for their collaboration with the international mission were too opaque and questioned why there wasn\u2019t more focus on providing material support to the local police. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the international community working with a few sectors with no clear plans on what they\u2019ll do and how. We don\u2019t even know how we will communicate with the Kenyan police officers who speaks English. We speak French and Creole in Haiti,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cWe believe only the Haitian police can provide long term security for Haiti. What we need are materials and logistical support.\u201d Haitian anti-corruption group Nou Pap D\u00f2mi (NPD) echoed the concern about transparency, noting that there needs to be clear mechanisms of accountability for the foreign forces\u2019 conduct in Haiti. \u201cWhile NPD believes that international support is necessary to address the crisis, we have always advocated for an approach that focuses primarily on strengthening the Haitian National Police so that it can address these challenges with lasting effect,\u201d the group said in a statement to CNN. Amid the continuing uncertainty this week about when the MSS will come, NPD said: \u201cThe Kenyan mission remains a mystery to the Haitian people; no one knows what it entails and there has been no communication on the matter, despite the arrival of several US military planes in Haiti.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/americas/haiti-gang-mss-kenya-explainer-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

After a short hearing on Friday, Magistrate Daniel Reiss found that Duggan met the conditions for extradition and ordered him to be moved to prison while lawyers for the US wait for Attorney General Mark Dreyfus to approve his removal. Duggan has 15 days to seek a review of the order, which comes 19 months after his arrest in rural New South Wales, just weeks after returning from China to join his family in Australia. Duggan\u2019s wife Saffrine stood outside court with their six children, as she appealed to the Australian authorities to intervene. \u201cWe are absolutely heartbroken and still don\u2019t understand how this could be happening to us,\u201d she said as supporters held up\u00a0signs saying \u201cFree Dan Duggan.\u201d \u201cMy husband is a good man, a great father, a wonderful friend and husband. He faces no Australian charges and has no criminal background whatsoever. Yet he is locked up by the say-so of the United States government,\u201d she added. She described Friday\u2019s hearing as \u201csimply about ticking boxes.\u201d \u201cNow, we respectfully ask the attorney general to take another look at this case and bring my husband home.\u201d A 2017 indictment alleges Duggan trained Chinese military pilots between November 2009 and November 2012, when he was still a US citizen. Duggan met his Australian wife in 2011 and took Australian citizenship the following year. The indictment said that \u201cas early as 2008,\u201d Duggan received an email from the US State Department telling him he was required to register with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and apply for permission to train a foreign air force. Instead, it claims he conspired with others \u2013 including the Test Flying Academy of South Africa (TFASA) \u2013 to export defense services in violation of an arms embargo on China. In a statement to CNN in 2023, TFASA said it complies with the laws of every jurisdiction in which it operates. The statement said Duggan undertook one test-pilot contract for the company in South Africa between November and December 2012, and \u201cnever worked for TFASA on any of its training mandates in China.\u201d Duggan maintains the students he trained were Chinese civilians, including plane enthusiasts and people with ambitions within the civilian aviation industry. His supporters believe he\u2019s been caught up in geopolitics during a time of strained relations between the United States and China and have accused authorities of using him to send a message to former military personnel. Friday\u2019s hearing at Downing Centre Local Court was delayed for almost an hour due to protests that required the proceedings to be moved to a smaller courtroom that became so crowded that some members of the public sat on the floor. Further delays occurred after Reiss asked the floor-sitters to leave the room, warning that anyone who didn\u2019t \u201chold their tongue\u201d could be prosecuted for contempt of court. A spokesperson for the Australian attorney general said the government doesn\u2019t comment on extradition matters. Under Australia\u2019s Extradition Act, Duggan is entitled to appeal directly to the attorney general as to why he shouldn\u2019t be sent to the US. There is no set time period for the attorney general to make a decision, but by law it should be made as soon as practicable.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/australia/daniel-duggan-us-extradition-hearing-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

The disaster hit the village of Kaokalam in Enga Province, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) northwest of the capital, Port Moresby, at about 3 a.m. local time (1 p.m. ET, Thursday). The remoteness of the affected village, home to nearly 4,000 people, is hindering rescue efforts, according to the Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the country. \u201cThe debris is as big as approximately three to four football fields, and is blocking the lifeline of the province\u2019s main highway, which is making the relief efforts all the more difficult,\u201d Serhan Aktoprak told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s already dark. It\u2019s already night time in Papua New Guinea. There\u2019s no power to continue the relief efforts. Only with sunrise will the [IOM] teams be returning,\u201d Aktoprak said. He added that three\u00a0bodies had so far been recovered, but the death toll is likely to increase because of the size of the landslide. The number of people killed or missing is \u201cvery fluid,\u201d but more than 100 are believed to be dead, Janet Philemon, Caretaker and National Treasurer of the Papua New Guinea Red Crescent Society (PNGRCS), told CNN. The local community has been scrambling to reach survivors \u201cwith whatever tools they have at their disposal,\u201d Philemon said. \u201cThe community themselves are responding, trying to bring out and uncover those that have been buried under the landslide,\u201d she added. She said that an earthquake had hit the area a few days prior, which she believed could have contributed to the cause of the landslide. Footage of the aftermath carried by AFP showed a wide scar of mud and rocks on a steep mountainside slope and locals clambering to look for survivors. Prime Minister James Marape said in an earlier statement, reported by the ABC and Reuters, that his government had sent officials from the country\u2019s disaster agency, defence force, and Department of Works and Highways to meet Enga\u2019s provincial and district authorities, and carry out the rescue and relief efforts, as well as the reconstruction of infrastructure. \u201cI extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the landslide disaster,\u201d he said, In comments reported by the ABC, officials said houses were flattened when the side of a nearby mountain gave way. CNN has reached out to local authorities, including Ipatas, as well as the national police and the country\u2019s disaster management agency. A Pacific nation home to around 10 million people, Papua New Guinea is rich in resources, but its economy has long trailed those of its neighbors, and it has one of the highest crime rates in the world. Violence remains widespread. Chaos erupted in the capital earlier this year after police walked off the job in protest over a drop in their pay, which government officials later blamed on a computer glitch in the payroll system. Shops were looted and buildings set on fire during the disturbance. Hundreds of tribes are spread across the country\u2019s remote and often inaccessible terrain.

{"id": "2024_05_23_americas_mexico-stage-collapse-presidential-candidate-intl-hnk", "text": "Nine people were killed and a presidential candidate was briefly taken to hospital after a stage collapsed under heavy winds at a campaign rally in Mexico on Wednesday. Candidate Jorge \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez said he was not injured in the incident, which happened during his campaign event in the northeastern city of San Pedro Garza Garc\u00eda. The governor of Mexico\u2019s Nuevo Leon state said at least 121 people were injured and has offered to pay for funeral and hospital costs for the victims. Among the dead is one minor, Governor Samuel Garc\u00eda Sep\u00falveda said in a post on X, adding that some of the injured are stable while others are undergoing surgery. \u201dWhat we experienced happened in just a few seconds: A gale came, a sudden wind, and unfortunately, it collapsed the stage, resulting in a fatal accident,\u201d \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez told Reuters. \u201cI first saw the musicians\u2019 drums, from the group that was going to play, were going to get blown away. When the others noticed, they ran in different directions; some jumped to the sides (of the stage), and I jumped back.\u201d Videos shared on social media showed the moment a strong gust caused the stage to collapse. \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez and his team can be seen running for cover as the structure, which included a large video screen, falls onto the stage and part of the audience area. Footage taken in the aftermath of the accident shows a large number of emergency vehicles at the scene, their lights flashing in the darkness, as injured people are carried away. The area was cordoned off and guarded by heavily armed security personnel. Nearby observations from Monterrey show there were thunderstorms that brought gusty winds to at least 40 to 50 kilometers (around 25 to 30 miles per hour). The stage location was likely impacted by a gust front, which is when gusty winds suddenly pick up and change direction from nearby thunderstorms. \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez later said he was suspending all campaign activities after the collapse but would remain in the state to monitor the situation and victims. \u201cWe have to have solidarity, there is nothing that can repair an accident, a damage of this nature, and [people] will not be alone in this tragedy and through the consequences that this tragedy will have in their lives,\u201d \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez said. The 38-year old congressman is representing the center-left Citizens\u2019 Movement party, and was named party candidate in January after Garc\u00eda Sep\u00falveda dropped out. Garc\u00eda Sep\u00falveda was forced to return to his duties as governor as political chaos erupted under his interim replacement, making his presidential campaign untenable. During his daily press conference, Mexico\u2019s President\u00a0Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador sent  condolences to the victims\u2019 families and expressed his support for Citizens\u2019 Movement. \u201cWe know that they are not to blame,\u201d he said, calling for authorities to investigate. The vote looms Mexico is heading\u00a0toward its largest election\u00a0in history on June 2, which has been marred by spiking political violence and assassinations. The presidential vote is seen as a two-horse race between a former Mexico City mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, a close ally of the Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and a former senator Xochitl G\u00e1lvez who is representing the opposition coalition. With the two women far ahead in the polls, Mexico is almost certainly going to elect its first female president in June. An estimated 70,000 candidates have stepped forward to compete for more than 20,000 positions, including the national presidency and the governorships of nine states. So far this year,\u00a0at least\u00a028 candidates have been attacked, with 16 killed, according to\u00a0data through April 1 from\u00a0the research group Data C\u00edvica, a figure set to outpace even the bloodiest election cycles in\u00a0Mexico\u2019s past.  Speaking to reporters, \u00c1lvarez M\u00e1ynez said Civil Defense teams had checked the \u201cstructure of the set\u201d prior to the event but that the severity of the wind gusts had caught organizers by surprise. \u201cThe weather conditions were very atypical: the rain didn\u2019t last for even five minutes \u2026 it wasn\u2019t even a storm, it was truly atypical what happened,\u201d he said. The presidential candidate said an investigation into the incident would take place.

{"id": "2024_05_23_asia_china-taiwan-drills-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Tensions are once again ratcheting up in the Taiwan Strait, with China launching two days of military drills encircling Taiwan just days after the democracy swore in a new leader long loathed by Beijing. The exercises began early Thursday, in what China described as \u201cpunishment\u201d for \u201cseparatist acts\u201d \u2013 alluding to the election and inauguration of the self-governing island\u2019s new President Lai Ching-te. China\u2019s military says the drills are designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power\u201d over Taiwan. Though relations between the two sides have been steadily worsening in recent years, this latest escalation marks a significant test for Taiwan\u2019s new leader, whose ruling party has championed democracy in the face of growing threats\u00a0from its authoritarian neighbor. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.\u00a0And it has become much more bellicose under Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Here\u2019s what you need to know. What\u2019s happening with the drills? The Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) said it launched joint military drills involving the army, navy, air force and rocket force in areas around Taiwan early\u00a0Thursday morning. The drills are being conducted in the Taiwan Strait \u2013 a narrow body of water separating the self-ruling island from mainland China \u2013 as well as north, south and east of Taiwan. They are also taking place in areas around Taiwan\u2019s outlying islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin, located just off China\u2019s southeastern coast, the command said in a statement. Naval Colonel Li Xi, spokesperson for the command, called the exercises \u201ca strong punishment for the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces and a serious warning against interference and provocation by external forces.\u201d As part of the drills on Thursday, dozens of Chinese fighter jets carrying live ammunition conducted mock strikes against \u201chigh-value military targets\u201d of the \u201cenemy\u201d alongside destroyers, frigates and missile speedboats, according to China\u2019s state broadcaster CCTV. On Friday, the Eastern Theater Command said it was continuing the drills on both sides of the Taiwan island chain to \u201ctest the ability to jointly seize power, launch joint attacks and occupy key areas.\u201d CCTV aired\u00a0footage that shows PLA soldiers moving mobile artillery and missile systems into position, though it did not show any live fire. China\u2019s military drills are often as much about playing to a domestic audience as signaling intentions internationally. Chinese state media heavily covered the drills while the military also posted footage on social media. The exercises subsequently went viral on China\u2019s heavily regulated internet. How has Taiwan reacted? Taiwan\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had dispatched sea, air and ground forces to respond to China\u2019s drills. It expressed regret at \u201csuch irrational provocations and actions that undermine regional peace and stability.\u201d Taiwan has also been closely monitoring China\u2019s warplanes and naval ships that came close to the island. Between 6 a.m. Thursday and 6 a.m. Friday, the ministry detected 49 Chinese aircraft, 19 warships and seven coast guard vessels. The island\u2019s presidential office said in a statement that it was \u201cconfident and capable of defending national security,\u201d accusing China of \u201cusing unilateral military provocation to threaten Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom.\u201d But despite Beijing\u2019s large show of force, life continued as normal in Taiwan, whose 23 million people have become used to China\u2019s military threats, even as they become more regular and prominent in recent years. \u201cWe are not scared of the Chinese Communist Party, and we have confidence,\u201d\u00a0an 88-year-old retiree, who gave his surname Liu, told CNN. \u201cIf the Chinese Communist Party does attack Taiwan, it won\u2019t be easy for them to take Taiwan. Taiwanese people are not afraid of war.\u201d What triggered this? The most obvious answer is Lai\u2019s inauguration on Monday. Lai\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), now in power for a historic third term, views Taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation with a distinct Taiwanese identity. Ahead of Taiwan\u2019s elections back in January, Beijing had warned that a Lai victory could inflame tensions and spark conflict \u2013 repeatedly framing the vote as a choice between \u201cpeace and war.\u201d Taiwanese voters dismissed those warnings, returning the DPP to power \u2013 although two opposition parties that favor closer ties with China now have a majority in parliament. China\u2019s government and state media regularly rebuke Lai, calling him a dangerous separatist, \u201ctroublemaker\u201d and \u201cwar maker,\u201d while rejecting his repeated offers of talks. Their vehement dislike of Lai is rooted in his political past, as well as Beijing\u2019s refusal to deal directly with a huge swathe of Taiwan\u2019s leaders. The 64-year-old former doctor and political veteran was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence \u2013 a red line for Beijing. His views have tempered over the years, and he now says he favors the status quo, saying there is \u201cno plan or need\u201d to declare independence since the island is \u201calready an independent sovereign country.\u201d But Beijing has never forgiven him for those early comments \u2013 making its stance clear with the drills on Thursday. Lai, too, has set the tone for his new administration\u2019s approach to China \u2013 using his inaugural speech on Monday to declare that a \u201cglorious era of Taiwan\u2019s democracy has arrived,\u201d and reiterating a determination to defend its sovereignty. He also called on Beijing to cease its \u201cintimidation\u201d of Taiwan and respect that its people want to decide their own destiny. What\u2019s the relationship between China and Taiwan? The Chinese Civil War ended with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) taking power in the mainland, establishing the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in Beijing in 1949. The defeated Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan, moving the seat of their Republic of China (ROC) government from the mainland to Taipei. Both proclaimed themselves the sole rightful government of the entire Chinese territory. In recent years, Taiwan has downplayed its territorial claims over mainland China, and is today a vibrant democracy, with its own military, currency, constitution and elected government. But it is not recognized as an independent country by most governments in the world.\u00a0Over the decades it has become increasingly isolated, with a number of governments switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.\u00a0But unofficial diplomatic ties with many Western nations have in fact been bolstered in recent years, in part thanks to China\u2019s saber-rattling. Meanwhile, under Xi, China has become increasingly assertive in foreign policy and grown more authoritarian at home. China has cut official communication with Taiwan since the DPP took office in 2016, and has ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure on the island. At the same time, ties between Taipei and Washington have become more robust, with increased arms sales and high-level political engagement under Lai\u2019s popular predecessor Tsai Ing-wen. This has infuriated Beijing, spurring it to unleash more pressure on Taiwan and sending cross-strait relations on a downward spiral. Where does the US stand in this? The US formally switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 \u2013 but has long trod a delicate middle path. In what is known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, Washington recognizes the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China; it also acknowledges Beijing\u2019s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never accepted the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s claim of sovereignty over the island. The US maintains close unofficial ties with Taiwan, which have been strengthened in recent years. It is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and supplies it with defensive weaponry. American lawmakers regularly visit Taiwan and have supported legislation to bolster US support for the island and its defensive capabilities. But it has historically remained deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan in case of a Chinese invasion, a policy known as \u201cstrategic ambiguity.\u201d After the election in January, the US sent a bipartisan delegation to Taiwan, where they met with Lai and Tsai \u2013 and promised that American support for\u00a0Taiwan\u00a0will continue no matter who wins the upcoming US election.

The supermodel, whose father is Palestinian-American real-estate developer Mohamed Hadid, drew praise from some on social media after she was pictured walking on the promenade in a dress by design duo Michael and Hushi. \u201cOur Palestinian princess,\u201d\u00a0wrote one user on X.\u00a0\u201cLoving this homage to her Palestinian roots,\u201d praised a separate user on Instagram, while another comment read, \u201cThis is fashion with purpose.\u201d The supermodel later reposted a picture of the dress with the caption \u201cFree Palestine forever\u201d in her stories on Instagram, where she is frequently vocal about violence against Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza. In October last year, she wrote in a statement posted to Instagram: \u201cMy heart is bleeding with pain from the trauma I am seeing unfold, as well as the generational trauma of my Palestinian blood,\u201d referencing those killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. And on May 15, Hadid marked Nakba Day (commemorating the time in 1948 when an estimated 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes)\u00a0with a post\u00a0sharing her family\u2019s history as Nakba survivors and pleading for an end to the war in Gaza. \u201cPlease look into the eyes of the Palestinians suffering,\u201d she wrote. The keffiyeh scarf, on which Hadid\u2019s dress is based, is worn across the Middle East. But in recent decades, it\u00a0has come to be identified as a symbol of Palestinian identity and resistance. Hadid\u2019s dress is from the archives of\u00a0Michael and Hushi, a New York-based brand founded by Michael Sears and Hushidar Mortezaie. The dress retailed for $900 in September 2001 and was featured in magazines including Women\u2019s Wear Daily and Wallpaper, according to an Instagram post by Mortezaie.  Some on social media were quick to point out that Hadid\u2019s dress was not technically a Palestinian\u00a0keffiyeh, with the colors more closely resembling those used in Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Mortezaie, one of the original designers, explained the intentions behind the dress. \u201cThis dress was made 23 years ago and everyone from the region was grouped as one big Other. There was no Google. Only what could be put together with little resources. Hopefully we can all learn to stand in unity and love against genocide,\u201d\u00a0he wrote on Instagram. Another Michael and Hushi creation made its way onto \u201cSex and the City,\u201d with Carrie Bradshaw\u00a0sporting a black-and-white\u00a0keffiyeh\u00a0tank\u00a0top\u00a0in season 4 of the show.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/style/bella-hadid-keffiyeh-dress-cannes-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_asia_myanmar-rohingya-arson-buthidaung-intl-hnk", "text": "Families of Rohingya people trapped in Myanmar\u2019s west are desperately trying to contact loved ones after a weekend of widespread arson attacks displaced up to 200,000 people and caused extensive destruction of homes. The country\u2019s Rohingya have long suffered mass atrocities and forced displacement that many \u2013 including UN experts \u2013 consider to be genocide, perpetrated by the country\u2019s military. Now, they are caught between warring forces in a deepening conflict that has unleashed more violence against the Muslim-majority community. Since\u00a0seizing power in a coup in February 2021, the military has been fighting a widening civil war against ethnic armed groups and people\u2019s resistance forces across Myanmar. In the western state of Rakhine, the Arakan Army, a powerful ethnic-minority armed group battling Myanmar\u2019s military junta, said it seized a predominantly Rohingya town close to the Bangladesh border. Reports from activists and relatives of residents have emerged of AA soldiers torching and looting Rohingya houses in the town of Buthidaung, preventing people from returning home, confiscating phones and threatening to kill those who try to contact family abroad. A junta-imposed internet and telecoms blackout in the state is making it almost impossible for relatives to speak with family members there and for journalists, activists and international monitoring groups to verify exactly what is unfolding. Farooq, a Rohingya poet living as a refugee in neighboring Bangladesh, told CNN that most of his family were still in Buthidaung but he has not been able to reach them since Saturday. \u201cThen, my brother-in-law told me that my family were displaced, and my home was burned down by the Arakan Army,\u201d he said. Rohingya rights activists and former officials said about 200,000 people had been forced to flee their homes to escape the fires and that many people, including women and children, had spent multiple nights hiding out in open paddy fields with no food, medicine, or belongings. There are also reports of an unconfirmed number of casualties. CNN cannot independently verify these reports. But satellite imagery showed huge fires engulfed downtown Buthidaung on Saturday morning and continued to burn over the weekend. Remote sensing data curated by NASA\u2019s Fire Information for Resource Management System and viewed by CNN suggests that the fires spread in the early hours, while satellite imagery collected by space technology company Maxar and obtained by CNN shows large-scale destruction across Buthidaung on that day. \u201cThe entire town is burning,\u201d said Nay San Lwin, a Rohingya activist originally from Buthidaung, and co-founder of the Free Rohingya Coalition. \u201cFew houses remain intact, only a few.\u201d The violence echoes attacks on the stateless Rohingya community in 2016 and 2017, when Myanmar\u2019s military launched a\u00a0brutal campaign\u00a0of killing, rape and arson that\u00a0is currently subject to a genocide investigation at the International Court of Justice. An estimated 1 million Rohingya people live now in what many consider to be the world\u2019s largest refugee camp in Bangladesh, after hundreds of thousands fled the military\u2019s \u201cclearance operations.\u201d Many of those who remained in Myanmar live in apartheid-like conditions and face heavy restrictions on their movement, education and healthcare. More than 100,000 Rohingya people\u00a0have been\u00a0kept in squalid displacement camps by the military and government in the Rakhine state capital for the past 10 years. Others have made perilous boat journeys to Indonesia, choosing to risk their lives at sea over enduring inhumane conditions at home. Young Rohingya men also face forcible conscription from the junta, the AA and armed Rohingya insurgent groups both in Myanmar and in the sprawling Bangladesh camps where gang violence is escalating. Experts with the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar on Sunday warned that the Rohingya are \u201cagain at risk of genocide\u201d and urged the UN Human Rights Council to convene a special session to address the \u201cworsening human rights emergency in Myanmar.\u201d UN rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk said\u00a0in a statement on Sunday that \u201cthis is a critical period when the risk of yet further atrocity crimes is particularly acute.\u201d Buthidaung attacks Fighting between the Arakan Army and Myanmar\u2019s military erupted in November after a shaky ceasefire broke down. The AA has made significant territorial gains in Rakhine state in recent months and last week announced that it had taken control of all junta military bases around Buthidaung, as well as the town itself. Aung Kyaw Moe, a\u00a0Rohingya\u00a0adviser to Myanmar\u2019s shadow National Unity Government \u2013 a continuation of the administration deposed in the coup \u2013 wrote on Saturday that the AA had ordered residents to leave the town in the days before the attack. \u201cTwo days before AA call elders for meeting to leave the houses as soon as possible AA will confiscate the Buthidaung downtown,\u201d he wrote on X, adding \u201cthe\u00a0Rohingya\u00a0said they will not leave because they have no where to go.\u201d In recent weeks, the population of Buthidaung had swelled as residents fled fighting in nearby villages, Rohingya activists said. Nay San Lwin from the Free Rohingya Coalition \u2013\u00a0who managed to speak with several residents of Buthidaung \u2013\u00a0said that, at 9:30 p.m. local time on May 17, AA soldiers entered the town and shortly after began torching homes. Reports also suggested that junta airstrikes and artillery\u00a0had\u00a0hit Buthidaung that day but there were no military soldiers left in the town, he said. \u201cI asked them about who are conducting the burning \u2013 they strictly said the AA members came into town and started shooting into the air and warning people to get out of their houses or you will be burned alive,\u201d he said. John Quinley, director of human rights group Fortify Rights, said there is \u201cclear destruction of civilian infrastructure including Rohingya civilian homes.\u201d \u201cWhat we have in Buthidaung over the last few days is the junta conducting artillery shelling and airstrikes\u2026 and signs pointing to the AA conducting widespread arson over the weekend,\u201d he said. AA spokesperson Khaing Thu Kha\u00a0wrote\u00a0on Telegram Friday evening that the armed group was \u201cevacuating the Muslim communities in Buthidaung and providing food, shelter, and medical care for them including the children, the women, and elderly persons.\u201d The AA has denied it torched the town, saying in a statement\u00a0on May 20 that it \u201cadheres to its principle of fighting under the military code of conduct and never targets non-military objects.\u201d It accused the Myanmar military, along with allied Rohingya militant groups \u2013 which it refers to as \u201cBengali terrorists\u201d \u2013 of destroying Buthidaung. The AA said that on May 17 the Myanmar military \u201claunched a prolonged aerial attack on Buthidaung township until midnight as their last desperate attacks.\u201d A previous statement from the AA in late April said that homes of non-Muslim people living in Buthidaung had been burned down in attacks by \u201cjunta-backed Bengali Muslim terrorist groups\u201d and \u201cother Muslim militants recently armed and trained by the junta.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify these claims. Farooq, whose family were forced to flee the fires, said it was the AA who set fire to villages and the homes of the Rohingya. There was no active fighting with the military at the time, he said. \u201cIn Buthidaung, when my (family) home and when my mom was asked to leave the village, there was no fight at all. There is no military left, no base, no junta there,\u201d he said. He said AA soldiers had warned residents there not to contact people living abroad and anyone caught with a Bangladesh SIM card \u201cwill be executed.\u201d Nay San Lwin also said he had heard reports that AA soldiers were taking cash and mobile phones from fleeing Rohingya. \u201cThey are afraid they have footage (of them) torching these houses,\u201d he said. In recent weeks, Buthidaung\u2019s residents had been subject to increasing violence by junta forces, rights groups and activists have said. Satellite imagery from Planet Labs, obtained by CNN, shows that western neighborhoods were affected by fire damage in mid-April and the Pan Zinn Chaung Bridge\u2014a crucial artery on the eastern edge of the city\u2014was destroyed prior to Friday\u2019s arson attacks. Humanitarian offices of Medecins\u00a0Sans Fronti\u00e8res in the town were burned down on April 15, the group said. \u201cWe hear reports of more than 200 homes being burned down and witness thousands of people who are displaced by the violence seeking refuge in an area directly across from where our office was located,\u201d it said at the time. Warnings of further atrocities An immediate concern is a humanitarian crisis in Rakhine state, with newly displaced residents unable to access food or clean water. \u201cThere are no NGOs at all, who will distribute food for them? The Myanmar military has blocked all access,\u201d said Nay San Lwin. \u201cAlso they are confining people to these villages. They are not allowed to leave.\u201d The violence has sparked a flurry of condemnations from human rights groups and the international community, calling for a halt in the fighting, to protect civilians, and for humanitarian aid to be allowed into Rakhine. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US is \u201cdeeply troubled by the reports of increased violence\u201d in Rakhine state and warned there are \u201crisks of further atrocities occurring.\u201d \u201cThe military\u2019s previous acts of genocide and other crimes against humanity targeting Rohingya, in addition to its history of stoking intercommunal tensions in Rakhine State and elsewhere across the country, underscore the grave dangers to civilians.\u201d Myanmar\u2019s National Unity Government said on Tuesday that it has \u201crepeatedly acknowledged that shameful past actions and failures in Myanmar allowed horrendous atrocities to be committed against minority communities, including the Rohingya, Rakhine and others in Rakhine state.\u201d \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that these crimes are never repeated.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/asia/myanmar-rohingya-arson-buthidaung-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_22_europe_ukraine-russia-lyptsi-kharkiv-intl", "text": "There are some towns that\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0can just never afford to lose, and Lyptsi is one of them. But the grip\u00a0the\u00a0nation\u00a0keeps is tenuous:\u00a0The streets are aflame from an airstrike moments earlier when we race in, under\u00a0the\u00a0cover of darkness. Night affords them the only\u00a0respite\u00a0from drone assault; the hours before we arrive have seen the town hit eight\u00a0times. Yet the soldiers of the 13th Khartiia National Guard have to endure, as the stakes here are huge. Russia\u2019s relentless onslaught has a key goal:\u00a0If they take Lyptsi, then they can position artillery within range of Ukraine\u2019s second city, Kharkiv, 20 minutes down the road. Down in a bunker, Oleksandr, a commander, looks at one of his many drone feeds. \u201cYou saw yourself how everything is burning. It is like that every night.\u201d His men were among the first to tackle Russia\u2019s new advance into Kharkiv region nearly two weeks ago. He says they are fighting trained professional\u00a0soldiers. \u201cWe can see it from their equipment and tactics,\u201d\u00a0he says. \u201cThey\u2019re not sending just anyone into the assaults.\u201d His stare lengthens when asked about what fortifications were in place before the surprise Russian attack. \u201cNothing was prepared here. Nothing. Just nothing. All the positions are being built by the hands of infantry.\u201d Outside, the night is shaken by more blasts. \u201cThree weeks ago the civilians were living a peaceful life here. Rebuilding, everything was\u00a0all right,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now most of the houses are ruined.\u201d As we leave, a loud drone buzzes overhead, close by. Our escort does not flinch or run. I ask if the drone is friendly. \u201cHow the f*** should I know?\u201d\u00a0he replies, tugging on a cigarette. All around the city of Kharkiv, home to an estimated million civilians, Ukrainian forces are trying to hold back a persistent Russian assault from multiple angles. Over a week reporting in the villages around the city, CNN saw Ukrainian units holding their positions at great peril and risk, and sometimes using aged and scant artillery to fend off a much better equipped Russian force, able to thwart their most basic\u00a0maneuvers\u00a0with huge numbers of drones. At one position closer to the Russian border, the 92nd Assault Brigade showed CNN a Russian artillery gun, captured in the first days of the war, from which they are now firing French mortar shells. The gun was partially hidden by a wire net, aimed\u00a0at providing\u00a0some protection from an attack drone. Yet above, an\u00a0unidentified scout drone began to hover, forcing the unit to run into a bunker. Another unit\u00a0is\u00a0forced to use a Soviet artillery gun made in the 1940s. Hidden in dense foliage, its metal is rusty in parts, limiting how often it can be fired. Artun, their commander, uses newer Polish shells, but now only fires 10\u00a0a day, when in the autumn it was\u00a0100. Drones are \u201ca big problem,\u201d\u00a0Artun\u00a0says. \u201cI have shrapnel in me as a keepsake,\u201d he adds, referring to the remnants of a Russian Lancet drone still in his hand and stomach, which\u00a0the surgeons could not remove. \u201cBut there are certain actions that can save you from drones.\u201d One of them springs into life: an alert from a $30 frequency scanner on his webbing. It has picked up the approach of another Orlan drone, sending Artun into the bunker. He looks out into the sky above, and sees it pass overhead. He commands a diverse unit, epitomizing the manpower challenges Ukraine is facing in its third year of war. Some, like him, are wounded infantrymen, put on the guns further back from the front. Others are older,\u00a0while\u00a0one of his team is on his first day in artillery. For nearly two years,\u00a0Kharkiv\u00a0thought the threat from its neighbour had passed. A lightning Russian retreat in late 2022 left Kharkiv region peaceful and the launchpad for Ukrainian attacks across the border into Russia proper. Attacks persisted\u00a0in the distance\u00a0however,\u00a0keeping the city\u2019s residents awake through violently loud nights, now amplified by the threat of Russian artillery edging closer. Flares, anti-aircraft fire,\u00a0and blasts regularly punctuate the enforced blackout, as Russian drones, rockets and airstrikes hit targets in the dark. On Wednesday, city officials reported an attack on a gas station, which left four people in hospital.\u00a0On Sunday, two missiles struck a lakeside resort in Cherkaska Lozova, outside the city\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a horrifying attack on a civilian target which also used a \u201cdouble-tap\u201d tactic, in which a second missile hit 10\u00a0minutes after the first, injuring first responders. A few hours after\u00a0Sunday\u2019s\u00a0blasts, rescue workers clambered over the ruins of a waterside terrace,\u00a0retrieving\u00a0two bodies from the seven who died in the attack. One was a woman,\u00a0seven\u00a0months pregnant. Another was only found later, their body fragments in the wreckage. As police combed the eviscerated terrace on the lake for evidence, another air alert sounded, causing half the workers to flee for cover, and some to carry on, almost oblivious.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/europe/ukraine-russia-lyptsi-kharkiv-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_20_uk_julian-assange-wikileaks-extradition-hearing-uk-intl-gbr", "text": "London\u2019s High Court has ruled that Julian Assange has the right to appeal in his final challenge against extradition to the United States. The legal victory for the WikiLeaks founder was cheered by dozens of his supporters as they rallied outside the court in the British capital. Some beat drums, some shouted \u201cdrop the case,\u201d while other supporters held placards reading \u201cLet him go Joe,\u201d in reference to US President Joe Biden. Assange\u2019s legal team argued in Monday\u2019s hearing that the judges, Victoria Sharp and Jeremy Johnson, should not accept the assurances given by US prosecutors that he could seek to rely on the rights and protections under the US First Amendment. His team made the case that, if extradited, Assange could be discriminated against on the basis of his nationality, as an Australian-born foreign national. In a short ruling, the judges said the US submissions were not sufficient, granting Assange permission to a full appeal in relation to the legal points on freedom of speech and nationality. A date has not yet been set for the next hearing. The 52-year-old is wanted by US authorities on\u00a0espionage charges connected to his organization\u2019s publication of thousands of classified documents and diplomatic cables in 2010 and 2011. Assange faces spending the rest of his life behind bars if convicted. Stella Assange, Julian\u2019s wife, said outside the court that Monday\u2019s ruling \u201cmarks a turning point.\u201d \u201cEveryone can see what is going on here: the US case is offensive, it offends our democratic principles. It offends our right to know it is an attack on journalists everywhere,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe are relieved as a family that the courts took the right decision today. But how long can this go on for?\u201d Activist Redde Jean-Baptiste told CNN that one of Assange\u2019s lawyers had said the WikiLeaks founder had been having sleepless nights. \u201c(He\u2019s) trying to prepare for a case that would determine his life or his death, so as you can imagine the pressure he\u2019s been under that is torture in itself,\u201d Jean-Baptiste said. Jean-Baptiste added that Monday\u2019s ruling is a \u201cglimpse of hope for him\u201d and \u201cwe are now on the right path.\u201d In March, the London court delayed its decision on an extradition as the judges sought a series of assurances, around both the First Amendment protections and the death penalty. The United States will not seek a\u00a0death\u00a0penalty if Assange is extradited, the High Court was told on Monday. \u201cThe United States assures that he will not be tried for a death-eligible offence,\u201d according to documents submitted by lawyers representing the US government. It has been 12 years since the Australian has lived freely. Assange has spent the past five years in London\u2019s high-security Belmarsh prison and nearly seven years before that holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in the city\u00a0trying to avoid arrest. He maintains his extradition is politically motivated. Alan Rusbridger, editor of the UK political monthly Prospect Magazine, wrote in an op-ed for CNN that working with Assange was \u201coften a bumpy ride\u201d but that their collaboration while he was still the Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief was \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d He added that the US case looks \u201clike a very belated attempt to punish whistleblowers and discourage journalists, whether conventional or not, from poking their noses where they\u2019re not welcome.\u201d This story has been updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/uk/julian-assange-wikileaks-extradition-hearing-uk-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

In a post on X, Duckworth said she was \u201cbeyond relieved that Dr. Hamawy \u2013 and his entire team \u2013 safely left Gaza today and that he will be able to see his family again soon.\u201d Hamawy previously turned down an evacuation offer, refusing to leave his non-US colleagues behind, who\u00a0weren\u2019t afforded the option to leave earlier. \u201cIt was only US citizens who could leave. There were spots for 20 people, and there are 20 US citizens. No one else could go. It was that simple,\u201d Hamawy told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic doctor concept for me as a US former service member that you don\u2019t leave your teammates behind. On leaving Gaza, Hamawy told CNN,\u00a0\u201cWe are glad that we are out and that we all left together. Our hearts are with the people who still have to endure and cannot leave.\u201d \u201cWe hope that medical relief is allowed to replace us soon and a permanent ceasefire puts an end to this nightmare.\u201d The evacuation was a multi-lateral effort involving Jordan and the US. Australian, Egyptian, Irish and Omani nationals were among the evacuees.\u00a0The team were told to follow a specific route to the\u00a0Kerem Shalom crossing and were taken by the Jordanian military to the King Hussein Bridge. On May 19, Hamawy wrote a letter to US President Joe Biden\u00a0detailing the realities on the ground. \u201cI have never in my career witnessed the level of atrocities and targeting of my medical colleagues as I have in Gaza.\u201d He\u00a0urged Biden and the international community to allow free passage for medical personnel into Gaza, adding: \u201cThe children of Palestine are not safe.

The streams of patients, mostly children, are rising faster than we can keep up with fewer medical staff.\u201d More than 35,000 people have been killed in Israel\u2019s seven-month military offensive, most of them women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. According to Hamawy, the European Hospital is \u201cthe last standing hospital that\u2019s functionating like a functional medical center.\u201d Many hospitals have been forced to evacuate and, \u201cthe ones before them have all been raided and destroyed.\u201d No medical team replaced the healthcare professionals who evacuated Tuesday, leaving the hospital with even fewer workers to look after patients with increasingly fewer resources.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/21/middleeast/european-hospital-gaza-medics-freed-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

Located in the Niger Delta region, Rivers State is a key oil-producing area in Nigeria. It hosts several major oil companies and boasts several oil wells. Despite its vast oil wealth, the region has faced oil theft and sabotage over the years and suffers from a high unemployment rate. Building an investor\u2019s paradise However, Fubara emphasized that his administration is taking measures to re-industrialize the state and bring back numerous production factories that had shut down operations. During the two-day Rivers State Economic and Investment Summit (RSEIS), themed \u201cRivers Emerge: Advancing Pathways to Economic Growth and Sustainability,\u201d held at the Dr. Obi Wali International Conference Centre in Port Harcourt, Sanusi delivered a keynote address where he called for better management of the state\u2019s resources. \u201cWith rich abundant land, abundant resources, and natural resources, as well as the strategic location of the state, Rivers can be one of the best investors paradises, not just in Nigeria but in West Africa if the right things can be done,\u201d Sanusi said. The Emir of Kano stressed that a prosperous future relies on the capacity of state institutions and the quality and skills of its population. He drew comparisons with countries like Japan, Singapore, Germany, Australia, and Rwanda, which have thrived without significant natural resources, attributing their success to good governance, innovation, and education. Fubara highlighted the various measures taken to make Rivers State a destination for all categories of investors. \u201cWe have already implemented certain policy initiatives and reforms, including the prompt allocation and issuance of land titles and certificates of occupancy to prospective investors and a moratorium on State taxes and levies on new businesses. We are also working on the harmonization of state and local government taxes to eliminate double taxation and the imposition of multiple levies on investors,\u201d he said. Fubara also announced a N4 billion (over $2.7 million)\u00a0matching fund loan scheme with the Bank of Industry Limited for small, micro, and medium-scale businesses to drive financial inclusion and enhance the growth and development of these businesses. \u2018Oil is not a curse, the curse is the leaders\u2019 Sanusi pointed out that while countries like Russia, the UAE, and Norway have benefitted from their natural resources, their success also hinges on visionary governance and strong institutions. He argued that resources can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on leadership. \u201cOil is not a curse; the curse is the leaders we have had,\u201d he said. Fubara detailed further initiatives, including providing hundreds of hectares of land for projects like a multi-billion-naira aluminum rolling mill and collaborations with international firms to develop the state\u2019s agricultural potential. He emphasized the importance of reviving abandoned agricultural projects and infrastructure, saying he would set aside about $10 million for these efforts this fiscal year. Governor Fubara highlighted the investment opportunities across diverse sectors, including oil and gas, agriculture, manufacturing, hospitality, tourism, education, ICT, healthcare, infrastructure development, glass products, garments production, and power generation and transmission. With over 40% of fertile cultivable landmass, Rivers State has the potential to significantly contribute to national food security through commercial investments in mechanized agriculture and agro-processing industrial value chains, he said. In his keynote address, former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Moghalu, said that due to the prevalence of poor governance in Nigeria, the abundant human and natural resources in the country have not been sufficiently harnessed to achieve the desired prosperity. He particularly advocated for the implementation of well-meaning policies to dismantle barriers to doing business while promoting transparency and building investor confidence. Moghalu added that, alongside developing requisite skills among the people and building enduring critical infrastructure, the foundation for good and competent governance should be assured to make the foreign direct investment (FDI) sought truly beneficial to the country. Sanusi concluded by highlighting the importance of investing in human capital and creating an education system that meets contemporary labor market demands. He called for an end to corruption in the judiciary, sensible tax policies, and the development of a skilled workforce to reduce dependence on foreign expertise. He urged Rivers State to aspire beyond being a recipient of federal allocations to becoming a commercial and industrial hub where citizens enjoy a decent standard of living.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/africa/nigerias-rivers-state-investor-magnet-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_22_india_pune-india-teen-drunk-driving-anger-intl-hnk", "text": "Anger is growing in India after a teenager who allegedly killed two people while drunk driving was ordered to write an essay as punishment, with many demanding a harsher penalty and accusing the judiciary of leniency. The 17-year-old boy was allegedly speeding in a Porsche in the city of Pune\u00a0on Sunday when the vehicle hit a motorcycle, killing two people, according to Maharashtra state\u2019s deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The minor was taken into custody and later presented to the Juvenile Justice Board, where he was released on bail and given 15 days of community service. He was also asked to write an essay about road safety, Fadnavis said. \u201cThe outrage grew after this. According to police, the boy is 17 years and 8 months. This is a heinous crime,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday, pointing to the 2015 changes to India\u2019s juvenile laws, which allow children above 16 to be tried as adults if they allegedly commit a \u201cheinous\u201d crime. \u201cThis was a surprising order passed (by the Juvenile Justice Board),\u201d Fadnavis said. Following the outrage, the minor\u2019s lawyer, Prashant Patil, on Wednesday told reporters that the teen\u2019s bail terms were modified, with the Juvenile Justice Board ordering him to remain in a rehabilitation home until June 5. The minor will receive counseling, Patil said. CNN has attempted to contact the Patil for comment. Fadnavis added that Pune police are investigating the minor for alleged culpable homicide not amounting to murder. They have also asked the Juvenile Court to review its bail order, he said. CCTV video, purportedly filmed moments before the crash, shows a white Porsche speeding down a busy main road. People can be seen rushing to the scene of the crash, which is not pictured in the video that was shared widely on social media and broadcast on local news channels. The minor\u2019s father has been arrested for allegedly allowing his son to drive despite being underage, according to Pune Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar. The legal driving age in India is 18. Three people who served the minor liquor have also been arrested, Kumar added. \u201cWe have adopted the most stringent possible approach, and we shall do whatever is at our command to ensure that the two young lives that were lost get justice, and the accused gets duly punished,\u201d he said. The incident has dominated headlines in India and sparked widespread anger, with many taking to social media to condemn the boy\u2019s bail conditions. Suresh Koshta, whose 24-year-old daughter was killed in the crash, urged authorities to take tougher action against the alleged driver. \u201cIt was wrong (to allow the minor to drive),\u201d he told reporters outside his home, while fighting back tears. \u201cOne needs to know how to drive first.\u201d Rahul Gandhi, the leader of India\u2019s main opposition, the Indian National Congress, questioned whether a bus or taxi driver would be given the same punishment. \u201cIf a 16-17-year-old son of a wealthy household, driving a Porsche under the influence, is caught, he is asked to write an essay,\u201d Gandhi said in a video posted to X. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t essays assigned to truck drivers or bus drivers?\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time a court\u2019s verdict has been scrutinized in this manner. In 2015, Bollywood superstar\u00a0Salman Khan, who was facing a lengthy prison sentence for a fatal hit-and-run, got a reprieve when the Bombay High Court tossed out his conviction for lack of evidence, causing widespread outrage. \u201cOn basis of evidences produced by the prosecution, the appellant cannot be convicted, no matter how differently the common man thinks,\u201d the court said. The hit-and-run incident took place outside a Mumbai bakery in September 2002, with prosecutors saying Khan ran over five sleeping men after losing control of his vehicle. He was returning from a bar after a night of drinking, they said. The actor said he wasn\u2019t the driver. One of the victims was killed; the others injured.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/22/india/pune-india-teen-drunk-driving-anger-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

Cracks in walls and falling cornices were reported, Italy\u2019s Fire Brigade spokesman confirmed to CNN. The 4.4 earthquake at a depth of 3 kilometers is the strongest earthquake to hit the highly seismic area in the past 40 years, according to INGV data. The quake is part of an ongoing \u201cseismic storm\u201d that has seen more than a dozen events over 2.0 magnitude in the past 48 hours. The 4.4 tremblor at 8:10 p.m. local time was preceded by a 3.5 earthquake an hour earlier. The INGV recorded 1,252 earthquakes in the Campi Flegrei area in the month of April 2024, most with a magnitude less than 1.0. The last major eruption of the supervolcano was in 1538, which resulted in the creation of a new bay on the southern Italian coast. The INGV has noted an increase of seismic activity since 2022, which could be due either to the building up of magma under the surface or the building up of gases, according to several volcanologists. The volcano is about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Mt. Vesuvius, and prone to a phenomenon known as bradyseism, during which the ground raises and falls due to pressure under the surface. The last major cycle was in 1984, but several volcanologists told CNN that the area is experiencing a new cycle of the phenomenon. More than 500,000 people live in the red zone directly adjacent to the Campi Flegrei, according to the Italian Civil Protection agency, which has been working this year to update evacuation plans in the event of a major disaster.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/20/europe/earthquake-italy-campi-flegrei-super-volcano-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

The USS Harder lies under 3,000 feet (about 900 meters) of water off the northern Philippine island of Luzon, sitting upright and intact except for damage behind its conning tower from a Japanese depth charge, the NHHC said in a press release. Harder was lost in battle on August 24, 1944, along with its entire crew of 79 submariners, while on its sixth patrol of the war, as the US sought to retake the Philippines from occupying Japanese forces. \u201cHarder was lost in the course of victory. We must not forget that victory has a price, as does freedom,\u201d NHHC Director Samuel J. Cox, a retired US Navy admiral, said in the press release. According to a US Navy history, Harder sank two Japanese escort ships off the Bataan Peninsula on August 22, 1944, and then headed north along the Luzon coast with two other subs in search of more targets. In a battle with Japanese escort ship CD-22 on the morning of August 24, Harder fired three torpedoes that missed and was later sunk by the Japanese ship\u2019s fifth depth charge attack, according to Japanese records cited by NHHC. The NHHC said the wreck of the Harder was confirmed by data provided by the Lost 52 Project, an effort led by Tim Taylor, CEO of Tiburon Subsea, to find the 52 US subs lost in World War II. The group has previously located at least six WWII subs, the NHHC said. \u201cWe are grateful that Lost 52 has given us the opportunity to once again honor the valor of the crew of the \u2018Hit \u2018em Harder\u2019 submarine,\u201d the NHHC\u2019s Cox said, in reference to the vessel\u2019s motto. The NHHC said the wreck is \u201cthe final resting place of Sailors that gave their life in defense of the nation and should be respected by all parties as a war grave.\u201d The Philippines was a US territory attacked by Japan just after its strike on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. By the spring of 1942, US and Philippine forces on Luzon surrendered to Tokyo\u2019s forces and Japan used the captured archipelago to protect its supply lines from the East Indies and Southeast Asia. But by mid-1944, the US was rolling back Japanese gains across the Pacific, and was planning landings to do the same in the Philippines. Harder,  which had the motto of \u201cHit \u2018em Harder,\u201d was captained by Cmdr. Samuel Dealey, who would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, the US military\u2019s highest decoration, for his actions in Harder\u2019s fifth patrol, from March to July 1944. During that time Harder sank three Japanese destroyers with another two likely destroyed or heavily damaged over the course of just four days, according to the National Medal of Honor Museum. The museum\u2019s page on Dealey described one particularly harrowing encounter. Coming under attack from a Japanese destroyer, Dealey ordered a head-on torpedo shot at the bow of the charging enemy, known as a \u201cdown the throat\u201d shot, according to the museum account. \u201cAt 1,500 yards, Dealey fired three torpedoes and ordered the sub to dive.\u00a0\u00a0As the\u00a0Harder\u00a0passed 80 feet underneath the destroyer, two of the torpedoes struck the ship, sending shock waves through the submarine.\u201d On its first four patrols after commissioning on December 2, 1942, Harder sank 14 Japanese warships and merchant vessels, according to the Medal of Honor Museum.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/asia/wwii-submarine-wreck-uss-harder-found-philippines-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}

Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s 1895 work \u201cFrom the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,\u201d the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire \u201cour own Notre Dame moment,\u201d referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is \u201cat a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.\u201d It said it was \u201ca sad day for our country\u201d and that \u201cthe damage will unfortunately be very expensive.\u201d \u201cWe have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,\u201d Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN.

Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building\u2019s roof need to be removed to extinguish it.

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters.

Since rising to the top of the rankings, the Polish star has been a dominant force in women\u2019s tennis, winning 16 titles \u2013 21 in total \u2013 and only once dropping from the No. 1 spot for an eight-week period last year. She is unmatched in her ability to sweep aside opponents in brutal fashion, and her habit of winning sets 6-0 \u2013 referred to as a \u201cbagel\u201d \u2013 and 6-1 \u2013 a \u201cbreadstick\u201d \u2013 has led to jokes from tennis fans about \u015awi\u0105tek running a bakery. After claiming back-to-back titles in Madrid and Rome, the 22-year-old is in auspicious form as she attempts to win the fifth grand slam of her young career at the French Open, entering the tournament on a 12-match winning streak. In the current era of women\u2019s tennis, no player has achieved so much in such a short space of time, and even \u015awi\u0105tek admits that her success has been a surprise. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s hard to get a grasp on it because it all happened so fast,\u201d she tells CNN Sport. \u201cWhen I was younger, I wouldn\u2019t even expect myself to be in the top five, (let alone) these kinds of stats. \u201cFor sure, I\u2019m proud of myself and of the team, because without them I wouldn\u2019t be in that place.\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek is most prolific on her preferred surface of clay, and the French Open, where she is a three-time champion, is her favorite of the four grand slams. She has only lost twice at Roland Garros, accumulating 28 wins since her debut in 2019. Whichever qualifier or lucky loser faces \u015awi\u0105tek in the first round could be the next victim. But being the world No. 1 and commanding so much success in a single tournament comes with its own challenges, particularly when you\u2019re the one player in the draw everyone wants to beat. \u201cSometimes I get this feeling off the court a little bit, or when I analyze these matches and I see that these players were super-motivated, more than usual when they played against me,\u201d says \u015awi\u0105tek. \u201cBut on the other hand, when you\u2019re on court, you don\u2019t have time to think about things like that \u2026 The best way, honestly, is really taking it step-by-step, not looking at the draws and not thinking what can happen in the quarterfinals or semifinals because there\u2019s still a long way (to go).\u201d Having spent more than 100 weeks as the world No. 1, \u015awi\u0105tek is growing used to the added pressures and responsibilities of being the world\u2019s top-ranked player. The process, however, has been a learning curve: as well as handling her high expectations for every tournament, she has had to deal with increased focus from the media and the demands of her widening portfolio of sponsors. For a self-described introvert, that hasn\u2019t always been straightforward. \u201cPeople really accept that I\u2019m an introvert and sometimes I like things quiet and not too much noise around me,\u201d says \u015awi\u0105tek. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to really take it easy and manage all these obligations well so it\u2019s not too much.\u201d One way of handling these demands has been working closely with her sports psychologist, Daria Abramowicz, who travels around the world as part of \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s team of trainers. The focus is primarily on performance \u2013 improving concentration, dealing with high-pressure environments, and learning how to stay calm on the court \u2013 but Abramowicz\u2019s influence also extends beyond that. \u201cWhen we started working in 2019, I was really, really introverted,\u201d says \u015awi\u0105tek. \u201cShe helped me to feel more comfortable in the world around me, and I think without that part of the work that we did, I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle all this pressure and attention that you get when you become world No. 1. \u201cShe\u2019s the kind of person that will kind of tell me, \u2018Oh, Iga, I think you\u2019re doing too much, you need to really focus on your game right now because I see that it\u2019s harder for you to concentrate,\u2019 or things like that.\u201d Among \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s list of sponsors are Porsche, Rolex, LEGO \u2013 which she uses as part of her mental preparation \u2013 and cosmetic brand Lanc\u00f4me \u2013 with whom she is the first athlete to sign a worldwide ambassador deal. Last year, she became the first female athlete to be sponsored by sportswear brand On and has helped to develop the company inaugural tennis range. \u201cI feel really taken care of,\u201d says \u015awi\u0105tek of the partnership, \u201cwhich is sometimes a struggle when you work with companies that have 20 other athletes just in one sport.\u201d \u201cBeyond Number One,\u201d a short film produced by On about her rise to the summit of tennis, released earlier this week. Given her sustained success in recent years, it\u2019s no surprise that \u015awi\u0105tek has attracted so much attention from sponsors. She was named as Forbes\u2019 highest-paid female athlete last year having earned $23.9 million \u2013 $9.9 million in prize money and $14 million off the court \u2013 topping the list ahead of Chinese freestyle skier Eileen Gu and American rival Coco Gauff. Tennis players, including Emma Raducanu, Naomi Osaka, and Aryna Sabalenka, made up nine of the top 10 and 12 of the top 20 on Forbes\u2019 list. \u201cShe has been really the first player since Serena (Williams) and (Maria) Sharapova retired that has been consistent week in and week out, competing to win grand slams every time she steps on the court,\u201d Max Eisenbud, \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s agent at IMG, tells CNN Sport about the reasons for her commercial success. \u201cI think that consistency in play has certainly separated her and made her very attractive to potential endorsers \u2026 Brands like that she\u2019s real \u2013 she is who she is \u2013 and I think that\u2019s refreshing. Sometimes when you get into this whole social media world, this whole influencer world, it\u2019s not the case with realness.\u201d For \u015awi\u0105tek, that \u201crealness\u201d means talking openly about her love for Taylor Swift, LEGO \u2013 last year, she was gifted a model of Rome\u2019s Colosseum for her birthday \u2013 or reading in the park. She enjoyed the autobiographies of Andre Agassi and Lindsey Vonn but generally prefers fiction to sports books. \u201cI sometimes have too much sport in my life,\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek admits. Eisenbud calls her a \u201cdream client\u201d and \u201cone of the most professional athletes I\u2019ve ever been around.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s waking up every day and thinking about how to be great, and that\u2019s from her diet to her sleep to her decisions that she\u2019s making,\u201d he adds. This dedicated, detailed approach has helped to create the best all-around game in women\u2019s tennis right now \u2013 aggressive groundstrokes, a vicious, topspin-laden forehand, and canny movement around the court. At Roland Garros, \u015awi\u0105tek could become only the third woman to win three consecutive titles in the Open Era after Monica Seles and Justine Henin \u2013 potentially another landmark on her impressive resume. She would be 23 by then but already with more titles and accolades than most tennis players could dream of; after her own, modest childhood ambitions, the possibilities for \u015awi\u0105tek\u2019s career seem limitless.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/sport/iga-swiatek-profile-french-open-tennis-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/25/2024", "section": "world"}}
