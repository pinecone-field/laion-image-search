Its consistent wind makes it a hotspot for kitesurfing enthusiasts, but a new port, currently halfway through construction, could turn the area into a gateway for trade. The $1.2 billion megaproject is expected to complete in 2028. Spanning 1,650 hectares, the complex will include a trade port with an oil terminal, a fishing port and a shipyard. There will be a bridge linking the port to the land and a 7-kilometer road that connects the port with a national highway that runs along the coast as far north as Tangier and as far south as the border with Mauritania. \u201cWe\u2019re constructing an ecosystem,\u201d Nisrine Iouzzi, the director of construction for the Dakhla Atlantic Port, tells CNN. Once operational, she expects the port to handle 35 million tons of goods a year. This will not only boost Morocco\u2019s economy, she says, but it could help the country become a maritime hub for worldwide trade, connecting regions such as West Africa, the Middle East, Europe, North America, the Canary Islands and even South America. \u201cThe geographic location is key (to) the success of the port,\u201d she says, adding that the project has attracted significant foreign investment, including from the United Arab Emirates. Gateway to Africa The project is part of Morocco\u2019s national port strategy, which aims to modernize and strengthen port infrastructure by 2030, in order to enhance its role in global supply chains. Seaports such as Casablanca, Tanger-Med and Agadir have already been or are being upgraded, but because of its location, the Dakhla port is seen as particularly significant in opening up\u00a0other parts of the African continent for the world to trade with. \u201cWe strongly believe that with this infrastructure \u2013 port infrastructure, road infrastructure, renewable energy \u2013 we will be very attractive for investors that aim to get to one of the fastest growing markets, which is the West African market,\u201d says Mounir Houari, general manager of Dakhla\u2019s Regional Investment Center. With the implementation of Africa\u2019s continental free trade agreement, which aims to create a single market for goods and services, the port could encourage the processing of raw materials within the continent. \u201cLess than 5% of African natural resources are processed in Africa because there is no industrial infrastructure and exporting infrastructure,\u201d says Houari. The Dakhla port \u201cwill encourage many Africans to start processing natural resources in Africa, allowing African countries to create more jobs to improve their skills and know-how and strengthen their own industries.\u201d The Sahel region, especially landlocked countries such as Mali, Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso, are expected to benefit. Houari explains that Morocco has granted the region access to its road and port infrastructure, providing \u201ca door to the Atlantic maritime trade.\u201d Turloch Mooney, head of port intelligence and analytics at research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, says the development could be beneficial to the region. \u201cIt is very positive to see modern port and trade infrastructure being developed in the Western Sahara where there is potential to support a large hinterland in West Africa and the Sahel,\u201d he says. \u201cQuality port infrastructure and efficient port operations is part of the package of assurance for foreign direct investment and has been a key factor in the successful growth strategies of many developing countries.\u201d But Western Sahara and the Sahel region has a long history of unrest. \u201cLocal disputes can make developing port infrastructure and reliable logistics much more challenging,\u201d says Mooney. He cautions that infrastructure alone won\u2019t drive trade growth in the region, and that the port\u2019s success will depend on good governance, reliable transport connections and political stability.", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/new-atlantic-port-of-dakhla-africa-trade-spc-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_europe_mammoth-bones-austria-wine-cellar-scli-intl-scn", "text": "Hundreds of mammoth bones have been uncovered in an Austrian wine cellar, in a discovery labelled an \u201carchaeological sensation.\u201d The remains are thought to be between 30,000 and 40,000 years old, according to experts. Andreas Pernerstorfer made the incredible discovery while renovating his wine cellar in the village of Gobelsburg, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) northwest of Vienna, in March. The find has been described as the most significant of its kind in more than a century, with researchers from the Austrian Academy of Sciences (OeAW), who are now recovering the bones, describing it as an \u201carchaeological sensation,\u201d according to a Wednesday press release. Pernerstorfer had decided to carry out some work to level the floor in the cellar, archaeologist Hannah Parow\u2013 Souchon, a researcher at the OeAW, told CNN in a video call Thursday. \u201cHe wanted to level the floor of his wine cellar because it was sloping and he removed some concrete in the center,\u201d she said. \u201cMore or less immediately he found the bones, which he initially thought were wood. Then he looked more closely and remembered a tale from his grandfather who in the sixties extended the cellar and found some mammoth molars.\u201d Pernerstorfer reported the find to the Federal Monuments Office, which referred him to the OeAW because, as Parow-Souchon told CNN, \u201cwe are experts on the Stone Age.\u201d She and her team of fellow archaeologists embarked on an excavation at the start of May. \u201cIt quickly became apparent that it wasn\u2019t just a few mammoth bones but very many mammoth bones,\u201d she said. Parow-Souchon said they have \u201cat least 300 bones,\u201d which were found densely packed together. \u201cWe think we have mostly the complete animals. They\u2019re not in anatomical connection but we do have probably all parts,\u201d she said, adding that the recovered haul includes some rare finds, including a lingual (tongue) bone.\u201d The archaeologists believe the bones are from three separate mammoths. The site they excavated was just 12 square meters (129 square feet) big, but they are hoping to return in August to continue with their search. \u201cI love being an archaeologist. I\u2019ve excavated lots of exciting things but I always wanted to excavate a mammoth,\u201d said Parow-Souchon, adding that the mammoth bone discovery was a first for her. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled, I can\u2019t deny it,\u201d she said. Comparable sites elsewhere in Austria and in neighboring countries were mostly excavated more than 100 years ago, which means they are not available for modern research. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve been able to investigate something like this in Austria using modern methods. It is a unique opportunity for research,\u201d said Parow-Souchon in the press release. The excavations, funded by the Federal Monuments Office and the province of Lower Austria, raise many questions, including whether these animals were killed by Stone Age hunters. \u201cWe know that humans hunted mammoths, but we still know very little about how they did it,\u201d said Parow-Souchon, adding that a trap for the animals may have been set at this site. Once the researchers complete their work, the bones will be passed to the Natural History Museum Vienna for restoration.

{"id": "travel_crystal-cabin-awards-2024", "text": "From an economy cabin concept allowing rows of fliers to sit opposite one another to a wellbeing area designed to keep travelers moving on ultra-long-haul flights. Welcome to the future of aviation \u2013 at least according to the 2024 Crystal Cabin Awards. Each year, this top aviation prize spotlights innovation in airplane cabin interiors \u2013 with nominees ranging from ready-to-launch, airline-backed initiatives, to experimental and as-yet-unrealized designs. This year\u2019s longlist included eye-catching concept Ameco\u2019s Fly-Buddy Hub, described by the company as a \u201cversatile social hub\u201d that rearranges two rows of the economy cabin so that six passengers can sit facing one another. After whittling down the longlist to a shortlist earlier this year, 28 industry experts crowned the eight winners at this year\u2019s ceremony, held at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany. Among this year\u2019s winners was Diehl Aviation for its Wellbeing Zone, designed in partnership with Qantas for the airline\u2019s upcoming \u201cProject Sunrise\u201d \u00a0ultra-long-haul flights, set to connect Sydney to London and New York via 19-hour-plus journeys. Diehl and Qantas\u2019 design triumphed in the \u201cpassenger comfort\u201d category, imagining a roomy area between the A350 premium economy and economy cabins, offering space for passengers to stretch their legs, grab a snack and get moving as they cross time zones. A \u2018more democratic approach\u2019 to aviation Caroline Oxley, who works for the Crystal Cabin Award Association, tells CNN Travel this year\u2019s finalists share a \u201cmore democratic approach\u201d to improving the passenger experience. She notes Diehl and Qantas\u2019 Wellbeing Zone is a concept more commonplace in business class and first class, but Diehl and Qantas\u2019 vision is designed to benefit those with the cheapest seats on the plane. Also aiming to ameliorate the flying experience across the board is the winner of the \u201chealth and safety\u201d category, Accenture GmbH\u2019s \u201cAccenture PED safety bag.\u201d This concept aims to tackle growing concerns around lithium battery fires on airplanes \u2013 should a personal device catch alight, this bag should safely contain flames for up to six hours. Oxley calls the design \u201cabsolutely convincing.\u201d Similarly making waves in the \u201chealth and safety\u201d category was nominee AirPRO by Schroth Safety Products, who presented a passenger lap belt airbag developed in collaboration with the design studio Teams and DesignB\u00fcro\u00a0St\u00fchmer/Scholz. Paired with crash sensor technology installed under the airplane seat, the bag\u2019s designed to be activated quickly in an emergency to help protect travelers from injury. A quest for sustainability The Crystal Cabin Awards also seeks to spotlight ideas that could make aviation more environmentally sound, with Oxley suggesting \u201chands-on solutions\u201d triumphed. This year\u2019s winner of the \u201csustainable cabin category\u201d was Diehl Aviation for their \u201cECO Sidewall\u201d \u2013 a greener take on an airplane wall. Also shortlisted in this category was RECARO Aircraft Seating\u2019s R Sphere, which intriguingly imagines airplane seats made from sustainable materials such as recycled fishing nets and cactus. RECARO claims this 100% recyclable seat could reduce CO2 emissions by 63 tonnes per aircraft per year. Meanwhile Crystal Cabin\u2019s \u201cuniversity\u201d award highlights the next generation of airplane innovation, and is \u201cintended to provide a forum for particularly creative designs,\u201d as the Crystal Cabin Awards Association puts it. This year\u2019s winner was Tongji University in Shanghai, awarded for its \u201cFlexifold\u201d seat \u2013 which aims to increase flexibility with an easily adaptable economy seat concept. Other notable nominees in the university category include the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, which worked in cooperation with aircraft manufacturer Embraer to design an aircraft-wide noise-canceling device, rendering the wearing of individual headphones obsolete. The futuristic concept uses artificial intelligence and an on-board camera to direct sound waves at passengers\u2019 heads and subsequently reduce the noisy whirring of the aircraft engines. Meanwhile the University of Virginia Tech worked with Boeing, All Wheels Up and Collins Aerospace on its Wheelchair Space and Securement System (WSSS). This hook-based device works to allow wheelchair users to stay in their wheelchairs for the duration of the flight. This design\u2019s now the basis of Collins Aerospace\u2019 wheelchair aircraft solution \u2013 on display at this year\u2019s Aircraft Interiors Expo and attracting a lot of industry buzz.

{"id": "2024_05_28_tech_ai-iphone", "text": "Imagine asking Apple\u2019s Siri to show you an old photo taken from a child\u2019s second birthday, or summarizing lengthy emails and writing drafts. Then consider Siri learning your schedule, preferences, even your personality, so it can better communicate with you throughout the day. Generative AI, artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions and prompts, could potentially breathe new life into Apple\u2019s iPhone lineup at a time when competitors are threatening to leave the company behind in the race to shape what could be a world-changing technology. The company is widely expected to partner with ChatGPT maker OpenAI ahead of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where it will likely show off its first batch of AI tools coming to the iOS software. Although artificial intelligence has powered some of the iPhone\u2019s experiences for years, such as Live Text and improved autocorrect, generative AI could unlock new levels of interaction and personalization. All this during a time when the company is under pressure to catch up to rivals such as Google and Samsung, which are already using the technology in its smartphones. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call in early May, noting there would be news announced in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d Apple is not always first to adopt to emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect them for years before including them in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology. The debut of an AI iPhone could also entice consumers to upgrade at a time when they\u2019ve been holding onto older models longer. Apple reported first-quarter revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% year over year, as the tech giant continues to struggle with growth challenges, particularly in China, amid an uncertain economic environment. Now all eyes shift to Apple for its take on generative AI. Here\u2019s how that could play out on the iPhone: A much smarter assissant Although it\u2019s unclear what exactly an iPhone in the generative AI world would look like, experts largely believe the biggest entrypoint is through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record. Integration with OpenAI\u2019s latest ChatGPT-4o model could catapult Siri years forward, essentially turning the feature into an iPhone chatbot. This would enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and even personality, and respond accordingly. Looking at how competitors have already introduced generative tools, the iPhone will also likely assist users with other tasks, such as offering to summarize and draft emails, or starting an online purchase return process. Samsung\u2019s \u201ccircle to search\u201d feature, which allows users to quickly search for information on a device\u2019s screen with a finger gesture, has received a lot of attention and is featured in marketing campaigns. Multimodal features \u2013 which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time \u2014 like analysis of video footage and in-call spam detection could also form part of the tools, according to Paul Schell, industry analyst at tech intelligence firm ABI Research. \u201cSomething similar would likely be included in an Apple offering, given its relative simplicity and appeal that goes beyond simple image search,\u201d Schell said. \u201cBut verbal interactions with a bot like Siri will be much more natural and fluent, and its capabilities will go far beyond the previous, narrow domains, like news and weather updates.\u201d An AI iPhone could also adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues. \u201cGenerative AI will allow the next generations of iPhones to become a sixth sense, empowering us to scan and interact with the world around us,\u201d said Thomas Husson, an analyst with market research firm Forrester. Generative AI will also likely change Apple\u2019s whole ecosystem by embedding it through its own apps, such as Apple Maps, iMovie and iPhoto, and release tools for developers for brands to develop new experiences through their own apps. Expediting AI Behind the scenes, Apple reportedly has been working on its on-device generative AI capabilities and acquiring companies for awhile, such as Canadian startup DarwinAI. It also has a machine learning research division dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence.  But after the launch of ChatGPT ignited an AI arms race in late 2022, followed by companies such as Google, Microsoft and Meta heavily pouring resources into developing related tools, Apple has remained relatively quiet about its visions for an AI-powered future. Nabila Popal, a senior research director at market research firm IDC, said the pressure to be part of the conversation likely moved up the company\u2019s timeline. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported Apple was closing in on a deal with OpenAI to use its ChatGPT technology on iPhones, after holding similar talks with Google. \u201cApple normally takes their time and doesn\u2019t let the Android race rush [impact its moves], be it with foldables or 5G or even augmented and virtual reality,\u201d Popal said. \u201cAnd Apple then comes out and does it better than anyone else.\u201d \u201cHowever this time, with AI, it is different,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Apple is being forced to show its hand early.\u201d She said consumers are considering AI capabilities of greater importance than any other feature when choosing their premium device, especially in China, where Apple is losing its marketshare. \u201cIt\u2019s not just because of the resurgence of Huawei but also because of \u2018lack of AI\u2019 in their devices,\u201d she said. \u201cChinese consumers want more from their premium phones.\u201d During its most recent iPad event, Apple reminded onlookers that it\u2019s been using artificial intelligence in its products for years, including a neural processing engine to support its A11 bionic chip. But now it needs to show it\u2019s going all in on artificial intelligence to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industry. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a question about whether or not Apple will announce something around generative AI, but Apple has to if they want to achieve growth in this highly competitive and innovative smartphone market, especially in China. \u2026 AI is one train Apple can\u2019t afford to miss.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/tech/ai-iphone/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

Many MSF staff members have lost family members or homes during the shelling. Since the fighting began more than two weeks ago, the group said it has treated 979 people. The violence in North Darfur has intensified as the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF) encircle El Fasher. The fighting also affects thousands of displaced people who have fled to El Fasher from the other four Darfur states now controlled by the RSF.

{"id": "2024_05_27_asia_us-congressional-visit-taiwan-defense-intl-hnk", "text": "US lawmakers\u00a0vowed to bolster Taiwan\u2019s deterrence against China on Monday during a bipartisan congressional visit to the self-governing democracy just days after Beijing surrounded the island with massive military exercises. Last week\u2019s drills were the largest China has launched in more than a year and came days after Taiwan\u00a0swore in its new president,\u00a0Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity. In a news conference in Taipei, US Representative\u00a0Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called the drills an \u201cintimidation tactic to punish democracy\u201d and vowed to bolster Taiwan\u2019s defense by speeding up the delivery of defensive weapons from the US. Citing recent\u00a0foreign military financing\u00a0for\u00a0Taiwan approved by the US House, McCaul pledged to get Taiwan the weapons it purchased from the US \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d \u201cWe are moving forward on those weapons systems. I\u2019d like to see them faster, but they are forthcoming,\u201d he said. The US maintains close but informal relations with Taiwan and is bound by law to supply the island with weapons to defend itself. However, Taiwan has repeatedly raised concerns about delays in US weapon deliveries, particularly after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cPresident Lai and I have always had a very sobering and yet very direct conversation about the threat that this island faces from its neighbor to the north,\u201d McCaul said, referring to China. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. China\u2019s military kicked off two days of exercises last Thursday, sending warships and fighter jets around Taiwan and its outlying islands in\u00a0what it called \u201ca strong punishment for separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces.\u201d It said the drills were designed to test its ability to \u201cseize power\u201d over the island. Beijing has long denounced Lai as a \u201cdangerous separatist\u201d and decried his inauguration speech, during which he called on China to cease its intimidation of Taiwan. The vast majority of Taiwanese have no desire to live under Chinese rule. But under Xi Jinping, China\u2019s most authoritarian leader in a generation, Beijing has grown more assertive\u00a0and ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on its democratic neighbor. In the often bitterly polarized atmosphere of Capitol Hill support for Taiwan has become one of the few bipartisan points of agreement. \u201cWithout deterrence, Chairman Xi has bold and aggressive ambitions, and we just need to do everything we can to make it possible for him to see that the risk outweighs the reward, that the risk is too high. I do think the deterrence we will provide, and we\u2019re providing by our presence here today, will help prevent that,\u201d McCaul, a Republican,\u00a0said. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it \u201cfirmly opposed\u201d the visit and had lodged stern representations with the US. It urged the American lawmakers to \u201cstop playing the Taiwan card, stop interfering in China\u2019s internal affairs, stop supporting and condoning Taiwan independence separatist forces, and stop undermining Sino-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a regular news conference Monday. \u2018Gesture of solidarity\u2019 Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Minister\u00a0Lin Chia-lung called the visit by US lawmakers \u201ca powerful display of the strong bipartisan support of Taiwan in the United States.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s also an important gesture of solidarity that shows America stands firmly with democratic Taiwan, and for this, we are deeply grateful,\u201d Lin said at the news conference alongside McCaul, vowing to advance the \u201crock-solid partnership\u201d between the two sides. China\u2019s military drills, he said, were \u201cto express their displeasure with President Lai, a president democratically elected by the people of Taiwan.\u201d But he added they had another objective. \u201cI believe the military exercises were also the PRC way of welcoming this delegation,\u201d he said, referring to China\u2019s official name the People\u2019s Republic of China. The delegation also met with Lai, Taiwan\u2019s new leader, on Monday morning. Calling McCaul \u201cTaiwan\u2019s longtime friend,\u201d Lai thanked the delegation for their firm support for Taiwan and vowed to deepen cooperation with the US and other like-minded countries to maintain regional peace, stability and prosperity. \u201cI deeply admire former US President Ronald Reagan\u2019s concept of \u2018peace through strength.\u2019 Therefore, moving forward, I\u2019ll enhance reform and bolster national defense, showing the world the Taiwanese people\u2019s determination to defend their homeland,\u201d Lai said. \u201cWith your support, I hope that the US Congress through legislative action will continue to assist Taiwan in strengthening its self-defense capabilities, thereby advancing bilateral exchanges and cooperation.\u201d In response, McCaul congratulated Lai for assuming the presidency, saying \u201cTaiwan has the right man at the right time in the right place.\u201d \u201cWe must make sure no one in the right mind will try to upset the peace that let you thrive,\u201d McCaul told Lai. \u201cAmerican is and will always be a reliable partner, and no amount of coercion or intimidation will slow down or stop the routine visits by the congress to Taiwan.\u201d McCaul last visited Taiwan in April 2023 and met former President Tsai Ing-wen. China responded with a show of military force and later imposed sanctions on McCaul. In August 2022, China staged massive war games around Taiwan to show its displeasure with then US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s visit to Taipei. Beijing fired missiles into waters surrounding the island and simulated a blockade with fighter jets and warships, in its largest show of force in years.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/asia/us-congressional-visit-taiwan-defense-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

Russian troops have taken advantage of a weakened front line in Ukraine, and for the past two weeks have advanced towards Kharkiv. Parts of the region were captured by Russian forces earlier in the war before being liberated. All seven of the deceased, at least five of whom were women, were civilians working for the Factor-Druk printing company in the region\u2019s capital, the city of Kharkiv, according to the regional governor,\u00a0Oleh Syniehubov. Sixteen people were injured at the at printing house, located south of the city center, and another seven were injured elsewhere. After the attack, images emerged of the factory partly reduced to rubble,\u00a0with\u00a0its facade blown off. Factor-Druk publishes around a third of the nation\u2019s books and 10% of its newspapers, the company says on its website. The Ukrainian state railway network was also attacked in the early morning, according to a statement from the company. Six employees were wounded, the company said. A CNN team travelling in the area saw two craters and smoke from impacts near a railway line. Civilians have also been trapped by a new swell of violence engulfing the region. On May 15, Russian forces fired on people desperately trying to flee the town of Vovchansk and killed a woman being pushed in a wheelchair by her husband, Ukrainian prosecutors reported. \u2018Extremely brutal\u2019 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the \u201cextremely brutal Russian attack\u201d on Kharkiv and the town of Lyubotyn, drawing attention to the fragility of Kyiv\u2019s air defenses in the face of Moscow\u2019s renewed assault. \u201cRussian terrorists are taking advantage of Ukraine\u2019s lack of sufficient air defense protection and reliable capability to destroy terrorist launchers at their exact locations, which are close to our borders,\u201d Zelensky posted on X. Earlier this month, the US approved a $400 million package of air defense munitions and other weapons to Ukraine. But senior officials in Kyiv have warned that recent flush of aid will not be enough to fend off further Russian advances. CNN journalists in the town of Lyptsi, around 20 miles north of Kharkiv city, saw troops using aging and inadequate weaponry, in an attempt to repel highly-equipped Russian units bolstered by drones. Zelensky is growing increasingly exasperated by a condition imposed by Washington and other Western allies that the weapons they provide to Ukraine cannot be used to launch munitions into Russia. \u201cI don\u2019t think there should be any restrictions, because this is not about the Ukrainian army using Western weapons on Russian territory for offensive,\u201d Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv earlier this month. \u201cThis is defense.\u201d White House officials earlier this month said their stance on the issue remained. \u201cWe do not encourage nor do we enable attacks using US-supplied weapons systems inside Russian territory,\u201d US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said during a press briefing on May 17.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s the policy.\u00a0That has not changed.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/europe/russian-strikes-kharkiv-ukraine-may-23-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_middleeast_gaza-us-munitions-rafah-strike-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "Munitions made in the United States were used in the deadly Israeli strike\u00a0on\u00a0a displacement camp in Rafah on Sunday, a CNN analysis of video from the scene and a review by explosive weapons experts has found. At least 45 people were killed and more than 200 others injured after a fire broke out following the Israeli military\u2019s strike\u00a0on the outskirts of Gaza\u2019s southernmost city, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian medics. Footage obtained by CNN showed swathes of the camp in Rafah in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. Israel\u2019s escalating assault in Rafah \u2013 where some 1.3 million Palestinians were taking shelter before Israel began its operation there \u2013 has drawn swift international condemnation, with United Nations agencies, aid groups and multiple governments calling on Israel to immediately halt its offensive. Israeli tanks were seen advancing further into Rafah on Tuesday for the first time in Israel\u2019s seven-month war against Hamas, signaling a new phase Israel pressing on with its controversial and destructive offensive. However, US President Joe Biden is not altering his policy towards Israel, suggesting the deadly Rafah strike had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support,  despite him saying in a CNN interview earlier this month\u00a0he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. CNN geolocated videos showing tents in flames in the aftermath of the strike\u00a0on\u00a0the camp for internally displaced people known as \u201cKuwait Peace Camp 1.\u201d In video shared on social media, which CNN geolocated to the same scene by matching details including the camp\u2019s entrance sign and the tiles on the ground, the tail of a US-made GBU-39 small diameter bomb (SDB) is visible, according to four explosive weapons experts who reviewed the video for CNN. The GBU-39, which is manufactured by Boeing, is a high-precision munition\u00a0\u201cdesigned to attack strategically important point targets,\u201d and result in low collateral damage,\u00a0explosive weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith told CNN Tuesday. However, \u201cusing any munition, even of this size, will always incur risks in a densely populated area,\u201d\u00a0said Cobb-Smith, who is also a\u00a0former British Army artillery officer. Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member who also identified the fragment as being from a GBU-39,\u00a0explained to\u00a0CNN how he drew his conclusion. \u201cThe warhead portion [of the munition] is distinct, and the guidance and wing section is extremely unique compared to other munitions. Guidance and wing sections of munitions are often the remnants left over even after a munition detonates.\u00a0I saw the tail actuation section and instantly knew it was one of the SDB/GBU-39 variants.\u201d Ball also concluded that while there is a variant of the GBU-39 known as the Focused Lethality Munition (FLM) which has a larger explosive payload but is designed to cause even less collateral damage, this was not the variant used in this case. \u201cThe FLM has a carbon fiber composite warhead body and is filled with tungsten ground into a powder. Photos of FLM testing have shown objects in the test coated in tungsten dust, which is not present [in video from the scene],\u201d he told CNN. Serial numbers on the remnants of the munitions also matched those for a manufacturer of GBU-39 parts based in California \u2013 pointing to more evidence the bombs were made in the US. Two\u00a0additional\u00a0explosive weapons experts \u2013\u00a0Richard Weir, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch, and Chris Lincoln-Jones, a former British Army artillery officer and weapons and targeting expert \u2013 identified the fragment as being part of a US-manufactured GBU-39 when reviewing the video for CNN, though they were unable to comment on the variant used. Asked for comment on the munitions used in the Rafah strike at Tuesday\u2019s briefing, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters: \u201cI do not know what type of munition was used in that airstrike. I\u2019d have to refer you to the Israelis to speak to that.\u201d CNN has also reached out to the US National Security Council. Main weapons supplier The US has long been the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), and that support has continued despite the growing political pressure on the Biden administration over the Gaza offensive. Last month, Biden signed a foreign aid bill that included\u00a0$26 billion for the Israel-Hamas conflict\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including $15 billion in Israeli military aid, $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza and $2.4 billion for regional US military operations. CNN\u2019s identification of the munition is consistent with a claim made by IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari in a briefing about the tragedy on Tuesday. Hagari told reporters the strike \u2013 which he said\u00a0targeted senior Hamas commanders \u2013 used two munitions with small warheads containing 17 kilos of explosives, adding these bombs were \u201cthe smallest munitions that our jets could use.\u201d The traditional GBU-39 warhead has an explosive payload of 17 kilos. Hagari said the deadly fire which occurred following the strike was not caused solely by weapons used by the Israeli military. \u201cOur munitions alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\u201d Hagari said, adding the IDF was investigating \u201cwhat may have caused such a large fire to ignite.\u201d He added that Israel is looking into whether the strike was \u201cunintentionally set off possible stored weapons in a nearby compound.\u201d Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the deadly airstrike in Rafah was a \u201ctragic error,\u201d but said Israel has vowed to press on with its operation despite international outrage and a US warning not to proceed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/gaza-us-munitions-rafah-strike-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

We are investigating the case,\u201d Netanyahu said in a speech at the Israeli Knesset. At least 45 people were killed and more than 200 others injured after a fire broke out at the camp following the strike, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian medics. No hospital in Rafah had the capacity to take the number of casualties, the ministry said. Footage obtained by CNN showed the camp in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. \u201cSeveral civilians are still trapped inside the camp, which was attacked without warning,\u201d a Palestinian man filming the fire said. \u201cThis was declared a safe zone.\u201d United Nations Secretary-General\u00a0Ant\u00f2nio Guterres issued a blistering condemnation on Monday. \u201cI condemn Israel\u2019s actions which killed scores of innocent civilians who were only seeking shelter from this deadly conflict,\u201d\u00a0he said on X. \u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.\u201d A UN diplomat told CNN that the Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Tuesday to discuss the airstrike at the request of Algeria. It will hold private discussions at 3.30 p.m., the diplomat said. A US official told CNN Monday that Israel had told the Biden administration it used a precision munition to hit a target in Rafah, but that the explosion from the strike ignited a fuel tank nearby and started a fire that engulfed a camp for displaced Palestinians and led to dozens of deaths. \u201cWe can\u2019t confirm that but it\u2019s what Israel shared with us,\u201d the official said, \u201cand we assume we will learn more once Israel completes its investigation.\u201d The attack came after Hamas launched rockets at Tel Aviv on Sunday for the first time in months. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that eight rockets were fired from the Rafah area, and that \u201ca number of projectiles\u201d had been intercepted. The IDF said it destroyed the rocket launchers used by Hamas shortly after the strikes. The Israeli military said in a statement earlier on Monday that it had struck \u201ca compound in Rafah in which significant Hamas terrorists were operating.\u201d It said the strike killed two Hamas officials \u2013 West Bank Chief of Staff Yassin Rabia and senior Hamas member Khaled Nagar. CNN cannot verify these claims. The IDF said in a later statement Monday that its Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism \u2013 an independent body responsible for examining allegations of misconduct in conflict \u2013 will investigate the \u201ccircumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area of the strike.\u201d It was among the deadliest strikes by the Israeli military on Gaza\u2019s southernmost city since Israel began its operation there on May 7. It also came just days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations\u2019 top court, ordered Israel to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its military operation in Rafah, and any other action in the city, \u201cwhich may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d The IDF said the attack was conducted based on \u201cprior intelligence\u201d indicating that senior officials of Hamas\u2019 West Bank wing were present at the site. The IDF said it had assessed there would be \u201cno expected harm to uninvolved civilians.\u201d More than 36,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military operation there, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave, which started after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. \u2018Hell on earth\u2019 Footage of the aftermath shared on social media showed chaotic scenes. In one video, the lifeless body of a man was seen being dragged by the legs out of the flames. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, he\u2019s dead,\u201d a rescuer says before moving on to find others. In another video, a man wept as he held up the headless body of a toddler for the camera. Women shrieked in grief as children peered into the fire. A man with a bloodied face stood in apparent shock, examining his wounds with one hand, as he held an infant with blood-stained clothes in the other arm. One of the bodies pulled out of the fire was charred-stiff. By Monday morning, the camp was in ruins with small fires still burning. Men and boys gathered around, rummaging through the burned and smoking wreckage for food and their belongings as drones hovered above. One of the structures still standing was a sign that read: \u201cKuwait peace camp 1.\u201d Children and women living in makeshift tents were among those killed, according to a post on X from UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. \u201cThe images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on earth,\u201d the commissioner-general said Monday. \u201cOthers were reportedly burnt to death,\u201d Lazzarini said. The reporting is based on open-source photos and videos which were shared with UNRWA, including from social media, UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma told CNN. Mohammad Abu Al Subeh, a displaced Palestinian man who survived the strike, said as he was lying in bed in the evening when he saw \u201crockets fired down at us.\u201d \u201cIt shook the earth like an earthquake,\u201d Abu Al Subeh, who fled his home in Nuseirat some five months ago, told CNN. He had to escape through the window of his makeshift house  in the desert area where the camp is located. \u201cI came here based on the leaflet that was dropped (by Israel) saying go to this humanitarian area,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just civilians here.\u201d Abu Nidal Al Attar, another displaced Palestinian who witnessed the attack, told CNN: \u201cWe were sitting as normal people do\u201d when they suddenly saw strikes and fire. \u201cWe went to see, and they were pulling out burned people.\u201d Hamas called the attack \u201ca horrific war crime\u201d and \u201cterrible massacre.\u201d International outrage International condemnation was swift, with UN agencies, aid groups and governments calling on Israel to respect the ICJ ruling and halt its Rafah operation. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday condemned the airstrike. \u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cDespite the ICJ binding ruling, Israel struck Rafah and Hamas fired rockets to Israel,\u201d the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, wrote Monday on X. \u00a0On Monday, in a meeting with Arab leaders to discuss Gaza and the Middle, Borrell said that \u201cwhat we have seen in the immediate hours is that Israel continues the military action that it has been asked to stop.\u201d Medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it was \u201chorrified by this deadly event, which shows once again that nowhere is safe.\u201d The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said \u201cGaza is hell on earth,\u201d referring to the Rafah attack. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \u201coutraged\u201d and called for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire.\u201d Critics have pushed back on Israel\u2019s claims. Already worried about an intensifying war right on its border with Gaza, Egypt on Monday condemned Israel\u2019s strike on Rafah, calling on the Jewish state to implement the ICJ ruling of \u201chalting military operations\u201d in Rafah and to \u201ccomply with its responsibilities as an occupying power\u201d. A mediator in the war, Egypt is set to host another round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas on Tuesday. Qatar, another key mediator, said Israel\u2019s strike could \u201chinder\u201d ongoing negotiations, and called the attack a \u201cserious violation of international law.\u201d Over a million Palestinians had been sheltering in Rafah before Israel began its operations there, having fled there from other areas of Gaza after Israel began its military campaign in the territory. Israel has said it had ordered civilians to leave some areas of Rafah, but many remain there, sheltering in what Israel designated as \u201csafe zones.\u201d More than 800,000 people have fled Rafah since May 6, according to UN figures. Israel has vowed to press on with its Rafah operation despite international outrage and a US warning not to proceed. In response to the ICJ ruling last week, Israel said it \u201chas not and will not conduct military actions in the Rafah area which may inflict on the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d Clarification: This story has been updated after additional review of the translation from Hebrew to English, to clarify the wording used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he referred to a deadly Israeli strike on Rafah, Gaza.\u00a0The word\u00a0\u201cerror\u201dwas originally translated as \u201cmistake.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/middleeast/gaza-rafah-displaced-people-camp-israel-strike-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_23_uk_uk-election-explainer-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl", "text": "Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has taken the biggest gamble of his troubled premiership by calling an early general election that almost everyone in Westminster believes he will lose. We\u2019ll know soon enough whether the decision was a masterstroke or a misfire. A frenetic six-week campaign will dominate airwaves in the UK \u2013 once again putting political battles front and center in a country fatigued by a turbulent stretch for the state. If, as current polls indicate, the opposition Labour party triumph, it will finally bring down the curtain of a 14-year era of Conservative rule, ushering in a center-left government led by former barrister Keir Starmer. Any other outcome would mean Sunak has orchestrated a shocking victory that even many in his own party believe is beyond reach \u2013 and would result in the Conservatives extending a political dynasty toward the two-decade mark. Here are some key questions answered. Why did Sunak call an election now \u2013 and is it a gamble? Sunak was obliged to call an election by December and hold it by the following month, but until that deadline \u2013 five years on from the last vote \u2013 the decision of when to stage a poll is in the gift of the prime minister. Sunak told journalists at a drinks reception in December that it would be in 2024, not January 2025, and has more recently said his \u201cassumption\u201d is that it would happen in the second half of the year \u2013 which 4 July is, just about. But beyond those clues, he has been tight-lipped while he weighed his options \u2013 feeding frenzied speculation in Westminster for months. The main problem facing him is that no good options existed. Sunak is down around 20 points in opinion polls, and that deficit hasn\u2019t budged all year. The economy is gloomy, and one line of thinking among his aides is that waiting until October or November would give it time to settle. But on the other hand, Sunak has placed much of his political capital into his pledge to stop small boat crossings to the UK by asylum seekers. He has recently passed a controversial law to process some claims in Rwanda, though nobody has yet been deported and further legal challenges may await the plan. Meanwhile, the warmer summer months are expected to see a huge number of such journeys across the English Channel, hurting a major pillar of his campaign message. Ultimately, hours after some rare good economic news \u2013 a healthy month-on-month reduction in the rate of inflation \u2013 Sunak decided that Wednesday was the least bad time to pull the trigger. Who\u2019s expected to win? The near-universal expectation is that Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party will lose the election. Labour have been leading in general election opinion polls since late 2021, and that lead has been huge for the entirety of Sunak\u2019s premiership. They are around 20 points up on average, with the Tories often closer to third party challengers like Reform and the Liberal Democrats than they are to Labour. When converted to a projection of seats in parliament, those figures indicate either a comfortable Labour win or a Labour win so huge it would spell a near-wipeout for the Conservatives. The Conservative brand was damaged by Partygate and a number of other scandals that led to the demise of Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership, and then the shambolic six-week tenure of his successor Liz Truss, whose fiscal agenda sent markets into turmoil. But for Sunak\u2019s team, some deeper numbers provide some comfort. While Keir Starmer leads Sunak in polling on the question of who would make a better prime minister, that lead is much smaller than the overall party voting gap \u2013 suggesting Sunak will seek to keep the focus on a \u201cme versus him\u201d message. Some polling experts also suggested that recent local elections may indicate a slimmer Labour win than polling does, but it is notoriously difficult to extrapolate nationwide forecasts from local votes in only some parts of the country. Sunak may also take heart from an unlikely source: the left-wing former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who started the 2017 general election facing a similar deficit and eventually forced a hung parliament, in a narrow loss to Theresa May. Nonetheless, Sunak hasn\u2019t been able to move the polls in his favor since he became leader \u2013 he has just six weeks left to do so to claim a stunning upset victory. What happens next? Party leaders are already on the campaign trail, but parliament has a few days to wrap up any pressing issues before it is officially dissolved, 25 days before polling day. Once that happens, the parliament that was formed in the previous, 2019 general election ceases to exist \u2013 and all sitting lawmakers are no longer MPs. Sunak\u2019s government will continue to run the country, albeit in a skeleton format. The main priority for every party will be the weeks-long dash around the country, where party leaders will seek to be pictured knocking on doors, standing in hi-vis jackets and meeting members of the public. A series of TV debates will likely be organized too, when Sunak and Starmer will go head-to-head. Then on Thursday, July 4, Britons will vote between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time, and as soon as polls close, votes will be counted. A winner is usually declared in the early hours of Friday morning. Who is Keir Starmer? Rishi Sunak\u2019s rival for power is Labour leader Keir Starmer, who is heavily favored to become Britain\u2019s new prime minister in July. A former, well-respected human rights lawyer who then served as Britain\u2019s most senior prosecutor, Starmer came into politics late in life. He became a Labour MP in 2015 and less than five years later was the party\u2019s leader, following a stint as shadow Brexit Secretary during Britain\u2019s protracted exit from the European Union. Starmer inherited a party reeling from its worst electoral defeat in generations, but he prioritized an overhaul of its culture \u2013 staring down left-wing supporters of former leader Jeremy Corbyn, and apologizing publicly for a long-running antisemitism scandal that had tainted the group\u2019s standing with the public. He has attempted to lay claim to Britain\u2019s political center ground, and is described by his supporters as a principled, serious leader with a focus on tackling the systemic issues facing Britain. But his opponents, on both the left of his own party and the right of the political spectrum, say he lacks charisma and ideas, and charge that he has failed to set out an ambitious and broad vision for the nation. Who else is standing? Only Sunak or Starmer have a realistic chance of becoming prime minister, but their plans could be disrupted by a number of smaller parties. Sunak is especially vulnerable to the success of the Reform Party \u2013 a right-wing group attempting to outflank him on immigration \u2013 and the Liberal Democrats, a centrist, pro-European group who have chipped away at Conservative support in affluent, southern parts of England. Given Labour\u2019s standing in the polls, Starmer is more equipped to take the fight to other groups. North of the border, he will look to end the Scottish National Party (SNP)\u2019s generation-long dominance at the ballot box, capitalizing on a rocky period in the party\u2019s recent history that has seen them replace two leaders in just over a year. But he will need to be mindful of the Green Party, which has challenged him from the left and has attracted some younger liberal votes as a result. In recent local elections, there was evidence too that Labour\u2019s stance on Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza had harmed the party in majority-Muslim areas. How does voting work? In the UK, voters don\u2019t elect a prime minister directly. Instead, they elect a member of parliament (MP) to represent their local constituency. The leader of the party that wins a majority of the UK\u2019s 650 constituencies automatically becomes prime minister, and can form a government. That means 326 is the magic number for an overall majority. If there\u2019s no majority, they need to look for help elsewhere, ruling as a minority government \u2013 as Theresa May did after a close 2017 result \u2013 or forming a coalition, as David Cameron did after 2010. The monarch has an important role; King Charles III must approve the formation of a government, the decision to hold an election and the dissolution of parliament. But this is a formal role only; the King won\u2019t contradict his prime minister or overrule the results of an election. What issues will decide the election? The answer to that question will go some way in deciding the night\u2019s winner. Labour will be keen to define the election as a referendum on 14 years of Conservative rule,  seizing on public fatigue with a party that has produced five prime ministers in that span and overseen Brexit, a stuttering economy and a series of sleaze scandals. In particular, Starmer will talk plenty about the cost of living hitting British families, and the state of the country\u2019s overstaffed and stretched National Health Service (NHS). Sunak, by contrast, will want to focus on migration \u2013 his pledge to \u201cStop the Boats\u201d hasn\u2019t yet worked, but his flagship Rwanda policy has at least become law. And he will attempt to convince voters that the economy has turned a corner, and can\u2019t risk a change in governance. Early signs also show he is attempting to make the question of leadership central in voters\u2019 minds \u2013 highlighting his time as finance minister during the Covid-19 pandemic in his first speech, and criticizing Starmer\u2019s record.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/23/uk/uk-election-explainer-sunak-starmer-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

Every year in western England, a group of enthusiasts chase a wheel of Double Gloucester cheese down Cooper\u2019s Hill for the chance to be crowned champion. The competition rules are simple \u2013 the cheese is released at the top of the hill, and a crowd of people chase it, with the first to the bottom winning the wheel as their prize. \u201cIt\u2019s a very steep hill,\u201d Lampe, the winner of this year\u2019s first women\u2019s race told CNN Sport\u2019s Don Riddell, adding she estimates it is about \u201c45 degrees.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking down, you can see the bottom, but it\u2019s definitely a long way down. At the starting line, you\u2019re basically grabbing on the grass so you don\u2019t fall down. \u201cAfter my win two years ago, I didn\u2019t want to just cling on to that victory because it\u2019s getting aged just like the cheese.

Once a local event, the competition at Cooper\u2019s Hill, in Brockworth, Gloucestershire, attracts entrants and spectators from all over the world. But if you\u2019re thinking of entering the 2025 edition bear in mind that the competition is often blighted by injury. \u201cTwo years ago, someone broke their leg, so it\u2019s definitely not for the faint of heart. People break their collarbones. People break their ankles, their arms \u2013 it\u2019s definitely a risky endeavor,\u201d reflected Lampe, who added that this year\u2019s competition had added jeopardy, due to the UK\u2019s recent wet weather. \u201cMy face took a lot of hits down the hill \u2013 so did my body \u2013 but that\u2019s the cost that it takes to win the cheese rolling,\u201d she added. \u201cMy strategy is to basically run from the gate and then start rolling, and two years ago that strategy worked really well for me \u2013 I just tumbled my way down to the bottom.

{"id": "2024_05_29_climate_orange-rivers-permafrost-alaska", "text": "Rivers and streams in Alaska are changing color \u2013 from a clean, clear blue to a rusty orange \u2013 because of the toxic metals released by thawing permafrost, according to a new study. The finding surprised researchers from the National Park Service, the University of California at Davis and the US Geological Survey, who conducted tests at 75 locations in the waterways of Alaska\u2019s Brooks Range. The rivers and streams in the range appeared to rust and became cloudy and orange over the past five to 10 years, according to the study published in the journal Communications: Earth & Environment. The discoloration and cloudiness are being caused by metals such as iron, zinc, copper, nickel and lead, the researchers found \u2013 some of which are toxic to the river and stream ecosystems \u2013\u00a0as permafrost thaws and exposes the waterways to minerals locked away underground for thousands of years. \u201cWe\u2019re used to seeing this in parts of California, parts of Appalachia where we have mining history. This is a classic process that happens in rivers here in the continental US that have been impacted for over 100 years since some of the mining rushes in the 1850s,\u201d said Brett Poulin, a co-author of the study and a professor of environmental toxicology at UC Davis. \u201cBut it\u2019s very startling to see it when you\u2019re on some of the most remote wilderness and you\u2019re far from a mine source.\u201d Arctic soils naturally contain organic carbon, nutrients and metals, such as mercury, within their permafrost, the study says. High temperatures have caused these minerals and the water sources around them to meet as permafrost melts. The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, studies have shown. \u201cWhat we believe we\u2019re seeing is this thawing of soil that\u2019s happening faster there than it would happen elsewhere,\u201d said Poulin. \u201cIt\u2019s really an unexpected consequence of climate change.\u201d Researchers used satellite imagery to determine when the change in color happened at different rivers and streams. \u201cAt several of the locations it happened, the most drastic increases were between 2017 and 2018 and they coincided with the warmest years on record at that point,\u201d said Poulin. This discoloration has been linked to \u201cdramatic declines\u201d in aquatic life, raising concerns about how the continued melting of permafrost will affect communities that rely on those waterways for drinking and fishing. In Alaska\u2019s Arctic rivers alone reside a variety of fish that are \u201ccritical for subsistence, sport, and commercial fisheries,\u201d researchers wrote. Poulin said local communities voiced their concerns and observations to study researchers beginning seven years ago. Alaska is not the only state experiencing this phenomenon. Another study, published just a month before researchers in Alaska made their findings public, details how Colorado\u2019s Rocky Mountains are seeing similar effects from, among other things, a warming climate. The study, published by Water Resources Research, notes an increase of metal concentrations \u2013 namely sulfate, zinc and copper \u2013 across 22 of Colorado\u2019s mountain streams in the past 30 years. Researchers found a reduced streamflow accounted for half of the increase, while the other half, they say, is from the thawing of frozen ground that allows for minerals to leach out of the bedrock. These studies have extended beyond the US in the past. Similar research on increases in metal and rare earth element concentrations in mountain rivers and streams has been done in the Chilean Andes, the European Alps and the Pyrenees in northern Spain. Although some of these areas have been exposed to mining sites and thus have seen metal concentrations in rivers and streams over the years, the noted increases raise questions about how climate change will continue to impact mountain water sources. Researchers in Alaska will continue their study in the coming years to determine the location of the metal and mineral sources, and how aquatic and human life will be impacted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/climate/orange-rivers-permafrost-alaska/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

He just keeps making me do things.\u201d Since assuming power in 2014, Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have promoted a strident brand of Hindu nationalism in a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith. And while he has used such language in the past, his message of being a leader chosen by God has become much more apparent as attempts to win a third consecutive five-year term in power. Throughout India\u2019s mammoth weeks-long\u00a0national election, which declares results on June 4, Modi has given multiple media interviews and speeches that echo the comments made to NDTV. He has taken on the persona of an openly devout Hindu, said Subir Sinha, Director of the South Asia Institute at SOAS University of London. This, he added has \u201crallied his base who feel pride in such religiosity.\u201d India is a deeply religious country. But historically its post-Independence leaders have remained publicly secular, in part to avoid being seen to pander to any one side in a nation with a long history of inter-religious violence. \u201c(He is) the first prime minister, they say, to be unashamed about this faith,\u201d Sinha said. When he first contested elections a decade ago, Modi chose India\u2019s spiritual capital Varanasi as his constituency, making the ancient city the perfect backdrop to meld his religious and political ambitions. \u201cMother Ganga has called me to Varanasi,\u201d Modi said at the time, referring to the holy Ganges River, considered to be the body of the Hindu deity Ganga by many followers of the faith. Standing on its banks earlier this month, Modi made another reference to his perceived divinity. \u201cUntil my mother was alive, I had believed that perhaps my birth was a biological one,\u201d Modi told CNN affiliate CNN News-18. \u201cBut after her death, when I look at my life experiences, I\u2019m convinced that God has sent me here.\u201d God has, Modi said, made him \u201cnothing but an instrument.\u201d Modi\u2019s grandest display of divinity was on display in January this year, when he consecrated the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, a controversial Hindu temple that was built on the site of a destroyed mosque. Billboards celebrating the temple\u2019s opening featured an image of Hindu deity Ram alongside Modi\u2019s face, with the leader of his BJP even\u00a0dubbing\u00a0the prime minister \u201cThe King of Gods.\u201d Modi fasted for 11 days in a purification ritual before the event and visited temples across the country, performing customs sacramental to India\u2019s majority faith. He publicly called himself \u201can instrument\u201d of Lord Ram, picked by the divine to \u201crepresent all the people of India.\u201d At the consecration, Modi presided over the \u201cPran Pratishtha\u201d \u2013 the unveiling of the much-anticipated Ram idol \u2013 taking on a role typically reserved for priests. During the election Modi has also sparked a row over hate speech when he accused Muslims \u2013 who have been part of India for centuries \u2013 of being \u201cinfiltrators,\u201d and echoing a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists that Muslims are displacing the country\u2019s Hindu population by deliberately having large families. It ignited widespread anger among Muslim leaders and opposition politicians and calls for election authorities to investigate. BJP party spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking about undocumented migrants.

Remal made landfall at the start of the week and while it weakened it has brought torrential rain to much of Bangladesh and northeastern India. The death toll across both nations has now risen to 51 people. The northeastern Indian state of Mizoram has been hit hardest with landslides killing 27 people, according to local officials. \u201cElectricity and water supply will be stifled due to damage of infrastructure,\u201d the Mizoram government said in a statement on X. Cyclone-related deaths were also reported in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal and the southern Indian state of Telangana as well as Bangladesh. The Indian Meteorological Department on Tuesday said Remal weakened into a depression over east Bangladesh after losing some force earlier on Monday. It caused widespread damage in both countries, toppling trees, turning roads into rivers and leaving millions without electricity. More than 1 million people in India and Bangladesh were evacuated Sunday as the cyclone made landfall near the border between the two countries. Authorities said that volunteers and army staff were mobilized to assist with clean-up efforts, and distribute food and water to displaced families. Remal made landfall roughly 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of the Indian city of Kolkata, packing gusts of up to 135 kilometers per hour (84 miles per hour), and is moving northwards across Bangladesh and its adjoining West Bengal coasts, the Indian Meteorological Department said. The storm weakened after it hit the coast with wind speeds of up to 115 kilometers per hour (71 mph). Remal is expected to dump more than 89 millimeters (3.5 inches) of rain and bring wind-driven storm surges of 2.5 to 3.7 meters to the coasts of the Bay of Bengal, according to CNN Weather. The ports of Mongla and Payra in Bangladesh put up the Great Danger Signal 10 \u2014 the highest alert signal \u2014 on Sunday, and all boats were advised to remain in shelter by the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. About 2 million people live in storm-affected areas in Bangladesh, according to non-profit BRAC.  At least half a million of these people \u201clive in houses made of materials such as clay, wood, plastic sheets, straw or tin,\u201d said Dr. Md Liakath Ali, a disaster expert at BRAC. The country is one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis, studies show.  Millions are without power as authorities shut down electricity supply to many areas in advance to avoid accidents, according to Ali. Fallen trees and broken lines disrupted supply, he said. An especially vulnerable group are the stateless Rohingya communities who fled persecution in nearby Myanmar during a military crackdown in 2017. They are already\u00a0living in the world\u2019s largest refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, which is at risk of landslides and floods, owing to the flimsy structure of their shelters. Many live in bamboo and tarpaulin shelters perched on hilly slopes that are vulnerable to strong winds, rain, and landslides. Video taken by a BRAC volunteer early Monday in Mongla showed a woman struggling to walk through the floodwaters as gusts of wind nearly toppled her over. In India, video from the country\u2019s National Disaster Response Force showed workers removing broken trees in the state of West Bengal as heavy rain lashed down on them. The Coast Guard was closely monitoring Remal\u2019s landfall, with ships and hovercraft on standby to respond to any challenges, it said. Hundreds of flights were also impacted following the closure on Sunday of the main international airport in Kolkata, West Bengal state\u2019s capital. Air traffic in and out of the airport resumed on Monday, but disruptions continued with dozens of flights delayed, according to the airport\u2019s official website. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said he had reviewed disaster management and preparation efforts. \u201cI pray for everyone\u2019s safety and wellbeing,\u201d Modi wrote on X. Cyclones, also known as typhoons and called hurricanes in North America, are enormous heat engines of wind and rain that feed on warm ocean water and moist air. And scientists say the climate crisis is making them more potent. A study published in 2021 by researchers at the Shenzhen Institute of Meteorological Innovation and the Chinese University of Hong Kong and published in Frontiers in Earth Science found that tropical cyclones in Asia could have double the destructive power by the end of the century, with scientists saying the human-made climate crisis is already making them stronger. The cyclone comes as parts of western and central India continue to bake under severe heat, with temperatures soaring beyond 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some cities, causing illness and forcing some schools to close. Climate scientists have long warned that these extremes of weather will only continue to intensify because of the climate crisis, with millions of people in India vulnerable to the risks associated with it.

Pope Francis has recognized a second miracle attributed to Acutis, a gamer and computer programmer who died from leukemia in 2006 at age 15. During his life, Acutis used his technological skills to spread awareness of the Catholic faith, including setting up a website documenting miracles. Born in London 1991, he later moved to Milan, Italy with his family. Although Acutis\u2019 parents were not religious, the young boy\u2019s faith was nurtured by his Polish nanny. After his death, his body was moved to the Italian town of Assisi, where it is now displayed in a shrine, alongside other relics linked to him. Prospective candidates for sainthood normally need to have two miracles attributed to them before they can be canonized. The latest miracle attributed to Acutis relates to the reported healing of a girl from Costa Rica who had suffered a head trauma after falling from her bicycle in Florence, Italy, where she was studying. Her mother said she prayed for her daughter\u2019s recovery at the tomb of Acutis in Assisi. Acutis was beatified and declared \u201cblessed\u201d after his first miracle in 2020, when he reportedly healed a Brazilian boy who had a birth defect in his pancreas that left him unable to eat food normally. Following the attribution of two miracles, the next step is for the Pope to convene a meeting of cardinals to agree on Acutis\u2019 sainthood and decide on a date for the canonization. His story is seen as helpful for the Catholic Church as it seeks to connect better with younger generations in a digital age. Acutis \u2013 considered a millennial as he was born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s \u2013 is remembered by friends and family as enjoying playing video games such as Halo, Super Mario and Pok\u00e9mon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/europe/carlo-acutis-first-catholic-millennial-saint-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

As of Wednesday, no arrests have been reported. Several organizations have reported that the run-up to this election has been the most violent in the country\u2019s recent history. However, figures from independent groups and firms differ from those of the Mexican government. The research group Data C\u00edvica has reported 31 homicides, Consultora Integralia has reported 34, and consulting firm DataInt registered 38 in a report published on May 21. The Secretary of Security and Citizen Protection, Rosa Icela Rodr\u00edguez, acknowledged on Tuesday the deaths of 22 candidates during the 2023-2024 electoral process, of which eight victims were candidates accredited by the National Electoral Institute (INE) or before local electoral bodies, according to the official. The Mexican government had previously reported on April 2 that there had been at least 15 candidate deaths since the electoral process began on October 1. On Wednesday, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador claimed that the electoral violence is the result of a link between past governments and criminal groups. \u201cWhat we are suffering in the case of electoral political violence still has to do with that \u2013 links that were established between the authorities and crime,\u201d the Mexican president said in his morning press conference. International electoral observers, accredited by INE to witness Sunday\u2019s general elections, have expressed concern about the violence plaguing the country ahead of the polls. \u201cCertainly, this is more of a call to investigate the facts and take measures so that these issues do not tarnish the elections and do not cause damage to Mexican democracy,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza Salinas, head of the Electoral Observation Mission of the Organization of American States, said Wednesday. Mexico will hold its general election on June 2, when nearly 100 million people will be called to vote. There are 20,375 positions on the ballot, of which 19,746 are local and 629 are federal, including the presidency.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/americas/mexico-electoral-violence-spikes-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_asia_chinese-ships-japan-senkaku-islands-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "China Coast Guard ships have been in waters around Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea for a record 158 consecutive days, according to Tokyo\u2019s latest count released Monday, surpassing the previous record set in 2021. Analysts fear the uninhabited islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China, have the potential to become a flashpoint for conflict between the two Asian neighbors. \u201cThe Japanese government takes very seriously the fact that there have been a succession of vessels sailing in the contiguous zone and trespassing in territorial waters,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at Monday briefing in Tokyo. The Japanese government chief spokesperson did not say how often Chinese ships entered Japan\u2019s territorial waters, though foreign ships are allowed \u201cinnocent passage\u201d through such waters. A contiguous zone extends another 12 nautical miles beyond a country\u2019s territorial waters, the area that stretches 12 nautical miles from the shore. Foreign warships are allowed into contiguous zone waters \u2013 so the Chinese Coast Guard hasn\u2019t broken any international agreements \u2013 but the continuous presence of the Chinese vessels there is seen as a provocation. Hayashi said Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has raised Tokyo\u2019s \u201cserious concerns\u201d with Chinese Premier Li Gongmin during a trilateral summit with South Korea in Seoul on Monday. \u201cWe will continue to take every possible precaution and surveillance around the Senkaku Islands with a sense of urgency,\u201d he said. Competing claims The uninhabited island chain has been a sore spot in Japan-China relations for years. Claims over the rocky chain, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) southwest of Tokyo but only about 205 miles (330 kilometers) from China\u2019s east coast, date back centuries, and neither Japan nor China is likely to back down over territory considered a national birthright in both capitals. Tensions heated up in 2012, after Tokyo bought some of the islands from a private Japanese owner, which Beijing took as a direct challenge to its sovereignty claims. It has frequently dispatched China Coast Guard and other government vessels to the waters around the islands to assert those claims. \u201cChina\u2019s patrol and law enforcement missions in waters off the Diaoyu Dao are legitimate measures taken by China to exercise its sovereignty in accordance with law and are necessary responses to Japanese provocations in violation of China\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d a 2022 Chinese Foreign Ministry document says. \u201cNo country or force should misjudge the strong resolve of the Chinese government to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d it says. Experts have said China makes a statement and sets up a possible legal argument for sovereignty over the islands by keeping government ships near them. To present an international legal claim to the islands over Japan, \u201cChina simply needs to establish a greater and more enduring presence of its ships in the waters around the islands,\u201d James Brown, an associate professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo, told CNN in 2022. Hayashi, the Japanese government spokesperson, said Monday that Tokyo is answering the Chinese presence around the islands with vessels of its own. \u201cWe ensure a comprehensive security system for territorial waters by deploying Coast Guard patrol vessels that are consistently superior to other party\u2019s capacity,\u201d Hayashi said. Any Japanese-Chinese incident in the Senkakus raises the risk of a wider conflict, analysts note, due to Japan\u2019s mutual defense treaty with the United States. Washington has made clear on numerous occasions that it considers the Senkakus to be covered by the mutual defense pact. China exerts pressure at sea The extended Chinese presence around the Senkakus comes as Chinese forces assert themselves in two other East Asian hotspots \u2013 around Taiwan and near Philippines-controlled features in the South China Sea. China staged its largest military exercises this year around Taiwan last week after the island\u2019s new democratically elected leader, President Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity, was sworn in. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary. And in the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard has been taking action against Philippine vessels trying to resupply a contingent of Philippine marines on Second Thomas Shoal, using water cannons on that have injured Filipino sailors and damaged their craft. The developments come as leaders and military officials prepare to gather in Singapore for the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia\u2019s premier defense summit. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is scheduled to give the keynote speech Friday evening, with Chinese-Philippine clashes around Second Thomas Shoal expected to be a prime topic. The US and Chinese defense chiefs are also expected to address the conference.

{"id": "2024_05_28_middleeast_spain-ireland-norway-recognize-palestinian-statehood-intl", "text": "Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized Palestinian statehood on Tuesday, cementing a joint move that further isolates Israel over its war against Hamas in Gaza. Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said his country made the decision, which was strongly condemned by Israel, \u201cto keep the miracle of peace alive.\u201d The nations had announced they would take this step last week, but on Tuesday their respective governments simultaneously approved the declaration, meaning it has now officially come into effect. The move also highlights just how split Europe is on whether to recognize Palestinian statehood. A majority of countries around the world do so, and reaffirmed that stance this month in a United Nations resolution in support of Palestinian membership that passed with the support of 143 nations. Among them were many European states. But it is difficult to be truly definitive about how many countries view the issue; some former Eastern bloc countries, for example, recognized Palestinian statehood decades ago while under Soviet rule, but have since distanced themselves from that stance as independent countries. Spain, Ireland and Norway The move by these three countries to recognize Palestinian statehood in tandem sent an impactful message to Israel, and other Western states. Harris said in a statement on Tuesday that Ireland \u201chad wanted to recognise Palestine at the end of a peace process,\u201d but ultimately \u201cmade this move alongside Spain and Norway to keep the miracle of peace alive\u201d \u2013 underlining how the joint declaration gave each nation some level of cover, and may have accelerated the process. \u201cI again call on Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to listen to the world and stop the humanitarian catastrophe we are seeing in Gaza,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,\u201d the Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide added as his country formalized the move on Tuesday. \u201cThe international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.\u201d In Madrid, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said in a nationally televised address that Spain would join \u201cmore than 140 countries that already recognize Palestine\u201d and that it \u201cis the only way to realize the solution that we all recognize as the only possible one to achieve a future of peace: that of a Palestinian state that coexists alongside the state of Israel in peace and security.\u201d But all three countries have received a furious response from Israel since announcing their decision last week. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors to the trio, and said in a statement: \u201cI am sending a clear message today \u2013 Israel will not hold back against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security.\u201d \u201cAfter the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has seen, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state,\u201d Katz added. Western Europe In 2014, Sweden became the first major Western European nation to recognize Palestinian statehood. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said the decision was made because it \u201cmet the criteria of international law.\u201d \u201cIn the light of the international law analysis, we see no reason to delay this decision,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a territory of people and a government. Not to recognize Palestine because of the occupation would be against the principle of international law about no fruits of aggression.\u201d But that move did not lead to a groundswell of Western European support for the declaration. Instead, some countries have inched towards supporting Palestinian statehood as part of their wider advocacy for a two-state solution, but have not yet taken the step of formal recognition. Notably, France, Belgium, Poland and Greece voted in favor of the May 10 UN General Assembly resolution that called for Palestinian membership of the UN earlier this month. Denmark was also among the countries that voted \u201cYes.\u201d But on Tuesday, as its neighbor Norway formalized its recognition, Denmark\u2019s parliament voted down a proposal to do so, Reuters reported. Other countries \u2013 including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands \u2013 abstained from the UN vote, which was significant but ultimately symbolic given the United States\u2019 veto. In total, 143 votes were passed in favor of the UN resolution, 25 nations abstained and nine voted against. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u00a0said Friday that the time for a German recognition had not yet come, as there is \u201cno clarity on the territory of the state.\u201d For now, it\u2019s about achieving a long-term ceasefire,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cThe path of symbolic recognition of\u00a0statehood\u00a0is not the way forward.\u201d Eastern Europe Officially, a number of countries that previously fell under the Soviet sphere of influence in eastern Europe recognize Palestinian statehood. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria all take that stance, Reuters reported on Tuesday. But in eastern Europe, that recognition is often complicated, given that the order to formalize ties was given under a Soviet regime that sought to disrupt American global partnerships, such as that with Israel. Some former Soviet-bloc countries, such as Poland, have maintained close ties with Palestinian authorities, and have visited or hosted leaders from the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. Others have since distanced themselves from their historical declaration of support for Palestinian statehood, such as the Czech Republic, which was one of just nine countries to vote against the UNGA resolution earlier this month. The other nations were Hungary, Argentina, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Israel and the United States. Slovenia\u2019s government will consider a proposal this week to recognize an independent Palestinian state, according to Prime Minister Robert Golob. Golob said in a statement that \u201cafter a series of consultations over the last few days,\u201d a government meeting on Thursday will consider forwarding \u201cthe recognition of Palestine\u201d to the country\u2019s legislature for approval.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/spain-ireland-norway-recognize-palestinian-statehood-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_ammo-arrests-turks-and-caicos", "text": "Five Americans were arrested in Turks and Caicos within the past six months because of tightened gun control laws in the territory that make bringing in firearms or ammunition without prior permission from police a crime with a mandatory 12-year prison sentence. Michael Lee Evans, 72, of Texas; Sharitta Grier, 45, of Florida; Bryan Hagerich, of Pennsylvania; Ryan Tyler Watson, 40, of Oklahoma and Tyler Wenrich, 31, of Virginia, were all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to Turks and Caicos, a 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas.  While some have pleaded guilty, paid fines or returned to the US, others await trial with the road ahead unclear. But what is clear: all have said the ammunition recovered from their luggage was not intentionally packed, according to American lawmakers petitioning for their expedited release. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the Americans and the laws in Turks and Caicos: No constitutional right to carry firearms in Turks and Caicos Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said. And that\u2019s a worry for the British Overseas Territory. While it is legal to fly in the US with unloaded firearms and ammunition in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration, bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d Firearm and ammunition offenses carry a mandatory minimum custodial sentence of 12 years and a fine, according to the Turks and Caicos Island Government. The mandatory sentence is in place to protect those on the islands, Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. Judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d she said. But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said. \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly,\u201d Misick said. US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials have said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were United States citizens, Misick said last week, and none of them received the 12-year sentence. While the US and Turks and Caicos collaborate in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know so far about the Americans and the laws in Turks and Caicos: Bryan Hagerich Hagerich was the first of the five to return to Pennsylvania after he received a suspended 52-week sentence on Friday, which meant he wouldn\u2019t face immediate incarceration, his representatives said. He was also given a $6,700 fine. The father of two pleaded guilty to possession of 20 rounds of ammunition, according to the Turks and Caicos government.  Hagerich paid the fine and was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory. He flew home Friday afternoon, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign, a group that helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Hagerich said when he was reunited with his children. \u201cA lot of memories to make together. Just so elated to see them. They\u2019ve been so strong through all this.\u201d After Hagerich arrived at Pittsburgh International Airport on Friday night, he told reporters he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d to have his two children jump into his arms, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WTAE. Before Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, his wife packed two suitcases \u2013 one if he was sentenced to prison and another if he were allowed to return home because the couple was unsure how the judge would rule when they walked into the courtroom on Friday, they said in an exclusive interview with \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cIt was dark, you have no concept of time,\u201d Hagerich said about his week-long stay in jail in Turks and Caicos. \u201cI was with three folks that were accused of murder. It was scary.\u201d Tyler Wenrich Wenrich pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. He was sentenced on Tuesday to three weeks in jail and issued a fine. The Virginia resident was fined $9,000, said Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, director of communications for the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands in a news statement Tuesday. Since he had already served three weeks in jail, the court recognized it as time served and he won\u2019t be immediately incarcerated, the release said. The Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case, saying, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Wenrich was charged with possession of two 9mm rounds, according to the Turks and Caicos government. Michael Lee Evans Evans, 72, pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9mm rounds of ammunition and appeared before the court on April 24 via video conference. The Texan was allowed to return to the United States on bail due to a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing set for June 18, his attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel, said. Ryan Tyler Watson Watson, who lives in Oklahoma, was charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition. The 40-year-old appeared in court on April 24, according to the TCGI, and is currently on bail. Watson pleaded guilty at a hearing on Tuesday, Tynes, with the communications office of the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, confirmed to CNN. He will be sentenced in June. Sharitta Shinese Grier Grier was\u00a0arrested two weeks ago\u00a0and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. The Florida mother had no idea that two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, she told CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV earlier this month. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen because I couldn\u2019t believe it was in there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey went through my bag and said they found rounds at the bottom of my carry-on.\u201d Grier was released on bail, but she can\u2019t leave the island until her case concludes and must report to a local police station weekly, the station reported. \u201cI\u2019m just broken,\u201d Grier said. Grier\u2019s next court appearance is on July 5, police said. US lawmakers tried to free Americans A US congressional delegation traveled to the islands last week and asked for the charges for the five Americans to be dropped. One of the US lawmakers, Oklahoma Republican Sen.\u00a0Markwayne Mullin, said in a statement, \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today.\u201d In an interview with ABC News last week, Republican Congressman Rep.\u00a0Guy Reschenthaler said, \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now, (where) every third week an American is being detained wrongfully and Turks and Caicos.\u201d Reschenthaler told CNN the prison on Turks and Caicos has been flagged by the UN for humanitarian concerns. In a House of Assembly address, the islands\u2019 Misick said, \u201cThe (accusations) of congressman (Guy Reschenthaler) against the government and people of the Turks and Caicos Islands are nothing more than diabolic falsehoods.\u201d Reschenthaler told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju he wants to see a \u201cresolution here where the Americans get zero amount of jail time. They should be given time served and be sent home to the United States.\u201d Reschenthaler continued: \u201cThey were innocent mistakes. Any other nation would handle this with a fine in sending that person back to the country of origin. Here, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d On Tuesday, Mullin welcomed the news of Wenrich\u2019s release, saying it\u2019s \u201canother step in the right direction,\u201d according to a post on X. \u201cI again encourage TCI to address the unintended consequences of their law to prevent this from happening again.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sahar Akbarzai, Michael Rios,\u00a0Holly Yan, Fabiana Chaparro, Amanda Musa\u00a0and\u00a0AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/americas/ammo-arrests-turks-and-caicos/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_28_middleeast_israeli-tanks-advance-central-rafah-gaza-intl", "text": "Israel\u2019s tanks were seen in central Rafah on Tuesday for the first time since its military entered Gaza\u2019s southernmost city earlier this month, two eyewitnesses told CNN, signaling a new phase in its offensive despite mounting global pressure. They arrive two days after a strike on a Rafah camp killed dozens of displaced Palestinians on Sunday and as the international community urges Israel to stop its assault on the city. Israeli strikes over the past two days in Rafah have forced more displaced people to flee. Two further attacks in Rafah killed at least 29\u00a0Palestinians on Tuesday,\u00a0according to authorities in Gaza. The first hit a displacement camp just 150 meters from the site of Sunday\u2019s strike. The second hit\u00a0a displacement camp\u00a0in the southern coastal town of Al-Mawasi, an area designated by Israel as a \u201csafe zone\u201d where it had earlier ordered thousands of people to evacuate to. Israel has denied striking a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi. Staunch ally the United States said President Joe Biden is not altering his policy toward Israel, suggesting the strikes had not yet crossed\u00a0a red line\u00a0that would force changes in American support. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby asserted on Tuesday there were no indications yet that Israel had waged a military campaign that would prompt Biden to withhold aid or weapons. Biden had said in a CNN interview earlier this month\u00a0that he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. His administration has warned against a large-scale ground invasion in Rafah unless the well-being of civilians can be guaranteed. Some 1.3 million Palestinians were sheltering in Rafah before Israel began its operation there, having fled from other parts of Gaza since the conflict began seven months ago. Around 1 million have fled the city since, according to UN figures. Israel\u2019s advance deeper into Rafah comes despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordering it to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its military operation there. The UN and some of Israel\u2019s European allies have called on it to abide by the ICJ\u2019s order, saying it is binding. In Khan Younis, north of\u00a0Rafah, people attempting to evacuate told CNN they do not know where else to go as they try to head north toward Deir El-Balah in central Gaza. Video shows mattresses, wooden panels, chairs, and various other belongings piled on top of vehicles and donkey carts. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now, whether in\u00a0Rafah, Khan Younis or Gaza in general, is the disastrous displacement of people. There is no shelter, no life, no future,\u201d said Ansar Mahdi, a Palestinian who said she has now been displaced four times. Walking on crutches, Mohamed Jarbou, said: \u201cThe elderly have been humiliated. Children humiliated. What\u2019s wrong? They are all civilians.\u201d Tanks in Rafah Alaa Abu Ibrahim, a Rafah resident, told CNN that Israeli tanks were seen at the Al Awda roundabout in the center of the city. Another resident, Salma AlKadoomi, said she saw armored vehicles in the downtown area. \u201cThese vehicles advanced in the middle of the night,\u201d AlKadoomi told CNN. Asked about reports of tanks advancing in the city, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told a media briefing on Tuesday that the military is operating in Rafah in a \u201ctargeted\u201d and \u201cprecise\u201d way. \u201cThere are still Hamas battalions in Rafah. A couple of days ago launchers from Rafah fired (rockets) to Tel Aviv. Millions of people went into bomb shelters,\u201d he said. Israel began a limited ground operation in Rafah on May 7, crossing the Philadelphi Corridor \u2013 a 14-kilometer (about 8.7-mile) buffer zone on the Egypt-Gaza border \u2013 and seizing the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt. Egypt has strongly opposed the operation at its border. On Monday, an Egyptian security worker was killed on the border with Gaza in a shooting that involved Egyptian and Israeli soldiers. Egypt\u2019s state-affiliated Al-Qahera News outlet said \u201cPalestinian resistance\u201d fighters were also involved. Displacement camps hit again: Palestinian officials Palestinian officials said Tuesday\u2019s fresh Israeli strikes had killed 29 people \u2013 at least eight at the Tal al-Sultan camp and 21 at a camp\u00a0in Al-Mawasi, though the IDF has denied striking a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi. CNN has followed up, asking if the IDF has struck elsewhere in Al-Mawasi, such as the UN warehouse that is in the vicinity of the camp, but has not received a reply. The first strike hit three tents at Tal al-Sultan at around 3 a.m. local time, according to residents and a CNN stringer in Rafah. At least eight people were\u00a0killed and transferred to a field hospital in Tal al-Sultan, according to the Emergency Committee of the Rafah Governorate. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the strike at Tal al-Sultan. The camp hit on Tuesday is approximately 150 meters from another displacement\u00a0camp where an Israeli strike and ensuing fire on Sunday killed at least 45 people. Video from CNN\u2019s stringer in Tal al-Sultan shows displaced people dismantling their makeshift living arrangements, gathering their belongings and evacuating the area on trucks and donkey carts. Al-Mawasi, north of Rafah, is supposedly a \u201csafe zone.\u201d In early May, the Israeli military ordered people in eastern Rafah to \u201cimmediately head to the expanded humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi,\u201d as it stepped up its operations in the area. The Al-Mawasi camp was already crowded with displaced people before civilians in Rafah were ordered to move there. The UN has said it is not \u201cquite suitable\u201d for habitation. Videos obtained by CNN show several dead bodies lying on sand covered in bloodied blankets with dozens of people shrieking and gathering around them. Children are seen crying next to the bodies of women whose faces are covered in blood. Israeli investigation Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday said the civilian casualties caused by Sunday\u2019s strike on the camp in Rafah were \u201ca tragic error.\u201d Israel launched an investigation into the event, and on Tuesday the IDF claimed the deadly fire at the camp could not have been caused solely by the weaponry used by Israel. \u201cOur munitions alone could not have ignited a fire of this size. Our investigation seeks to determine what may have caused such a large fire to ignite,\u201d Hagari said. \u201cWe are looking into all possibilities, including the option that weapons stored in a compound next to our target, which we did not know of, may have ignited as a result of this strike.\u201d He showed aerial footage of a strike on a structure in which he said senior Hamas commanders were meeting and\u00a0said that the military used two munitions with 17-kilogram (37 lbs) warheads.\u00a0\u201cThis is the smallest munitions that our jets could use.\u201d \u201cWe are working to verify the cause of the fire, it is still too early to be determined,\u201d Hagari said.\u00a0\u201cEven when we do find the cause of the fire that erupted it won\u2019t make this situation any less tragic.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/israeli-tanks-advance-central-rafah-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_europe_russian-strike-kharkiv-megastore-intl", "text": "Eighteen people, including a 12-year-old girl, are among those killed in a Russian strike that hit a large store in Kharkiv\u00a0at the weekend, regional officials have said, making it the deadliest attack Ukraine has endured in several weeks. Five people remain missing, Oleh Syniehubov, the head of the Kharkiv region military administration, said Monday. He said that 48 people were injured in the strike that hit the Epicenter hypermarket shopping center building while nearly 200 people were inside. Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second biggest city, which sits near its border with Russia, has seen a spate of Russian attacks in recent weeks. Security camera footage of the moment of the strike shows the building shake on impact, with the whole site immediately engulfed in thick smoke and flames. Police and witnesses described at least two explosions taking place. Oleksandr Lutsenko, director of the Epicenter shopping center, said he was in his office on the second floor at the time of the two explosions. \u201cI started to make my way down the corridor to the evacuation exit, but it was dark and the whole corridor was covered in dust. There was no air to breathe,\u201d he told CNN over the telephone. \u201cThe employees were also leaving. Everyone was groping, and people were holding each other. We could hear the ceiling falling.\u201d Once outside, he saw the hypermarket was on fire. \u201cThere was black smoke everywhere, and it was hard to breathe. Some people were jumping out of the windows,\u201d Lutsenko added. Ukraine\u2019s interior minister, Ihor\u00a0Klymenko, said the hours following the strike were \u201chellish\u201d and thanked everyone who helped to put\u00a0out the fires. Photographs from inside the store following the attack show the building in complete ruin, with burnt stock and collapsed walls. Ukrainian Catholic University identified the killed 12-year-old as Maria Myronenko, saying in a Facebook post that she had died in the strike alongside her mother, Iryna, who was a student at the institute. Her father had also been injured and was being treated in hospital, it said. Serhii Bolvinov, Chief of the Investigative Department of the Kharkiv Regional Police, said the family had been shopping when the two bombs hit. Maria\u2019s elder sister, Nadiya, 20, was not with them at the time, and learned of the deaths only after finding her father in hospital. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the strike as a \u201cbrutal attack,\u201d saying that\u00a0\u201cRussia is run by men who want to make it a norm \u2013 burning lives, destroying cities and villages, dividing people, and erasing national borders through war.\u201d Zelensky, who was in Spain for an official visit on Monday, urged Ukraine\u2019s allies to provide it with more air defenses. Meeting with Zelensky in Madrid, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced on Monday a new $1.08 billion weapons deal for Ukraine that \u201caims to reinforce air defense systems\u201d and protect Ukrainian citizens and infrastructure from Russia\u2019s attacks. \u201cWe are sending Patriot missiles,\u201d Sanchez said of the American-built air-defense system. \u201cZelensky\u00a0asks for the platforms to launch those, asking how many we can give. We are sending another batch of Leopard tanks and above all, munitions that the [Ukrainian] troops need.\u201d Zelensky\u00a0was due to visit Spain earlier this month but postponed the trip due to Russia\u2019s offensive around Kharkiv and other parts of Ukraine. That offensive appears to continue, with Kharkiv enduring intense attacks daily. The United States announced on Friday that it\u2019s sending $275 million in military assistance to Ukraine as part of \u201cefforts to help Ukraine repel Russia\u2019s assault near Kharkiv,\u201d according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The top US diplomat said the new tranche of assistance \u201ccontains urgently needed capabilities\u201d for Ukrainian troops as they\u00a0fight to hold back Russia\u2019s advances\u00a0toward the key northeastern city. Ukraine tamps down French trainer comments News of the new military assistance came as Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry tamped down expectations that French military trainers could soon be in Ukraine after online comments from army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi appeared to suggest their arrival in country was a done deal. \u201cI welcome the initiative of France to send instructors to Ukraine to train Ukrainian military personnel,\u201d Syrskyi had written on Telegram following a video conference between himself and the two countries\u2019 defense ministers. \u201cI have already signed the documents that will allow the first French instructors to visit our training centres and get acquainted with the infrastructure and personnel.\u201d Syrskyi\u2019s statement gave no possible timeline, but seemed to indicate France was ready to make what would be a very significant shift in NATO countries\u2019 involvement in Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia. Further heightening that sense, Syrskyi went on to write, \u201cI believe that France\u2019s determination will encourage other partners to join this ambitious project. I thanked the minister for the friendly support of the French people and military and economic assistance to Ukraine to repel Russian military aggression.\u201d In a later comment to CNN, apparently designed to lower expectations, and possibly soothe key allies, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry toned down the language, saying Kyiv had \u201cexpressed interest in the prospect of welcoming foreign instructors in Ukraine\u201d ever since a conference in Paris at the end of February. \u201cWe have ongoing discussions with France and other countries on this issue and have started internal paperwork to move forward when the decision is taken,\u201d the short statement concluded. The French Defense Ministry, in a comment to CNN, had a similar message about military trainers. \u201cAs with all the projects discussed at the conference, we are continuing to work with the Ukrainians to understand their exact needs,\u201d the statement said. At the Paris conference, French President Emmanuel Macron had floated the idea that sending military trainers to Ukraine was one way Kyiv\u2019s western allies could deploy troops in the country.

Satellite imagery from before and after the landslide show a vast section of the landscape in the mountainous Enga region essentially torn away. The vast size of the slide is even more visible from nearer the ground. More than 150 houses in Yambali village were buried in debris, officials said Sunday. The country\u2019s National Disaster Center said almost 2,000 were feared to be buried. The landslide\u00a0hit the remote village of Kaokalam, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby, at approximately 3 a.m. local time on Friday (1 p.m. Thursday ET), leaving a scar of debris that humanitarian workers said was\u00a0as big as\u00a0four football fields. The phenomenon slammed tons of rock and mud into locals\u2019 homes as they slept, and rescuers struggled to reach such a remote part of what is already one of Asia\u2019s poorest nations, leaving villagers with no choice but to dig through the collapsed mountainside with whatever tools they had. The area has remained unstable, with smaller landslides occurring regularly and endangering rescue workers, Sandis Tsaka told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re getting huge rocks and debris that keep falling down and land further beyond the original landslide area are being impacted,\u201d Tsaka said. He added the government had ordered nearly 7,000 people to evacuate. Evit Kambu said after the disaster that she had lost more than a dozen family members. \u201cI have 18 of my family members buried under the debris and soil that I am standing on and a lot more family members in the village I cannot count,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cI am the landowner here \u2026 but I cannot retrieve the bodies so I am standing here helplessly.\u201d Papua New Guinea is home to around 10 million people. Its vast mountainous terrain and lack of roads have made it difficult to access the affected area. Miok Michael, a local community leader, told CNN that it was likely there were few survivors. \u201cPeople are gathering and mourning,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have been digging since day one but can\u2019t locate bodies as they are covered by huge rocks.

The attack occurred in Kuchi village, Munya district, in Niger state, beginning at about 5:30 p.m. on Friday and lasting until 4:00 a.m. Saturday, according to district official Aminu Abdulhamid Najume. Niger state, which borders Nigeria\u2019s capital Abuja, has experienced repeated kidnappings for ransom by armed groups, including mass abductions, in recent years. Najume reported that about 300 gunmen arrived on motorbikes and stayed for several hours, making themselves at home before leaving with the abductees. \u201cThey made a fire to curb the cold because it was raining throughout that day,\u201d Najume said. \u201cThey cooked and made tea; they made Indomie (instant noodles) and spaghetti.\u201d Some of those killed were members of a local vigilante group who confronted the attackers but were overpowered. Najume added that security forces had not yet started rescue operations. \u201cThe police visited Kuchi yesterday [Sunday] and left, nothing else.\u201d A spokesperson for the Niger State Police Command did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. \u201cThis is not the first or second time Kuchi village has been attacked. This is the fifth time,\u201d Najume said, noting that the area frequently suffers from kidnappings for ransom. The kidnappers have not yet made any demands regarding the latest abduction, he said. Amnesty International said in a post\u00a0on social media platform X on Sunday that it was \u201cdeeply concerned by the abduction,\u201d criticizing Nigerian authorities for leaving \u201crural communities at the mercy of gunmen.\u201d \u201cSince 2021, gunmen have been consistently attacking Kuchi village and raping women and girls in their matrimonial homes,\u201d the agency stated. \u201cThe invasion of the village by the gunmen is yet another indication of the Nigerian authorities\u2019 utter failure to protect lives,\u201d Amnesty added. Nigeria\u2019s security forces have struggled for years to control insurgent groups in the north of the country. The Kuchi abduction comes two months after 21 people, including a newlywed, were killed when gunmen described locally as \u2018bandits\u2019 stormed a market in Rafi, another affected district in Niger. At least 137 schoolchildren were kidnapped earlier in March in Niger\u2019s neighboring Kaduna state but were later released after the kidnappers made an initial demand of 1 billion naira (over $675,000) and threatened to kill them all if their demands were not met.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/africa/gunmen-kidnap-scores-in-nigeria-deadly-raid-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

More than 280,000 utility customers in Texas were without power as of Wednesday evening, including more than 150,000 in Dallas County alone, according to PowerOutage.us. Both Houston and Dallas were slammed with hurricane-force winds Tuesday as violent storms flooded roads, upended trees and power lines and reduces some buildings to shells of their former selves. The winds collapsed an under-construction home in Magnolia, Texas, killing a 16-year-old working inside of it, according to the Montgomery County Sheriff\u2019s Office. At least eight people have been killed in the state since Saturday as severe weather pummeled the region over Memorial Day weekend. The violent weather is just the latest in an unrelenting series of severe storms that has battered Texas in recent weeks, leaving residents with little time to recover from one storm before the next arrives at their doorstep. Summerlike heat will ease across Texas this week following a sweltering heat wave, but those left without power or a reliable way to cool down could still face the risk of dangerous heat stroke or heat exhaustion. Temperatures across eastern Texas on Wednesday will hover around the mid-80s to low 90s, according to the National Weather Service. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins warned people to prepare to be without power for days as an area utility company reported extensive damage to its infrastructure. The utility, Oncor, shared photos of mangled electricity poles, twisted power lines and massive toppled trees. Widespread outages also hampered primary runoff elections on Tuesday in Dallas County, as more than a third of polling locations were in the dark, according to Jenkins. \u201cCheck on your friends, family, and neighbors, especially anyone elderly,\u201d Dallas County officials advised. \u201cDon\u2019t move debris yet as there could be hidden downed power lines that could still be energized.\u201d Esmeralda Martinez, who lives in the Dallas suburb of Carrollton, is among those now sifting through homes that were reduced to piles of soggy debris and jagged wooden beams, CNN affiliate WFAA reports. She and her family sheltered in a hallway as the storm tore off the roof, damaging every room in her home and soaking their belongings. Across the street, Javon Holloway and his grandmother are grateful their home was spared from more serious damage. The neighbors are thankful no one was harmed. \u201cDon\u2019t take your house for granted. I\u2019ll say that much. Be thankful for what you got,\u201d Holloway told WFAA. Storms continued moving across north and central Texas on Tuesday night and are expected to last through Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service in Fort Worth said. After a brief reprieve, another round of powerful storms will rumble back into the same area Thursday evening, bringing a threat of large hail, damaging winds and localized flooding to the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Houston faces damage d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu Houston-area residents are facing an all-too-familar feeling as they survey the fresh layer of damage left by Tuesday\u2019s storms \u2013 just two weeks after a derecho and a tornado bulldozed through the city, killing multiple people and knocking out power for nearly 1 million homes and businesses. Though 99% of those outages had been restored as of last week, more than 300,000 homes and businesses in the Houston area lost power in Tuesday\u2019s storms, according to the regional utility CenterPoint Energy. A majority of its customers had power restored by Wednesday morning. The latest severe weather also thwarted some of the city\u2019s ongoing recovery after the mid-May storm covered streets with trees and debris, shattered skyscraper windows and damaged buildings. That damage had not yet been fully repaired when Tuesday\u2019s storms tore through, rescattering piles of debris that crews had been collecting off the streets and sending another shower of broken window glass onto Downtown Houston, according to CNN affiliates KTRK and KHOU.

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said the new record was measured in the suburb of Mungeshpur, surpassing Delhi\u2019s previous high of 49.2 degrees Celsius (120.5 degrees Fahrenheit), observed in May 2022. Some areas of Delhi are struggling to access water, while others have none at all, said Atishi Marlena Singh, a senior minister in the Delhi government, at a news conference. Areas that normally receive water supplies twice a day will now have their delivery cut to once a day to redirect resources to areas that have had little to no supply at all, Singh said. The water shortages were caused by the \u201cacute heatwave,\u201d as well as a lack of water deliveries from the northern state of Haryana to Delhi, which are not being made as usual, Singh said. Delhi was not alone, as the mercury spiked across northwestern India. The temperature in the city of Churu in the state of Rajasthan soared to 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit). Sirsa, a city in the state of Haryana, saw thermometers reach 50.3 degrees Celsius (122.5 degrees Fahrenheit), Indian authorities said. Heatwave conditions will prevail in Delhi on Wednesday but are expected to subside starting Thursday, the IMD said. Extreme heat is becoming more common and intense in much of the world because of the human-caused climate crisis. India is particularly vulnerable to extreme heat and some places there are pushing the limits of human survivability, experts say. One study found that heat waves have killed more than 24,000 people in the country since 1992.

{"id": "travel_article_bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness", "text": "You\u2019re out for a hike, reveling in glorious nature. Suddenly, you spot a bear. And the bear has spotted you, too. Would you know what to do next? Beth Pratt sure would. She was once on the Old Gardiner Road Trail in Yellowstone National Park, enjoying her run in wild nature. Her reverie came to an end when she came upon a grizzly bear eating flowers.  \u201cI stopped. It stood on its hind legs and looked at me. I knew that wasn\u2019t a threatening gesture,\u201d she told CNN Travel. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding, it waved its paw at me as if to say, \u2018just go on your way,\u2019 and went back to eating.\u201d \u201cAnd I walked slowly away and put some distance between us, and the encounter ended fine.\u201d When it comes to dealing with bears, Pratt does have a thing or two on almost all the rest of us, though. She is the California regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation, a job she\u2019s had for more than 10 years. She worked in Yellowstone for several years \u2013 and once saw nine grizzlies in one day there.    Finally, she lives on the border of Yosemite National Park, and bears will pass through her yard, including this one seen in the footage above in late September 2021. You can hear the enthusiasm in Pratt\u2019s voice as she shares her bear bona fides and advice to make sure bear/human encounters are delightful, not dangerous. \u201cA wild bear is a beautiful sight to see. It\u2019s incredible to see them in the wild. I never had a bad experience with bears. What I try to get people to feel is respect, not fear, for bears. The animal usually wants to avoid the encounters.\u201d  Bears in the news   Bear attacks are rare, Pratt and US National Park Service websites point out, but they do happen:  \u2022 A disable veteran survived an attack from a mother grizzly at Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming in May 2024. \u201cIt was the most violent thing I have ever experienced.\u201d \u2022 A hunter suffered serious injuries in a grizzly bear attack in British Columbia in May 2024. \u2022 Bear attacks are on the increase in Japan. \u2022 A man lost part of his jaw in a grizzly bear attack in Montana in September 2023. \u2022 Two people died in a suspected grizzly bear attack in Canada\u2019s Banff National Park in late September 2023. \u2022 Two collegiate wrestlers were mauled by a grizzly bear near Cody, Wyoming, in October 2022; they had serious injuries but survived. They illustrate the point that rare doesn\u2019t equal never. Feasts for beasts  While it pays to be diligent at any time, autumn is a particularly good season to bone up on bear facts and safety when many bears are in a phase known as hyperphagia, Pratt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a period in the fall where bears are eating anything and everything to fatten up for hibernation.\u201d  She noted mountain lions are comparatively picky eaters. Not bears.   \u201cThey eat everything: Ants. Roadkill. Flowers. Nuts. And unfortunately, human food that\u2019s not secured. Our food is very attractive to them; it\u2019s easy calories.\u201d   Combine that with the fact that some national and state parks have become very popular and crowded, and you have a recipe for potential trouble. \u201cIf more people are using public lands and more people are in the mix, there\u2019s more potential for encounters and conflict. It does concern me a little bit,\u201d Pratt said. The key is being prepared \u2013 and that\u2019s where Pratt and others in the know come in. First rule of \u2018bear fight club\u2019: Don\u2019t fight The best strategy is to never get in harm\u2019s way by enticing or provoking a wild bear. Trying to give a bear food or approaching cute cubs are particularly terrible ways to start an encounter. That\u2019s just looking for trouble. The US National Park Service site points out each bear and each encounter is different, but there are general guidelines useful in most situations. First of all, keep your distance if you happen upon a bear. Don\u2019t approach it, and give it plenty of room to walk away from you. Yellowstone tells you to stay at least 100 yards (300 feet or 91 meters) away; Shenandoah National Park in Virginia suggests 200 feet (61 meters) for its black bears. You can run afoul of the law as well as the bears if you get too close and end up paying a fine.   Other tips: \u2022 Talk calmly to yourself in low tones to identify yourself as human. \u2022 Walk with a group (we\u2019re smellier and noisier in packs) and stay on designated trails. \u2022 If you have a small child or dog, pick it up. \u2022 Don\u2019t put yourself between cubs and their mother. \u2022  Avoid direct eye contact and move away slowly, sideways if possible. Pratt said don\u2019t be alarmed if a bear stands on its hind legs; it\u2019s not considered an aggressive move. Almost all encounters are peaceful, Pratt said. Many times, people never knew they were even close to a bear, as in this YouTube video that shows two people emerging from a basement oblivious to a nearby bear.  What if a bear starts coming at you anyway?  If a bear starts making assertive moves in your direction, you have important decisions to make \u2013 and fast. First thing is: Stand your ground with bears. With either grizzlies (a subspecies of brown bears) or black bears, \u201cplease don\u2019t run. Bears can outrun anybody,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cDon\u2019t climb a tree either. They can also climb trees better than you.\u201d  New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Division of Fish and Wildlife (where the black bear population is growing) also has some tips: \u2022 Make loud noises by yelling, banging pots and pans or using an airhorn to scare bears away. \u2022 Make yourself look as large as possible by waving your arms.  \u2022 If you\u2019re with other people, stay together. Pratt said you can usually intimidate or bluff your way out of sticky bear situations, depending on the bear species and the situation.  But what if a bear is about to attack? You\u2019re now in the rarest of situations \u2013 you\u2019ve attracted a bear\u2019s attention. It didn\u2019t move off. It\u2019s started coming at you aggressively and fast. You think you\u2019re about to be attacked. What\u2019s next? One very crucial thing is to make a quick ID of the kind of bear, because your strategy is going to be different depending on the type of bear.  If it\u2019s a black bear, the NPS and Pratt have a clear message: Do not run. Do not play dead. \u201cYou want to stand your ground with black bears. Look as intimidating as possible,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cThrow things not at it but near it. Make that black bear intimidated by you. Let it know you are a big person. Pick something up; yell at it. If it attacks, fight back \u2013 aim for the face.\u201d It\u2019s a different situation with grizzlies If you\u2019re dealing with a grizzly that won\u2019t back off and an attack is imminent, you\u2019re advised to do the opposite. You should play dead. \u201cAct as unthreatening as possible with a grizzly. Play dead with a grizzly if it starts to attack,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cTuck and cover. Get into a fetal position. Wrap your hands around your neck. Lay on your stomach. Once you do that, 99 percent of the time the grizzly will move on.\u201d  NPS elaborates: \u201cRemain still until the bear leaves the area. Fighting back usually increases the intensity of such attacks. However, if the attack persists, fight back vigorously.\u201d   Fighting back a grizzly bear is the last resort \u2013 \u201cyour Hail Mary pass\u201d as Pratt called it \u2013 when all other options are out. An exception to this rule: If you\u2019re camping in a tent and are attacked, that bear likely sees you as food. NPS and Pratt say this is a time to fight. How do you tell a black bear from a grizzly? First off, know your area and read up on the bears there. In North America, grizzlies have a much more limited range than black bears do. In the Lower 48, they are in Washington, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. And then in Alaska, too. They also cover large parts of western Canada. Black bears have more territory. They can be found in as many as 40 US states, much of Canada and even parts of northern Mexico, the National Wildlife Federation says. So say you\u2019re in Quebec, the Appalachians, the Ozarks, California or even parts of Florida, that\u2019s going to be a black bear. But if you\u2019re in Yellowstone or Glacier National Park, for instance, that could be a black bear or a grizzly. That\u2019s when it\u2019s crucial to know how to make a quick visual ID. You can\u2019t go by the color of the fur. Black bears can be black, brown, cinnamon, blond, blue-gray or white, according to Bear.org.  One of the best ways to tell the difference, Pratt said, is to look for a hump at the shoulders. Grizzlies have them. Black bears don\u2019t. She also said the face shapes are different. \u201cBlack bear faces look a little more cuddly to me, a little rounder, with a straight nose. A grizzly bear face looks more like a wild predator and has a dished shape.\u201d This NPS webpage has more helpful ways to tell the differences. Fun facts: Eight bear species can be found all over the world \u2013 from tropical Sri Lanka to the frigid reaches of Russia, Norway and Canada. And European websites such as Bear Watching Slovenia give many of the same safety tips as North Americans get. Bear spray and weapons Some people like to carry bear spray and/or a weapon with them when venturing into bear country.  Pratt is an advocate of the former and says be sure to practice using it first before going into the wild. NPS has helpful tips on using spray to ward off bears. She\u2019s more cautious about bringing firearms with you, especially if you\u2019re inexperienced. \u201cTaking a grizzly out with one shot would be tough. You need to be very experienced with a gun to increase your chance of safety.\u201d   A Brigham Young University study in 2008 found spray more effective than a firearm. And spray doesn\u2019t permanently harm a bear. Some people like to carry bear bells on their hikes, hoping the noise will ward off the animals. But the park service says that \u201cYelling, clapping and talking are more effective ways of alerting a bear to your presence.\u201d What campers need to know  If you\u2019re out camping overnight, you have extra considerations to take. Kyle Patterson, management specialist and public affairs officer at Rocky Mountain National Park, emailed CNN Travel some ways to keep hungry bears away. Patterson advised using a food storage locker if provided in campgrounds and picnic areas. Also, \u201cavoid storing food and coolers in your vehicle. If you must, store food in airtight containers in the trunk or out of sight. Close vehicle windows completely.\u201d  Other tips and cautions: \u2022 Don\u2019t store food in tents or pop-up campers in campgrounds or in vehicles at trailheads. \u2022 Don\u2019t leave food, coolers and dirty cookware unattended. Park rangers may confiscate them and cite you. \u2022 Get rid of garbage in bear-resistant dumpsters and trash cans. Human-fed bears usually end up as chronic problems and need to be removed, Patterson said. \u201cA fed bear is a dead bear.\u201d The ball is in our court Pratt emphasized it\u2019s up to humans to be responsible to these creatures. \u201cThe bears are just being bears. We are way more of a threat to them. Bear attacks are so rare. And fatalities are even rarer,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bears\u2019 lives are more at threat than ours in encounters. I want people to have magical, wonderful experiences in the wild. I want people to feel OK about having these encounters.\u201d ", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/article/bear-encounters-prevent-attacks-wellness/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_29_sport_josh-gibson-mlb-records-negro-league", "text": "Major League Baseball has incorporated the statistics of former Negro Leagues players into its historical records on its website, meaning legendary leaders in some categories like Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb have now been replaced in the record books by players who were not allowed to play on the same fields as them during segregation. Josh Gibson, one of the greatest sluggers in the history of the Negro Leagues, is now listed as MLB\u2019s new all-time career leader in batting average at .372, moving ahead of Ty Cobb at .367. The MLB website shows Gibson also overtaking Babe Ruth in career slugging percentage. \u201cWe are proud that the official historical record now includes the players of the Negro Leagues. This initiative is focused on ensuring that future generations of fans have access to the statistics and milestones of all those who made the Negro Leagues possible,\u201d said MLB commissioner Rob Manfred in a statement. \u201cTheir accomplishments on the field will be a gateway to broader learning about this triumph in American history and the path that led to Jackie Robinson\u2019s 1947 Dodger debut.\u201d Gibson was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972. \u201cWe\u2019re excited,\u201d Sean Gibson, the slugger\u2019s great grandson, told CNN. \u201cThis is a long time coming. Not just for Josh Gibson, but all the other great Negro League family members as well.\u201d The power-hitting catcher\u2019s Baseball Hall of Fame plaque \u2013 he\u2019s one of 35 Negro League stars enshrined in Cooperstown \u2013 says he \u201chit almost 800 home runs in league and independent baseball\u201d during his 17-year career. However, the majority of those homers came not in league-sanctioned games (about 50 to 75 per season) but in exhibitions played against former big leaguers and White semi-pro teams. \u201cThis is indeed an exciting day. It was a long time coming,\u201d Negro Leagues Baseball Museum President Bob Kendrick said at a Wednesday news conference. \u201cIt is an absolute watershed moment for both Black baseball and Negro League history.\u201d Kendrick continued, \u201cYou cannot reduce the story of the Negro Leagues to statistics. You just can\u2019t. \u201cThis story is far more grandiose than mere statistics. This story in many ways is bigger than the game of baseball.\u201d Kendrick also addressed baseball fans who may be upset their favorite players have moved down in some of the rankings. \u201cThat does not diminish them,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cIt is just now providing some names that perhaps you should have known about before now and you\u2019re getting the opportunity\u00a0to learn about them.\u201d More than 2,300 Negro Leagues players from 1920-1948 were added to the MLB database as more stats are \u201cstill being discovered.\u201d Also, MLB career statistics for Hall of Famers like Jackie Robinson, Satchel Paige and Minnie Mi\u00f1oso now reflect their Negro Leagues\u2019 accomplishments. For example, Robinson\u2019s 49 hits with the Kansas City Monarchs in 1945 increase his career total from 1,518 to 1,567. Paige\u2019s career wins total goes from 28 to 125 and Mi\u00f1oso\u2019s 150 hits with the New York Cubans raised his career total over the 2,000 hits milestone to 2,113. This comes about three and a half years after\u00a0MLB recognized the Negro Leagues as its equivalent and counted the statistics and records of thousands of Black players\u00a0who played in the Negro Leagues from 1920 to the late 1940s. Even though that recognition happened in December 2020, MLB at the time\u00a0said it needed time to review how that recognition would affect MLB record books. That was in part because some statistics were still being compiled and because MLB needed to sort league-sanctioned games from exhibitions. \u201cShortened Negro League schedules, interspersed with revenue-raising exhibition games, were born of MLB\u2019s exclusionary practices,\u201d John Thorn, MLB historian who chaired the review Negro Leagues Statistical Review Committee, said in a statement. \u201cTo deny the best Black players of the era their rightful place among all-time leaders would be a double penalty.\u201d Baseball historian Larry Lester, who also served on the committee, added: \u201cStories, folklore and embellished truths have long been a staple of the Negro Leagues narrative. Those storylines will always be entertaining, but now our dialogues can be quantified and qualified to support the authentic greatest of these athletes. \u201cEvery fan should welcome this statistical restitution towards social reparation.\u201d MLB in 2020 said it was \u201ccorrecting a longtime oversight\u201d by elevating the status of the Negro Leagues \u2014 which consisted of seven leagues and about 3,400 Black and Latino players from 1920 to 1948. \u201cMany people have heard of Martin Dihigo and Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige. But what about the thousands of other men who played in the Negro Leagues from 1920 to 1948? They\u2019re being recognized finally as major league caliber ballplayers,\u201d Scott Simkus, one of the researchers credited by MLB with compiling and constructing the\u00a0Seamheads Negro Leagues Database, said at the time. \u201cTheir statistical records, their careers are going to be considered equal to anybody who had played in the National League or American League during that period of time.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s sad this great history has been kept from them,\u201d Lester, co-founder of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, said at the time. Bob Kendrick, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, had said the recognition \u201cserves as historical validation for those who had been shunned from the Major Leagues and had the foresight and courage to create their own league that helped change the game and our country, too.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/sport/josh-gibson-mlb-records-negro-league/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_sport_kylian-mbappe-interview-spt-intl", "text": "He\u2019s a World Cup winner, who has won multiple titles with French club Paris Saint-Germain over the last seven years. Now, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who is widely expected to imminently join Real Madrid, says he\u2019s looking forward to the challenge of playing in a new country. \u201cI want to be happy,\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 told CNN Sport\u2019s Amanda Davies after being crowned Best Men\u2019s Player at the inaugural Globe Soccer Awards Europe Edition in Sardinia, Italy, on Tuesday. \u201cI will leave my country for the first time,\u201d added Mbapp\u00e9. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an amazing experience and I can\u2019t wait to be in my new club. I want to win trophies \u2026 When you speak about football, [it\u2019s about] winning trophies, being with new teammates. \u201cNow, I have my contract with PSG \u2026 Everybody knows that it\u2019s soon finishing and we\u2019re going to see what happens.\u201d It was earlier this month that confirmation came that the 25-year-old, who is the second most expensive soccer player in history, wouldn\u2019t be extending his stay with French giant PSG. The first time Real came calling for Mbapp\u00e9 was when the forward was just 13 years old. In his comic book, \u201cJe m\u2019appelle Kylian (I\u2019m called Kylian),\u201d Mbapp\u00e9 describes his dreams of one day playing in the famed white shirt of Los Blancos. And when Real submitted a $188 million bid for the striker in August 2021 \u2013 a deal that was close to being agreed \u2013 the Frenchman admitted at the time that he wanted to leave PSG. Mbapp\u00e9 eventually made a U-turn by signing a three-year contract extension with PSG in May 2022, temporarily pausing one of soccer\u2019s biggest transfer sagas. So was it the right decision to stay in Paris? \u201cIt was more than just staying at PSG. It was the World Cup in Qatar. It was many things around these things. It was a big decision, difficult decision \u2026 but I don\u2019t regret anything,\u201d said Mbapp\u00e9. \u201cOf course, in a career, you have to take difficult decisions and it\u2019s what I did, but I became the all-time top scorer with PSG. I just want to remember the best things \u2026 It was not an easy situation and I wish nobody to live that.\u201d Speaking with CNN Sport, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi paid tribute to Mbapp\u00e9 ahead of his impending departure from the club. \u201cI wish him all the best. He\u2019s done amazing for us for seven years. He was vice captain, he came to us at 18 years old or less and now he is a big man, the best player in the world,\u201d Al-Khelaifi said. \u201cYou never know, maybe one day he comes back to France, that\u2019s football,\u201d he added. \u201cHe only deserves good things.\u201d Real Madrid, meanwhile, has long had a history of having some of the game\u2019s biggest superstars in its ranks. The 2000-06 Gal\u00e1cticos squad boasted the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio, Lu\u00eds Figo and David Beckham, before the second incarnation came in 2009 in the form of record-breaking signings Cristiano Ronaldo and Kak\u00e1 \u2013 not to mention signing a young Karim Benzema from Lyon. The young Frenchman seems to have been earmarked as the player to headline a new wave of star power alongside the likes of Vin\u00edcius Jr. and Jude Bellingham. Those two players will be bidding to help Real win a record-extending 15th European Cup on Saturday when Los Merengues face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final in London\u2019s Wembley Stadium. Will Mbapp\u00e9 be cheering on his prospective new employer and teammates? \u201cNo \u2013 I\u2019ll just watch the final like you,\u201d he smiled. \u201cWhen you love football, you watch every game. I watch every game when I can \u2026 in France, England, Spain, Germany, Italy. Every league. So, of course, I\u2019m going to watch the Champions League.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s part of the journey\u2019 Champions League glory has so far eluded Mbapp\u00e9 in what is otherwise an astounding trophy-laden career. The closest he and PSG got was the 2020 final in Lisbon, when the team lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich. \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the journey,\u201d he says. \u201cI have, of course, many opportunities more to win the Champions League, but I think it\u2019s part of your destiny. \u201cWe were close a few times \u2026 It\u2019s part of the game. Now, I\u2019m in the position that I only want to have good feelings, good memories about my journey in Paris and everything that happened in this club and don\u2019t forget about the small details.\u201d Paris is where Mbapp\u00e9 the boy became Mbapp\u00e9 the man. After leaving AS Monaco as a fresh-faced 18-year-old, the superstar has achieved numerous individual and team accolades with PSG. He leaves the French capital having won six Ligue 1 titles, four French Cups, two League Cups and a record five Player of the Year awards. And, on top of that, he\u2019s a World Cup winner. \u201cIf I\u2019m the player who I am now \u2026 I have to thank PSG,\u201d said Mbapp\u00e9. \u201cWhen I arrived there [at 18], I was just a young guy who wanted to be someone in world football. \u201cI did one year in Monaco. Of course, it was great. We won the league and went to the semifinal of the Champions [League], but I did nothing important in the world of football. \u201c[PSG was] an amazing opportunity. I\u2019m French, I\u2019m from Paris, so it was something special. Seven years \u2026 That\u2019s a lot in a career, even more in modern football \u2026 It was a special feeling for me to be part of this club.\u201d \u2018I want to really improve my game\u2019 While some will judge his career in terms of goals, trophies and accolades, Mbapp\u00e9 sees his imprint on the sport in a bigger, historical perspective. \u201cI have a lot of things to give to football,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done many things, but I\u2019m still young and I want to do more \u2026 I want to put my name in the history of football. \u201cI just watch what I have in the future, and I want to really improve my game, to be a better player every year and to be the player who I want to be. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about goals, not just about trophies, it\u2019s about the feeling that you give to people, the emotion, and the way you can be a complete player, the way you can help your teammates to be better. \u201cI want to understand more the game, more the world of football, everything.

{"id": "2024_05_29_africa_south-africa-elections-polls-open-intl", "text": "Millions of South Africans are voting in what is expected to be the most pivotal general election since the end of apartheid. For months, polls have shown the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party could lose its majority for the first time since Nelson Mandela led it to power in 1994. While polling can be challenging in South Africa, most analysts believe that the ANC faces its stiffest challenge yet with a population deeply frustrated by the country\u2019s direction. If support for the ANC drops below 50% for the first time, the party will be forced to enter into a coalition government. ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Wednesday\u2019s vote \u201cone of the most important elections in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d while addressing a crowd of thousands at Soweto\u2019s FNB soccer stadium on Saturday. \u201cOur people will decide whether our country continues moving forward with the ANC towards a better, brighter future or backwards to a terrible past,\u201d Ramaphosa said. The South African leader, who cast his ballot at a polling station in Soweto, told reporters on Wednesday that he has \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that voters will again trust in the ANC. \u201cThis is the day when South Africa decides, decides on the future of our country, (on) who should lead the government of South Africa, and I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart of hearts that the people will once again invest confidence in the African National Congress to continue to lead this country,\u201d Ramaphosa\u00a0said. South Africa is the most unequal country in the world, according to the World Bank. Citizens are also contending with the highest sustained rate of unemployment in the world, rampant corruption, feeble economic growth, crippling power cuts and\u00a0rising violent crime. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the\u00a0failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Voters in Johannesburg told CNN they headed to vote shortly after polls opened at 7 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) on Wednesday, and many expressed their hopes that the country would move in a different direction. \u201cWe want to see the change,\u201d said Sydney Radebe. \u201cThis is a rich country but people don\u2019t have anything,\u201d the 66-year-old actor and filmmaker added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have land, we don\u2019t have property\u2026 you cannot own nothing and say you are \u2018free.\u2019\u201d Radebe was among the first early morning voters at one of the biggest polling stations in Johannesburg. On a crisp morning as the Southern Hemisphere heads into winter, the line of voters gradually began to grow inside Joubert Park. Events worker Newton Ugboh, 20, was voting for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m looking for change so I came early in the morning,\u201d he said. Ugboh said that some of his friends didn\u2019t want to vote as \u201cthey think things aren\u2019t going to change at all,\u201d but that there are \u201cbig issues\u201d facing young people in the country. The \u201cunemployment rate is crazy,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s a \u201cbig-time struggle to find work, most of my friends are unemployed.\u201d Healthcare worker Roselyne Tswakae, 46, said she\u2019s worried about the future of South Africa\u2019s youth and also believes \u201cit\u2019s time for change.\u201d \u201cYoung South Africans were promised that education would be the key to success, they went to university but they are unemployed and often end up getting involved in drugs, drinking, smoking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are hoping for the light,\u201d Tswakae added. Land surveyor David Ngobeni, 31, also said \u201cthere isn\u2019t much hope\u201d for young people in South Africa. He says unemployment, inflation, crime and corruption are the \u201cbig issues facing everyone right now.\u201d \u201cIf you have a job, you are very lucky,\u201d Ngobeni told CNN. He added that he hopes the outcome of this election will lead to inflation going down and boost the economy. At the very end of a long line in Joubert Park was 40-year-old Ncumisa Xabanisa. She said she has been voting for the same party since 1994 and is very loyal to the ANC. \u201cit\u2019s only one party for me, it\u2019s from home, it\u2019s from my grandmother, I grew up knowing them,\u201d Xabanisa told CNN. She said the major problem the country is facing is a lack of jobs. \u201cSome of us we went to school, we graduated but we have the certificates like it\u2019s a display. It\u2019s hurting.\u201d The mother-of-two added that she is educated but is currently sitting at home most of the time, and sells plastic food containers to make a living. There are 52 parties on this election\u2019s national ballot, including new parties formed by previous ANC members such as former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK). Zuma was forced to\u00a0resign as president in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court. The 82-year-old was barred from running for parliament last week after the country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled that five years must have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. However, his party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Capping off a heated few months of election campaigning, many of the largest parties held their final rallies this weekend, including the Democratic Alliance (DA), the official opposition party. \u201cOn Wednesday, the ANC will lose the outright majority it has abused for decades to subject the people of this country to unemployment, corruption and misrule\u2026 we close the ANC chapter of our history,\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen told supporters in the town of Benoni, east of Johannesburg. The DA has formed a coalition bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. This is the seventh general election South Africa has held since the end of white minority rule 30 years ago. A record 27.79 million people are registered to vote \u2013 the highest number to date, according to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC.) The country\u2019s electoral commission (IEC) said that, by 11 a.m. in South Africa, a \u201csignificant majority\u201d of voters had already cast their ballots, as lines to vote had formed before the polls opened. \u201cThis, we think, is testament to the enthusiasm of South Africans to record their political choice,\u201d the IEC\u2019s deputy CEO Masego Sheburi added during a briefing at the National Results Center. Sheburi said that some voting stations opened late, but by midday \u201cgood progress\u201d was made with \u201cminimal incidences\u201d across the country. One of the issues some polling stations faced was late delivery of ballot papers, mainly in the Johannesburg area, according to the IEC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/africa/south-africa-elections-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_style_lost-caravaggio-prado-madrid-scli-intl", "text": "A lost Caravaggio painting that was almost mistakenly sold at auction for a bargain price has gone on display at the Prado Museum in Madrid, Spain, after being rescued and restored. \u201cEcce Homo,\u201d which was painted by the Italian master around 1606-09, will feature in a special one-piece exhibition from Tuesday, according to a statement from the museum. The oil on canvas work depicts Jesus wearing a crown of thorns with blood running down his face and onto his chest. In front of him to the left is Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor in Judea, while a third figure stands behind Jesus holding a red robe over his shoulders. Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, better known simply as Caravaggio, is known for his visceral depictions of violence. Caravaggio painted \u201cEcce Homo\u201d toward the end of his life when he had fled Rome, accused of murder, and was living in exile in Naples, where his work underwent a marked shift in style, becoming darker and more somber. \u201cThe painting is one of around only 60 known works by Caravaggio in existence, and thus one of the most valuable old master artworks in the world,\u201d said the museum. Formerly part of King Philip IV\u2019s art collection, the painting was passed on to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, which then exchanged it for another artwork with a politician named Evaristo P\u00e9rez de Castro in 1823, according to the museum. It then remained in the same family, but its significance went unnoticed until it surfaced at auction house Ansorena in April 2021 with a starting price of 1,500 euros ($1,600), attributed to a pupil of Spanish painter Jos\u00e9 de Ribera. Experts from the Prado Museum highlighted the misattribution to Spain\u2019s Ministry of Culture, which placed an export ban on the work and declared it a national treasure, Jorge Coll, CEO of Colnaghi Gallery in Madrid, which has had the painting in its care since its real origin came to light, told CNN on Tuesday. Coll then coordinated the authentication of the work by leading experts, as well its restoration, before it was sold to the current owner. Coll told CNN that he cannot reveal the identity of the buyer or the purchase price for legal reasons. The painting represents \u201cone of the greatest discoveries in the history of art, inspiring an unprecedented speed of consensus around its authentication,\u201d said the museum. It has also been restored \u201cin an informed and rigorous manner,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cEcce Homo\u201d will be displayed at the Prado Museum until October 13. Both the previous owner and the buyer were keen for the painting to go on public display at the Prado, said Coll. \u201cIt means the world,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody has to go and see it.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/style/lost-caravaggio-prado-madrid-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) said on Wednesday during a press conference streamed on its official Youtube channel that its 28,000 members \u2014 just under a quarter of the company\u2019s total workforce in the country \u2014 would strike on June 7, following failed negotiations over pay and bonus arrangements. \u201cWe can no longer afford to see a company that has no will to negotiate,\u201d union representatives said, adding \u201cwe will fight for workers\u2019 rights and interests.\u201d Son Woomok, a union leader, told CNN that many NSEU members worked for Samsung\u2019s flagship semiconductor unit. \u201cWe are demanding transparent and fair performance bonuses and wage increases,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere has never been a proper wage negotiation. It has always been carried out by announcing the (outcome) at the labor-management council, which does not include our union, and the company telling us to accept it,\u201d he added. In a statement to CNN, a Samsung spokesperson said: \u201cThe company remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union, and is making every sincere effort to come to an agreement.\u201d The world\u2019s biggest memory chipmaker has had a rough few years. A historic shortage\u00a0of computer chips during the Covid pandemic was followed by falling demand last year as consumer appetite for electronics remained weak because of global economic uncertainty. In January, Samsung reported an operating profit of just 6.567 trillion won ($4.8 billion) for 2023, its weakest annual performance since 2009, according to the Wall Street Journal. Samsung also lost its crown as the top smartphone maker globally. But things are looking up for the company because of  the AI boom. It is optimistic about a resurgence in demand for mobile devices this year, particularly with the rollout of new products, such as AI-powered smartphones. Last month, Samsung reported a more than 10-fold rise in first-quarter operating profit amid forecasts of high demand for AI and high-end chips, an area in which it competes with Intel (INTC) and Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. The vast majority of the world\u2019s advanced microchips are made in just two places: Taiwan and South Korea.

{"id": "2024_05_28_style_wu-tang-clan-album-museum-australia-intl-hnk", "text": "\u201cOnce Upon a Time in Shaolin\u201d is as mysterious as its title. Recorded by legendary hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan in secret over six years, only one physical copy of the album was ever made and just a handful of people have heard it in full. Now a few lucky members of the public will be able to listen to it \u2013 if they can get to a museum next month on the Australian island of Tasmania. The rare piece of hip-hop history is set to go on display at the Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) from June 15 to 24, according to the museum. The album will be part of an exhibit that lasts a little over a week with a limited number of free tickets available for curated private listening sessions. It is part of the museum\u2019s \u201cNamedropping\u201d exhibition which explores the rare objects which \u201cpossesses mystical properties that transcend its material circumstances,\u201d said Jarrod Rawlins, director of curatorial affairs at Mona. \u201c\u2019Once Upon a Time in Shaolin\u2019 is more than just an album, so when I was thinking about status, and what a transcendent namedrop could be, I knew I had to get it into this exhibition,\u201d Rawlins said in a statement. The album itself is bound by a legal agreement which states it cannot be commercially exploited until 2103, although it can be played at private listening parties, according to the museum. Wu-Tang Clan first announced in March 2014 that it would produce one copy of \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Shaolin\u201d to be sold to the highest bidder. The album came in a hand-carved box with a leather-bound book of parchment paper containing lyrics and its backstory. By\u00a0releasing\u00a0only one copy of the album, the group wanted to \u201cput out a piece of art like nobody else has done in the history of [modern] music,\u201d Wu-Tang member Robert \u201cRZA\u201d Diggs\u00a0told Forbes in 2014. The album was also created in protest of the devaluation of music as an artform in the digital age, RZA said in the interview. Since then, the album has had a history almost as unusual as its release. In 2015, notorious \u201cPharma Bro\u201d Martin Shkreli bagged the album for about $2 million \u2013 making it the world\u2019s most expensive music album ever sold at the time. But US federal authorities seized it from Shkreli, who was eventually\u00a0convicted\u00a0 of securities fraud and conspiracy in 2017 for defrauding investors out of more than $10 million between 2009 and 2014. Before his conviction, which was related to his time as CEO of biotech company Retrophin, Shkreli was dubbed \u201cthe most hated man in America\u201d in 2015 while serving as CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals after he increased the price of a drug used by AIDS patients from $13.50 to $750 per pill. In 2021, the US Justice Department then sold the album without disclosing the buyer. At the time the DoJ said the money from the album\u2019s sale would go toward the remaining balance owed on the approximately $7.4 million forfeiture order entered against Shkreli at his March 2018 sentencing. Digital art collective PleasrDAO, who describe themselves as a \u201cdecentralized autonomous organization\u201d and an early adopter of NFT digital art, later confirmed in a\u00a0 video the same year that they\u00a0bought the album using cryptocurrency. While PleasrDAO did not disclose how much it spent to acquire the album, the The New York Times reported it exchanged hands for the equivalent of $4 million.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/style/wu-tang-clan-album-museum-australia-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-american-sentencing-tuesday", "text": "American Tyler Wenrich was sentenced to three weeks in jail and fined Tuesday after he pleaded guilty earlier this month to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. The Virginia resident was fined $9,000, Kimo Tynes, the director of communications for the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, said in a statement. Since he had already served three weeks in jail, the court recognized it as time served, so his prison sentence is complete, the release said. The 31-year-old American faced as much as a 12-year prison sentence. But the Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case and said, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Another American charged with possession of ammunition, Ryan Tyler Watson, pleaded guilty Tuesday, according to Tynes. Watson\u2019s sentencing is scheduled for June 21. Watson and Wenrich are among five Americans arrested in Turks and Caicos in recent months, all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. Bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden,\u201d according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from its government. In the Turks and Caicos, possession of firearms or ammunition carries a minimum 12-year sentence, though the law allows reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d  Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Misick said. Meanwhile, the United States has\u00a0more guns than people. On Friday, American Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty and received a 52-week sentence\u00a0suspended for one year\u00a0and a $6,700 fine, his representatives said. He returned to the United States after paying the fine. In addition to Hagerich and Wenrich, one other American \u2013 Michael Lee Evans \u2013 pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the territory\u2019s government. Evans was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, attorney Oliver Smith told CNN. The rest remain in Turks and Caicos. A fifth American, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, with the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. The mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms or ammunition is in place to protect those on the islands, and judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences, Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick said Thursday. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date.

{"id": "2024_05_29_europe_ukraine-war-us-tanks-intl", "text": "Ukrainian crews working on US-supplied Abrams tanks have told CNN of a series of the weaknesses and flaws\u00a0with the armored vehicles, calling into doubt their utility on\u00a0the war\u2019s\u00a0ever-changing frontlines.\u00a0The donation was announced by US President Joe Biden as evidence of the United States\u2019\u00a0\u201cenduring and unflagging commitment to Ukraine.\u201d CNN\u00a0journalists\u00a0were the first reporters to see the M1 Abrams in Ukraine, at a location in the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0east, where around six vehicles were visible, hiding in the foliage. Crews trained in Germany said the vehicles\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the US military\u2019s main $10\u00a0million\u00a0battle tank used in Iraq against Saddam\u00a0Hussein\u2019s\u00a0forces and insurgents \u2013 lacked armor that could stop modern weapons. \u201cIts armor is not sufficient for this moment,\u201d said one crew member, callsign Joker. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t protect the crew. For real, today this is the war of drones. So now, when the tank rolls out, they always try to hit\u00a0them.\u201d His colleague, Dnipro, added they are the \u201cnumber one target.\u201d \u201cWithout defense, the crew doesn\u2019t survive at the battlefield,\u201d\u00a0he said. The crew showed CNN their attempts to affix\u00a0active armor to one damaged tank.\u00a0They used\u00a0plates of plastic explosive that,\u00a0when hit by a round,\u00a0detonate and provide a protective counter-blast. All 31 Abrams deployed to Ukraine are engaged near the frontline in the east, according to officials in the 47th Mechanised Brigade, who took receipt of them all. The Ukrainian request for Abrams, complex and heavy tanks, sparked significant debate in early 2023, as the American vehicle has a complex supply chain.\u00a0Some versions even run\u00a0on jet fuel. Pentagon officials said in April that the Abrams were pulled back from the frontline due to the threat of Russian attack drones, although the 47th said some were still in action, despite the deficiencies that had\u00a0materialized. Much of the Ukrainian frontline is now dominated by the use of self-destructing attack drones, tiny and accurate devices that can swarm infantry and even cause significant damage to tanks. The advent of these so called First-Person Vision (FPV) drones, flown by soldiers wearing gaming goggles, has changed the nature of the war, limiting movement and introducing a new element of vulnerability to\u00a0armored\u00a0vehicles. This Ukrainian crew have learned of the Abrams\u2019 limitations the hard way, in pitched battles around the town of Avdiivka, which Russia finally took control of in February. A driver lost a leg when the\u00a0armor\u00a0was penetrated. Yet it is not just innovation that is hamstringing the tanks\u00a0\u2014\u00a0they appear to have technical issues too. One, parked under a tree, was almost immobile during CNN\u2019s visit, due to an engine problem, the crew say, despite the vehicle having just been shipped in from Poland. They also complain of how, in rain or fog, condensation can fry the electronics inside the vehicle. CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment. Ammunition is also a problem, like elsewhere on the Ukrainian frontline. They say they seem to have the wrong type for the fight they are in. \u201cWhat we have is more for direct tank-to-tank fights, which happens very rarely,\u201d Joker said. \u201cMuch more often we work as artillery. You need to take apart a tree-line or a building. We had a case when we fired 17 rounds into a house and it was still standing.\u201d The tank\u2019s poor performance has been mocked by Russian analysts, dubbing them \u201cempty tin cans.\u201d One model was captured by Russian forces and, damaged, paraded in Red Square. The Ukrainian crew expressed frustration the tanks were made for a NATO style of warfare, in which air power and artillery prepare the battlefield before tanks and infantry advance. Kyiv has long bemoaned its lack of artillery and air power. \u201cThey would never do it,\u201d Joker said, of NATO soldiers undertaking the same advances they make without air support. He switched to English to mimic a NATO soldier: \u201c\u2018Call the aviation, call the artillery,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no aviation and artillery. We have only tank. And it\u2019s the problem.\u201d A spokesperson for the Ukrainian defense ministry told CNN that \u201cUkraine is now testing and improving equipment that was not initially prepared for our war.\u201d \u201cWe are asking all countries to support us with equipment of any technical capacity levels. We use all of it accordingly,\u201d the spokesperson added. Biden\u2019s decision to supply the Abrams came after European allies pledged to send their own battle tanks in early 2023 ahead of Ukraine\u2019s failed summer counteroffensive last year, a step that had been deemed unthinkable months earlier. Kyiv\u2019s allies have slowly swallowed the red lines of what equipment they once refused to supply. F-16s may arrive in Ukraine in the months ahead. Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine\u2019s military commander, on Monday said he had signed initial paperwork to permit France to send military trainers into the country to try and reverse an\u00a0urgent manpower problem on the frontlines. France\u2019s\u00a0defense ministry\u00a0declined to\u00a0confirm the plan, but said it, and other ideas, had long been under discussion. The move would mark a significant escalation in the West\u2019s involvement in the war, now in its third year. The Ukrainian defense ministry later appeared to tamp down those expectations, saying in a statement to CNN that it had \u201cstarted internal paperwork to move forward when the decision is taken.\u201d For the Abrams crew, each delay in equipment or assistance costs the lives of friends. \u201cI only have one question,\u201d Joker said of US assistance. \u201cWhy is this taking so long and (comes) partially? We are losing time. It\u2019s death to us.\u201d Victoria Butenko contributed to this report.

The balloons so far contain \u201cfilth and garbage\u201d and are being analyzed by government agencies, said the JCS, adding that the military was cooperating with the United Nations Command. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s actions clearly violate international law and seriously threaten the safety of our citizens,\u201d it added. \u201cAll responsibility arising from the North Korean balloons lies entirely with North Korea, and we sternly warn North Korea to immediately stop its inhumane and low-level actions.\u201d Local governments also sent messages to residents in the northern Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces to warn of the \u201cunidentified objects,\u201d and advised against outdoor activities. The packages risk damaging residential areas, airports and highways, said the JCS. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s younger sister Kim Yo Jong \u2013 who is also a senior official in the reclusive regime \u2013 referred to the activities as \u201cfreedom of expression.\u201d In a statement published by state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Wednesday, Kim said that North Korea had dispersed toilet paper and other waste materials in bags attached to the\u00a0balloons along the Korean border and central areas. Kim compared North Korea\u2019s actions to South Korea\u2019s years-long practice of sending\u00a0balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets towards her nation. \u201cWe\u2019ve done some of the things they always do, but I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re making a big deal like they\u2019ve been hit by a shower of fire,\u201d Kim said. The move, according to North Korean state media KCNA, was to retaliate against South Korean activists who often send materials to the North \u2013 including propaganda leaflets, food, medicine, radios and USB sticks containing South Korean news and television dramas, all prohibited in the isolated totalitarian dictatorship. Campaigners in the South, including defectors from North Korea, have long sent these materials through balloons, drones, and bottles floating down the cross-border river \u2013 even after South Korea\u2019s parliament banned such actions in 2020. \u201cScattering leaflets by use of balloons is a dangerous provocation that can be utilized for a specific military purpose,\u201d said Kim Kang Il, North Korea\u2019s Vice Minister of National Defense, KCNA reported on Sunday. He accused South Korea of using \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d by scattering \u201cvarious dirty things\u201d near border areas, declaring that the North would take \u201ctit for tat action.\u201d \u201cMounds of wastepaper and filth will soon be scattered over the border areas and the interior of (South Korea) and it will directly experience how much effort is required to remove them,\u201d Kim said, according to KCNA. \u201cWhen our national sovereignty, security and interests are violated, we will take action immediately.\u201d Kim also decried joint US-South Korea military drills, which have increased in recent years as tensions have risen in the Korean peninsula. The 2020 law that prohibited sending leaflets also\u00a0restricted\u00a0loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts, which the South\u2019s military once championed as part of psychological warfare against the North until it withdrew the equipment following a 2018 summit between the two Koreas. But even after parliament passed the ban, activists told Reuters they planned to continue \u2013 including the defector Park Sang-hak, who had been sending materials back to his homeland for 15 years, vowing to continue in an effort to give North Koreans a rare glimpse of the outside world. Earlier this month, Park\u2019s organization Fighters for a Free North Korea said in a statement it had sent 20 balloons toward North Korea, containing 300,000 leaflets that condemned Kim Jong Un and 2,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and music videos. \u201cIn order to appeal and urge the North Korean people to rise up and put an end to Kim Jong Un \u2026 the group is sending the leaflets to the compatriots in North Korea,\u201d the organization said in a statement. For decades, North Korea has been almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group has released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers sentenced to hard labor for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including parts of its pop culture, to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years and diplomatic talks fell apart \u2013 prompting strict rules to snap back into place in the North.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_style_pompeii-children-drawings-scli-intl-scn", "text": "Children\u2019s sketches of violent scenes of gladiators and hunters battling animals have been uncovered at the archaeological park of Pompeii, the park\u2019s superintendent has said. The drawings, thought to be made by children between the ages of five and seven sometime before Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, were found on the walls of a back room in the \u201cIsland of chaste lovers\u201d residential sector of the archaeological park. They\u00a0show that even children in ancient times were exposed to extreme violence. \u201cIt does not seem to be a problem only of today, between video games and social media,\u201d Gabriel Zuchtriegel said\u00a0in a statement about\u00a0the latest discovery. \u201cThe difference is that in ancient times the bloodshed in the arena was real and that few saw it as a problem with all the possible repercussions on the psycho-mental development of Pompeian children.\u201d As of Tuesday, visitors to the park can see the drawings from suspended walkways above the excavation as archaeologists continue to work on the site. The drawings depict a fight scene with two gladiators, spears in hand, facing what is likely to have\u00a0been intended to be\u00a0wild boars. Nearby lies the head of a bird of prey archaeologists say could have been an eagle. The drawings also include a child\u2019s outlined hands made with charcoal and figures playing with a ball. There is also a boxing scene with both boxers appearing to be lying on the ground in a \u201cknock-out,\u201d according to the park\u2019s description of the discovery. An even older drawing on an adjacent wall was presumably made by an older child with the use of a red mineral pigment rather than charcoal, but it was partially covered in whitewash,\u00a0suggesting\u00a0the room was being repainted to cover up the childrens\u2019 drawings on the walls,\u00a0archaeologists said. The older painting, likely drawn by an older child according to researchers, depicts a more sophisticated marine scene with two ships surrounded by fantastical fish, one of which was caught on a hook. Children likely witnessed violence Pompeii park has started a collaboration with the\u00a0Department of\u00a0Child\u00a0Neuropsychiatry at Naples\u2019 Federico II University to study the children\u2019s art. So far, they have determined that the drawings likely came from \u201cdirect vision\u201d of an event rather than from pictorial models. \u201cProbably one or more of the children who played in this courtyard, among the kitchens, latrine and flowerbeds for growing vegetables, had witnessed fights in the amphitheater, thus coming into contact with an extreme form of spectacularized violence, which could also include executions of criminals and slaves,\u201d Zuchtriegel said. \u201cThe drawings show us the impact of this on the imagination of a young boy or girl, subject to the same developmental stages that are still found today.\u201d In addition to the drawings, archaeologists uncovered the petrified remains of a man and a woman who perished when the volcano erupted, capturing the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in a time capsule that was first discovered in the 16th century. The presumed couple were found in front of a home that was undergoing renovation, based on construction materials found on site. Archaeologists also discovered a painting of a small child wearing a hood that they say is \u201cwithout comparison\u201d in Pompeii, perhaps a homage to a deceased child, according to the park. The child was surrounded by bunches of grapes and pomegranates and a tiny dog and seemed to be looking out into the garden near where the other children\u2019s drawings were found. The ongoing excavations are part of an extensive plan to save the ancient site from collapse after years of neglect. Previous discoveries have included a\u00a0prison bakery\u00a0and a lavish dining room with\u00a0mythological figures\u00a0on the walls.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/style/pompeii-children-drawings-scli-intl-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_asia_thailand-indicts-thaksin-shinawatra-lese-majeste-intl-hnk", "text": "Thailand\u2019s former Prime Minister\u00a0Thaksin Shinawatra has been indicted on lese majeste charges, authorities said Wednesday, the latest\u00a0twist in a decades-long political saga in the Southeast Asian kingdom. The case, filed by police, alleged Thaksin violated Thailand\u2019s notoriously harsh royal insult law during an interview he gave in 2015 to the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo. \u201cThe attorney general has decided to indict Thaksin on all charges,\u201d spokesperson Prayuth Bejraguna,\u00a0told reporters Wednesday. Thaksin will need to appear before the Office of the Attorney General on June 18, after which he will be taken to court. He could not appear at Wednesday\u2019s hearing due to a Covid-19 infection, the spokesperson said. Thaksin has denied the charges, according to the spokesperson, and has repeatedly pledged loyalty to the monarchy. Thaksin, who served as prime minister from 2001 until he was ousted in a military coup in 2006, made a dramatic return to Thailand last August after 15 years in self-imposed exile and\u00a0was taken into custody. Some experts believe Thaksin may have struck a deal with the country\u2019s powerful conservative and royalist establishment for his return \u2013 given his court convictions and the charges against him. Thaksin has denied the claim. He was sentenced to eight years in prison for conflict of interest, abuse of power and corruption during his time in power, though his sentence was later reduced to one year. In February, the 74-year-old was released from detention after being granted parole, having served just six months in a police hospital. Thailand\u00a0has some of the world\u2019s strictest royal defamation laws, and\u00a0criticizing the king, queen, or heir apparent can lead to a maximum 15-year prison sentence for each offense. Sentences for those convicted under Section 112 of Thailand\u2019s Criminal Code,\u00a0or lese majeste law, can be decades long, and hundreds of people have been\u00a0prosecuted in recent years. Earlier this month, the death of a young Thai activist in pre-trial detention for lese majeste charges shocked many in the country and sparked renewed calls for justice reform. Thaksin, a former owner of Manchester City Football Club, is the head of a famed political dynasty that has dominated Thai politics for the past two decades, boasting two former prime ministers. Even today, Pheu Thai \u2014 the latest party of the powerful Shinawatra clan \u2014 is in government after entering into a ruling coalition with its former military rivals following the May 2023 election. Thaksin\u2019s daughter Paetongtarn is leader of the party. Return from exile Thaksin\u2019s return to Thailand reintroduced a towering and divisive figure to\u00a0Thailand\u00a0at a tense political time. Since his release from detention, Thaksin has traveled the country making a series of public appearances, including to his hometown of Chiang Mai where his support base is concentrated. Throughout his time in power, Thaksin was hugely popular with Thailand\u2019s rural and working class but his policies were loathed by rich elites and conservatives who accused him of being a dangerous and corrupt populist. During his physical absence from the country, he retained an outsized influence on Thai politics and has remained at the center of the country\u2019s tumultuous and often violent political landscape. Thaksin has denied that he remains behind the scenes pulling the strings and insisted he returned to Thailand because he wants to enjoy his retirement and spend time with his family. Some analysts suggest Thaksin sees himself as an \u201celder statesman\u201d figure and that his old adversaries in the establishment still consider him a threat. \u201cThe charge is politically driven, there\u2019s no other way to put it,\u201d said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University. \u201cThey see him as a threat. He didn\u2019t serve a day in jail which caused consternation because it was a double standard, and he wields influence over the Pheu Thai party in government.\u201d Thailand\u2019s Constitutional Court last week accepted a petition seeking to remove Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office over his appointment of a Cabinet member, a lawyer and close Thaksin aide who had served jail time. Pichit Chuenban was jailed for six months in 2008 for contempt of court after trying to bribe Supreme Court officials in a land case involving Thaksin. Thitinan said the two cases are connected, and the lese majeste charge was a \u201cway to keep Thaksin in line.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an indictment and a reminder to Thaksin of who has real power in Thailand,\u201d he said. Calls for reform For years,\u00a0human rights organizations\u00a0and free speech campaigners have said lese majeste has been used as a\u00a0political tool\u00a0to silence critics of the Thai government. And rights groups say the right to freedom of expression in Thailand has come under increased attack since nationwide 2020 youth-led protests that saw millions of young people take to the streets calling for constitutional and democratic reforms \u2013 for the first time, openly criticizing the monarchy and publicly questioning its power and wealth. Those protests came four years after King Maha Vajiralongkorn succeeded his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej who had reigned for seven decades. Despite the change from a military-backed government to civilian leadership last year, surveillance and intimidation against activists and students continues, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. The legal advocacy group said that since the start of those protests in July 2020 and up until March 2024, at least 1,954 people have been prosecuted or charged for their participation in political assemblies and for speaking out, with 286 of those cases involving children. A push to reform the lese majeste laws gained significant traction ahead of the 2023 general election, which saw the progressive Move Forward Party win the most votes. The party was ultimately blocked from forming a government over its reform agenda, and later the Constitutional Court ruled Move Forward violated the constitution through its campaign to amend the lese majeste law and ordered it to stop all related activities.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/asia/thailand-indicts-thaksin-shinawatra-lese-majeste-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_middleeast_israel-gaza-war-seven-months-end-year-intl", "text": "The war in Gaza will likely continue through at least the end of the year, an Israeli official warned Wednesday, seeming to dismiss the idea that fighting would end after the military offensive against Hamas in Rafah. Israel\u2019s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, said the year 2024 has been \u201cdefined as a year of combat\u201d by Israel\u2019s war cabinet. \u201cWe are now in the fifth month of 2024, which means we expect another seven months of fighting to deepen our achievements and achieve our goal of destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Islamic Jihad,\u201d Hanegbi said. The comments came as Israeli tanks \u2013 seen Tuesday in central Rafah for the first time since the operation began earlier this month \u2013 continued to probe the southern Gaza city on Wednesday, despite mounting global pressure to stop the offensive. The Israeli government had previously signaled that entering Rafah would be the final stage of its war against Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 people hostage. In response, Israel launched a devastating offensive in Gaza which has killed more than 36,000 people, according to Palestinian officials. Despite the prospect earlier this month of striking a ceasefire-for-hostages deal with Hamas, the more extreme wing of Israel\u2019s war cabinet had urged that the Rafah offensive go ahead, arguing that destroying the group was more urgent and of greater importance than returning the hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza. But Hanegbi\u2019s comments suggest that the Rafah operation may not mark the end of hostilities, raising questions about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plans to wind down Israel\u2019s campaign and his plans for the post-war governance of Gaza. While Netanyahu has portrayed Rafah as Hamas\u2019 \u201clast bastion\u201d his forces have been operating in northern areas the military previously said it dismantled the militants\u2019 command structure. In a radio interview on the Israeli station Reshet Bet, Hanegbi said \u201cit was honestly stated in the first days of presenting the plans to the cabinet that the war would be long.\u201d \u201cYou need to have patience and know how to stand strong. This resilience is what has allowed this nation to survive for 75 years, and even for 3,000 years before that. Just don\u2019t use a stopwatch on ourselves or set ultimatums,\u201d he said. Israel is pressing ahead with its military offensive in the face of growing global outrage, after an Israeli airstrike on Sunday killed at least 45 people and injured 200 others in Rafah at a camp for displaced people, which Israel had designated as a safe zone. Video from the Tal al-Sultan camp showed scenes of horror: charred bodies being pulled from the rubble, a man holding the headless body of a child, fire raging from tents in the background. A CNN analysis of video from the scene suggests that munitions made in the United States were used in the strike. But US President Joe Biden is not altering his policy towards Israel, suggesting the strike on Rafah had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support, despite him telling CNN earlier this month he would not allow certain US weapons to be used in a major offensive in Rafah. The strike came days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its offensive in Rafah, or any actions \u201cwhich may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d The ICJ said the humanitarian situation in Rafah can now be described as \u201cdisastrous\u201d and could worsen still if Israel\u2019s operation in the city continues.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-seven-months-end-year-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

Extreme temperatures throughout Asia over the past month were made worse most likely as a result of\u00a0human-driven climate change, a team of international scientists have said. In Mohenjo Daro, a town in Sindh known for archaeological sites that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization built in 2500 BC, temperatures rose as high as 52.2 C (126 F) over the last 24 hours, a senior official of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Shahid Abbas told Reuters. The reading is the highest of the summer so far, and approached the town\u2019s and country\u2019s record highs of 53.5 C (128.3 F) and 54 C (129.2 F) respectively.

{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_china_hong-kong-security-arrests-hnk-intl", "text": "Hong Kong police have made their first arrests under a newly passed local national security law over social media posts deemed \u201cseditious\u201d by authorities, just days ahead of the 35th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. The city\u2019s national security police on Tuesday arrested six people on suspicion of committing acts with seditious intent, according to a police statement. Security chief\u00a0Chris Tang confirmed one of those arrested was Chow Hang-tung, a leading organizer of the huge Tiananmen vigils that used to be held in Hong Kong but are now effectively outlawed. Chow is already in custody on charges related to her democracy activism. In their statement, police accused an unnamed woman in custody and five others of taking advantage of \u201can approaching sensitive date\u201d to anonymously publish seditious posts on social media since April. The goal, police alleged, was to \u201cincite citizens\u2019 hatred of the central authorities, the city government and the judiciary, and to incite netizens to organize or participate in illegal activities later on.\u201d The statement did not state the upcoming sensitive date. However next Tuesday marks the anniversary of Beijing\u2019s June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, an event that has been scrubbed from the record by Chinese authorities and can no longer be safely commemorated in Hong Kong. Chow, a lawyer and one of the city\u2019s most prominent pro-democracy activists, was previously twice jailed for holding unauthorized vigils to commemorate Beijing\u2019s bloody military crackdown. She is currently in custody on a national security charge. Tang was asked by reporters if the authorities were referring to the June 4 commemoration in the statement announcing the latest arrests. \u201cThe date itself is not important,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe most important thing is that people who want to endanger national security use these topics to incite citizens\u2019 hatred against the Central government, our government and our judiciary.\u201d Those arrested were five women and a man, aged between 37 and 65, police said, adding they could face up to 7 years in prison if convicted. Police raided the homes of five of the suspects and seized items including electronic devices that officers suspect were used to publish the \u201cseditious messages,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cThose who intend to endanger national security should not have the delusion that they can avoid police investigation by going anonymous online,\u201d the statement added. The arrests marked the first time Hong Kong\u2019s own national security law\u00a0had been invoked since it was unanimously passed by the city\u2019s opposition-free legislature in March. Locally known as Article 23, the\u00a0law\u00a0was rushed through at the request of city leader John Lee\u00a0and debated over just 11 days. The legislation introduces 39 new national security crimes, adding to an already powerful national security law that was directly imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong in 2020 after huge and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests the year before. That law has already transformed\u00a0Hong Kong with authorities jailing dozens of political opponents, forcing civil society groups and outspoken media outlets to disband and transforming the once freewheeling city into one that prioritizes patriotism. The local national security legislation covers a raft of new crimes including treason, espionage, external interference and unlawful handling of state secrets, with the most serious offenses punishable by up to life imprisonment. Lee, Hong Kong\u2019s leader, described it as a \u201chistoric moment for Hong Kong,\u201d but critics and analysts warned it would align the financial hub\u2019s national security laws more closely with those used on the Chinese mainland and deepen\u00a0an ongoing crackdown on dissent. For decades, Hong Kong had been the only place on Chinese soil where mass commemorations were held on every June 4 to commemorate the pro-democracy protesters killed by Chinese troops in 1989. The vigils were held by the now-disbanded organization Hong Kong Alliance, of which Chow was a leading figure within. But the candlelight vigils had been all but banned since 2020, as authorities sought to snuff out all public commemorations of the crackdown, which remains the biggest political taboo in mainland China. In 2020 and 2021, Hong Kong authorities banned the event on\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0restrictions grounds, but small crowds continued to show up and light candles. Chow was sentenced to 15 months in prison in 2022 for her part in organizing an unauthorized vigil to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre the year before. At the time, she was already serving a 12-month sentence for her role in organizing the 2020 Tiananmen vigil. In a separate case, Chow was charged in 2021 with inciting subversion of state power over her role in Hong Kong Alliance.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/china/hong-kong-security-arrests-hnk-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_americas_mexico-female-president-violence-miltiarization-intl-latam", "text": "Claudia Sheinbaum was campaigning for president in southern Mexico when hooded men approached her car, filming\u00a0the interaction\u00a0as they implored her to keep their town from being taken over by gangs. One man said he felt helpless, and that the government had \u201cnever done anything for these lands.\u201d They lived in Chiapas, Mexico\u2019s poorest state and an\u00a0increasingly\u00a0important territory for criminal organizations moving illegal drugs, firearms and migrants from\u00a0neighboring Guatemala.\u00a0Sheinbaum thanked the men, shaking one of their hands before her car pulled away. The former Mexico City mayor\u00a0is the frontrunner in a landmark election\u00a0this weekend\u00a0where Mexico is all but certain to emerge with its first female president \u2013 a remarkable achievement in a country known for its patriarchal culture and high rates of gender-based violence, where\u00a0around 10 women\u00a0are murdered every day. Sheinbaum is riding on a wave of popularity\u00a0with the support\u00a0of her long-time ally, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and their leftist Morena party. Trailing her in the polls is former senator Xochitl G\u00e1lvez, from the conservative PAN party, who is representing a coalition of\u00a0opposition parties. But what should have been celebrated as a ground-breaking election\u00a0has become overshadowed by the bloodiest election campaign\u00a0in Mexico\u2019s history,\u00a0and ongoing high levels of violence across the country. At least\u00a034 political candidates or applicants have been murdered\u00a0since\u00a0June 2023\u00a0as gangs try and influence those coming into power, according to a report by research group Laboratorio Electoral, which also found hundreds of attacks on candidates and people related to the current electoral process. And while\u00a0the murder rate has fallen in Mexico\u00a0between 2019 and 2022, in absolute numbers the country is still reeling from historically high levels of homicides of around 30,000 people\u00a0murdered\u00a0each year, say experts. The central challenge for the next president will be\u00a0convincing voters that she can end the near-certain impunity in Mexico;\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved\u00a0in the country in\u00a02022, according to think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua. \u201cMexico is a country where more than nine out of 10 crimes committed against the population go unpunished,\u201d Stephanie Brewer, Mexico Director at the Washington Office for Latin America (WOLA), told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a country with low levels of reporting of crimes due largely to distrust in authorities, lack of faith in investigations, which can be very well founded.\u201d \u2018Paradoxical\u2019 Mexico is a world leader when it comes to gender equality in elected office, which was cemented in 2019 constitution\u00a0reform.\u00a0It\u00a0outflanks\u00a0several countries in\u00a0terms of women\u2019s\u00a0parliamentary representation. Yet Mexico remains a dangerous place to be a woman, with\u00a0sky-high femicide\u00a0rates for\u00a0the region.\u00a0The most\u00a0recent data\u00a0from Mexico\u2019s\u00a0National Institute of Statistics and Geography found that at least 11,852 femicides were recorded in the first three years of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s presidency \u2013 higher than the 7,439 reported during the same period of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s presidency (2012-2018). With security topping voter concerns, both Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez have largely remained coy about their proposals. Neither\u00a0has\u00a0repudiated a nearly two-decades-long approach of relying on the armed forces to tackle organized crime \u2013 which\u00a0has coincided with\u00a0historically high levels of homicides. Sheinbaum, a former climate scientist, has pledged to continue with her predecessor\u2019s policies. She has pointed to her record as Mexico City mayor, with her team indicating having improved conditions for police and better intelligence gathering about criminal networks. Galvez has been critical of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s non-confrontational approach to cartels. She has suggested\u00a0pulling forces back from\u00a0domestic security\u00a0roles, increasing the number of police in violent areas, and building a new high\u00a0security prison. \u201cIn 2018, millions of Mexicans voted for change with hope, but the truth is that it did not happen,\u201d\u00a0G\u00e1lvez\u00a0said during a presidential debate in April, taking aim at the incumbent\u2019s approach to tackling organized crime. \u201cClaudia Sheinbaum is offering to continue the hugs for criminals \u2026 I am offering to build a Mexico where we can end violence, but above all, to bet on health and education.\u201d Both have spoken of the need to strengthen police and civilian institutions, and better use intelligence and coordination. \u201cBut the extent to which either one of them really means to emphasize or follow through on that is very unclear,\u201d Brewer said. Experts have been underwhelmed by the lack of new approaches to the security situation, saying there is a connection between militarization and more bloodshed in the country since its inception\u00a0in\u00a02006,\u00a0when former President Felipe Calder\u00f3n declared an all-out-war against criminal groups. \u201cMexico cannot deploy its way out of problems like impunity or corruption in institutions or lack of effective criminal investigation,\u201d\u00a0Brewer\u00a0told CNN. \u201cMilitarization simply is not a tool that could ever do that.\u201d \u2018Hugs, not bullets\u2019 Incumbent L\u00f3pez Obrador won the presidency in 2018 on a platform of demilitarizing the country\u2019s war against drug cartels,\u00a0vowing\u00a0to restore peace with \u201chugs, not bullets.\u201d Popular social welfare programs would address the root causes of economic insecurity, instead of violent confrontations with criminal groups,\u00a0he promised. It was a strategy that saw the son of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d\u00a0Guzman released\u00a0on the orders of L\u00f3pez Obrador in 2019\u00a0to avoid bloodshed.\u00a0He was later re-arrested and extradited to the US. However,\u00a0he never really de-militarized public security.\u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador instead merged several law-enforcement agencies, such as the federal police, to create the\u00a0National Guard\u00a0that was,\u00a0in principle, to be under civilian command. But\u00a0he soon after\u00a0placed\u00a0the\u00a0body under the Secretary of Defense, sparking criticism across the political spectrum,\u00a0which said\u00a0it was furthering\u00a0militarization\u00a0in Mexico. The Supreme Court upheld an opposition complaint and ordered L\u00f3pez Obrador to return the National Guard to civilian jurisdiction. He said he would follow suit, but the National Guard still reports to the Secretary of Defense. This creation was part of what\u00a0Brewer described as a \u201cpopulist\u2026and highly visible measure that\u201d\u00a0intended to give\u00a0the perception that something is being done about crime. The National Guard has gone on to take\u00a0over several civilian\u00a0functions including building infrastructure projects and airport management \u00ad\u2013 a situation ripe for corruption, warn Mexico watchers. Meanwhile,\u00a0criminal groups have only expanded\u00a0their reach. A May report by the Crisis Group documented limited crime-fighting where there were large military deployments in areas most affected by warring cartels. Instead, the report found that \u201ca set of largely unspoken rules has been established, encouraging illegal groups to reduce and conceal the violence they perpetrate,\u201d the report wrote. \u201cIn exchange, authorities have turned a blind eye to a degree of illegality, enabling these organisations to diversify their trafficking operations (including into newer illicit drugs such as fentanyl), expand their extortion rackets, branch out into legal business, and assume greater control of communities and local governments.\u201d This may have distorted official statistics around homicides, Falko Ernst, a senior analyst on Mexico at the Crisis Group who led the report, told CNN. \u201cBut what we have seen in a number of high conflict states is that while official murders have dropped, disappearances have gone up, even the official ones, so that puts another question mark behind the drop in homicides,\u201d he said. The report found there was also political pressure to reduce the recorded rate of lethal violence has led to \u201cmurders being logged under other causes of death or going unrecorded.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Mexican Secretary of Defence for comment. There is a through line between militarization and gender-based violence in Mexico, say experts. Feminist groups in the country began documenting a \u201cdramatic increase in women being killed by firearms\u201d after 2007 as well as women being targeted in the public sphere,\u201d said\u00a0Gema Kloppe-Santamar\u00eda, assistant professor of Latin American History at George Washington University. Female homicides often fail to get prosecuted, with 88.6% impunity rate for femicide cases, according to Mexico Evalua. Both candidates have recognized the crisis of femicide, but Sheinbaum, who holds a sizeable polling lead against Galvaz, has a tense relationship with some feminists \u201cwho encountered lots of repression by Mexico City police under the purview of Sheinbaum,\u201d said Kloppe-Santamar\u00eda. Sheinbaum has touted her efforts for women and girls, saying there was \u201czero impunity\u201d to femicides in Mexico City during her time as leader, and that there was a large reduction in femicides under her watch. Though the claims have\u00a0not\u00a0borne out\u00a0after some scrutiny, say critics. Amid ongoing \u201cgender-based violence, including femicides and disappearances,\u201d Kloppe-Santamar\u00eda said, getting a female president at this moment feels\u00a0\u201cvery paradoxical.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/americas/mexico-female-president-violence-miltiarization-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

Among the earliest works is a 1955 Richard Avedon: the wildly fantastical \u201cDovima with Elephants\u201d, part of a fashion shoot that first appeared in Harper\u2019s Bazaar magazine and epitomizes his approach to photography as\u00a0\u201ca vacation from life.\u201d\u00a0The most contemporary piece on display, meanwhile, is from 2022; by 29-year-old American photographer Tyler Mitchell (best known for his\u00a0Vogue\u00a0cover of Beyonc\u00e9) and titled \u201cSimply Fragile\u201d, the delicate\u00a0depiction of a boy with a beetle on his nose is part of what\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0has referred to as a \u201cBlack utopic vision\u201d. The show, however, is not chronological; instead it\u2019s grouped into \u201cchapters,\u201d from \u201cFashion\u201d and \u201cStars of Stage Screen and Studio\u201d to\u00a0\u201cReportage\u201d and\u00a0\u201cDesire.\u201d The themes arose from how John and\u00a0Furnish\u00a0live with the prints, rotated\u00a0in salon-style displays across their homes \u2014 from London to Los Angeles.\u00a0\u201cTheir LA house has these wonderful (William) Egglestons \u2014 all early dyed transfer prints, very rare, very sought after \u2014 on the wall of the dining room,\u201d said Newell Harbin,\u00a0director of The Sir\u00a0Elton\u00a0John and David Furnish Photography Collection, and a co-curator of \u201cFragile Beauty\u201d.\u00a0\u201cThen you go into their Atlanta home and it has so many wonderful (Peter) Hujars.\u201d A collection that \u2018speaks to\u2019 Elton John \u201cWe really began to construct this exhibition while sitting at\u00a0Elton\u00a0and David\u2019s kitchen table,\u201d confirmed\u00a0Forbes.\u00a0\u201cThis is a very personal collection. Some collections are built by art advisers; this is not a collection built by an art adviser. This is a collection passionately constructed by the two men that are in it.\u201d Working closely with John and Furnish since 2010, Harbin helps to build and shape the collection in a process of constant dialogue. Each piece \u201chas to speak to them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not just after a big name or somebody who is making a splash right now in the art scene. It\u2019s a rather organic process,\u201d she said, highlighting a recent sale of some of their pieces at Christie\u2019s and added; \u201cWe\u2019re still bringing in new works all the time.\u201d The latest addition is Avedon\u2019s famous 1981 portrait of Ronald Fisher\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a beekeeper shown with the insects crawling over his naked chest \u2014 featured in the \u201cFragile Beauty\u201d show. For Newell, one of the most powerful works in the exhibition is the last self-portrait of Robert Mapplethorpe. \u201cIt tells a very sad story about an artist that we lost way too soon to Aids,\u201d she said of the stark image of the American photographer holding a skull-topped walking cane, his gaze intense and direct.\u00a0Known for his portraits, sensual depictions of flowers (one of which graces the cover of the \u201cFragile Beauty\u201d catalogue) and portrayals of New York\u2019s\u00a0BDSM\u00a0gay\u00a0bars, Mapplethorpe\u00a0died in 1989 at the age of 42.\u00a0Newell added: \u201cIt\u2019s a great reminder of how their collection crosses over into their lives and all of the work they\u2019ve done with the\u00a0Elton\u00a0John Aids Foundation.\u201d Across the exhibition, the display calls attention to both\u00a0gay liberation \u2014 an image from Sunil Gupta\u2019s series \u201cChristopher Street\u201d, for instance, captures gay visibility in 1970s New York \u2014 and queer artists, from American artist George Platt Lynes in the 1940s to contemporary South African artist Zanele Muholi, whose self-portraits emphasize Black queer visibility. The room titled \u201cDesire\u201d is a joyful celebration of the male form, which encompasses Mel Roberts\u2019 1970s shots for beefcake magazine \u201cThe Young Physique\u201d; Gilbert & George\u2019s \u201cNaked Body\u201d (1991); Ryan McGinley\u2019s raw and intimate \u201cHaving Sex\u201d; and a trio of Don Herron\u2019s \u201cTub Shots\u201d, capturing pioneering queer artists Keith Haring, Robert Mapplethorpe and Peter Hujar while bathing. Photography as a visual journal One section, too, is titled \u201cFragile Beauty\u201d, featuring work by Mapplethorpe, Hujar and McGinley. Among the work of documentary photographer Mary Ellen Mark, a portrait of a 14-year-old Seattle prostitute known as \u201cTiny\u201d is particularly affecting, while the space\u00a0centers on an encompassing floor-to-ceiling installation of Goldin\u2019s\u00a0149-photo series \u201cThanksgiving.\u201d Taken between\u00a01973 and 1999, the images are a visual journal of the\u00a0downtown New York art world\u00a0and its debauchery, capturing Goldin\u2019s own\u00a0bruised and beaten face, the result of an abusive relationship, and\u00a0the harrowing effects of drug addiction and Aids among her friends. John\u2019s own struggles with addiction have no-doubt informed his selection; it\u00a0was after leaving rehab in 1990 that he began to collect photography. \u201cHe has told the story numerous times of seeing a print for the first time with fresh, sober eyes, and how impactful it was for him,\u201d says Harbin, referring to a meeting with\u00a0photography dealer David Fahey over lunch at a south-of-France chateau. \u201cI had just seen a collector in London so happened to have all these photographs with me,\u201d recalled Fahey over Zoom. \u201cIt was suggested that I bring them out to show everyone\u2026 It was a fragile, delicate time for\u00a0Elton\u00a0and he responded emotionally to the pictures he was looking at,\u201d\u00a0of how John became enamored with the work of 20th-century fashion photographers such as Irving Penn, Herb Ritts and Horst P. Horst. \u201cHe selected about 10 pictures\u00a0and then walked over and gave half of them to our host. It was a demonstration of his gift-giving abilities, and his need to share photographs with people.\u201d In an inscription to Fahey\u00a0in the catalogue to John\u2019s 2000 Atlanta exhibition, the singer notes the importance of their initial encounter; \u201cotherwise my ignorance about photography and all its beauty would probably still be inside of me. Instead, my eyes have been opened to the most visual stirring world,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s an obsessive collector,\u201d added Fahey, noting John\u2019s dramatic shift in focus from \u201cstriking, beautiful objects\u201d into \u201chardcore documentary and photojournalism\u201d. At the V&A, the\u00a0\u201cReportage\u201d section is startling. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0grounded in photography from the American civil rights movement,\u201d explained Forbes, who highlighted a piece by New York-based, African American artist\u00a0Roy DeCarava\u00a0as \u201cone of the most beautiful photographs I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. His work has hardly ever been shown in Britain.\u201d Other images are instantly recognizable, such as\u00a0Associated Press photographer Julio Cortez\u2019s\u00a0viral image\u00a0of a protester in Minneapolis in May 2020, following the murder of George Floyd. The scope is at times overwhelming, but as Hunt concludes: \u201cThere is a richness and drama and beauty and tragedy in this exhibition, the emotional intensity of which I have rarely witnessed in a photography show.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/style/fragile-beauty-elton-john-photography/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_05_28_weather_texas-southern-plains-storm-forecast-tuesday", "text": "At least one person has been killed and more than 600,000 customers in Texas remained without power Tuesday night as powerful storms delivered another round of violent weather to a state still reeling from an almost unrelenting parade of destructive and deadly storms in recent weeks. Storms unloaded hurricane-force wind gusts across the Dallas area Tuesday and later tore through Houston in the afternoon, where the city\u2019s George Bush Intercontinental Airport recorded a wind gust of 75 mph. Roughly 40 miles northwest of Houston, one person died after a house under construction collapsed in a subdivision in Magnolia, the city\u2019s fire officials said. The victim \u2013 described as a \u201cjuvenile male\u201d by the Magnolia Fire Department \u2013 was removed from a debris pile by firefighters and pronounced dead. Magnolia Fire Department Division Chief Jason Herrman confirmed to CNN the home\u2019s collapse was related to a Tuesday thunderstorm with \u201csignificant winds.\u201d Videos captured across Houston and Dallas communities revealed scenes of disaster and flooding Tuesday. Footage from north Dallas obtained by CNN showed multiple cars stranded in a flooded roadway, surrounded by frequent lightning as the rain continued. In other communities, powerful winds ripped out trees and forced them onto homes and knocked down neighborhood fences, leaving communities in disarray. The power outages started to ramp up early Tuesday morning in the Dallas area, then extended south with the storms as they roared across the state, according to PowerOutage.us. Hundreds of thousands of outages were in Dallas County, where officials issued a disaster declaration and warned outages could last for days. READ: White House announcing action to modernize electric grid and pave the way for fewer outages These storms have arrived even as some residents are still mourning at least seven people killed in the state during\u00a0violent storms over Memorial Day weekend. In total, at least two dozen people, including four children, were killed across six states as storms hit the central US over the holiday period, and several communities are grappling with significant losses of homes and businesses. Sunday was the busiest severe weather day of the year so far, with more than 600 reports of strong winds or hail across more than 20 states, including gusts over 75 mph and hail the size of softballs. Twenty-six tornado reports also were made in 10 states. Storms turned homes and businesses into piles of rubble, flung cars and brought down power lines. Parts of Texas and extreme western Louisiana faced Tuesday\u2019s most serious threat of severe weather. Large hail, lightning and wind gusts as strong as 80 mph were the main threats with any storm. A few tornadoes were also possible, according to the National Weather Service. The weather also spelled misery for hundreds of travelers. More than 600 flights flying in and out of the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and the Dallas Love Field Airport have been canceled \u2013 and more than 900 flights in and out of the two airports have been delayed, according to FlightAware data. More than 75 flights in and out of Houston\u2019s William P. Hobby Airport and George Bush Intercontinental Airport have been canceled, while more than 530 have been delayed. Power outages could last days in Dallas It could take days to fully restore power in the Dallas-Fort Worth area after violent storms unleashed hurricane-force wind gusts Tuesday morning. Dallas is the second major Texas city to have critical power infrastructure damaged by severe weather in less than two weeks. \u201cThis, unfortunately, will be a multi-day power outage situation, similar to the one that (occurred) in Harris County and Houston,\u201d Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins cautioned during a news conference Tuesday. A derecho and tornado in mid-May blasted 100 mph wind gusts through the Houston metro, killing multiple people and knocking out power for days. The full extent of damage to power infrastructure in the Dallas area is still being assessed, but the current prognosis is concerning, according to Grant Cruise, a spokesperson for Oncor \u2014 the state\u2019s largest utility company. \u201cWe did have a significant number of downed lines because of this weather event,\u201d Cruise said during Tuesday\u2019s news conference. \u201cIn many cases it\u2019s not going to be simple repairs, we\u2019re looking at complete reconstruction for parts of our area.\u201d The storm damage prompted Jenkins to issue a disaster declaration for Dallas County. The outages come as some Texans head to the polls Tuesday for primary runoff elections. More than a third of Dallas County\u2019s polling places were without power Tuesday afternoon, according to Jenkins. Summerlike heat will ease in Texas this week, but those left without power or a reliable way to cool down could still face the risk of dangerous heat stroke or heat exhaustion.

{"id": "2024_05_28_style_italy-stolen-artifacts-returned-intl-scli", "text": "It looked more like a museum exhibition of Italian art than a crime scene, but in the Central Institute for Restoration\u2019s offices, located inside a former women\u2019s prison in central Rome, some 600 works of art were put on display Tuesday morning. Ranging\u00a0from life-sized bronze statues to tiny Roman coins,\u00a0from\u00a0oil paintings to mosaic flooring, the pieces span the 9th century BC to the 2nd century AD\u00a0and amount\u00a0to just one year\u2019s stolen and trafficked art confiscated by Manhattan prosecutor Col. Matthew Bogdanos\u2019 team and returned to Italy. The trafficked works, pillaged from the Italian regions of Lazio, Campania, Puglia, Calabria and Sicily, were sequestered in New York and New Jersey\ufeff\u00a0last year. The returned works, together with 60 items repatriated\u00a0last year, are worth more than $80 million (or roughly \u20ac73.6 million) \u2014 but are just a drop in the bucket when it comes to artwork still hidden away in private warehouses and on display in museums in the United States, Bogdanos told CNN on the sidelines of\u00a0a\u00a0presentation\u00a0to the media on Tuesday. Bogdanos said the $80 million of items does not include a further 100 items his team has just seized in the US. What makes the seizure and return of stolen artifacts so difficult is that authorities often have no idea what they are looking for, according to Gen. D. Francesco Gargaro, commander of the Carabinieri for the Protection of Cultural Heritage. \u201cWhen artifacts are taken from clandestine graves, they have never been\u00a0cataloged,\u201d he said. That means that, in addition to the items themselves, their historical context was stolen, robbing archaeologists of valuable\u00a0information. (Instead,\u00a0investigators work backwards, assessing paperwork and provenance claims for artifacts provided by their owners, as well as undertaking technical tests to best confirm a piece\u2019s true origins.) Most of the recent items returned to Italy were dug out of clandestine excavations or stolen from churches, museums and private individuals,\u00a0Gargaro\u00a0said. Among the items on display\u00a0\ufeffon Tuesday\u00a0was a cuirass and two bronze heads dating back to the 4th-3rd century BC\u00a0that were\u00a0confiscated from\u00a0a\u00a0gallery owner in New York. There was also\u00a0an Umbrian bronze statue depicting a warrior stolen from an Italian museum in 1962\u00a0that was\u00a0found in a well-known American museum. And a mosaic floor depicting the myth of Orpheus enchanting wild animals with the sound of the lyre from the mid-3rd to mid-4th century AD\u00a0was recovered after being\u00a0stolen from a clandestine excavation in Sicily in the early 1990s.\u00a0It was\u00a0confiscated from the private collection of a well-known New York collector. Italy\u2019s Carabinieri Cultural Heritage Protection unit uses artificial intelligence to search for stolen cultural assets under a new program called \u201cStolen Works Of Art Detection System\u201d (SWOADS), which searches for\u00a0\ufefftaken items\u00a0by scanning the web and social media for images. \u201cThe return to Italy of cultural assets of such importance, both for their numerical consistency and for their historical-artistic value, is another significant achievement, Italy\u2019s culture ministry undersecretary Gianmarco Mazzi said Tuesday. \u201cIn addition to being works of art of inestimable value, they represent the high expression of our history, our culture and our national identity.\u201d In 2023 alone, 105,474 pieces of art worth more than \u20ac264 million\u00a0(or $287 million)\u00a0were found and confiscated worldwide thanks to the artificial intelligence project, according to\u00a0Gargaro.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/style/italy-stolen-artifacts-returned-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}

Destructive thunderstorms and tornadoes were responsible for at least 23 deaths over the long weekend, including four children, in parts of Kentucky, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma and Alabama. The storms killed 15 in Arkansas and Texas alone. Another five people died in Kentucky. LIVE UPDATES: At least 23 killed in tornado-spawning storms sweeping central US Sunday was the busiest severe weather day of the year so far, with more than 600 reports of storm damage across at least 20 states, including tornadoes, wind gusts in excess of 75 mph and hail the size of softballs. Storms turned buildings into piles of rubble, damaged cars and brought down power lines. More than 450,000 homes and businesses in the central, southern and eastern US still were without power in the wake of weekend storms Monday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us. Harsh storms pummeled parts of Kentucky Sunday night and inflicted damage on some communities, prompting Gov. Andy Beshear to issue a state of emergency early Monday. Phone lines in the Bowling Green area were knocked out, leading police to set up alternate emergency numbers for those who needed help. The National Weather Service office in Paducah, Kentucky, is sending out at least two storm survey teams Monday to assess damage, the office said.

A tornado of at least EF3 strength \u2013 meaning it was capable of gusts between 136 mph and 165 mph \u2013 struck Claremore, Oklahoma, on Saturday night, the National Weather Service said. Twenty-three people were injured there, officials said. The twister also tore through Will Rogers Downs, a horse-racing facility outside Claremore, injuring several horses and requiring three to be euthanized, according to Joe Lucas, a spokesperson for the state\u2019s Thoroughbred Racing Association. Two people were killed as a result of storms in the nearby city of Pryor, officials said. Severe thunderstorm threat shifts to East More than 70 million people from the South to the Northeast are under a level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms Monday. Severe thunderstorms will rumble to life through Monday evening in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, including a vast section of the I-95 corridor. Storms in the regions could unload damaging wind gusts, hail and tornadoes. Tornadoes are possible in any severe storms that develop in the East Monday, but areas from eastern North Carolina to eastern Pennsylvania and western New Jersey are at a slightly increased risk. Richmond, Virginia, DC, Baltimore and Philadelphia are just a few cities that could contend with tornadoes. Storms will also unload drenching rainfall which could lead to flooding, especially in low-lying or urban areas. A level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall is in place for parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland. Severe thunderstorms in the East will come to an end Monday night after tracking offshore and out into the Atlantic Ocean. Isolated severe thunderstorms could bubble up later Monday afternoon and evening in parts of the southern Plains. A level 2 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place in north-central Texas and includes the Dallas-Fort Worth metro. Large hail and damaging wind gusts are the main threats with any storms in the area, but a tornado is also possible. High temperatures scorch parts of the South High temperatures and an early season heat wave are making for a sweltering Memorial Day holiday across parts of southern Texas, the central Gulf Coast and southern Florida. Excessive heat warnings are in effect through Monday evening for parts of Texas while heat advisories stretch from Texas to Mississippi. Houston; New Orleans; Miami; Mobile, Alabama; Tampa, Florida; and Charleston, South Carolina, are some areas experiencing extreme warmth Monday. Air temperatures in some locations were rising to near-record highs mid-afternoon Monday, with heat index readings exceeding 110 degrees from Texas to southern Louisiana. The heat index \u2013 a measure of how the body actually feels when it\u2019s hot out \u2013 was between 110 and 115 degrees in parts of the Houston metro Monday afternoon. It broke into the low 120s near Texas\u2019 border with Mexico. The heat index soared to at least 108 degrees in New Orleans and flirted with the triple-digit mark in Mobile, Alabama. Nightfall may not bring relief in some areas. Overnight low temperature are expected to be 10 to 15 degrees above normal and could be record-warm in dozens of locations. Such extreme, prolonged heat raises the risk of heat illness such as heat stroke, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, adults with underlying health conditions, pregnant women and outdoor workers. The risks of excessive heat \u2013 the most deadly form of extreme weather \u2013 are becoming more widespread as human-driven climate change drives warming global temperatures. During the warm season last year, heat-related illnesses accounted for a 20% larger share of emergency department visits than they did in the five previous seasons.

Conille was chosen by consensus after the council conducted hearings of candidates, Leblanc Fils said. Conille briefly served as prime minister from 2011 to 2012 during the presidency of Michel Martelly. He is currently the UNICEF Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean. His appointment is a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti\u2019s government, following the ouster of former Prime Minister Ariel Henry earlier this year. The new prime minister and the nine-member council must also select a cabinet and eventually lead Haiti to new elections. Since February, attacks by an insurgent alliance of gangs in the capital Port-au-Prince mean the city\u2019s international airport and seaport have ceased to function, breaking vital supply lines of food and aid and triggering an exodus of evacuation flights for foreign nationals. The violence erupted while Henry was in Kenya to secure its commitment to a multinational security mission meant to bolster Haiti\u2019s national police. But the then-leader was unable to return to the country amid the bloodshed, and ultimately announced his resignation in March. The resignation pitched the country\u2019s political establishment into weeks of negotiations as they sought to muster a transitional government. The inauguration of the CARICOM-backed presidential council in April has since allowed Haiti to resume planning for the much-delayed foreign mission. That foreign mission, led by Kenya, is now expected to arrive sometime in June. While some commercial flights to Port-au-Prince have tentatively restarted, the city remains\u00a0largely cut off\u00a0from the outside world. Across the nation, nearly 5 million people in Haiti are suffering from acute food insecurity \u2013 defined as when a person\u2019s inability to consume adequate food poses immediate danger to their life or livelihood. This is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/americas/garry-conille-haiti-council-picks-prime-minister-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/30/2024", "section": "world"}}
