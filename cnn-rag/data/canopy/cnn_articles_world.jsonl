{"id": "2024_06_20_asia_putin-ukraine-north-korea-south-korea-intl-hnk", "text": "Vladimir Putin has threatened to arm North Korea if Western countries continue providing military aid to Ukraine, as the Russia president\u2019s new defense pact with Pyongyang sparked a series of diplomatic reverberations in the region. Putin\u2019s remarks, at the end of a state visit to Vietnam, capped off a week in which Moscow sought to rattle the West and project strength from a part of the world in which his influence still carries weight. \u201cThose who supply these weapons believe that they are not at war with us. I said, including in Pyongyang, that we then reserve the right to supply weapons to other regions of the world,\u201d Putin told reporters Thursday at the end of his trip to Hanoi, in response to a question on whether the supply of Western long-range weapons could be considered an act of aggression. \u201cWhere they will go next?\u201d he said, suggesting those countries could then sell the weapons to Western adversaries. The US called Putin\u2019s remarks \u201cincredibly concerning\u201d in a briefing on Friday. \u201cIt would destabilize the Korean Peninsula,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters, and \u201cdepending on the type of weapons they provide, might violate UN Security Council resolutions that Russia itself has supported.\u201d Russia and North Korea\u2019s signing of a mutual defense pact this week sent ripples out across the region, with South Korea summoning Moscow\u2019s envoy on Friday, and Japan and the United States voicing serious concern. The defense pact, which comes against the backdrop of Putin\u2019s grinding war against Ukraine, is the most significant agreement signed by Russia and North Korea in decades and is seen as something of a revival of their 1961 Cold War-era mutual defense pledge. The deal was inked on Wednesday during Putin\u2019s trip to Pyongyang, where he received a lavish welcome from fellow autocrat Kim Jong Un, North Korea\u2019s leader. It consolidates the Kim regime\u2019s powerful link with a world power that wields a veto on the UN Security Council and means Russia now has a defense pact with South Korea\u2019s biggest enemy. South Korea, a US ally, condemned the treaty and summoned Russia\u2019s ambassador on Friday, a rare diplomatic step that illustrates the soured tensions between Seoul and Moscow. First Vice Minister Kim Hong-kyun relayed the South Korean government\u2019s \u201cstern position\u201d on Kim and Putin\u2019s defense pact, urging Moscow to \u201cimmediately halt military cooperation\u201d with Pyongyang and abide by UN Security Council resolutions, the Foreign Ministry said. Kim told the Russian ambassador that \u201cany cooperation that could directly or indirectly help reinforce the North Korean military power is a violation of the UN Security Council resolution,\u201d adding that Russia, a permanent member of the UNSC, should \u201cact responsibly,\u201d according to the ministry. An official of the US military, which maintains almost 30,000 troops in South Korea, told CNN the closer Russia-North Korea ties were troubling. \u201cThese developments should concern any country that cares about maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,\u00a0abiding by UN Security Council resolutions, and\u00a0supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia\u2019s brutal invasion,\u201d the military official said. New threats Putin flew to Vietnam on Thursday where he renewed threats towards both Western powers and their partners in Asia. Speaking to Russian journalists at the end of the visit he\u00a0accused\u00a0NATO\u00a0of \u201ccreating a threat\u201d for Russia in Asia. \u201cAnd we see what\u2019s happening in Asia, right? The bloc system is being cobbled together in Asia.\u00a0NATO\u00a0is already moving there as a permanent place of residence. This, of course, creates a threat for all countries in the region, including the Russian Federation. We are obliged to respond to this and will do so,\u201d\u00a0Putin\u00a0said. Putin warned South\u00a0Korea\u00a0on Thursday it would be making \u201ca very big mistake\u201d if it decided to supply arms to Ukraine, claiming Seoul has \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d concerning the new strategic partnership signed by Russia and North\u00a0Korea. \u201cAs far as I know, the Republic of Korea does not plan aggression against the DPRK, which means there is no need to be afraid of our cooperation in this area,\u201d he said. But at the same time, senior Russian government officials were warning that Moscow planned to send weapons to North Korea. \u201cI wonder what the people of this country (South Korea) will say when they see the latest Russian weapons from their closest neighbors \u2013 our partners from the DPRK?\u201d senior Russian official\u00a0Dmitry Medvedev said in a post on Telegram. US and South Korean forces hold regular exercises and training in and around the Korean Peninsula, and the two allies have been working more closely with Japan, including recent exercises involving forces from all three countries. National Security Director Chang Ho-jin said South Korea would review the issue of arms provision to Ukraine, but he also noted that Seoul was willing to wait for the Russian government\u2019s explanation of the results of the meeting between Putin and Kim Jong Un. Currently, South Korea\u2019s policy is not to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine. When later asked about those comments, Putin said: \u201cAs for the supply of lethal weapons to the combat zone in Ukraine, this would be a very big mistake. I hope that this will not happen. If this happens, then we will also make appropriate decisions, which are unlikely to please the current leadership of South Korea.\u201d Reports from earlier in the war say South Korea may have provided 155mm artillery shells to the United States to replace 155mm rounds sent to Ukraine. A recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said South Korea\u2019s stockpile of 105mm howitzer rounds could give Ukraine an important battlefield boost if it were released to Kyiv. \u201cPublic reports\u00a0suggest\u00a0South Korea has around 3.4 million 105mm artillery shells,\u201d the CSIS report said. Ukraine has about 100 105mm artillery pieces, the report said. \u201cDuring the Vietnam War, these lighter howitzers proved indispensable in firebases, given their high mobility by road and air. Their light weight and mobility would allow Ukrainian artillery units to relocate quickly after firing, a crucial tactic for survivability on the modern battlefield. These howitzers would also allow Ukrainian battlefield commanders to conduct attacks on rough terrain against high-value targets,\u201d the CSIS report said Earlier on Thursday, Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi also expressed strong concern about the agreement signed by\u00a0Russia and North Korea. The fact that Putin \u201cdid not rule out military-technical cooperation with North Korea, which could be a direct violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, is a point of serious concern from the perspective of its possible impact on the security environment surrounding our country,\u201d Hayashi\u00a0said in a press conference.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/asia/putin-ukraine-north-korea-south-korea-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_middleeast_marjayoun-lebanon-israel-border-war-fears-intl-hnk", "text": "In the town of Marjayoun in southern Lebanon, around five miles north of the Israeli border, the main square seems almost abandoned. A few men play billiards in a storefront nestled in a building crowned with life-sized statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint Charbel, a revered Lebanese saint. They don\u2019t want to talk about the wars and rumors of war that for decades have plagued this predominantly Christian town near the border. Journalists are a bother, one grumbles, and goes back to the game. On the other side of the square, a woman in her thirties comes out of a grocery store with a small bag. \u201cMarjayoun is very nice, it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d the woman, Claude, tells me. \u201cBut the shelling scares us.\u201d That\u2019s all she wants to say. Throughout the day, occasional thuds of incoming and outgoing fire echo through the streets. Tensions between Israel and Lebanon have risen sharply since the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing military campaign by Israel in Gaza. The Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah has been firing missiles, mortars and drones into Israel, and Israel has returned that fire. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the mountainous border have fled as concerns intensify about the possible outbreak of another full-fledged war. On the Lebanese side, residents of Shia-majority towns like Kafr Kila, Adaisa, Aita\u00a0Al-Shaab and Aitaroun have almost all left. Frequent Israeli airstrikes and artillery barrages have reduced many of these communities to rubble. Marjayoun, in comparison, has been mostly spared. The town was the headquarters of the Israeli-armed and funded South Lebanese Army (SLA), a Christian-led proxy militia, during Israel\u2019s decades-long occupation of southern Lebanon, which ended 24 years ago after a protracted guerilla war with Hezbollah. When Israel pulled out in 2000,\u00a0many of Marjayoun\u2019s inhabitants fled south across the border to Israel, fearful of being accused by fellow Lebanese citizens of being collaborators with Israel. Their departure, along with Lebanon\u2019s collapsed economy, fear of yet another prolonged conflict, the absence of a functioning state and emigration have sapped Marjayoun of people and prosperity. Yet, more than two decades later, some residents still cling to their ancient town and vow not to leave. \u201cI feel this area has a geographical curse. There has always been tension,\u201d Edouard Achy told me. \u201cThe threats are coming from both sides of the border. Tensions are increasing day by day. Everything points to something about to happen.\u201d Is he going to leave, I ask. He shrugs. \u201cAfter more than eight months of this situation, people just want calm and quiet,\u201d he says. His sister, Amal, and her family have come to church to say a special prayer to mark 40 days since her mother died. Dressed in black with a crucifix around her neck, she brought large loaves of bread and bags of buns to share with the congregation. Amal exudes a strong connection with her hometown, but wonders how much longer it will be safe as the clouds of war gather overhead. \u201cWe\u2019re staying put, and God willing, we\u2019ll continue to stay,\u201d she insisted. \u201cThe south is the Holy Land. The Messiah tread here two thousand years ago.\u201d She paused and sighed. \u201cBut if things escalate to war and it reaches here like it did before, with some shelling, of course, like others, we\u2019ll have to leave,\u201d she said. \u2018In war, everyone loses\u2019 Half an hour away, in the mostly Druze town of Hasbaya, 85-year-old Abu Nabil sweeps the street outside his shop. The Druze faith is an offshoot of Islam, with adherents found in Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Jordan. A pious man with a gentle smile and a bushy white moustache, he looks on the bright side of life. \u201cThe Lord is merciful to us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can sleep in our homes. We eat. We drink. No one goes hungry.\u201d Since his birth, Abu Nabil saw Lebanon gain its independence from France in 1943, prosper during the 1960s, become engulfed by civil war, invaded and partially occupied by Israel for decades, and partially occupied by Syria, also for decades. He has seen the country emerge from civil war, embroiled in war again with Israel in 2006, wracked by a string of high-profile assassinations, convulsed by a short-lived revolution in 2019, followed by economic collapse, and now once again, on the brink of full-scale war with Israel. \u201cWar is ruinous,\u201d he says, grasping my hand. \u201cIn war, everyone loses, even the winner.\u201d Across the street, young men drink coffee from small paper cups while smoking cigarettes. They don\u2019t want trouble, they say, declining to be interviewed. The worry here, and in many parts of Lebanon, is that if you speak out against Hezbollah, there could be a price to pay. Some people do, some politicians do, but when Hezbollah lives nearby, it\u2019s best not to take the risk. \u201cGaza is not my war, and I don\u2019t want to pray in Jerusalem,\u201d one of the men insisted. Another said one of reasons not one Israeli missile, bomb or artillery round has landed in Hasbaya is because young men act as a sort of armed community watch, making sure no one, neither Hezbollah nor Hamas, fires anything at Israel. It\u2019s not their turf and they\u2019re not welcome here, they say. Down the hill, there\u2019s a traffic jam on the road leading out of Hasbaya west towards Marjayoun. Cars crawl at a snail\u2019s pace, drivers sticking their heads out to see what it\u2019s all about. A large group of men, women and children stand around a new white stone building, all dressed in their best. Parked in front is a shining white convertible, the bonnet covered with bouquets of flowers and a license plate reads, in English, \u201cNewly Married.\u201d A group of men arrives in traditional Druze clothing\u2014with small turbans, vests and low-crotched trousers\u2014carrying drums and horns. As people leave the building, musicians strike up a raucous tune with a heavy beat and high notes, while others twirl prayer beads over their heads. The bride, Fatin, in a long lacy dress, and the groom, Taymour, emerge into the sunlight, and everyone cheers. I decide not to interfere with annoying questions about Israel, Hezbollah, impending war, death, destruction and displacement. Everyone is happy, enjoying the bright June afternoon, the noise, the presence of friends and relatives. \u201cWhy spoil such a beautiful day?\u201d I think. Looking at the festivities, you\u2019d never guess that Israeli forces are only about five miles away and that, not far from here, deadly projectiles are being hurtled back and forth across the border. The irony, however, was not lost on one man, who leaned over with a chuckle, \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating here while war is around the corner.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/middleeast/marjayoun-lebanon-israel-border-war-fears-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_style_vivien-maier-street-photography-new-york", "text": "For much of her life, Vivian Maier was something of a mystery. Her photographic talent went largely unrecognized because she kept her work a secret from most of the people who knew her, including the New York and Chicago families she worked for as a live-in nanny and caregiver. Maier only printed a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of images of bustling city life she snapped with her Rolleiflex and Leica cameras over some five decades, and showed them to almost no one, instead amassing boxes and boxes of negatives and unprocessed film. Her fame came about posthumously, and only because the contents of her Chicago storge lockers were sold off at auction in 2007, after she had stopped paying the rent. \u201cVivian Maier the mystery, the discovery, and the work \u2014 those three parts together are difficult to separate,\u201d said Anne Morin, curator of the touring exhibition \u201cVivian Maier: Unseen Work,\u201d which opened 31 May at Fotografiska New York, the American outpost of the Swedish contemporary photography museum. The show, which runs through 29 September, does not attempt to unravel the puzzle of Maier\u2019s life, however, instead focusing on the work itself, with more than 200 photographs on display, including about 50 vintage prints made by Maier. Morin places her work on the same level as that of renowned street photographers like Robert Frank and Diane Arbus, and worthy of a place in the history of photography. \u201cNobody doubts that,\u201d Morin told CNN. \u201cThe work is strong and Maier had a marvelous eye. And in 10 years, we could do another completely different show \u2014 she has more than enough material to bring to the table.\u201d The exhibition is also a homecoming of sorts for Maier, who was born in New York to a family of French and German immigrants. She started capturing street scenes in the city as a young woman in the 1950s, first borrowing her mother\u2019s Kodak Brownie box camera and then buying her own professional-grade Rollieflex, which she taught herself to use. Her confidence and skill in finding the right moment to snap the shutter is evident even in these early works, in which Maier zeroed in on the unique characters and situations that make up city life: Men snoring open-mouthed on park benches; a balloon from the Central Park Zoo floating to hide a doting father\u2019s face as his baby reaches towards him. But while Maier was known to use commercial studios in New York to have her film processed, she never seems to have made a serious effort to exhibit or sell her work. Maier\u2019s return to New York as a popular icon is \u201ca big thing not only for women, but also for all the artists who are working and are never recognized and never have the opportunity to be seen, to be shared, to exist,\u201d Morin said. \u201cIt is never late to repair history.\u201d New York is \u201cin many ways, the heart of photography history in America,\u201d said Sophie Wright, the museum\u2019s director. \u201cSo it\u2019s amazing now to be in a position to be bringing Vivian back to that world. She\u2019s a rediscovered, important voice of 20th-century photography.\u201d Wright added that Maier\u2019s photographs were taken with \u201cso much thought and care and lack of self-consciousness \u2014 there\u2019s no audience in mind. In a way, it\u2019s pure, artistic expression for her.\u201d Maier\u2019s name and work first captured the public imagination in 2009, the same year she died in Chicago, after the collector and amateur historian John Maloof shared scans of her work on the photo-sharing website Flickr. He was seeking advice on what to do with the thousands of negatives, prints and undeveloped rolls of film he had acquired over the past two years, after stumbling across Maier\u2019s work at the auctions of her storage lockers. Photographers and critics immediately remarked on Maier\u2019s well balanced compositions, and her incisive and often humorous view of the people and places she came across, not just in New York, but also Chicago, where she moved in 1956 and spent most of her adult life, as well as the far flung locations she visited on vacations, from California to Europe and Asia. In 2011, Maloof published a book, \u201cVivian Maier: Street Photographer,\u201d and with the filmmaker Charlie Siskel co-directed the 2013 documentary \u201cFinding Vivian Maier,\u201d which was nominated for an Academy Award. A number of other gallery shows and biographies have also debuted in the years since\u2014 as well as a legal tussle over Maier\u2019s estate, which is now overseen by Chicago\u2019s Cook County Probate Court, and with which Maloof has signed an agreement to display and sell her work. (While Maier did not have any children of her own to inherit her estate, 10 potential heirs in Europe have been found among her extended family, and the court is looking into whether her brother Carl, who died in a psychiatric hospital in 1977, might have had any children.) The public\u2019s appetite for Maier hasn\u2019t diminished, however. When the current exhibition was on display at the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg in Paris in 2021, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 213,000 people attended over its four-month run. The opening preview in New York on 30 May had over 600 visitors. Despite her immense popularity, some museums have been slow to accept her work, even those that have major photography collections. Wright attributes this caution over Maier\u2019s work to the fact that she did not make many prints herself. \u201cThere\u2019s a reticence to be seen to be driving a narrative for the work that\u2019s not the artist\u2019s,\u201d\u00a0she explained, as well as a nervousness around the politics of her situation as a woman who was vulnerable in her later years. (At the end of her life, as her hoarding led to her losing caretaking jobs, Maier was believed to have been facing homelessness, until two of her former charges, Lane and Matthew Gensburg, paid for an apartment for her to live in, and later a nursing home.) Maloof and the photography dealer Howard Greenberg, who represents his extensive collection, acknowledge the concerns around posthumous printing of Maier\u2019s work, and during a talk at the exhibition opening, said that led to their decision to only create uncropped, direct reproductions from her negatives. In the show, there are many instances where these later prints are displayed next to the ones Maier made herself, showing how she chose to focus on certain elements in a scene. Maier\u2019s presence can also be felt in the exhibition through audio recordings she made\u00a0 interviewing the children she cared for to encourage their critical thinking, which were also found in her storage lockers. They are played throughout the galleries. But the most persistent reminders of the artist behind these works are the numerous self-portraits she took, often as reflections in mirrored and glass surfaces, or simply as her shadow cast on the ground or a wall. \u201cThe beating heart of the work is the self-representation,\u201d Morin said, and it is these works she sees resonating the most with today\u2019s audiences. \u201cEverybody says, \u2018Oh, my God, Vivian was the godmother of the selfie.\u2019 But it\u2019s different,\u201d the curator continued. Maier\u2019s self-portraits are a stubborn insistence in declaring her independence and identity, at a time when women, and especially domestic workers like her, were ignored and marginalized. \u201cShe wanted to record that,\u201d Morin said, imagining Maier as saying: \u201cI\u2019m here at this moment. No one will erase my face. I exist and I have the proof.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/style/vivien-maier-street-photography-new-york/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

If, however, we absolutely must, the way to make that experience the best it can possibly be is to fly with Qatar Airways. At least that\u2019s the verdict from this year\u2019s Skytrax Awards, which were announced Monday. For the eighth time in the 25-year history of the prestigious awards \u2013 known as the Oscars of commercial aviation \u2013 Qatar was named the World\u2019s Best Airline, in recognition of the quality of service it offers passengers on its modern fleet. \u201cThis is a remarkable achievement for Qatar Airways to win this World\u2019s Best Airline title for 2024, the eighth time they have triumphed,\u201d Skytrax CEO Edward Plaisted said in a statement to mark the award ceremony, which gathered airline execs and cabin crew in a manor house near London\u2019s Heathrow Airport. \u201cWe congratulate Qatar Airways on this success which should be a source of great pride and satisfaction for the airline management and staff.\u201d The Middle Eastern carrier has built a strong reputation over the past decade, helping Qatar\u2019s award-winning Hamad International Airport establish itself as a global aviation hub to challenge regional rivals Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Qatar\u2019s fleet of 230 airplanes ranges from its 10 much-loved A380 superjumbos, to Boeing 777-300ERs, Boeing 787-8s and 787-9s, Airbus A350-900s and A350-1000s, plus a range of smaller capacity jets. \u201cThis is a proud Qatar Airways moment and it is my honor to share this award with my hard working colleagues,\u201d the airline\u2019s CEO Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said in a statement released by Skytrax. \u201cThis award is testimony to our relentless dedication to providing unparalleled service and innovation. We look forward to more wins in the future.\u201d Close-run contest Qatar\u2019s victory meant second place for last year\u2019s winner, Singapore Airlines, but only just. UK-based Skytrax said the votes, gathered from surveys of more than 21 million customers from 100 countries about 350 airlines, were the closest run since the awards began in 1999, requiring a recount. The rest of the top 10 was, once again, devoid of North American airlines, with Dubai\u2019s Emirates airline in third, Japan\u2019s ANA All Nippon Airways in fourth, Hong Kong\u2019s Cathay Pacific in fifth, Japan Airlines in sixth, Turkish Airlines is seventh, Taiwan\u2019s EVA Air in eighth, Air France in ninth and Swiss International Airlines in 10th. There were plenty of consolation prizes. Five-time winner Singapore picked up the prize for World\u2019s Best Cabin Staff \u2013 an achievement senior VP, Tan Pee Teck, put down to the \u201cunwavering dedication and professionalism\u201d of its in-air teams. Singapore also won for Best First Class service and Best Airline in Asia. ANA, meanwhile, picked up the accolade for World\u2019s Best Airport Services, as well as Best Airline Staff Service in Asia. Saudia was named World\u2019s Most Improved Airline, beating Taiwan\u2019s Starlux and Iceland\u2019s Play into second and third places. At the budget end of flying, AirAsia was once again crowned the World\u2019s Best Low-Cost Airline \u2013 repeating an achievement it has made every year since 2010. Singapore\u2019s Scoot was named the World\u2019s Best Long Haul-Low Cost Airline. AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes said his airline\u2019s unwavering success was thanks to the work of its \u201cAllstars\u201d cabin crew coupled with strong brand loyalty. \u201cNo other companies come to my mind in achieving such a winning streak, and we are very proud of it,\u201d he said in a statement.\u00a0 We dedicate this award to all of our Allstars who work tirelessly to make today happen, and also to everyone who has remained loyal to us through the ups and downs AirAsia has experienced.\u201d Still in Asia, Bangkok Airways picked up the World\u2019s Best Regional Airline prize for the eighth consecutive year, while Vistara was named best India/South Asian carrier and Fiji Airways was Best Airline in the Australia/Pacific region. Ethiopian Airlines was named Africa\u2019s best, for the sixth year in a row. Turkish Airlines was Europe\u2019s best, airBaltic was Eastern Europe\u2019s winner and Hainan Airlines was best in China. Delta Air Lines was declared the Best Airline in North America, also picking up the award for Best Airline Staff Service for the region. The post-Covid world of heightened germ awareness, the top 10 of the World\u2019s Cleanest Airlines were mostly based in Asia.

{"id": "2024_06_21_style_amiri-menswear-paris-fashion-week", "text": "Few cities have been so adamantly idealized, mythologized and captured on film and in photographs as Los Angeles and Paris. Inside the majestic\u00a0botanical garden\u00a0of \u201cJardin des Plantes\u201d\u00a0at the heart of Paris earlier this week, Mike Amiri, founder of\u00a0the\u00a0eponymous Californian label, brought these two worlds together in a cinematic show that brought Hollywood to the legendary \u201cRive Gauche\u201d of the\u00a0River\u00a0Seine. Accompanied by the tunes of\u00a0south London musician Yussef Dayes,\u00a0what emerged was\u00a0a collection about \u201cModern jazz, meaning both the music and and attitude\u201d\u00a0according to the show notes. Among influences,\u00a0the designer references Miles Davis\u00a0(who himself\u00a0had a special relationship with the City of Lights), as well as Duke Ellington and his Big Band\u00a0and\u00a0Dizzy Gillespie, all\u00a0of whom\u00a0fascinated him both for their stage presence and their off-stage life. These inspirations translated into\u00a0pieces in\u00a0faded, sun-washed teal, blue, gray and vintage-inspired knits. Formal tuxedos with d\u00e9grad\u00e9 beadings were fused with slouchier lines and flared pants as a nod to skate culture,\u00a0or\u00a0elevated with crystal-pinstripes. Like a golden thread running through the collection, models wore drum bags featuring a guitar pick as a lock, or music notes as brooches holding together a silk foulard. Interested both in craft and attitude,\u00a0Amiri, 47, sought\u00a0to be \u201coptimistic, not loud,\u201d as he put it\u00a0during a meeting a few days before the show. In the midst of model castings and fittings, he was calm and elegant, multi-tasking as his son Ryan, 13, came to join him in putting\u00a0the\u00a0final touches to the collection in a\u00a0temporary\u00a0studio set up near Paris\u2019s Avenue Montaigne. Amiri\u2019s two other children and wife were also in the city and present at the show. Since its launch in 2014, Amiri has looked to musicians as well as Americana\u00a0for a transcontinental discussion\u00a0of\u00a0luxury\u00a0\u2014\u00a0mixing thrifting with subcultures\u00a0such as\u00a0rock\u2019n\u2019roll, garage and skate. Having grown up in Hollywood to \u00e9migr\u00e9 Iranian parents, two blocks away from Hollywood Boulevard, Amiri was also deeply impacted by the stark cultural differences between LA neighborhoods such as Silver Lake, Venice Beach and the styles\u00a0that came with\u00a0that. Today, the designer has made a name for himself for the quality of his garments\u00a0and\u00a0his fluid, creative approach\u00a0that\u00a0walks a line between elegance and hype. The people he dresses all \u201cwant to have personality, but they don\u2019t want to look like they\u2019re faking young, it\u2019s a fine balance between looking modern and faking youth\u201d he said. Despite the recent announcement of South Korean musician Kim Sunwoo of K-pop band \u201cThe Boyz\u201d becoming a brand ambassador, many of Amiri\u2019s stars find\u00a0their\u00a0way to the independent\u00a0label organically, rather than by way of paid endorsements, the brand said. Perhaps because the world of celebrity is one Amiri is comfortable in, having been to\u00a0school with Angelina Jolie and Lenny Kravitz\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who he recently dressed (alongside\u00a0a diverse roster of celebrities such as like Ryan Gosling, Omar Sy, Lena Waithe and Barry Keoghan).\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s important not to chase everything, let it be organic,\u201d he said at the studio while examining final runway looks.\u00a0\u201cThe right people find you.\u201d In an age of hyper-visibility,\u00a0Amiri\u00a0appears\u00a0to be rethinking luxury\u00a0\u2014 or\u00a0\u201cmaking ordinary things extraordinary\u201d as he put it. This includes focusing on detail so fine it might not appear on camera, such as couture-level craftsmanship infused with DIY\u00a0techniques, twisting and reworking denim, leather and seemingly mundane textiles. To James Sleaford, editor-in-chief of men\u2019s fashion magazine ICON France, Amiri has fine-tuned chic, offering a fusion of American cool and technical know-how: \u201cPeople recognize a lot of what he does, the ripped jeans, but what you see when you look at the shows is pretty different, he is very cultured, and very into his tailoring\u201d he said. \u201cHe has brought\u00a0a real element of luxury to\u00a0American cool.\u201d Today, with a flagship boutique on Rodeo\u00a0Drive, the \u201cAmiri Prize,\u201d an award to \u201cencourage, nurture and showcase up-and-coming talent,\u201d a second retail space in Dubai and a pop-up store in Saint Tropez,\u00a0Amiri is\u00a0pursuing a worldwide dialogue.\u00a0\u201cIn a world where everything is shared and visible, there is definitely a blending of cultures\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not through geography, but the things people gravitate towards,\u201d he said. \u201cIf\u2026\u00a0people connect to your story, your aesthetic, maybe it\u2019s something about them they find in there,\u201d he continued.\u00a0\u201cSomething they want to bring out in themselves.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/style/amiri-menswear-paris-fashion-week/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_weather_heat-wave-new-york-i-95-corridor-new-mexico-wildfires", "text": "Extreme summer weather continues to impact much of the US on Friday and into the weekend with a dangerous heat wave ratcheting up in New York and the I-95 corridor, deadly and destructive wildfires still burning in New Mexico and potential tropical threats. Here\u2019s the latest: \u2022 Heat escalates this weekend: More than 100 million Americans, including those in the  highly populated I-95 corridor, are under heat alerts through the weekend. A heat emergency was in effect for Washington, DC, where upper 90s and even triple-digit temperatures for the first time since 2016 will be possible. \u2022 Search for \u201cmore loss of life\u201d in New Mexico fires:\u00a0In New Mexico, authorities reported\u00a0that at least two people\u00a0died, 1,400 structures were destroyed and and more than 8,000 residents were evacuated as a result of\u00a0wildfires. The mayor of hard-hit Ruidoso, New Mexico, said they were preparing for more fatalities in the fires and bringing in dogs to help the search for \u201cmore loss of life.\u201d The South Fork and Salt fires have together burned an estimated 24,000 acres and were still 0% contained as of Friday. Evacuations are still in effect for Village of Ruidoso and City of Ruidoso Downs residents and additional evacuation orders have been issued in at least seven more areas. \u2022 Flood threat in fire zone: A flash flood warning was issued for Ruidoso and other New Mexico areas burned by the South Fork Fire after 0.5 inches of rain fell in the morning. More rain was expected into the late afternoon hours. Rain earlier in the week created a flash flood emergency with water rescues as a torrent of mud and water rushed from burned areas. Ground charred by fire, also known as a burn scar, loses its ability to effectively absorb water and more easily floods. \u2022 Tropical threats brewing: The National Hurricane Center\u00a0is monitoring two areas with a medium chance of tropical development in the next 48 hours. One could become a tropical depression off the North Florida and Georgia coasts Friday. The other could take a nearly identical track to Tropical Storm Alberto. \u2022 FBI investigating origins of New Mexico fires: FBI special agents have joined the investigation into the cause of wildfires in New Mexico, the agency said Thursday. \u201cI can confirm that the FBI is assisting our local, state, federal and tribal partners in the ongoing investigation of the fires in Ruidoso NM,\u201d said a spokesperson with the bureau\u2019s Albuquerque field office. President Joe Biden is \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d wildfires in New Mexico, the White House said Thursday. The administration has also approved an expedited major disaster declaration from New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, \u201cunlocking further federal support and FEMA assistance to the impacted communities.\u201d \u2022 California firefighters brace for 100-degree heat: California is heating up Friday, with triple-digit temperatures expected in some areas. Heat alerts span parts of southern and central California, including in Colusa County, where firefighters are working to rein in the Sites Fire spanning over 19,100 acres. High temperatures between 100 and 106 are expected and could hinder firefighting efforts. California is seeing an active early fire year, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Since the start of the year, 89,784 acres have burned, compared to 5,747 acres during the same period last year. Early-season heat wave intensifies this weekend More record daily high temperatures are possible through the weekend as heat expands into new areas and intensifies in others. A stagnant heat dome over the eastern US is fueling some of the most unusually intense heat over portions of the Ohio Valley and the mid-Atlantic. Heat will build in Washington, DC, Friday and threaten triple-digits Saturday and Sunday. The extreme heat and humidity will combine to push the heat index \u2013 or how hot it feels \u2013 to 100 to 105 degrees over a widespread area, with 110 degrees possible in the southern mid-Atlantic. Record overnight low temperatures will increase health risks by reducing the ability for people to cool down at night. The heat wave\u2019s prolonged nature is another serious concern. New York City could experience 90-degree temperatures or higher for seven days straight into week. The  stretch would be the longest ever in June in the city. Heat is also returning in full force in the West following a brief break. Heat alerts are already in place for portions of California, Arizona and Utah. Temperatures are expected to jump back up to 10 to 15 degrees above normal for Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Sacramento and Bakersfield, California, through the weekend. Hurricane season heating up, too Two tropical systems could develop quick on the heels of Alberto. The first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season made landfall as sprawling tropical storm in Mexico, but brought heavy rain and storm surge to much of the western Gulf of Mexico. A system with a medium chance of tropical development could mimic Alberto\u2019s track through the southwestern Gulf of Mexico and into northeastern Mexico this weekend. A broad area of low pressure near the Yucatan Peninsula is forecast to strengthen as it moves into the southwest Gulf of Mexico this weekend. This system has a medium chance of developing into a tropical system. in the next several days and will also bring more rain chances to South Texas. While this system is not expected to be as large as Alberto, it would bring more rain chances to South Texas and trigger new flooding concerns there and along the Gulf Coast. Texas isn\u2019t the only area watching for a potential tropical system. Those in Florida and Georgia should also watch closely as a tropical depression could develop Friday with little time before it makes landfall Friday night. The National Hurricane Center on Friday morning increased the odds of the storm system developing after finding signs it was organizing. It has a medium chance of a last-gasp development, according to the NHC. The designation would largely be ceremonial as some heavy rain, high surf and gusty winds are expected regardless of the system\u2019s final form.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/weather/heat-wave-new-york-i-95-corridor-new-mexico-wildfires/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_18_europe_us-soldier-gordon-black-russia-sentencing-intl-hnk", "text": "A Russian court on Wednesday sentenced a US soldier to three years and nine months in a penal colony on charges of theft and threatening murder, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Staff Sgt. Gordon Black was arrested in May on charges of theft in the far eastern city of Vladivostok, where he had traveled to visit a woman, believed to be his girlfriend. He was accused of stealing 10,000 rubles (roughly $112) from her when he visited Russia in April after meeting her in South Korea, state news agency TASS previously reported. Black was also accused of assaulting the woman during a quarrel. The US soldier did not admit to charges of threatening to kill the woman, but partially admitted guilt to theft charges, RIA Novosti previously reported. Black will appeal the sentence handed down by the court in Vladivostok, his lawyer said Wednesday, according to TASS. Speaking to the Pervomaisky District Court on Monday, Black said he took the money from the woman\u2019s purse, but the next day transferred $125 to her. He said he spent the money on food and three nights in a hotel, according to RIA. He also said the woman was to collect a deposit of 10,000 rubles from the landlord after the end of the lease of the apartment for which he was paying, RIA said. The woman also spoke in court on Monday, saying she was not yet ready to\u00a0reconcile with Black since the damage had not yet been compensated. Black\u2019s sentencing comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow, as\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u00a0rages on. A number of Americans are being held in Russia, including two who have been declared as wrongfully detained by the US State Department \u2013 former Marine\u00a0Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich. Gershkovich, 32, will stand trial behind closed doors in the city of Yekaterinburg from June 26, TASS reported Monday, citing the court\u2019s press service. The journalist has been imprisoned since he was arrested while on a reporting trip in March last year by the FSB, Russia\u2019s federal security service, which accused him of trying to obtain state secrets. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. Gershkovich, the US government and the Wall Street Journal have vehemently denied the charges against him. The\u00a0White House has previously alleged the Kremlin\u00a0is using Gershkovich, the first American reporter detained in Russia on allegations of spying since the Cold War, as a geopolitical hostage.

{"id": "2024_06_22_middleeast_naama-levy-birthday-israel-hostage-intl-latam", "text": "Thousands of people gathered in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Saturday to commemorate the 20th birthday of Naama Levy, who has been held captive for 260 days. It was one of the first and most searing viral videos to emerge as the October 7 attack unfolded. A cell phone video released by Hamas shows Levy, who was 19-years-old at the time, being dragged by her hair at gunpoint by a terrorist in Gaza. Her hands are bound, her ankles cut. Her pants are soaked in blood. Eight months on, and Levy is one of 120 people who remain in captivity in Gaza, 116 of whom were among the more than 250 taken hostage on October 7. A hostage and ceasefire deal in November secured the release of more than 100, while a handful have been rescued. But fears for those who remain are growing, with a senior Hamas official telling CNN recently that \u201cno one has an idea\u201d how many of them are still alive. Their plight is the subject of regular anti-government protests in Israel, where many demonstrators are calling on Israeli leaders to secure a hostage deal and hold an early election. At Hostages Square on Saturday, Levy\u2019s parents Ayelet Levy Shachar and Yoni Levy addressed the crowd. \u201cToday, I didn\u2019t want to make a speech in the square. I just wanted to wish Naama a happy birthday, to speak to you, Naama, hoping you might hear, wishing these words reach you,\u201d Levy\u2019s mother said during her speech. \u201cI \u2026 wish for you the most basic right that you deserve as a human being \u2013 your freedom, which was taken from you eight and a half months ago,\u201d her mother added. Levy\u2019s father, Yoni, said he wished his daughter could see how many people showed up to celebrate her birthday. \u201cI remember your laughter and can hear your voice, imagining exactly what you\u2019d be doing today. We would have prepared a table for you, full of sweets, balloons, and gifts. Like every year,\u201d Yoni said during his speech at the gathering. \u201cHow happy this day could have been. Instead, you\u2019re there. In darkness. For 260 days already. And we stand here,\u201d Yoni added. \u201cWe all understand that 120 hostages cannot be returned through military operations. We must honestly say \u2013 120 hostages will only return home through a deal,\u201d Yoni said. Yoni also addressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directly, saying, \u201cVictory in war is not just victory in military battles. And it\u2019s not just preserving the coalition at any cost. Victory in war is the ability to preserve the values of this nation, years ahead. And victory is the ability to continue being faithful to our values as Jews and Israelis.\u201d The gathering in Hostages Square was just one of several that took place in cities across Israel on Saturday Families of hostages held in Gaza also took part in protests in Jerusalem, Herzliya, Caesarea, Raanana, Be\u2019er Sheva, Kiryat Gat and the town of Pardes Hanna-Karkur. Many waved Israeli flags and held up signs with images of the Israeli hostages. \u201cAlive! Alive! And not in body bags!\u201d, \u201cHostage deal now! Bring them back alive now! The baby, the soldiers, the women, the men,\u201d protesters in Tel Aviv shouted. Other protesters were heard shouting, \u201d Elections now.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing more important, every hostage must return!\u201d protesters in Jerusalem chanted. In Caesarea, thousands of protesters took to the streets chanting, \u2018You\u2019re the leader, you\u2019re guilty!\u2019 In the town of Pardes Hanna-Karkur, protesters also called for the release of all hostages and an early election to be held. Some of them were heard chanting, \u2018We will not give up until we make it a better place to live.\u201d Former Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz took part in a hostage rally in Carmei Gat in Kiryat Gat city with members of Kibbutz Nir Oz. Nir Oz was one of several kibbutzim\u00a0that bore the brunt of Hamas\u2019 attack on October 7, with many residents murdered or taken hostage.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/middleeast/naama-levy-birthday-israel-hostage-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_19_tech_openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor", "text": "Victor Miller, 42, recently filed paperwork to run for mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming, but it wasn\u2019t exactly for him: He listed the name of a customized AI chatbot to appear on the ballot. He argued that the chatbot, named VIC \u2013 for \u201cvirtual integrated citizen\u201d \u2013 would use technology from artificial intelligence company OpenAI to make all political decisions and help govern the city. (VIC is not affiliated with a political party.) AI has \u201chelped me in my life personally \u2026 such as helping me with my resume,\u201d Miller told CNN. \u201cI think it could add a layer to help a town. I really want to see that happen.\u201d On Tuesday, however, OpenAI told CNN it shut down Miller\u2019s access to the tool that was being used to interact with and persuade voters. Using ChatGPT in this way, according to the company, is against its policies. AI is making politics even more complicated as government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to use AI tools responsibly, and the tech is advancing faster than social, legal and regulatory guardrails. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken action against these uses of our technology for violating our policies against political campaigning,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told CNN. On its website, OpenAI states it prohibits \u201cengaging in political campaigning or lobbying, including generating campaign materials personalized to or targeted at specific demographics.\u201d Miller said he was motivated to create VIC after he was denied access to city records about policies and procedures because he made his request anonymously. \u201cIf I was able to ask AI and interact with this new intelligence, it would have known the law and I would have gotten the records,\u201d he said. The city did not respond to request for comment on the denial of records, but Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray told CNN in a statement that he is \u201cclosely\u201d monitoring Miller\u2019s bid for mayor. \u201cWyoming law is clear that, to run for office, one must be a \u2018qualified elector,\u2019 which necessitates being a real person,\u201d Gray said in the statement. \u201cTherefore, an AI bot is not a qualified elector.\u201d He also suggested the chatbot is essentially a fig leaf for a Miller candidacy. Gray said he wrote a letter to the Cheyenne municipal clerk raising his concerns about the bid. Although the public-facing version of VIC has been removed by OpenAI, Miller said it still works on his own ChatGPT account. He plans to bring it, along with a microphone, to a local Cheyenne library and give voters the opportunity to directly ask it questions via its voice-to-text feature. OpenAI told CNN it also took action against another candidate in the UK who was using its AI models to help campaign for Parliament. Steve Endacott, chairman of an AI company called Neural Voice, answers questions from voters via AI Steve, a chatbot, on his site. He is running as an independent. Endacott did not respond to a request for comment. His website offered a ChatGPT chatbot where voters were able to leave opinions and help create policies. If a voter asked the tool a question about AI Steve\u2019s policies and it didn\u2019t have an answer, it would conduct a search and create a policy suggestion. (While his website continues to operate, the tool is no longer powered by ChatGPT.) \u2018Gimmick is the right word\u2019 Although AI chatbots are getting smarter, some experts told CNN the technology should never substitute for human judgment in running any part of government. \u201cWhen it comes to AI now and what it will be like in the future, it should never be used to make automated decisions,\u201d said Jen Golbeck, a professor at the College of Information Sciences at the University of Maryland. \u201cAI has always been designed for decision support \u2013 it gives some data to help a human make decisions but is not set up to make decisions by itself.\u201d The emergence of AI political candidates also comes amid growing concerns about how the spread of misinformation could impact elections. Earlier this year, for example, a fake recording of a candidate in Slovakia saying he rigged the election went viral. Golbeck said, however, that there may be a place for AI in politics when it comes to helping with various tasks, such as answering forms from constituents or directing how to get problems solved. \u201cYou may be able to train a chatbot with all of the knowledge found in an office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the decision making should always be left to humans.\u201d David Karpf, an associate professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University, agreed, noting the people behind an AI candidacy are leaning into \u201ca cultural moment\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be taken seriously. \u201cGimmick is the right word for it,\u201d Karpf told CNN. \u201cChatGPT is not qualified to run your government.\u201d Karpf said he doesn\u2019t believe lawmakers need to make formal legislation around AI chatbots running for office because \u201cno one is going to vote for an AI chatbot to run a city.\u201d Karpf believes that the timing of these cases is noteworthy, too. \u201cWe have a very serious election coming up, and I don\u2019t mind levity in it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what this is: We should laugh for a minute and get back to work.\u201d But Miller said he hopes the attention around his efforts inspires more AI candidates in the months ahead. \u201cI think this can expand beyond the mayor and Parliament, and [reach the whole] world,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/19/tech/openai-shuts-down-ai-mayor/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Russian Ministry of Defense said in a post on Telegram that Ukraine carried out the attack using \u201cUS-supplied ATACMS operational-tactical missiles equipped with cluster warheads.\u201d Four missiles were shot down by Russian air defense but another \u201cdeviated from its flight trajectory in the final section due to the impact of air defenses, with the warhead exploding in the air over the city,\u201d the post added. Video footage posted on X shows the aftermath of the strike, with\u00a0wounded civilians seen being carried from the beach in stretchers before being loaded into vehicles. Beachgoers, some of them still in their swimwear, can be seen evacuating the area. One of victims killed in the Ukrainian strike was the daughter of Oleg Averyanov, Deputy Mayor of Magadan. Yuri Grishan, the Mayor of Magadan, said Averyanov\u2019s daughter Sofia was nine and on vacation with her parents in Sevastopol. The casualties were partially caused by the timing of the strike, which came \u201cat a time when civilians, some were returning from work, some had already gone to the beach with their children,\u201d according to Governor Razvozhayev, who has announced a day of mourning. According to eyewitnesses on the ground, there was no air raid siren which warned of the attack. Many local residents also took to the comment section of official posts to express their dissatisfaction about the air raid siren not alerting them to an incoming attack. In response to Ukraine\u2019s attack on Sevastopol, the Russian Ministry of Defense said \u201csuch actions will not go unanswered,\u201d saying responsibility for the attack lied with Washington. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry\u00a0Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin is in constant contact with Sevastopol authorities, adding that the Russian government\u2019s priority is to provide all necessary assistance to victims, RIA says. Ukraine has not officially commented on the attack, but CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian military for a comment. Crimea has been occupied by Russia since its forces annexed the peninsula in 2014. Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, it has come under sporadic attack from Ukrainian forces. Kyiv has previously insisted that its strikes on Crimea, which have targeted Russian naval bases and vessels, are an integral part of their\u00a0strategy, intended to try to isolate the peninsula and make it more difficult for Russia to sustain its military operations on the Ukrainian mainland, a Ukrainian source familiar with the strategy told CNN last year. Before Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Sevastopol \u2013 the largest city in Crimea \u2013 was a popular tourist destination for Russians. Even after the outbreak of war, Russians have continued to flock to the coastal city despite the dangers.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/europe/at-leastfivedead-and-over-100-injured-in-ukrainian-strike-in-russian-occupied-crimea/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_middleeast_american-deaths-hajj-heat-intl-latam", "text": "Saida Wurie said it was her parents\u2019 lifelong dream to participate in Hajj, the religious pilgrimage that brings Muslims from around the world to Saudi Arabia each year. They\u2019d spent $23,000 on an all-inclusive travel package through a tour company registered in the state of Maryland. \u201cThey saved their whole lives for this,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Fredricka Whitfield. But what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime turned tragic this week, when Wurie learned that her mother Isatu Tejan Wurie, 65, and father Alieu Dausy Wurie, 71, were among the hundreds of pilgrims who have died during the extreme temperatures that have gripped the Persian Gulf country. More than 500 have been confirmed dead while there\u00a0are fears that\u00a0number is well above a thousand. The Wuries were American citizens from Bowie, Maryland. Mrs. Wurie had recently retired as a head nurse at Kaiser Permanente in Prince George\u2019s County, her daughter told CNN. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Whitfield on Saturday, Wurie said she had been in close contact with her parents while they were in Saudi Arabia via a family group chat. It was in that chat, she said, that she learned that the tour company did not provide the proper transportation or credentials needed to participate in the pilgrimage. The group her parents were traveling with, which included up to 100 fellow pilgrims, lacked sufficient food and supplies for the five-to-six-day journey that is a pillar of Islam, she said. Wurie believes her parents were not \u201cproperly prepared\u201d for the trip by the tour operator\u00a0and \u201cdid not receive what they paid for\u201d from the company. CNN has reached out to the tour company for comment. She last heard from her parents on Saturday, June 15, when her mother messaged that they had already been waiting for transportation for hours to take them to Mount Arafat. She believes they were located in Mina at the time. The couple ultimately opted to walk instead and sent a message to their daughter after they had been walking for over two hours. The couple then joined fellow pilgrims and others in their tour group on Mount Arafat, where they were gathering to pray and reflect on the holy site. A man on their tour group contacted Saida Wurie to say that her parents had gone missing on Mount Arafat, after her father said\u00a0that he could not continue on the journey and stopped for a break along the way. The man had continued to the top of Mount Arafat but could not find the couple upon his descent. Wurie received death notifications from the US Consulate in Jeddah, which had obtained them from the Saudi Interior Ministry, saying her parents had died of \u201cnatural causes\u201d on June 15. She was later advised by someone at the US Embassy that heat stroke would be considered a natural cause. The Consulate General\u2019s Office told her that her parents had already been buried, but have been unable to tell her exactly where. Now, Saida and her brothers are doing everything they can to get answers and find their parents\u2019 burial\u00a0place. \u201cWe did ask the Saudi government to hold the bodies in order for us to travel to Saudi Arabia to at least give them the proper burial with [their] children being present and to be able to identify the bodies,\u201d she told Whitfield. \u201cUnfortunately, they have already been buried.\u201d \u2060She would like\u00a0American diplomats to meet her and\u00a0her siblings\u00a0on the ground when they arrive to assist them in finding where their parents are buried and collecting their belongings, since she does not know Arabic and is not familiar with the area. As of Saturday, diplomats have not committed to meeting them in person in Saudi Arabia, she said. The US State Department confirmed there had been \u201cdeaths of multiple US citizens in Saudi Arabia,\u201d but declined to comment on any specifics around the Wurie family. Extreme heat has been named as a main factor behind the hundreds of deaths and injuries reported this year during the Hajj. Mecca, the holy city that is central for Hajj pilgrims, saw temperatures soar to a record-setting 125 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday. High temperatures for this year\u2019s gathering had been expected, with the Saudi army deploying more than 1,600 personnel with medical units and 30 rapid response teams specifically for heatstroke. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers were also on duty. But CNN has spoken to other Hajj\u00a0pilgrims who said the preparations weren\u2019t enough, with one describing seeing fellow worshipers lose consciousness and walking past bodies covered in white cloths. The exact death toll remains unclear and is expected to rise, as countries around the world have been independently announcing the deaths of their nationals. Concern over improper tour groups has also grown. Egypt announced it was revoking the licenses of 16 travel agencies that organize Hajj trips\u00a0on Saturday, according to the state-run news agency Ahram Online. This isn\u2019t the first time hundreds of pilgrims have died while traveling for the Hajj, which this year attracted more than 1.8 million people.\u00a0In 2015 more than 700 people were killed\u00a0during a stampede in the Saudi Arabian city of Mina, just outside of Mecca. In 2006, 363 people were killed during a stampede at the site where pilgrims gathered to participate in the \u2018stoning of the devil\u2019 ritual in Mina.\u00a0Last year, more than 200 people died.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/middleeast/american-deaths-hajj-heat-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_weather_south-heat-wave-midwest-flood-recovery", "text": "Dangerous heat is setting its sights on millions of Americans across the South and Plains on Monday, including several communities recovering from destructive flooding over the weekend. Here\u2019s the latest. \u2022 Heat heads to the South: The unrelenting heat shifts into the South and Southern Plains on Monday and Tuesday, bringing temperatures in the mid to upper 90s. Some cities could even see 100-degree highs, including Dallas and Little Rock, Arkansas. The heat index \u2013 a measurement of how the body feels in humidity and high temperatures \u2013 could top a dangerous 110 degrees in some areas. \u2022 Flood-stricken communities begin recovery amid sweltering heat: Heat alerts on Monday spread over 1,000 miles from North Florida to South Dakota, which was among several states inundated by heavy rain and devastating flooding over the weekend. Heat advisories are in effect for several areas that were swamped with floodwater over the weekend, including parts of\u00a0northern Iowa, southern South Dakota, eastern Nebraska and northern Missouri and Kansas. In Iowa, Gov. Kim Reynolds has asked President Joe Biden for a major disaster declaration after \u201ccatastrophic flooding\u201d forced some communities to evacuate. \u2022Record-breaking weekend heat: Daily high-temperature records were broken from New York to Mississippi over the weekend, including some that were more than a century old, as a brutal heat wave embraced the mid-Atlantic and I-95 corridor from Washington, D.C. to New York. Philadelphia hit 98 degrees on Sunday, shattering its 1888 record of 97 degrees. Both Greenville, Mississippi, and Raleigh, North Carolina, saw a record 100 degrees. People in the region can breathe a sigh of relief Monday as cooler temperatures begin to set in. \u2022 Flooding turns deadly in South Dakota: At least one person died during severe flooding in South Dakota, Governor Kristi Noem said. \u201cI want to remind everybody to remember the power of water and the flow of water, and to stay away from flooded areas,\u201d the governor warned. At least nine people were rescued from rising water in Sioux Falls, where emergency personnel reported stranded drivers and dozens of trapped vehicles. And the flood threat still isn\u2019t over \u2013 several rivers in the state are swollen with floodwater and will continue rising over the next few days, Noem said. \u2022 More than 20 rivers at major flood stage: Flood warnings remain across waterlogged areas of South Dakota, Iowa and southern Minnesota, as well as along rivers that are running well above normal. At least 23 river gauges have reached major flood stage in the area, meaning extensive flooding of buildings, main roadways, and other critical infrastructure is possible, according to the National Weather Service. That number is expected to grow as water continues to collect across creeks and streams, eventually dumping into major rivers. \u2022 \u201cMonsoon-like\u201d conditions coming to the Southwest: An influx of tropical moisture \u2013 some of which is from Tropical Storm Alberto \u2013 is bringing \u201cmonsoon-like conditions\u201d to the Southwest, the Weather Prediction Center said. Thunderstorms are possible through midweek as a result. While the rainfall may be welcomed by firefighters battling several active wildfires in the region, too much rain could trigger flooding and debris flows, making it difficult for crews to access burn areas. Where heat will go next A heat dome building over the southwestern and south-central US early this week will push temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above normal each afternoon in an area spanning from the West into the Southeast. High temperatures in the upper 90s and low 100s are expected Monday from southern South Dakota through the Southeast. A handful of daily record high temperatures could fall in parts of Nebraska and Kansas, and a few are at risk in Mississippi. The southern tier of the country will remain the epicenter for sizzling conditions Tuesday with high temperatures in the low 100s likely in the southern Plains and Southeast. Atlanta is forecast to top out in the upper 90s both Tuesday and Wednesday, about 10 degrees above normal for late June. By Wednesday, heat will briefly shift back into some of the same areas of the mid-Atlantic and Northeast that baked last week, but it won\u2019t touch the extreme nature of last week\u2019s oven-like conditions. Temperatures in the upper 90s and low 100s will return in the mid-Atlantic and 90s will return as far north as southern New England. A few daily high temperature records are in jeopardy Wednesday \u2013 including DC and Baltimore \u2013 but much of the northeast US will avoid unseasonable heat. Stormy weather maintains flood threat There will be rain chances for heavily flooded areas of the Midwest most of this week. A level 2 of 5 risk for severe thunderstorms is in effect over the area Monday and Tuesday and some of these storms could unload rounds of heavy rainfall. Exactly how much rain falls and where depends on how thunderstorms develop each afternoon, but the heaviest storms could unload more than an inch of rain in a short time. That\u2019s more than enough to cause additional flooding concerns in areas that can\u2019t take much more rain. Storms are expected to roar to life each day in the late afternoon or early evening hours and remain a threat overnight. Damaging wind gusts and hail\u00a0are also threats with any severe thunderstorm early this week. After a brief break on Wednesday, additional heavy rain is possible in the same areas Thursday and Friday.

{"id": "2024_06_24_asia_us-aircraft-carrier-south-korea-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "A United States Navy aircraft carrier has arrived in South Korea for a show of force as Washington, Seoul and Tokyo released a joint statement on Monday condemning deepening military ties between North Korea and Russia. The nuclear-powered USS Theodore Roosevelt docked in the port of Busan on Saturday ahead of trilateral exercises with South Korea and Japan in the waters near the peninsula. The Freedom Edge exercises resulted from an agreement made by the defense chiefs of the US, South Korea and Japan before Russian leader Vladimir Putin made his high-profile  trip to Pyongyang last week. But the strongly worded joint statement the three partners released Monday shows the gravity with which they view a new \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d between North Korea and Russia made during Putin\u2019s trip. Besides signing the defense deal with Kim Jong Un, Putin also linked security on the Korean Peninsula to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, threatening to arm North Korea should South Korea provide military aid to Kyiv. The US, South Korea and Japan \u201ccondemn in the strongest possible terms deepening military cooperation between the DPRK and Russia,\u201d the joint statement said, using the acronym for the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, North Korea\u2019s official name. Deepened ties between Moscow and Pyongyang, and the mutual defense pact \u201cshould be of grave concern to anyone with an interest in maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, upholding the global non-proliferation regime, and supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend their freedom and independence against Russia\u2019s brutal aggression,\u201d it said. The joint statement comes after all three partners separately expressed deep concerns over the treaty, including South Korea condemning it and summoning Russia\u2019s ambassador on Friday, a rare diplomatic step that illustrates the soured tensions between Seoul and Moscow. The aircraft carrier\u2019s presence in Busan is just the latest in a series of US military moves to show Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad\u201d commitment to its own treaty ally in South Korea. Earlier this month, US Air Force B-1B bombers participated in a live-fire exercise on the peninsula, the first time in seven years those long-range strike aircraft have dropped live munitions in South Korea. And last week, a US Air Force AC-130 gunship also performed live-fire strikes on the same range where the B-1s dropped their bombs. Joint drills with the US have long been a source of frustration and ire for North Korea which has pressed ahead with its illegal nuclear weapons program and missile testing under Kim, who has found a common cause with Putin. Russia, which once supported sanctions on North Korea, used its veto power in the United Nations earlier this year to shield Pyongyang from further scrutiny and Putin has backed often backed Kim\u2019s narrative. \u201cThis confrontational policy on the part of the US to expand its military infrastructure in the subregion was accompanied by significant increases in the intensity and scale of military drills involving South Korea and Japan that are hostile towards North Korea,\u201d Putin said in Pyongyang on Wednesday. The visit of the USS Theodore Roosevelt to Busan marks the second time a Nimitz-class carrier has visited South Korea in seven months. The USS Carl Vinson called in Busan last November. The Roosevelt, with some 5,000 personnel aboard, carries an air wing of more than 60 aircraft, including F/A-18 Super Hornet fighters. The presence of the Roosevelt and its carrier strike group of supporting warships \u201cdemonstrates the solid combined defense posture and resolute will of the South Korea-US alliance to respond to the sophisticating threat from North Korea,\u201d a statement from the South Korean military said. Neither the US nor South Korea would give details or exact dates of the upcoming Freedom Edge exercise. But the three have been working more closely together, including recent exercises involving forces from all three countries. The Pentagon on Sunday gave a clue as to the timing of the Freedom Edge exercise, releasing a statement saying the Roosevelt would be departing the Indo-Pacific theater next week and heading to the Middle East to replace the carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower.

{"id": "2024_06_21_europe_italy-indian-farm-worker-death-intl-latam", "text": "The death of an Indian\u00a0migrant\u00a0worker in Italy, who was reportedly abandoned on a road after his arm was severed at work, has sparked outrage and prompted calls for a demonstration on Saturday in the town of Latina, in the country\u2019s central Lazio region. Satnam Singh,\u00a0a 31-year-old farm worker, was left on the street\u00a0Monday\u00a0after losing his right\u00a0arm while working at\u00a0a farm near Latina, which is southeast of Rome, CNN\u2019s affiliate SkyTG24 reported. His arm was reportedly severed by a plastic wrapping machine on the farm. Singh died days later and has come to symbolize the plight of vulnerable migrant workers in the country, with several trade unions and Latina\u2019s Indian community organizing demonstrations in the following days. Italian state broadcaster RAI said Singh was hooked by the plastic wrapping machine, towed by a tractor, which severed his right arm and crushed his lower limbs. Singh was then loaded into a van and abandoned near his home, while his severed arm was left in a vegetable collection box, RAI reported. He died\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0at\u00a0the San Camillo\u00a0hospital in Rome. An investigation into farm owner Antonello\u00a0Lovato \u2013 who allegedly left the injured Singh outside his home after the incident \u2013 has now been opened over potential charges of manslaughter and failure to assist a person in danger, Reuters reported, citing lead prosecutor Giuseppe De Falco. Singh did not have a regular contract or a residence permit, according to SkyTG24, and had been working at the same company for Italy for two years. CNN has reached out to De Falco and to Lovato\u2019s lawyers for comment, as well as to the Indian government. Lovato\u2019s father, Renzo Lovato told\u00a0RAI\u00a0that Singh had been warned \u201cnot to approach the vehicle\u201d and that \u201cthere is sadness because a man died at work and it should never happen. The\u00a0family\u2019s\u00a0lawyer, Valerio Righi, told Reuters that\u00a0Antonello Lovato \u201cspontaneously went to the judicial police an hour after the events, as any decent person would do,\u201d\u00a0adding that his client was waiting for the charges to be formalized to defend himself. Responding to allegations that Singh was abandoned without calls to an ambulance, Righi said, \u201cYou will see during the proceedings that maybe help was called sooner than people think.\u201d The farm worker\u2019s death has shocked the country. Italy Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed\u00a0her condolences and\u00a0strongly condemned Singh\u2019s death at\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0cabinet meeting. \u201cThese are inhumane acts that do not belong to the Italian people, and I hope that this barbarism will be harshly punished,\u201d she said in a statement. \u2018Unprecedented brutality\u2019 Trade unions met with the Italian\u00a0Labor Minister Marina Elvira Calderone and Agriculture\u00a0Minister Francesco Lollobrigida on Friday to discuss changes needed to prevent such events from happening again. What happened to Satnam Singh is \u201cmuch more than an injury: it is an inhuman act of barbarism in which those who abandoned him demonstrated that they had no regard for the value of human life,\u201d Calderone said Thursday in an interview with RAI, calling for exemplary punishments against exploitation at work. Several trade unions have organized a demonstration for Saturday in Latina and called for a two-hour strike to demand \u201cdignity and respect for the health and safety of workers\u201d and to urge political and social forces to combat worker exploitation and inhuman work conditions. Trade unions have also organized a fundraiser to raise funds for Singh\u2019s family, with some condemning Italy\u2019s gangmastering system, which involves the illegal recruitment and exploitation of agricultural workers. In a press release on Wednesday, trade union leader Maria Grazia Gabrielli called the incident one of \u201cunprecedented brutality\u201d. She said the incident was a result of \u201cthe irregularity in which we relegate thousands of\u00a0migrants who arrive in our country in search of hope.\u201d She said migrants found themselves as \u201cslaves of contemporary society, irregular, without a residence permit, and therefore more susceptible to blackmail by those who consider work only for profit, and rights - such as that of assistance - only as obstacles.\u201d Gabrielli added that exploitation in the fields often results in \u201cstarvation wages, unsafe and inhuman working rhythms and conditions, psychological and physical violence which unfortunately also lead to terrible events like the one in Latina.\u201d The Indian community of Latina will take to the streets on June 25\u00a0 to take part in a demonstration in memory of Singh, and will deliver an open letter to the prefect of Latina, Maurizio Falco calling for action and denunciation of the incident, according to RAI. According to a report from Italy\u2019s biggest labor union, CGIL, and labor union FLAI, in 2021 there were approximately 230,000 irregular workers employed in the primary sector, which largely includes non-resident foreigners employed in agriculture.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/europe/italy-indian-farm-worker-death-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_02_style_aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl", "text": "Miami has a new addition to its skyline \u2013 a 66-story residential tower built by Aston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker\u2019s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_middleeast_intense-phase-hamas-war-end-netanyahu-lebanon-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the \u201cintense phase of the war with Hamas (in Gaza) is about to end,\u201d and that the military\u2019s focus could then shift to Israel\u2019s northern border with Lebanon, where fighting with the Iran-backed group Hezbollah has intensified in recent weeks. Netanyahu, however, vowed that Israel would continue operating in Gaza until the militant group Hamas was eliminated. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the war is going to end, but the war in its current stage is going to end in Rafah. This is true. We will continue mowing the grass later,\u201d Netanyahu told Channel 14 Television in his first one-on-one interview with local Israeli media since October 7. More than a million Palestinians were taking shelter in Rafah before Israel started its air and ground operation in the southern Gazan city, defying calls from the international community not to proceed. Around 800,000 people have since been displaced from Rafah, where conditions have been described by the United Nations food agency as \u201capocalyptic.\u201d The city\u2019s border crossing\u00a0with Egypt \u2014 a vital entry point for humanitarian aid \u2014 has remained closed since the Israeli military seized it early last month. And international pressure on Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza have mounted since it started its operation in Rafah. Last month, the UN\u2019s top court ordered Israel to immediately halt its controversial military operation there, calling the humanitarian situation \u201cdisastrous.\u201d Netanyahu also weighed in on the ongoing negotiations to end the war, saying he was ready to make \u201ca partial deal\u201d with Hamas to return some hostages still being held captive in Gaza, but reiterating his position that the war will still continue after a ceasefire \u201cto achieve the goal of eliminating\u201d Hamas. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to give that up,\u201d Netanyahu said. Netanyahu\u2019s comments were at odds with the aims of a broader proposal outlined by US President Joe Biden last month. That plan, which the US has said is an Israeli one, sets out conditions intended to lead to the eventual release of all remaining hostages, in return for a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli forces. Israeli opposition politician Gadi Eisenkot said Netanyahu\u2019s remarks about a \u201cpartial deal\u201d contradicted the wishes of the country\u2019s recently-disbanded war cabinet, of which Eisenkot was a member. \u201cA deal in one step, the so-called \u2018all for all,\u2019 or a complete deal in three steps. The cabinet voted unanimously on this. That\u2019s why the Prime Minister\u2019s statement about a partial deal is against the war cabinet\u2019s decision,\u201d Eisenkot told the Knesset Foreign Affairs Committee on Monday. \u201cI think this requires clarification in light of the turmoil it causes to the families of the hostages.\u201d Eisenkot, who \u2013 along with centrist opposition figure Benny Gantz \u2013 resigned from the war cabinet the week before Netanyahu dissolved it, said the remarks had damaged Israel\u2019s war objectives. \u201cThe damage is of course the failure to realize the goals of the war, and it is a fatal damage to the national strength of the State of Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are soldiers who are fighting now because they have war goals to return the hostages and therefore I think that an immediate clarification by the Prime Minister is required as to what he meant.\u201d In a short statement issued after his interview Sunday, Netanyahu\u2019s office sought to clarify his comments, saying Hamas opposes a deal, not Israel. \u201cPrime Minister Netanyahu has made it clear that we will not leave Gaza until we return all 120 of our hostages, living and deceased,\u201d it said. The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters condemned any suggestion of a withdrawal without securing the return of all hostages. \u201cThe end of the fighting in the Gaza Strip, without the release of the hostages, is an unprecedented national failure and a failure to meet the goals of the war,\u201d the Forum said in a statement on Monday. The prime minister has faced nationwide protests in Israel calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and the return of all hostages. On Saturday, families of the hostages took part in the ongoing\u00a0anti-government\u00a0protests, including in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Herzliya, Caesarea, Raanana, Be\u2019er Sheva, Kiryat Gat\u00a0and the town of Pardes Hanna-Karkur. Many protesters demanded the government accept the hostage release deal. Cracks also appear to be deepening between the Israeli government and its military. Netanyahu has come under increasing\u00a0pressure\u00a0from members of his\u00a0government\u00a0and Israel\u2019s allies, including the United States, to devise a strategy for the post-war governance of Gaza after Israel\u2019s devastating bombardment of the isolated enclave. In response to the prime minister\u2019s comments, Hamas said the words used by\u00a0Netanyahu\u00a0show that he is only looking for a partial agreement and not an end to the war in Gaza. Netanyahu\u2019s positions are \u201ca clear confirmation of his rejection of the recent Security Council resolution, and the proposals of US President Joe Biden,\u201d Hamas said in a statement. Hamas continues to insist that any agreement include, \u201ca clear affirmation of a permanent ceasefire and a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.\u201d Shifting north Netanyahu also told Channel 14 Television that \u201cafter the end of the intense phase, we will have the possibility to shift some of the power north, and we will do it.\u201d \u201cFirst of all, for protection purposes, and secondly, to bring our residents home as well. If we can do it politically, that would be great. If not, we will do it in another way, but we will bring everyone back home \u2013 all the residents of the north and the south,\u201d he added. Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Islamist movement with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, has been carrying out deadly attacks from southern Lebanon targeting areas in northern Israel since October 8, the day after the Hamas attacks on Israel. Israel has responded to Hezbollah\u2019s attacks with strikes that have killed Hezbollah militants, among them senior commanders. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from their homes in northern Israel due to ongoing conflict. Villages across southern Lebanon have also emptied. The increase in cross-border attacks in recent weeks has intensified concerns about the possible outbreak of another full-fledged conflict in the Middle East. Israeli officials have told the US they were planning\u00a0to shift resources from southern Gaza to northern Israel in preparation for a possible offensive against the group, US officials told CNN on Wednesday. The implications of a wider war between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah could be devastating, a senior US official previously told CNN. US officials have serious concerns\u00a0that in the event of a full-blown war between Israel and\u00a0Hezbollah, as the Iran-backed militant group could overwhelm Israel\u2019s air defenses\u00a0in the north \u2014 including the much-vaunted\u00a0Iron Dome\u00a0air defense system. Netanyahu was also asked in the interview if his solution to ending the conflict with Hezbollah was via agreement or war. The prime minister responded, \u201cLook, if there is an agreement, it will be an agreement according to our terms. Our terms are not ending the war, leaving Gaza, and leaving Hamas intact. I refuse to leave Hamas intact. We need to eliminate them.\u201d Israel launched its war in Gaza following the Hamas attacks of October 7, when militants killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages. Since then, the Israeli campaign has killed more than 37,000 people, according to the ministry of health in Gaza.

{"id": "2024_06_23_style_las-vegas-mystery-monolith-removed-intl-hnk", "text": "A strange monolith\u00a0found jutting out of the rocks\u00a0in a remote mountain range near Las Vegas has been taken down by authorities. How it got there is still unsolved. \u201cIt remains unknown how the item got to its location or who might be responsible,\u201d Las Vegas police said Friday in a series of posts on X announcing the removal of the glimmering, 6-foot-4 prism. Its discovery over the previous weekend, and quick removal because of public safety and environmental concerns, revived a pandemic-era mystery that captured the public\u2019s imagination when shiny monoliths evoking the object that appears in the Stanley Kubrick movie \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d began to appear around the globe. Members of the Las Vegas police search and rescue team found the object near Gass Peak, part of the vast Desert National Wildlife Refuge where bighorn sheep and desert tortoises can be found roaming. It was the latest discovery in a\u00a0series of mysterious columns that have popped up since at least 2020. In November of that year, a similar metal monolith was found deep in the Mars-like landscape of Utah\u2019s red-rock desert. Then came sightings in Romania, central California, New Mexico and on the famed Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. All of them\u00a0disappeared as quickly\u00a0as they popped up, adding to the lore. \u201cThis thing is not from another world,\u201d Lt. Nick Street of Utah\u2019s Department of Public Safety said at the time. The Utah monolith, believed to be the first in the series, had been embedded in the rock in an area so remote that officials didn\u2019t immediately reveal its location for fear of people getting lost or stranded while trying to find it. But internet sleuths quickly found the coordinates, and hordes of curious tourists eager to see and touch the otherworldly object arrived, flattening plants with their cars and leaving behind human waste in the bathroom-free backcountry. Authorities said the same concerns led them to tear down the latest monolith on Thursday. It was illegally installed on federal land established to protect bighorn sheep and is home to rare plants and desert tortoises. The Desert National Wildlife Refuge, which is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is the largest wildlife refuge outside of Alaska and can cover the state of Rhode Island twice. Christa Weise, acting manager of the wildlife refuge, confirmed Friday that the monolith had been removed but said she couldn\u2019t comment on whether federal authorities have opened a criminal investigation. The police department said the object was being kept at a secret location while authorities try to figure out the best way to dispose or store the massive structure made out of a reflective sheet of metal that was molded into a prism and secured with rebar and concrete. Photos accompanying the department\u2019s social media posts showed the object on its side after its removal, which left a large indent in the ground because the rebar had been buried deep into the dirt and rocks. The department said it \u201cdiscourages anyone from venturing off marked trails or leaving objects and items behind.\u201d \u201cThis poses a danger to you and the environment,\u201d Las Vegas police said. In Utah, the removal of the monolith there also left behind a hole in the red rock. The Bureau of Land Management said Friday that it was still actively investigating the Utah case.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/style/las-vegas-mystery-monolith-removed-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_portland-maine-best-towns-america", "text": "To understand how essential the sea is to the spirit of this bustling city, consider Jordan Rubin, owner-chef of Bar Futo, a Japanese-inspired eatery downtown. Rubin estimates that 70% of the seafood on his menu comes from the waters of Casco Bay and the nearby North Atlantic. And when he and his staff need more, they don\u2019t have far to go. \u201cWe walk down to the pier and pick up our fish,\u201d he said one recent afternoon. \u201cI did it this morning.\u201d Such is the nature of life in Portland, a working harbor town where James Beard Award-winning restaurants operate blocks from a busy waterfront where fishing trawlers arrive with the day\u2019s catch. Visitors to Maine, arriving with visions of lighthouses and lobsters, often bypass Portland on their way northeast to Acadia National Park or the many picturesque fishing villages of the state\u2019s mid-coast. But in recent years Portland\u2019s handsome red-brick architecture, vibrant food scene and acclaimed breweries have made it a destination on its own. Stroll down the cobblestoned streets of its quaint tourist district, known as the Old Port, and except for the T-shirt shops you almost feel like you could be back in the 1800s. Signs of Portland\u2019s maritime legacy are everywhere, from ferries to fish markets to Winslow Homer seascapes in the city\u2019s art museum. Indeed, the ocean is never far away. Portland\u2019s downtown sits on a hilly peninsula surrounded on three sides by water. To the east is Casco Bay, a broad inlet dotted with islands connected to the city by daily ferry service. Within a short drive are beaches, waterfront parks, seaside trails and six working lighthouses. Portland is Maine\u2019s largest city, and yet its 68,000 residents would fit comfortably inside an NFL stadium. Even so, the city offers a buffet of metropolis-level cultural attractions, from a symphony and live theater to professional baseball, basketball, soccer and hockey. This variety and compactness suits locals just fine. \u201cIt\u2019s just the right size,\u201d said Jamie Kingman Rice, a deputy director of the Maine Historical Society. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty to do. It\u2019s got a lot of great culture and restaurants. It\u2019s a walkable city. You get sort of a big-city feel in a small-city package.\u201d On the waterfront With its coastal New England vibe, Portland can feel like a smaller cousin of Boston, the historic Massachusetts capital about two hours\u2019 drive to the south. Some people confuse it with its namesake across the country, the much larger Portland, Oregon. But the city has plenty of vibrant history of its own. Settled by British explorers in the 1600s, colonial Portland soon became a thriving seaport, spurred in part by the Royal Navy\u2019s reliance on harvesting Maine\u2019s towering white pines as masts for its ships. Canadian cities such as Montreal also relied on Portland for transatlantic goods, since the Saint Lawrence River often froze solid in the winter. To help facilitate the flow of shipping in Portland\u2019s busy harbor, a sea captain in 1807 built on a hill an 86-foot tower with a telescope that could identify incoming ships from some 30 miles away. The invention of two-way radio rendered the observatory obsolete by the 1920s, but it\u2019s been restored and is open for tours today as the only remaining signal tower of its kind in the United States. The city survived four major fires, most recently on the Fourth of July in 1866, when fireworks ignited a blaze at a sugar factory. That fire wiped out many of Portland\u2019s historic buildings, although some on its outskirts survived \u2014 including the handsome Tate House, built in 1755 for a naval captain and the only pre-Revolutionary home in greater Portland open to the public as a museum. Today, Portland\u2019s waterfront holds everything from boutique hotels to dockside seafood joints serving fried clams and steamed lobsters on paper plates. Its busy harbor hosts a wide variety of watercraft, from fishing boats to commercial tankers to cruise ships. For visitors, the easiest way to get out on the water is via Casco Bay Lines, which offers dozens of ferries each day from Portland\u2019s Old Port to six of the bay\u2019s islands. Several islands offer overnight lodging, restaurants, beaches and bike rentals. The ferries run 365 days a year and are a lifeline for the islands\u2019 residents, many of whom commute to jobs and schools in Portland, said Nick Mavodones, Casco Bay Lines\u2019 operations manager. For passengers they also offer a bounty of sights, from lighthouses and sailing ships to historic spots such as Fort Gorges, a granite fortress built on a small island during the Civil War. Tourists can even board a working mailboat, which delivers letters, packages and freight to the islands on a three-hour tour. \u201cYou\u2019ll get to see working lobstermen, you\u2019ll get to see seals,\u201d said Mavodones, who also happens to be a former Portland mayor. \u201cYou also can see cormorants, eagles and great blue herons.\u201d \u2018Innovation and entrepreneurship in the food scene\u2019 Like many US cities, Portland experienced a slump in the 1960s and \u201870s as residents moved to the suburbs and shopping malls drained some of the street life from downtown. It\u2019s since come roaring back, spurred by urban revitalization projects, tourism and the city\u2019s growing reputation as a foodie hotspot. Locals trace the city\u2019s dining renaissance to the 1996 opening of Fore Street, a farm-to-table pioneer which continues to serve elevated cuisine in a brick warehouse two blocks from the waterfront. Over the years the restaurant has won numerous accolades and its owners have since opened two upscale seafood restaurants \u2014 most recently Scales, in an airy, rustic space on a wharf with harbor views. The city\u2019s restaurant scene got another boost in 2012 when Eventide Oyster Co. opened to national acclaim. While Eventide\u2019s centerpiece is its popular raw bar, some locals say it makes the best lobster roll in the city. In 2018, Bon Appetit named Portland its restaurant city of the year. In recent years the city\u2019s dining offerings have expanded further beyond traditional seafood to include a wide range of ethnic cuisines. Walk down Washington Avenue in the Munjoy Hill neighborhood and you\u2019ll find eateries serving Salvadoran, Vietnamese and East African food. \u201cThe food scene here is made up of a lot of small, owner-operated businesses,\u201d said Rubin, owner of Bar Futo and the newly opened Mr. Tuna, which started several years ago as a sushi cart. Bar Futo\u2019s chef was a semifinalist this year for a James Beard Award. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young chefs here doing some really interesting stuff.\u201d Among them is Ben Wexler-Waite, a New Yorker who went to college in Maine and was inspired to open a Neapolitan pizza business in 2021 after spending time in Italy and working on an organic farm. Instead of a brick-and-mortar location, Wexler-Waite chose something different: an outdoor space on Peaks Island, a 20-minute ferry ride from downtown Portland. His seasonal operation \u2013 a wood-fired oven on wheels, a refrigerated pantry trailer and some picnic tables \u2013 sits on land he leases each summer from the local Lions Club. In tribute, his eatery is called Il Leone \u2013 \u201cthe lion\u201d in Italian. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to build a really special, wood-fired, island dining experience outdoors in a wooded grove just a few hundred feet from the ocean,\u201d he said. A stickler for authentic and fresh ingredients, Wexler-Waite imports flour and San Marzano tomatoes from Italy while sourcing his vegetables, herbs and other toppings from nearby Maine farms. His efforts have paid off \u2013 in 2022 the Portland Press Herald crowned Il Leone as the best pizza in Maine. \u201cThere\u2019s a unique emphasis among restaurants in Portland about sourcing the best possible ingredients we have here locally,\u201d said Wexler-Waite, who believes emerging chefs are increasingly giving Portland a shot \u2013 and taking culinary risks they might not take if they faced higher rents in bigger cities. \u201cWhen you compare opening a restaurant in Portland to a city like New York, the barrier to entry is lower, and I think that allows for more innovation and entrepreneurship in the food scene.\u201d Witness the city\u2019s showing at this month\u2019s James Beard Awards, where not one but two bakeries were honored: ZU Bakery, a tiny boulangerie whose owner Barak Olins turns out beloved artisanal loaves; and Norimoto Bakery, where Atsuko Fujimoto has won a devoted following for her chocolate sake cake, yuzu meringue pie and other pastries with a Japanese twist. That entrepreneurial spirit also extends to beermaking \u2013 a delicious irony, given Maine\u2019s leading role in the 19th century temperance movement. Portland has more than two dozen breweries \u2013 more per capita than any other city in the country, according to 2019 data. Stalwarts such as Allagash, nationally known for its Belgian styles, and Shipyard, whose Pumpkinhead Ale is a longtime favorite, now share space with a flock of newcomers such as Belleflower, a family-run, small-batch brewery with a broad palette of beers and an inviting taproom. Arts and the outdoors A visitor could spend a week happily eating and drinking their way across town. But Portland offers nourishment for the soul as well. For a small city it has a rich artistic tradition. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, the 19th century poet who famously penned \u201cPaul Revere\u2019s Ride,\u201d was born here. His childhood home, the oldest standing brick structure on the Portland peninsula, is now a museum. Maine\u2019s rugged coastline inspired Winslow Homer, the landscape artist who painted many of his best watercolors from a seaside studio in Prouts Neck, some 10 miles south of Portland. The studio is open for tours in the summer and early fall. Homer\u2019s works are on display at the Portland Museum of Art, whose broad collection also contains works by Claude Monet, Frederic Edwin Church and Andy Warhol. The museum anchors the city\u2019s Arts District, which includes galleries, performance spaces and an arts college. With its deep green forests and deep blue water views, greater Portland also is surrounded by restorative natural beauty. A popular nearby spot is the Fore River Sanctuary, an 85-acre preserve with freshwater and saltwater marshes, a host of aquatic bird life and Portland\u2019s only natural waterfall. But when it comes to scenery, it\u2019s hard to beat Maine\u2019s craggy coastline and its postcard views of lobster boats and lighthouses. Don\u2019t miss Portland Head Light, an iconic landmark and Maine\u2019s oldest lighthouse, which sits on a rocky point some 5 miles south of Portland. The lighthouse dates to 1791 and was commissioned by George Washington. Portland also makes a good base from which to explore the rest of southern coastal Maine, from the shops of Kennebunkport to the sprawling L.L. Bean flagship store in Freeport to the charming towns of Bath, Rockland and Camden further up Route 1. Wherever you wander, the ocean beckons.

Marlene Engelhorn, 32, has spent years criticizing the birth lottery by which she inherited tens of millions and does not have to give any of it to the state, and calling for change. In January, she said that a panel picked by a pollster as representative of the Austrian public would decide how to distribute the sum, without any intervention on her part. The list of 77 recipients was announced on Tuesday. \u201cA large part of my inherited wealth, which elevated me to a position of power simply by virtue of my birth, contradicting every democratic principle, has now been redistributed in accordance with democratic values,\u201d Engelhorn said in a statement. A spokesman said the 25 million euros was \u201cthe overwhelming bulk\u201d of her wealth, though she retains an undisclosed sum. The panel had examined \u201cabove all the question of the effects of our uneven distribution of wealth\u201d and debates on \u201cdemocracy and participation in it, tax justice and social inequality,\u201d she said. Engelhorn is a descendant of Friedrich Engelhorn, who founded German chemicals giant BASF in 1865. Her grandmother Gertraud Engelhorn-Vechiatto married his great-grandson. When Engelhorn-Vechiatto died in 2022, Marlene inherited a large sum. One of the objectives the 50-person panel, aged between 16 and 85, aimed to support was \u201ca fairer distribution of wealth, more transparency and reporting on that issue and better data on very large accumulations of wealth,\u201d one member of the panel, retail employee Elisabeth Klein, said in a statement. In support of that aim, two of the four donations of more than a million euros went to the Momentum Institute, a left-wing think-tank, and Attac Austria, which opposes neoliberal economic policy and \u201cderegulated financial markets.\u201d The donations ranged from 40,000 euros - for an initiative to support data-based reporting on climate change - to 1.6 million euros for the Austrian Nature Conservation Federation. Other issues covered included housing, integration, women\u2019s rights and fighting poverty. \u201cNow, it is up to the political actors to do justice to what this group representative of the Austrian population has embodied,\u201d Engelhorn said, calling for more debate on these issues.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/18/europe/austrian-heiress-wealth-climate-left-wing-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_middleeast_medics-pilgrimage-hajj-eyewitnesses-intl", "text": "There were not enough medics or basic facilities to protect Hajj pilgrims from the effects of the sweltering heat in Saudi Arabia last week, two pilgrims recently returned from Hajj told CNN, as the official death toll from this year\u2019s Hajj pilgrimage soared to almost 500. Witnesses said worshipers losing consciousness and walking past bodies covered in white cloth became a norm during the mass religious event. This years\u2019 Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca has been held amid extreme weather conditions which saw temperatures consistently soar above average figures. The exact death toll remains unclear and is expected to rise much further, as each country has been independently announcing the deaths of their nationals. Additionally, the governments are only aware of pilgrims who have registered and traveled to Mecca as part of their country\u2019s quota \u2013 more deaths are feared among unregistered pilgrims. Zirrar Ali, 40, who returned to London on Friday from his pilgrimage with his 70-year-old father, told CNN that authorities did not provide enough water, shade or medical support to Hajj pilgrims during the week he was there. \u201cTo me, it felt like there are too many people, there are not enough medics, so they are just waiting for the worst of the worst to happen and then they will step in,\u201d Ali said, adding that people passing out came to be a regularity. \u201cI couldn\u2019t focus on my Hajj when I saw these people suffering,\u201d he added. Ali\u2019s comments were echoed by another witness, 44-year-old Ahmad from Indonesia, who told CNN he saw many people falling ill and even dying from the heat. \u201cAlong the way home, I saw many pilgrims who died. Almost every few hundred meters, there was a body lying and covered with an ihrom [white fabric] cloth,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time there is a distribution of water from local residents or certain groups, it is immediately overrun by the pilgrims,\u201d he added, saying that he didn\u2019t see health workers or a single ambulance along the road. Both pilgrims lamented the poor infrastructure and organization of this year\u2019s pilgrimage, especially for those who travelled independently, outside of licensed tour groups. Saudi Arabia requires each pilgrim to acquire one of the 1.8 million available licenses to legally access Mecca. These licenses can cost several thousand US dollars. Unlicensed pilgrims typically don\u2019t travel in organized tour buses with air conditioning or easy access to water and food supplies. Despite the luxuries on offer to some, all pilgrims spend the bulk of their day walking outdoors in the scorching heat. According to Ali, five hours walking every day is the minimum, but many pilgrims spent 12 hours outside per day. For him, although the long walk is a fundamental part of the Hajj experience, he believes the Saudi government should have provided more assistance. \u201cTaking eight hours to get from A to B, that\u2019s part of being patient and that\u2019s considered hardship\u2026but at no point were we told \u2018if you don\u2019t have water for ten hours, that\u2019s considered part of Hajj\u2019 it\u2019s not considered to be part of Hajj, we should be giving comfort and taking care of ourselves,\u201d he said. The\u00a0daughter of an elderly\u00a0Indonesian man who died during Hajj told CNN her family was \u201chappy\u201d\u00a0he\u00a0was\u00a0buried\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0Islamic holy city of\u00a0Mecca\u00a0after\u00a0he\u00a0had waited for\u00a0years to go on the\u00a0pilgrimage. Speaking to CNN on Sunday,\u00a0Heru Jumartiyah said\u00a0her 86-year-old father Ngatijo Wongso Sentono registered for Hajj pilgrimage\u00a0in\u00a02018 and travelled to\u00a0Mecca\u00a0with his 83-year-old wife and neighbors from the\u00a0Indonesian city of Yogyakarta. \u201cMy father was very enthusiastic about going on the\u00a0Hajj.\u00a0He\u00a0wanted to leave immediately,\u201d she\u00a0told CNN. According to Islamic belief, to die and be\u00a0buried\u00a0in\u00a0Mecca\u00a0is considered to be a blessing, with many Muslims travelling\u00a0in\u00a0their old age after having saved for the\u00a0pilgrimage. CNN has reached out to Saudi authorities regarding the reportedly inadequate response to this year\u2019s heat and has yet to hear back. More than\u00a01.8 million people\u00a0took part in this year\u2019s Hajj, one of the world\u2019s largest religious gatherings, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. While deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year\u2019s gathering is being held amid particularly high temperatures. Hajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom. It occurs two months and 10 days after Ramadan ends, during the Islamic month of Dhul-Hijjah. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and shorter than the Gregorian calendar, the timing of Hajj on the Gregorian calendar shifts slightly each year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/middleeast/medics-pilgrimage-hajj-eyewitnesses-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_europe_dagestan-synagogue-attack-russia-intl-latam", "text": "Gunmen opened fire on places of worship in two cities of Russia\u2019s southernmost Dagestan province on Sunday, killing at least 15 police officers and four civilians, including an Orthodox priest, in what appeared to be a coordinated attack. Sergey Melikov, head of the Dagestan Republic, said at least six \u201cmilitants\u201d were also killed following the attacks on churches, synagogues and police posts in the cities of Derbent and the regional capital Makhachkala, which are about 120 kilometers (75 miles) apart. The attacks took place in the republic of Dagestan in the North Caucasus, a predominantly Muslim region on the Caspian Sea that has a history of separatist and militant violence. The turbulence in the region has been further fanned by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, where ethnic minorities have been disproportionately mobilized to fight. Video and photos showed large flames and plumes of smoke billowing heavily out of a synagogue in Derbent, while footage filmed from the window of a building in Makhachkala shows black-clad unidentified people shooting at a police car in a street. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks, which come three months after ISIS affiliate ISIS-K said it carried out an assault at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow that claimed more than 140 lives in one of Russia\u2019s deadliest terrorist atrocities in years. Russian law enforcement agencies told state-run news agency TASS on Sunday that the gunmen in Dagestan were \u201cadherents of an international terrorist organization.\u201d Russia\u2019s National Antiterrorist Committee (NAC) said Monday that \u201carmed militants attacked two Orthodox churches, two synagogues and police officers\u201d in the two cities. It added that the counter-terrorism operation in Makhachkala and Derbent had ended, TASS reported. Four civilians were killed in the attacks, Russia\u2019s investigative committee said on Monday, bringing the death toll up to 19. Dagestan head Melikov also said in a Telegram post early Monday that the active phase of the \u201coperational and combat measures in Makhachkala and Derbent\u201d was completed but further investigations would continue. Melikov described the possible involvement of \u201csleeper cells\u201d and suggested the attacks may have had foreign help. \u201cOperative-search and investigative measures will be carried out until all participants of the sleeper cells are identified, which, undoubtedly, include some that were organized from abroad,\u201d he added. Three days of\u00a0mourning\u00a0have been declared in Dagestan following the deadly shootings, with state flags lowered to half-staff, Melikov said. Financial assistance will also be given to families of the victims, according to TASS. Priest killed, synagogue set on fire Dagestan is home to a small Christian minority and even smaller Jewish population that appeared to be among the targets of Sunday\u2019s attacks. A priest killed during an attack on a church in Derbent was identified as Father Nikolay by Dagestan Public Monitoring Commission Chairman Shamil Khadulaev. \u201cThey slit his throat. He was 66 years old and very ill,\u201d Khadulaev said. Nighttime video, shared by the Republic of Dagestan\u2019s Ministry of Internal Affairs, showed at least a dozen law enforcement officers \u2014 who appear to be armed and wearing tactical gear \u2014 outside the gates of a cathedral in northwest Makhachkala. CNN has geolocated the video to the gates of the\u00a0Cathedral of the Assumption (Svyato-Uspenskiy Sobor), a Russian Orthodox cathedral in the city. Earlier Sunday, TASS reported that a security guard was killed in a shootout at the cathedral, and 19 people had locked themselves inside the premises during the attack. Those who had holed up there have since been evacuated to safety, TASS reported, citing the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Dagestan. Meanwhile, two synagogues in Dagestan \u2014 one in Derbent and one in Makhachkala \u2014 were also attacked, according to a statement from the Russian Jewish Congress (RJC). Forty minutes before evening prayer, gunmen stormed the synagogue in Derbent and \u201cset the building on fire using Molotov cocktails,\u201d while police and security guards were killed outside, the RJC said. Photos showed flames and plumes of smoke billowing out of a series of windows on at least one floor of the structure. Dagestan\u2019s small Jewish community is part of the Mountain Jews that historically lived for centuries in parts of Azerbaijan and what is now Russia\u2019s Caucasus,\u00a0according to Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the Derbent synagogue had \u201cburned to the ground\u201d and that local guards had been killed, while the synagogue in Makhachkala had been attacked by gunfire. \u201cAs far as is known, there were no worshipers in the synagogues at the time of the attack, and there are no known casualties from the Jewish community,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Security guards had been placed outside of local synagogues ever since an antisemitic mob stormed through the local airport in October in an attempt to block a passenger plane arriving from Tel Aviv. The clashes left at least 10 people injured and videos showed a crowd of people inside the Makhachkala Uytash Airport and on the runway, some waving the Palestinian flag, others forcing their way through closed doors in the international terminal. The airport attack came amid rising public anger in the region over Israel\u2019s bombardment and blockade of Gaza in response to Hamas\u2019 deadly October 7 attacks on Israel. Investigation underway after police killed An attack was also reported Sunday at a police traffic post in Makhachkala. One of the law enforcement officers killed was Mavludin Khidirnabiev, the head of the \u201cDagestan Lights\u201d police department, according to the Dagestan Ministry of Internal Affairs\u2019 Telegram channel. In an earlier Telegram post, Dagestan head Melikov said, \u201cunknown persons made attempts to destabilize the social situation. Dagestan police officers stood in their way. According to preliminary information, there are victims among them.\u201d The identities of the attackers was being established, he said. \u201cThe attacks, the encroachment on our brotherhood, on our multinational unity, on our confessional indivisibility, are an attempt to split our unity, thereby creating rifts between us,\u201d Melikov said later in a video address. The Investigative Directorate of the Investigative Committee of Russia for the Republic of Dagestan said it had launched a terror investigation into the attacks under the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. \u201cAll the circumstances of the incident and the persons involved in the terrorist attacks are being established, and their actions will be given a legal assessment,\u201d the agency said in a statement.

The State Duma Deputy from\u00a0Dagestan, Dmitry\u00a0Gadzhiyev, said he believes \u201cspecial services of Ukraine and NATO countries\u201d could be behind the attack. But Russian senator Dmitry Rogozin disputed the claim, saying in a Telegram post that writing off every terrorist attack as the \u201cmachinations of Ukraine and NATO\u201d would lead to \u201cbig problems\u201d for Russia.

{"id": "2024_06_24_asia_philippines-leila-de-lima-acquitted-intl-hnk", "text": "A Philippine court has dropped drugs charges against one of the most vocal critics of former President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s bloody \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d ending a long legal battle that had seen the former senator held for more than six years in police custody. Opposition figure Leila De Lima, who was released on bail last November after\u00a0she was acquitted of two counts, was cleared of a third and final charge on Monday, her lawyer told state broadcaster PTV. The charges stemmed from allegations by Duterte that De Lima had received payoffs from convicted drug gangs to fund her 2016 senatorial bid. More than 6,000 people were killed in\u00a0anti-drug operations\u00a0during Duterte\u2019s tenure as president from 2016 to 2022, according to police data. Many of the extrajudicial killings of suspected drug offenders took place in the poorest areas of the country \u2013 and independent monitors believe the number of those killed could be much higher. Human rights activists had long criticized De Lima\u2019s prosecution and lengthy detention, pointing out that she was held in a police cell despite not having been convicted of any charges. They say her treatment is emblematic of a deteriorating rights situation in a country where political activists and the media often face threats, harassment and even death for attempting to keep those in power in check. On Monday, supporters who gathered outside the courthouse in Muntinlupa city shouted, \u201cLeila is free,\u201d according to a livestreamed video posted on her official Facebook page. Speaking to reporters outside the court, De Lima said\u00a0Duterte would be held responsible for \u201csins committed\u201d against Filipinos. \u201cI\u2019m only one of the victims. Thousands of Filipinos were murdered during the bloody and fake \u2018drug war.\u2019 Many families lost loved ones,\u201d she said. \u201cFor those who weren\u2019t killed, they were left languishing in jail because of the incorrect and twisted enforcement of the law. I\u2019m one of those who have experienced unjust imprisonment.\u201d During his tenure as president, Duterte\u00a0repeatedly said the\u00a0killings\u00a0of\u00a0drug\u00a0suspects are lawful if police are acting in self defense. He had previously admitted to killing drug suspects\u00a0during his time as mayor of Davao City. In July last year, the International Criminal Court (ICC)\u00a0rejected an appeal by the Philippine government to block an investigation by prosecutors into Duterte\u2019s drug war. An ICC judge said the dismissal by the Hague-based court meant the Philippines has exhausted its options to appeal. Duterte\u2019s administration and its successor under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have pushed back against the ICC\u2019s probe, denouncing the investigations as unjust. The Philippines was formerly a signatory to the ICC but Duterte canceled the country\u2019s membership after the court began probing his drug war. But under the ICC\u2019s withdrawal mechanism, the court keeps jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period of a state \u2013 in this case, between 2016 and 2019, when the Philippines\u2019 pullout became official.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/asia/philippines-leila-de-lima-acquitted-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_asia_bangladesh-flooding-sylhet-climate-intl-hnk", "text": "Extensive flooding has stranded about 1.8 million people in northeast Bangladesh, following weeks of heavy rains that have submerged homes and devastated farmland, according to state media and humanitarian agencies. Video shows large swathes of Sylhet city\u00a0and the nearby town of Sunamganj underwater in the second wave of flooding to hit the region in less than a month, state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) reported Saturday. The widespread flooding was triggered by prolonged\u00a0torrential rain and water runoff from the hilly regions upstream on the border with India, which caused four rivers to swell beyond their danger marks, the Water Development Board said last week, according to local media. Villagers in the hardest-hit low-lying areas of Sylhet could be seen wading through chest-deep water and heaping their belongings into piles to protect them from the muddy waters. There is concern for those trapped by floodwaters who now face food shortages and\u00a0a lack of clean water, according to local media. About 964,000 people in Sylhet and 792,000 in Sunamganj had been affected by the flooding and authorities said they had set up more than 6,000 shelters to help the displaced, BSS reported. Among them are 772,000 children who were in urgent need of assistance, the United Nations\u2019 Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) said\u00a0Friday. More than 800 schools had been flooded with 500 more used as flood shelters, the agency said. \u201cAs waters rise, children are the most vulnerable, facing heightened risks of drowning, malnutrition, deadly waterborne diseases, the trauma of displacement, and potential abuse in overpopulated shelters,\u201d Sheldon Yett, UNICEF Representative to Bangladesh, said in a statement. International development organization BRAC said it was helping to deliver emergency food and health support to hundreds of families in Sylhet and Sunamganj. It said about 2.25 million people have been affected by the flash floods, which have left 12,000 people in the region without power. Khondoker Golam Tawhid, program head of BRAC\u2019s Disaster Risk Management Program said flooding in the country is \u201cbecoming more dangerous\u201d with \u201chuge losses to livelihoods, biodiversity and infrastructure \u2014 and interruption to schooling and health services.\u201d \u201cBangladesh is used to flooding, but climate change is making floods more intense and less predictable, making it impossible for families to stay safe, let alone plan ahead,\u201d Tawhid said. Meanwhile, fish farmers have faced significant losses as floodwaters wash away thousands of farms and ponds, with local media reporting an economic toll of over $11.4 million. Densely populated and low-lying Bangladesh is prone to seasonal rains, flooding and cyclones. But the South Asian country is one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable to the impacts of the human-caused climate crisis,\u00a0studies show. As extreme weather events become more frequent and severe as a result of the climate crisis, the humanitarian and economic impacts to Bangladesh will continue to deteriorate. By 2050, 13 million people in Bangladesh could become climate migrants and severe flooding could cause GDP to fall by as much as 9%, according to the World Bank. The latest bout of heavy rains and floods came as the region had barely recovered from widespread flooding in late May following Tropical Cyclone Remal, which lashed Bangladesh and southern India and impacted about 5 million people. \u201cFor many, this will change the course of their lives, leaving them without homes and schools and forcing them to move to temporary shelters for who knows how long,\u201d said Sultana Begum, Save the Children\u2019s regional humanitarian advocacy and policy manager for Asia, in a statement. \u201cEverything we are hearing points towards these kinds of extreme weather events getting worse and worse. And we have certainly not seen two bouts of severe flooding happen in such quick succession before. Make no mistake, the climate emergency is already making its mark on India and Bangladesh, and it is robbing children of their homes, families, food, water, and access to education and healthcare.\u201d Rohingya vulnerable Monsoon rains and landslides have also affected southern Bangladesh, where about a million people from the Rohingya Muslim community are living in the world\u2019s biggest refugee camps, having fled persecution and violence in neighboring Myanmar. At least 10 people, including three children, died from mudslides and heavy rainfall in the refugee camps near Cox\u2019s Bazar on Wednesday, according to Bangladesh\u2019s Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief. \u201cPeople have been evacuated from the low-lying areas and at least 500 people have been shifted to other relief centers,\u201d Hasan Sarwar, head of the refugee cell for the ministry told CNN last week. Many Rohingya refugees live in bamboo and tarpaulin shelters perched on hilly slopes that are vulnerable to strong winds, rain, and landslides. Save the Children said about 8,000 people in 33 camps have been impacted by the torrential downpours, which have destroyed or damaged more than 1,000 shelters. The humanitarian group noted that the monsoon season in Bangladesh has only just started and will last for the next two months, with the potential to bring more heavy rains, landslides and flooding. Landslides, heavy rains and flooding have also hit the neighboring Indian state of Assam, affecting more than 4 million people, according to Save the Children. At least 31 people have died in the floods and landslides since May 29 in the state, according to local police and disaster management authorities. Some immediate relief for northeast Bangladesh is in sight, however, as the rains\u00a0began to ease and there are signs that floodwaters were starting to recede, local media reported. The Bangladesh Water Development Board said Saturday that water levels of the major rivers in the northeast were falling and the trend could continue over the coming days if further rains hold off. \u201cOverall improvement of the flood situation in various low-lying areas under districts of the northeastern part of the country may continue in next 72 hours,\u201d it said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/asia/bangladesh-flooding-sylhet-climate-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_17_europe_uk-mi5-spy-agency-chinese-alert-partygate-intl-latam", "text": "A former opposition lawmaker in Britain\u2019s House of Commons has alleged that the UK\u2019s domestic spy agency MI5 may have issued a rare alert notice in 2022 about an alleged Chinese agent as a distraction from the so-called Partygate scandal, according to testimony before a tribunal looking into the alert. In the alert issued back in January 2022, MI5\u00a0alleged\u00a0Christine Ching Kui Lee had \u201cacted covertly in coordination\u201d on behalf of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party and was \u201cjudged to be involved in political interference activities in the UK.\u201d The alert was issued a day after former Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologized to the House of Commons for the Partygate scandal. Johnson\u2019s premiership came crashing down in 2022 after it emerged that numerous social gatherings took place on his watch \u2013 some of which he personally attended \u2013 at a time when Britons were living under strict rules due to Covid-19. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal in London heard on Monday that Barry Gardiner, former lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party to whom Lee donated over \u00a3500,000 (more than $600,000) between 2014 and 2020, said in a text that he had heard that the MI5 alert had been issued to \u201cdetract attention\u201d from Johnson\u2019s Partygate scandal, PA news agency reported. In a text forwarded to Lee by a friend, Gardiner said that \u201cmany people\u201d had told him \u201cthey believe the reason for putting out the story when they did was to detract attention from Boris\u2019 Partygate apology,\u201d according to PA\u2019s report. Gardiner did not specify exactly who these people making the suggestion were. Nor was any evidence provided to the tribunal Monday to back the allegations. The hearing will continue on Tuesday. CNN reached out to Gardiner\u2019s office but did not receive an immediate response. \u201cI had never believed that the Security Services would be overtly party political in that way [\u2026] What has also been suggested to me is that the Security Services may have wished to \u2018pick a fight\u2019 or to \u2018detract attention\u2019 from something else and that we were simply collateral damage,\u201d read a portion of a text from Gardiner that Lee\u2019s lawyer read out to the hearing, according to PA. CNN has also reached out to the UK\u2019s Home Office and Boris Johnson\u2019s office for comment. The MI5 alert in question\u00a0also alleged that Lee had been facilitating \u201cfinancial donations to political parties, Parliamentarians, aspiring Parliamentarians and individuals seeking political office in the UK, including facilitating donations to political entities on behalf of foreign nationals.\u201d \u201cMs Lee denies the allegations and is taking legal action against the Security Service with her son, Daniel Wilkes, who lost his job with Mr Gardiner following the alert, arguing that issuing the alert was unlawful and interfered with their human rights,\u201d PA reported. Gardiner served as a Labour MP between 1997 and 2024. He was the chairman of the now-disbanded Chinese in Britain All-Party Parliamentary Group, on which Lee sat. It was not illegal for Lee to make the donations as the UK did not have a foreign agents registration act at the time, nor was it illegal for a British citizen or foreign national working in the UK to be affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Lee is listed as a British national in the UK\u2019s corporate registry. The UK has since introduced a foreign agents registration act, which is expected to come into force later this year. In a statement to CNN in 2022, Gardiner said he had not benefited personally from Lee\u2019s donations in any way, adding that the money had been properly reported and its source verified.

More than 1,300 people died on this year\u2019s Hajj with \u201cnumerous cases\u201d due to heat stress, according to Saudi Arabian authorities, after more than 1.8 million pilgrims took part despite temperatures soaring to dangerous levels. Authorities in Indonesia, the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority country, said at least 215 Indonesians are among the dead. Speaking to CNN on Sunday,\u00a0Heru Jumartiyah said\u00a0her 86-year-old father, Ngatijo Wongso Sentono, died on June 17\u00a0in his tent in\u00a0Mina, southeast of Mecca, as he waited for midday prayers. \u201cHe was asleep and had no symptoms of sickness before. Everyone said he was healthy during the\u00a0Hajj\u00a0procession,\u201d she said. Sentono had registered for the Hajj in\u00a02018 and traveled to\u00a0Mecca\u00a0with his 83-year-old wife and neighbors from the\u00a0Indonesian city of Yogyakarta, Jumartiyah said. \u201cMy father was very enthusiastic about going on the\u00a0Hajj.\u00a0He\u00a0wanted to leave immediately,\u201d she\u00a0said. Performing Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life. According to Islamic belief, to die and be\u00a0buried\u00a0in\u00a0Mecca\u00a0is considered to be a blessing, with many Muslims traveling\u00a0in\u00a0their old age after having saved for many years to make the\u00a0pilgrimage. \u201cWe are happy that he was buried in Mecca,\u201d Jumartiyah said, adding that she hoped to visit her father\u2019s grave when she eventually makes the pilgrimage. Jumartiyah said her mother, Pariyem Prawirodinomo, is\u00a0healthy and due to return to Indonesia on July 7. Some 241,000 Indonesian pilgrims were scheduled to make the journey to Mecca this year, according to Indonesian officials \u2013 the country\u2019s largest ever quota. According to data from the\u00a0Indonesian\u00a0Ministry of Religious Affairs, most of the Indonesians who died on the pilgrimage this year were over age 50. It is not uncommon for Indonesia to register hundreds of deaths during each year\u2019s Hajj \u2013 last year, 773 people died during the pilgrimage, according to records from the ministry. \u2018I saw many pilgrims who died\u2019 Extreme heat has been named as a main factor behind the hundreds of deaths and injuries reported this year during the Hajj. Mecca, the holy city that is central for Hajj pilgrims, saw temperatures soar to a record 125 degrees Fahrenheit (51 Celsius) on Monday. Various authorities have also said the problems have been compounded by the number of unofficial pilgrimages, with the Saudi government saying Sunday that \u201cunauthorized\u201d trips accounted for more than four out of five of the fatalities. Saudi Arabia requires each pilgrim to acquire one of the 1.8 million available licenses to legally access Mecca. These licenses can cost several thousand US dollars. Unlicensed pilgrims typically don\u2019t travel in organized tour buses with air conditioning or easy access to water and food supplies. As part of the pilgrimage, the faithful perform a series of rituals in and around the holy city of Mecca, often involving many hours of walking in the scorching heat every day. Some pilgrims have lamented the poor infrastructure and organization of this year\u2019s Hajj. Even pilgrims on official tours spend the bulk of their day walking outdoors in the heat. Some\u00a0witnesses have told CNN\u00a0of how they saw worshipers losing consciousness and walked past bodies covered in white cloth. A 44-year-old Indonesian man who only wished to be referred to as Ahmad, recalled seeing many dying from the heat. \u201cAlong the way home, I saw many pilgrims who died. Almost every few hundred meters, there was a body lying and covered with an ihrom (white fabric) cloth.\u201d \u201cEvery time there is a distribution of water from local residents or certain groups, it is immediately overrun by the pilgrims,\u201d he added, saying that he didn\u2019t see health workers or a single ambulance along the road. In recent decades, the sheer size of Hajj crowds has been a factor in a number of deadly incidents during the pilgrimage, including a stampede that killed hundreds of people in 2015. However, experts have warned that rising temperatures pose the deadliest threat to pilgrims as heat records tumble in the Middle East \u2013 one of the most vulnerable regions to the climate crisis \u2013 making mass gatherings riskier. Climatologist and weather historian Maximiliano Herrera, who tracks extreme temperatures, told CNN that deserts in the region were \u201cwarming at night much faster than during the daytime,\u201d which was supposed to provide a break and relief from the heat. \u201cThis didn\u2019t exist until a couple of decades ago,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cEverybody is affected by deadly heat and sadly I am not surprised by (the Hajj) death toll,\u201d he added. \u201cSpending time outdoors in the extreme Mecca heat is risking death \u2026 so I am afraid there will be more deadly Hajj pilgrimages in the future.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/asia/indonesia-hajj-heatwave-burial-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "world_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-arrests", "text": "Turks and Caicos is revising part of its firearms law that recently caused legal trouble for several Americans carrying ammunition into the British Overseas Territory, House of Assembly member Edwin Astwood said in a statement\u00a0Friday. The revision comes weeks after a bipartisan US congressional delegation traveled to the islands asking for charges to be dropped for five Americans whom they said \u201cinadvertently\u201d had ammunition in their luggage. It is a crime to bring firearms or ammunition into the territory without prior permission from police. The amendment passed by the House of Assembly on June 14 clarifies that in sentencing for firearms-related offenses, courts have the discretion to impose either a fine, a custodial sentence, or a mixture of both in exceptional circumstances, the statement read. Previously, the law mandated courts to impose both a fine and a prison sentence of 12 years, although it allowed reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d \u201cThe amendment was introduced to address concerns about the rigidity of the previous sentencing framework, which mandated both imprisonment and financial penalties for all firearms offenses, regardless of the specific context or severity. This often resulted in disproportionately harsh sentences that did not always fit the nature of the crime or the circumstances of the offender,\u201d Astwood said. The mandatory minimum has not changed from 12 years, according to Sheena C. Mair, a lawyer for Sharitta Shinese Grier, an American awaiting trial.\u00a0The only change is if the court finds exceptional circumstances allowing the departure from the mandatory minimum of 12 years, they can impose a custodial sentence or a fine or both. Bryan Hagerich, one of the five Americans\u00a0arrested\u00a0for carrying ammunition, is\u00a0back\u00a0in the\u00a0United States\u00a0after receiving a suspended 52-week sentence and a $6,700 fine.\u00a0Hagerich\u00a0was allowed to leave the\u00a0territory\u00a0and return to the US once he paid the fine, his attorney Oliver Smith said. Tyler Wenrich\u00a0previously pleaded guilty to similar charges and\u00a0was sentenced to time served\u00a0and issued a $9,000 fine, according to court records. Ryan\u00a0Tyler\u00a0Watson, another American awaiting his fate after being charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition,\u00a0is expected to be sentenced Friday, a little\u00a0under a month\u00a0after he pleaded guilty. Michael Lee Evans, a Texan in his 70s, who pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9mm rounds of ammunition,\u00a0was scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday \u2013 though it is unclear based on court records if the sentencing happened. CNN has reached out to his attorney for more information. Grier, a Florida mother, said she had no idea that two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. She was released on bail but can\u2019t leave the island until her case concludes and must report to a local police station weekly,\u00a0WFTV\u00a0reported.

{"id": "2024_06_21_style_gen-z-bridal-fashion-trends-bof", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Just an hour after getting engaged in Venice, Italy last year, Christyne de Quesada began scouring the internet for white dresses to wear to her many upcoming wedding-related events: An engagement party, a bachelorette weekend, a civil ceremony at a courthouse and a bigger celebration in Mexico City. But the Miami-based human resources manager had a hard time finding good quality, under $1,000 ensembles that reflected her personality. \u201cIt actually drove me a bit crazy,\u201d de Quesada said. \u201cI bought about seven things and returned all of them.\u201d Instead, she decided to look beyond classic bridal wear brands and retailers. She eventually settled on an ivory two-piece set by Shanghai-based label ShuShu Tong, which she bought from the e-tailer Ssense, for her civil ceremony, a Vera Wang gown she describes as \u201ctraditional and very princess-like\u201d for her Mexico City wedding ceremony and a bespoke ivory skirt and corset set by Florida-based bridal designer Gabriella Arango, complete with Gucci shoes, for the reception. Millennial and Gen-Z brides-to-be like de Quesada are no longer shopping for just a wedding dress, but an entire wardrobe for pre- and post-wedding events. That breadth is propelling the global bridal wear market, which is projected to grow at a rate of 3.5 percent annually and is expected to reach $83.5 billion by 2030, according to the Global Bridal Wear Market Industry report. But it\u2019s not companies like David\u2019s Bridal (which filed for bankruptcy and sold to Cion Investment Corp last year) that are benefitting. In order to find less cookie-cutter ensembles that are more reflective of their personal style, this new generation of brides are shopping outside the traditional bridal market. \u201cThe bridal industry is very much like an old boys club. They live by \u2018If it\u2019s not broken, don\u2019t fix it\u2019 and are very comfortable with the limited options that they\u2019ve given you,\u201d said Caroline Crawford Patterson, a bridal stylist and designer. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realize is that the consumer is different and there\u2019s a big opportunity to shake things up.\u201d New opportunities in the bridal market After the industry was brought largely to a halt in 2020, weddings returned to pre-pandemic levels last year, with couples hosting over 2 million parties\u00a0, according to The Wedding Report. But the post-pandemic bridal wear landscape is remarkably different. Historically, brides have been limited to independent boutiques, department stores and chains like David\u2019s Bridal. Now, though, brides-to-be are open to wearing any white dress and are casting a wider net. It\u2019s an evolution of a space that was stagnant for a long time. \u201cSalons could get away with offering dresses that weren\u2019t chic or suited the fashion-forward bride or weren\u2019t size inclusive and the consumer, who is already spending a lot of money, just had to bear it,\u201d said Crawford Patterson, who got married in 2021. Anthropologie was one of the first non-bridal retailers to enter the space with the launch of its Bhldn line in 2011. (It\u2019s now called Anthropologie Weddings.) Today, Reformation, Abercrombie & Fitch and Revolve all offer wedding edits on their websites, as does The RealReal. Even fast fashion brands like ASOS, Forever 21, Lulus and Shein are increasing the number of bridal styles they carry. It\u2019s not just mass retail taking advantage. New York-based designer Jackson Wiederhoeft launched a made-to-order bridal segment in 2020 and now spends up to a year and a half developing wedding dresses for clients including initial appointments, fittings, alterations and advising. Despite the investment in time and resources, Wiederhoeft says the effort is \u201cworth it,\u201d as they get to develop an intimate relationship with consumers. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a dress for many people, it is the dress,\u201d said Wiederhoeft. For an emerging designer like Wiederhoeft, bridal is something of a safety net, serving as \u201ca floating line of credit\u201d for the rest of their business. With bridal, Wiederhoeft is able to collect 100 percent of the garment\u2019s cost upfront and directly from the client in order to pay for production, material and overhead costs. A Wiederhoeft wedding dress can cost between $3,000 and $25,000 for ready-to-wear bridal garments; pricing for custom dresses starts at $25,000. And unlike ready-to-wear, the brand\u2019s bridal segment is not subject to discounting. \u201cSome of the garments I made in my apartment four years ago are still in our showroom. I still use them as sale samples, and the styles are quite evergreen,\u201d they said. \u201cWhereas ready-to-wear has the shelf life of an avocado.\u201d What today\u2019s brides want \u2014 and don\u2019t As younger Millennials and Gen-Zers, the oldest of whom turn 27 this year, approach the altar, their ceremonies can differ greatly from previous generations, including their parents. (According to the US Census Bureau, the average American woman is 28.6 years old when they get married and the average American man is 30.5 years old.) Young people today are more likely to support same-sex and interracial marriage, enter into non-traditional relationships such as polyamory, and are more likely to forgo marriage entirely in favor of cohabiting with a partner long-term, according to research from Pew Research Center. \u201cSome of my clients are trying to push against the grain of conventional weddings and are focused on spending money on a house,\u201d said Hillary Taymour, founder and creative director of Collina Strada, who said her clients are looking to splurge on pieces that can be re-worn. Taymour said that today\u2019s brides believe \u201canything can be a wedding outfit.\u201d Her clients are opting for colorful designs and unconventional jewelry, including the brand\u2019s frog ring, which typically retails for $80, that couples have commissioned as engagement or wedding bands to mark the occasion. Catering to a broader spectrum of bridal wear can be beneficial even for a business with a historic focus in the sector, said Andrew Kwon, founder and creative director of his namesake label. He launched an eveningwear line alongside bridal in 2022. \u201cOne of the main challenges with bridal is the lack of repeat clients,\u201d said Kwon. \u201cTapping into eveningwear and colored dress has allowed me to bring in non-traditional brides, their bridesmaids and even their mothers into the fold.\u201d Retailers hoping to capture this new, forward-thinking bridal consumer are updating their assortment to reflect changing attitudes towards weddings. Last month, e-commerce retailer Ssense launched its second \u201canti-bridal\u201d capsule collection which featured unorthodox gowns, flower girl dresses and accessories. \u201cWe speak to an audience that\u2019s very open-minded and fluid,\u201d said Brigitte Chartrand, vice president of womenswear buying and the Everything Else segment at Ssense. \u201cThe products we commissioned didn\u2019t feel necessarily classic \u2026 it brings that differentiation of what bridal could be.\u201d This article was originally published by\u00a0The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN Style.

{"id": "2024_06_21_middleeast_hajj-deaths-mecca-extreme-heat-intl-latam", "text": "The official death toll from this year\u2019s Hajj pilgrimage has soared to almost 500 and the true toll could be more than double that as reports emerged that as many as 600 Egyptian worshipers perished on the route to Mecca amid extreme heat. At least 14 Malaysians, 165 Indonesians, 75 Jordanians, 35 Pakistanis, 49 Tunisians, 11 Iranians and 98 Indians have died, according to authorities in each country. A further 27 Jordanians are hospitalized and around 14 are still missing, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said. The US State Department said multiple US citizens died during the Hajj pilgrimage but did not provide a number. \u201cWe can confirm the deaths of multiple U.S. citizens in Saudi Arabia.\u00a0We offer our sincerest condolences to the families on their loss,\u201d the State Department spokesperson said, adding that the agency stands ready to provide consular assistance. Dozens of Iranians have also been hospitalized due to heatstroke and other conditions, the Iranian Red Crescent said Wednesday, according to Iran\u2019s semi-official Tasnim news agency. According to a CNN tally, this brings the latest official death toll for this year\u2019s pilgrimage to at least 480. The death tolls are expected to rise much further, as Saudi Arabia and Egypt have yet to release official figures. Additionally, the governments are only aware of pilgrims who have registered and traveled to Mecca as part of their country\u2019s quota \u2013 more deaths are feared among unregistered pilgrims. The pilgrims made this year\u2019s journey in dangerously high temperatures of up to 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit). According to the Egyptian presidency, the crisis unit will be headed by Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly,\u00a0and will \u201cprovide support for families of the deceased.\u201d Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has also instructed the unit on \u201cspeedy coordination with Saudi Arabian authorities to facilitate the return of the bodies\u201d of those who died, the statement added. The official number of dead Egyptians stands at 28, according to an Egyptian cabinet statement Thursday. However, it is being widely reported by Reuters news agency and other outlets that as many as 500 to 600 Egyptians perished on the route. Egyptian officials said they were working to gather an accurate tally of victims and missing persons.\u00a0The discrepancy stems from vast numbers of unregistered pilgrims who are not accounted for among those who have registered and traveled to Mecca as part of their country\u2019s quota. Thousands more have been treated for heatstroke after an estimated crowd of 1.8 million Muslims contended with the high temperatures. The Saudi Ministry of Health implemented safety measures including cooling stations along the official route, and urged pilgrims to use umbrellas and stay hydrated, The Associated Press reported. Despite this, this year\u2019s event was overshadowed by tragedy, raising questions over whether more could have been done to ensure people\u2019s safety. It also highlights the dangers posed for the many unregistered worshipers who want to fulfil their religious duty despite not obtaining a Hajj permit, and who don\u2019t have access to the official facilities. Of the dozens of Jordanians who died of heatstroke while performing Hajj rituals, at least 68 pilgrims have been granted burial permits to be laid to rest in Mecca on the wishes of their families, the Head of the Jordanian Directorate of Operations and Consular Affairs, Sufian Qudah, said. Malaysia\u2019s Minister for Religious affairs, Dr Mohd Na\u2019im Mokhtar, said most of its pilgrims died from \u201cheart disease, pneumonia and blood infection,\u201d according to state-run Bernama News Agency. The\u00a0Bernama\u00a0report did not specify if the dead were members of the country\u2019s official\u00a0Hajj\u00a0delegation. A spokesperson for India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs announced the death of the 98 Indian nationals on Friday, saying: \u201cThese deaths have happened on account of natural illness, natural causes, chronic illness, also old age.\u201d On Saturday, the day when Muslims gather at Mount\u00a0Arafat and where the Prophet Mohammed is believed to have delivered his last sermon, six Indian nationals died amid extreme heat and another four died due to \u201caccidents,\u201d the spokesperson said, without giving further details. The fallout from the deaths saw Tunisia\u2019s President Kais Saied fire the country\u2019s minister of religious affairs. Prior to his dismissal, Ibrahim Chaibi had acknowledged the possibility\u00a0of\u00a0negligence in the care\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0pilgrims. \u201cThe negligence may have occurred. It will be present, and we will evaluate it at the ministry level, and whoever fails will be punished,\u201d Chaibi said Friday. The Saudi government said on Monday that more than 2,700 people had been treated for heatstroke. Meanwhile, hundreds of people have taken to social media to post about their loved ones being unaccounted for. More than\u00a01.8 million people\u00a0are taking part in this year\u2019s Hajj, one of the world\u2019s largest religious gatherings, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. While deaths among pilgrims are not uncommon (there were more than 200 last year), this year\u2019s gathering is being held amid particularly high temperatures. Hajj season changes every year according to the Islamic calendar and this year it fell in June, one of the hottest months in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia advised pilgrims against performing the \u201cstoning of the devil\u201d ritual between certain hours after temperatures reached an extreme 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit). Hajj officials asked pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated amid the harsh conditions while the Saudi army deployed more than 1,600 personnel with medical units specifically for heatstroke and 30 rapid response teams. Another 5,000 health and first aid volunteers took part. Performing Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which requires every Muslim who is physically and financially able to make the journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in his or her life. The pilgrimage includes numerous detailed rituals including wearing a special garment that symbolizes human equality and unity before God, a circular, counter-clockwise procession around the cube-shaped Kaaba building, and the symbolic stoning of evil. A source of prestige and revenue The Hajj is a source of prestige for Saudi Arabia\u2019s king, who holds the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques as the guardian of Islam\u2019s holiest sites. But the pilgrimage is also a significant source of revenue for the Saudi economy. Soon after\u00a0King Salman bin Abdulaziz\u00a0took power in 2015, Saudi Arabia launched a\u00a0$21 billion project\u00a0to expand the Grand Mosque in Mecca to accommodate 300,000 additional worshippers. A year later, then Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman identified the pilgrimage as a key component of a plan to\u00a0diversify the Saudi economy\u00a0by 2030. Experts say that with oil sales generating close to a billion dollars a day for the kingdom, the pilgrimage\u2019s economic benefit is marginal by comparison. But its great, untapped potential could bring significant riches to the kingdom in the long term. Pilgrimage revenues were forecast to average about\u00a0$30 billion a year\u00a0and create 100,000 jobs for Saudis when the kingdom attracted around 21 million worshippers annually during the 10-day Hajj as well as the yearlong Umrah pilgrimage, according to official data cited by Reuters. The government is targeting 30 million pilgrims by 2030. This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_06_22_europe_balkan-states-heat-power-outage-minister-intl", "text": "A major power outage hit Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania and most of Croatia\u2019s coast on Friday, disrupting businesses, shutting down traffic lights and leaving people sweltering without air conditioning in the middle of a heatwave. Montenegro\u2019s energy minister said the shutdown was caused by a sudden increase in power consumption brought on by\u00a0high temperatures, and by the heat itself overloading systems. Power distribution is linked across the Balkans for transfers and trading. \u201cThis was just waiting to happen in this heat,\u201d Gentiana, a 24-year-old student in Montenegro\u2019s capital Podgorica, told Reuters. Temperatures hit 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) across the southeastern European region. Electricity and wifi networks went down from around 1 p.m. (1100 GMT), officials and social media users said. Suppliers in the four countries said they started restoring supply by mid-afternoon and power was largely back by the evening. At the start of the blackout, traffic light failures caused gridlock in Bosnia\u2019s capital Sarajevo and the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar, Reuters reporters said. Many lost water in Podgorica as pumps stopped working, locals reported. Air conditioners shut down and ice cream melted in tourist shops. Cars also ground to a halt in the Croatian coastal city of Split, state TV HRT reported. Ambulance sirens rang out across the city, it added. \u201cThe failure occurred as a result of a heavy load on the network, a sudden increase in power consumption due to high temperature and the high temperatures themselves,\u201d Montenegro\u2019s energy minister, Sasa Mujovic, said in a TV broadcast. Experts were still trying to identify where the malfunction originated, he added. Risk remains Montenegro\u2019s Vijesti TV said a fire had been spotted in a 400KW transmission line in a rugged area along the border with Bosnia - though it was not immediately clear if this could have been the cause of outages or in some way related to them. The report cited unnamed sources from the electric transmission company CGES which, it said, would need helicopters to access the site. Albanian Energy Minister Belinda Balluku said there had been a breakdown in an interconnector between Albania and Greece and he had heard there had been similar circumstances in Montenegro and parts of Croatia and Bosnia. A full investigation would take time, but early analysis suggested that \u201cbig volumes of power in the transmission system at the moment and very high temperatures in record levels have created this technical problem,\u201d Balluku added in a video address. Power in Albania was restored within half an hour, but the country remained at a high risk of further shutdowns as power usage and heat levels were still high, he said. Shifts in the region\u2019s energy supplies have put strains on its transmission systems,\u00a0industry officials say. Western Balkan nations have seen a boom in solar energy investment, meant to ease a power crisis that had threatened a shift away from coal. But the infrastructure is not prepared for new energy feeds, the president of North Macedonia\u2019s Energy Regulatory Commission and other industry figures told Reuters in April last year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/europe/balkan-states-heat-power-outage-minister-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_europe_ukraine-russia-power-blackouts-spring-intl", "text": "Kateryna Serzhan says the only way to survive Ukraine\u2019s almost daily blackout schedule is to \u201calways have a plan B.\u201d The 35-year-old\u00a0has had to adapt to life in her high-rise Kyiv apartment block with her active 3-year-old daughter, Varia. Going out to play involves hiking back up 15 flights of stairs carrying her now 17 kg (37 lb) child. They tend to take a ball instead of a bicycle for those days, she jokes. Without power, there\u2019s no water, so she has to schedule her child\u2019s baths around the blackouts. But sometimes they occur outside of the scheduled times. Keen to provide hot meals each day to a toddler who doesn\u2019t always eat them, she now has a gas camping stove in her kitchen, and a small battery to power the microwave. Serzhan\u2019s resilience masks a deepening crisis in Ukraine. These are not the first rolling blackouts since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, but they are the first to happen in the spring and early summer \u2013 traditionally the months with lowest electricity demand before air-conditioning season kicks in \u2013 underscoring the scale of the supply problem. In the early hours of Thursday morning, Ukraine endured the seventh massive Russian attack on its energy facilities since March 22 this year. Ukrenergo, the state-owned grid operator, reported damage in four regions. Seven energy workers were injured, and previously scheduled power outages extended. On Saturday, \u201cmassive\u201d Russian missile attacks hit several Ukrainian energy facilities, leaving thousands without power, officials said. In the Zaporizhzhia region, two power engineers were injured and the energy facility was damaged overnight, according to Ivan Fedorov, the head of Zaporizhzhia\u2019s regional military administration. Ukraine\u2019s energy grid has been firmly in the crosshairs of Russian missiles since the war began but this year Moscow began specifically targeting power generation facilities \u2013 thermal power plants, hydroelectric power stations, even energy storage facilities \u2013 a marked shift in tactics from the previous winter, when the attacks were less precise, and the damage easier to repair. Experts say Russia has been using better weaponry and taking advantage of thin Ukrainian air defenses. At Ukraine\u2019s reconstruction conference in Berlin in mid-June, President Volodymyr Zelensky laid out the scale of the destruction from the first six attacks. \u201cRussian missile and drone strikes have already destroyed 9 GW of capacity, while the peak energy consumption in Ukraine last winter was 18 GW. So, half of it does not exist anymore,\u201d he said. Officials and energy executives are now acknowledging there is no way to avoid blackouts this winter. The mission now is simply to minimize them. \u201cIf we don\u2019t restore the existing the damaged plants, if we don\u2019t improve the interconnector capacity for input, if we don\u2019t build these distributed generators, at least in some places\u2026 then people will have power for less than four hours per day,\u201d says Dmytro Sakharuk, executive director of DTEK, Ukraine\u2019s largest private energy company. \u201cWe have 120 days left before the start of the heating season,\u201d he warns. \u201cIt cannot be business as usual.\u201d Ukraine is trying to tackle the problem in a variety of ways.\u00a0As well as rebuilding what they can, in some cases using parts from decommissioned power plants in Europe, officials and energy companies are trying to secure as many generators and gas turbines as possible to support critical infrastructure through the winter, and are working with European partners to increase imports of electricity. Before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine was a net exporter of electricity, and had even been able to resume some exports during wartime.\u00a0That stopped in March. \u201cWe are doing our best,\u201d Deputy Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk told CNN. \u201cWe understand that without energy it will be very difficult to survive.\u201d When supply-side efforts fall short, all that\u2019s left is to reduce demand. And that means asking for even more sacrifice from the already blackout-weary Ukrainian people. \u201cWe asked our people\u2026 to be ready to understand the situation, to support Ukraine, to support our energy workers,\u201d says Grynchuk. \u201cWe call it the second front line, energy.\u201d At the end of April, a few weeks after a Russian attack destroyed the Kyiv region\u2019s biggest power plant, Andrii Buzovskyi, a 52-year-old Kyiv police officer, spent about $1,400 on two solar panels for his balcony. \u201cI installed them so that my family would not feel uncomfortable when there is no electricity,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWhat will happen next is unknown.\u201d The government would like to see more of this. Ukraine\u2019s Prime Minister Denis Shmyhal just announced new grants to help housing cooperatives invest in solar panels and heat pumps. Ukraine\u2019s central bank is also working to make loans for households and businesses to buy energy-related equipment more affordable. In her Kyiv high-rise, Serzhan is pursuing a different kind of energy independence. She is so worried about braving freezing temperatures in her apartment this winter, she\u2019s looking to rent a small house outside Kyiv with a wood-burning stove. \u201cIt\u2019s like the 19th century,\u201d she admits. Companies are doing their part. Ukrainian Railways has revised the schedule for 74 suburban trains (about 7% of the total), temporarily suspending some services.\u00a0The company told CNN it\u2019s also halted the use of air conditioning in administrative buildings, and turned off outdoor lighting. The chief executive of supermarket chain Auchan Ukraine, Marta Trush, told CNN that while all its stores are already equipped with generators, it has modernized its refrigerators to save energy and reduced its range of products with short sell-by dates.\u00a0Some of that has the added incentive of mitigating soaring costs. \u201cThe operation of the entire network on diesel generators is about three times more expensive than from the central power grid,\u201d said Trush. \u201cSo, to save electricity in the sales areas, we reduce lighting and temporarily restrict access to refrigerators, but we see how customers are understanding of the forced measures.\u201d Power outages have a clear inflationary effect, said Igor Piddubnyi, a researcher at the Kyiv School of Economics. \u201cCompanies have to have to somehow get back-up power supply and they are\u2026 buying the diesel generators, solar panels, etcetera\u2026and it increases the cost of production,\u201d he told CNN. Ukraine\u2019s inability to export electricity also upsets its balance of trade, he says, which feeds into inflation. The National Bank of Ukraine estimated in May that economic growth will slow to 3% this year, from 5.3% in 2023, mostly because of the damage to the energy sector. Inflation is expected to rise slightly to 8.2%. And while Russia is experiencing a wartime uplift for its labor force, with unemployment at record lows, Piddubnyi said evidence shows power outages are forcing Ukrainian companies to lay off workers. The central bank still expects unemployment to fall this year, but only to 14% from the current level of 15%. It is painful situation, said Piddubnyi. \u201cUkraine really loses a lot, but also the problem is that Russia is still gathering huge profits from exporting oil and gas.\u201d The Kyiv School of Economics estimated last month that rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s damaged energy infrastructure would cost $50.5 billion, factoring in new measures to improve its resilience against further attacks. That\u2019s the equivalent of the entire hard-won loan backed by the profits of frozen Russia assets Ukraine was recently promised, but it may not see that money for months.\u00a0 The G7, having already spent $3bn to date to support Ukraine\u2019s energy sector, just announced another $1bn in funding in early June. And Piddubnyi points out that calculating the true cost of rebuilding, while attacks continue, is impossible. \u201cThere is a clear uncertainty of how many more power plants will be destroyed by Russians,\u201d he said. Ukraine\u2019s energy ministry says it has been building concrete shelters to protect some energy equipment from attacks. But more advanced air defense systems are the only way to protect entire power plants and prevent the reconstruction bill from spiraling higher. In the wake of Thursday\u2019s attack, Kyiv\u2019s intensive lobbying efforts finally looked to be paying off. Romania agreed, after months of deliberation, to send a Patriot air defense system to Ukraine.\u00a0And a senior White House official told CNN that Ukraine was being given top priority for US shipments of advanced air defense capabilities, ahead of some other countries.\u00a0Those deliveries should start this summer. Sakharuk, who spoke to CNN before the seventh wave of strikes on energy facilities on June 20, said he would like to see deliveries of air defense munitions specifically to protect energy facilities. He admits keeping up morale among employees is a major challenge.\u00a0\u201cThey see that they are in a type of cycle where they repair an energy facility and Russia finds out that it\u2019s being repaired, and (it is) again destroyed.\u201d \u201cIn some cases, the workers did this three to four times already.\u201d CNN\u2019s Clare Sebastian wrote and reported from London, and Olga Voitovych reported from Kyiv.

Or if you\u2019re Amy Yang, try 75 times to win your first major \u2013 ending an almost two-decades wait \u2013 after the South Korean golfer survived a late scare to win the Women\u2019s PGA Championship in Washington on Sunday. Seven shots clear with just three holes to play at Sahalee Country Club, alarm bells rang when Yang bogeyed and double bogeyed the subsequent two holes, but the 34-year-old righted the ship with a closing par to finish three stokes clear of compatriot Ko Jin-young and American Lilia Vu at seven-under par overall. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d Yang, who carded a final round even-par 72, told reporters. \u201cI was so nervous at the beginning of the day, even the night before. \u201cI told Jan [Meierling, caddie] on the 18th fairway, this has been the longest 18 holes I\u2019ve ever played in my career.\u201d Despite five wins on the LPGA Tour, victory on the biggest stage had eluded Yang for 18 years. In 74 prior major starts, she had finished inside the top-10 on 21 outings, and twice as a runner-up at the US Women\u2019s Open in 2012 and 2015. With 17 of those top-10 finishes coming between 2009 and 2017, Yang\u2019s best window of opportunity looked to have passed, yet the world No. 25 mastered a star-studded field and a demanding course to become the LPGA Tour\u2019s oldest major winner since Angela Stanford claimed the 2018 Evian Championship at 40-years-old. Stanford is the sole player to have waited longer for their first major than Yang, and only just: the American triumphed on her 76th attempt. \u201cAt one point I thought, \u2018Will I ever win a major championship before I retire?\u2019\u201d Yang said. \u201cI finally did it and it\u2019s just amazing.\u201d Victory secured Yang $1.56 million in prize money and stamped her ticket to the Paris Olympics next month. It will mark her second appearance at the Games, having finished tied-fourth in Rio in 2016. \u201cThat was one of my biggest goals for this year,\u201d Yang said. \u201cMissing cuts past few tournaments and I saw my world ranking went down so I wasn\u2019t sure if this winning was enough to make the team. But I made it, so I\u2019m very grateful for that.\u201d Korda tumbles It was another tough weekend for world No. 1 Nelly Korda, who carded the worst round of her professional career to tumble from within touching distance of the lead to missing the cut for the third tournament in a row. Already chasing her seventh win of the season, the American made a stellar start with an opening three-under 69, just one stroke shy of early leader and compatriot Lexi Thompson. Yet the 25-year-old nosedived during Friday\u2019s second round, carding eight bogeys and a double bogey en route to a nine-over 81. It marked the highest score of her eight-year pro career and resigned her to a third consecutive missed cut after failing to make the weekend at the Meijer LPGA Classic and last month\u2019s US Women\u2019s Open, the latter of which included a septuple-bogey. \u201cNo words for how I\u2019m playing right now,\u201d Korda, who won the first major of the season at the Chevron Championship in April, told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go home and try to reset \u2026 A lot went my way at the beginning part of the year, and just giving it back.\u201d The major calendar continues with The Evian Championship in France on July 11, before concluding with the Women\u2019s British Open at St. Andrews in Scotland on August 22.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/sport/amy-yang-womens-pga-championship-win-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_india_india-delhi-nighttime-heatwave-climate-intl-hnk", "text": "Nights are getting uncomfortably and dangerously hotter in India\u2019s capital as people in the world\u2019s most populous nation feel little respite from unrelenting temperatures. Northern India has endured a scorching summer, with one part of Delhi reaching 49.9 degrees Celsius (121.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in late May \u2014 the capital\u2019s highest temperature on record. But the stifling heat persists even after the blazing sun has set. The city is cooling down by only 8.5 degrees Celsius at night compared to a 12.2 degrees cooling down in\u00a0urban outskirt areas, a report published by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) last month tracking urban heat stress in Delhi has found. The warmer nights deprive people of rest and recovery from long hours of exposure to oppressive heat, particularly for people without access to air conditioning. Bicycle rickshaw driver Sagar Mandal told CNN that he\u2019s been getting fewer passengers because people opt for air-conditioned taxis over open-air transport. \u201cMy body can\u2019t take it, but I have to keep cycling. We are used to physical labor, we aren\u2019t complaining about that. But this heat is not normal, something has to change,\u201d the 39-year-old, who pedals people around the city, said. \u201cNo one cares if we live or die, no matter who you vote for this is a problem no one can solve,\u201d he said. Nikhil Kumar, an auto-rickshaw driver said his workdays are getting longer and tougher amid the heat. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get any better at night, even at night I\u2019m sweating, it rained a little last night but look how hot it is today, there\u2019s no relief,\u201d the 26-year-old driver said. Hotter nights are a consequence of the climate crisis,\u00a0scientists have warned, heightening the health hazards of heat stress. Studies have shown\u00a0higher nighttime temperatures make it harder to fall asleep\u00a0and reduce deep wave and REM (rapid eye movement), both critical to how well the body repairs and refreshes itself at night. In the United States, for example, nights are warming faster than days in most of country, the\u00a02018 National Climate Assessment\u00a0found. Mandal, the cycle-rickshaw driver said he has been sleeping on the roof of his home for some hope of cooler air but only for a couple of hours. \u201cI barely sleep these days,\u201d he said. Exposure to heat waves during pregnancy may be associated with adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, according to a\u00a02019 study. Older adults may have higher heart rates and more\u00a0physiological stress when sleeping in warmer temperatures. A\u00a02008 Australian study\u00a0even found deaths due to mental and behavioral disorders rose during heat waves, especially for older adults. Power paucity, water woes and heat stress Increasing nighttime heat is even more common in cities like Delhi because of the\u00a0urban heat island effect, in which metro areas are significantly hotter than their surroundings. Areas with\u00a0a lot of asphalt and dense concrete buildings absorb more of the sun\u2019s heat than areas with ample parks, rivers and tree-lined streets. The hot days and nights are testing the limits of the country\u2019s electricity grid and water supply, and the strain on\u00a0resources is already making people sick. \u201cWe\u2019ve been living in this neighborhood for 40 years, but we have never seen a summer like this,\u201d said 60-year-old Kalyani Saha, a resident of the Lajpat Nagar neighborhood of the capital city. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been power for the last two hours, in the middle of the day that\u2019s unbearable,\u201d Saha told CNN, saying that power cuts also render their air-conditioning system useless. \u201cWe get water only once a day, and it\u2019s scalding hot, unless you fill up a bucket and let it cool off all day before using it, you can\u2019t bathe in this water,\u201d she said. Saha also said her grandson has been ill for a week. \u201cThey\u2019re small, they can\u2019t cope with this, this is not a human level of heat,\u201d she said. At least 40,000 cases of heat stroke have been reported in India since March, an official in the Ministry of Health told CNN Thursday, and at least 110 people have died across the country due to suspected heat stroke as well. Dr Ajay Chauhan, in charge of the first of its kind heat-stroke unit at Delhi\u2019s Ram Manohar Lohiya (RML) hospital says hotter nights mean increased stress on the bodies. \u201cWhen a person has a heat stroke, things progress very quickly, so without early intervention the fatality rate of heat strokes is very high,\u201d Chauhan said. Chauhan said people who work outdoors all day need time to cool down and recover but he concedes \u201cthat\u2019s not been possible.\u201d At least 11 people have died as a result of heat strokes at his hospital since May 29 and on Thursday alone over 20 new patients were admitted to the hospital for various heat-related illnesses. Over the past five decades, India has experienced more than 700 heat wave events claiming more than 17,000 lives, according to a 2021 study of extreme weather in the Weather and Climate Extremes journal. Delhi recorded the highest numbers of homeless deaths in the last five years during the 9-day stretch. Between June 11 and 19, Delhi saw 192 heatwave-related deaths among its homeless\u00a0population, a record high compared with the same\u00a0period in the last five years, according to a report from the NGO Centre for Health Development India. \u201cAlmost everyone living on the streets reported experiencing sleeplessness,\u201d the report said, adding that they suffered from several heat-related ailments. Sarita Kumari has been sleeping on the streets of Delhi with her three children, and told CNN her three-year-old son has been running a high fever all week. \u201cWe do have a house but there\u2019s a lot of us and when the power goes it gets suffocating,\u201d Kumari said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/india/india-delhi-nighttime-heatwave-climate-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_americas_turks-and-caicos-ammunition-charges-sentencing", "text": "One of\u00a0several Americans recently charged\u00a0with having ammunition in Turks and Caicos is expected to go home after a court issued a suspended sentence and fined him $2,000. Ryan Tyler Watson of Oklahoma pleaded guilty last month to possessing four rounds of ammunition, a spokesperson for the government of Turks and Caicos said. He had been released on bail and ordered to stay on the islands while awaiting this sentence. On Friday, Watson received a 13-week suspended sentence and a $2,000 fine \u2013 $500 per bullet, a spokesperson for the Turks and Caicos Islands Supreme Court told CNN on Friday. Watson will not need to serve the 13-week sentence \u201cas long as he doesn\u2019t commit any crimes and keeps the peace in the TCI within 9 months,\u201d the court spokesperson said. Watson \u201cis now allowed to leave \u2026 as he\u2019s now cleared with the justice in the TCI.\u201d Watson is expected to return to Oklahoma City by Friday night, according to Jonathan Franks, a spokesperson for\u00a0Bring Our Families Home. \u201cWe will make payment shortly, depart TCI and anticipate being home in OKC tonight,\u201d Franks posted on X from the courthouse. Watson was visiting Turks and Caicos with his wife in April to celebrate several friends\u2019 40th birthdays. But bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d The British Overseas Territory doesn\u2019t manufacture guns or ammunition, yet the number of firearms making their way to the islands has increased, Turks and Caicos Premier C. Washington\u00a0Misick said in May. By contrast, the United States has\u00a0more guns than people. \u201cIn the\u00a0Turks\u00a0and Caicos Islands, the law stands firm and applies to everyone equally, without exception,\u201d\u00a0Misick said in a statement last month. Turks and Caicos recently revised part of its firearms law after a bipartisan group of US Congress members traveled to the islands southeast of the Bahamas and asked officials to drop charges against five Americans whom they said \u201cinadvertently\u201d had ammunition in their luggage. The new amendment clarifies when sentencing for firearms-related offenses, courts have the discretion to impose either a fine, a custodial sentence, or a mixture of both in exceptional circumstances. Previously, the law required courts to impose both a fine and a prison sentence of 12 years \u2013 though it allowed reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d Watson is the first of those five Americans to be sentenced under the amended firearms law, which went into effect Wednesday. What\u2019s happened to the other Americans At least four other Americans have recently been arrested in Turks and Caicos on charges of having ammunition. Bryan Hagerich is\u00a0back\u00a0in the\u00a0United States\u00a0after receiving a suspended 52-week sentence and a $6,700 fine.\u00a0Hagerich\u00a0was allowed to leave the\u00a0territory\u00a0and return to the US after he paid the fine, his attorney Oliver Smith said. Tyler Wenrich\u00a0pleaded guilty and\u00a0was sentenced to time served\u00a0and issued a $9,000 fine, according to court records. Michael Lee Evans pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9 mm rounds of ammunition,\u00a0and was scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday \u2013 though it is unclear based on court records if the sentencing happened. CNN has reached out to his attorney for more information. And Sharitta Shinese Grier is expected to plead guilty in court next Tuesday, her attorney Sheena C. Mairto told CNN. The Florida mother said she had no idea two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. Grier was released on bail but can\u2019t leave the islands until her case ends, the affiliate reported. She was also ordered to report to a police station weekly. CNN\u2019s Michael Rios, Michelle Watson, Alisha Ebrahimji and Sahar Akbarzai contributed to this report.

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_22_middleeast_rapper-toomaj-death-sentence-iran-overturn-intl-latam", "text": "Iranian dissident rapper Toomaj Salehi had his death sentence overturned by the Iranian Supreme Court this week in what his lawyers have deemed a victory for human rights in Iran. Salehi had become a key voice of anti-government dissent in Iran, strongly criticizing the repressive nature of the Iranian regime through his musical output and social media posts. In October 2022, as fervent demonstrations gripped Iran following the death of a young girl, Mahsa Amini in morality police custody, Salehi threw his support behind the protest movement. Salehi has claimed he was tortured and placed in solitary detention after being initially arrested in October 2022 for his involvement in the protest movement. After being briefly released from prison in 2023, Salehi was re-arrested for \u201cmaking false claims and spreading lies,\u201d according to Iranian judiciary news agency Mizan. He was then sentenced to death in May this year. A lower court in the central city of Isfahan found him guilty of the crime of \u201ccorruption on earth,\u201d issuing the maximum punishment of death. On Saturday, his lawyer Amir Raesian broke the news of the reversal\u00a0in a post on X, saying that the Iranian Supreme Court had \u201cavoided irreparable judicial error\u201d and overturned Salehi\u2019s death sentence this week. In its judgment, Iran\u2019s highest court found previous prison sentences handed down to Salehi to be \u201cin excess of legal punishment.\u201d The news was welcomed by the campaign group Index on Censorship which has lobbied strongly for the rapper\u2019s release and worked closely with a team of international human rights lawyers based in London\u2019s Doughty Street Chambers to reverse his death sentence. \u201cIt [the judgment] is a clear demonstration of the injustice of the lower court decision, and we are delighted that Salehi no longer faces the threat of execution. The Supreme Court found that the death sentence delivered to Salehi was excessive and failed to comply with Iranian law,\u201d the group said in a statement Saturday. Salehi\u2019s case will now referred back to the lower court in Isfahan for re-sentencing, Index On Censorship said, decrying the prospect of any further jail time for the rapper. \u201cEven a shorter period of imprisonment would be an injustice: Salehi has done nothing other than to call for his, and other Iranians\u2019, fundamental rights to be respected,\u201d the group added. London-based human rights lawyer Caoilfhionn Gallagher who is the international counsel for the Salehi family said it was \u201cnot enough\u201d that his life had been \u201cspared\u201d by the Iranian authorities. Gallagher who alongside a team of colleagues filed an urgent appeal to the UN regarding Salehi\u2019s case back in May, called once again for his \u201cunconditional\u201d release. \u201cWe urge the international community to keep the pressure up at this critical time, to secure Salehi\u2019s freedom and hold Iran to account for its egregious violations of international human rights law,\u201d Gallagher said in the Index On Censorship statement. The campaign to secure Salehi\u2019s release has won support from high-profile voices across the globe. The Recording Academy which organises the Grammy Awards, put out a statement in April saying it was \u201cdeeply troubled by the recent news regarding Toomaj Salehi.\u201d \u201cNo artist anywhere should have to fear for their life or livelihood when expressing themselves through their art,\u201d the statement added. British business magnate Richard Branson was also among those to call for Salehi\u2019s release, calling it \u201cimpossible to listen to Toomaj\u2019s music, read his lyrics, and not be deeply touched by his message.\u201d At home in Iran, over 300 Iranian musicians signed a collective statement conveying their opposition to the rapper\u2019s death sentence, describing him as \u201ca champion of the righteous aspirations of an entire generation of Iranians.\u201d Index on Censorshop CEO Jemimah Steinfeld said she hoped the decision would allow Salehi to \u201cseek the medical treatment he needs and continue his vital work.\u201d Claudia Bennett, a legal and programs officer at the Human Rights Foundation, called the rapper\u2019s case \u201cemblematic of the brutality of dictatorships.\u201d \u201cThey use arbitrary detention to silence dissidents and those advocating for democracy and human rights. Toomaj\u2019s crime was singing a song and posting on social media.

{"id": "2024_06_24_europe_dagestan-putin-extremism-pledge-failure-intl", "text": "Only a fraction of the violence that raged across Dagestan on Sunday is visible at the moment, and it is already horrific. Co-ordinated attacks in Dagestan\u2019s two main cities, hitting synagogues and churches. Reports a priest had his throat slit, hostages taken, and the sons of a local official and an MMA fighter among the five attackers. Videos of the violence showed police responding, racing down Makhachkala\u2019s panicked streets, as darkness fell. And police casualties appear improbably greater than the civilian toll, hinting worse news about civilian deaths may be yet to emerge. The partial information available is entirely by design. Moscow has tried for decades to keep a lid on the raging Islamist extremism its years of brutal suppression and poverty have fomented across the North Caucasus. Some times it is through brutal force, others through the selective release of information. But neither has conquered the problem. This attack \u2013 almost three months to the day after gunmen stormed into Moscow\u2019s Crocus City Hall killing 133 \u2013 compounds the unpleasant fact that Russia\u2019s Islamist threat has metastised, like it has across the world, and the next, younger generation retains the same vile hatred for the Kremlin\u2019s past and present. The extent of the law enforcement response will be key as Russia\u2019s political elite picks through the wreckage. The high death toll among police suggests they were either heavily targeted, or met fierce resistance when they intervened. The war in Ukraine \u2013 with police officers sent to the front \u2013 has left Russia\u2019s law enforcement depleted nationwide. But it is particularly bad in Dagestan, where protests broke out in the earlier months of the war, as their sons had been disproportionately mobilized. This is a poor, febrile pocket of Russia on the Caspian Sea, in places devoutly Muslim, where the war in Ukraine will have left many empty places at the dinner table, and fomented discontent against the Kremlin and its often corrupt local proxies. Dead and absent sons are hard to stomach, but if they come with worse security at home, it can be a critical problem for the Kremlin\u2019s grip on Dagestan. Extremist Islamism became Russia\u2019s curse after the savagery of its two wars in Chechnya. Putin came to power in 1999 graphically pledging to wipe out \u201cin the toilet\u201d the extremists apparently behind apartment bombings in Moscow. Chechen separatist militants like Shamil Basayev grew more radical in their ideology as Moscow\u2019s \u201cclean-up\u201d campaigns raged through Chechnya\u2019s villages in the early 2000s, often executing military-aged males randomly. Over the coming years, the two protagonists fed off each other; militants would reach yet more disgusting depths, and be answered by security forces who saw no limits on what they should do in response. The attacks on Christians in Dagestan on Sunday echo the militants\u2019 most ghastly crime \u2013 the siege of the school in Beslan, in 2004, where an Orthodox Christian area was targeted and more than 300 people died, most of them children. The security forces\u2019 response was woeful back then, until special forces arrived and bravely suppressed the siege, suffering great casualties in their ranks. Russian President Vladimir Putin sneaked into the area to see the wounded in hospital in the dead of night. Beslan was a manifestation of the sore he had pledged to cure when he came to power. As he has now, he failed back then, and wanted no photocall with the devastation. Chechen wars ignited entire region The perpetrators of Beslan had complex histories that spoke of how the Chechen wars had ignited an entire region. They were mostly not Chechens, but from nearby Ingushetia, another Russian region hit hard by its brutal war on extremism and separatists. Their decision to launch such a diabolical scheme \u2013 and there could only have been one real outcome from stringing up explosives in the basketball hoops above children\u2019s heads in a gym on the first day of school \u2013 came, they said, from the brutalities they had seen. I interviewed the only surviving Beslan gunman\u2019s father back in 2004, in a remote village in the Chechen hills. A tiny man, in a kufi hat and silver beard, he said little about his son\u2019s crimes. We spoke in a hurry, as Russian forces were then busy entering homes on the other side of his village in yet another clean-up operation. He said to me only this: \u201cIt is as Lenin said. There is White and there is Red. Always has been, and always will be.\u201d His point: there are two sides in this savage war, and they are irreconcilable. Fast forward a decade, and the North Caucasus came into focus again when two former residents perpetrated the Boston bombing in 2013. Their links back to Dagestan extremism proved slight. Most reporting suggested the elder brother had tried to be recruited by local jihadists, and hung around Makhachkala for weeks, hoping to get the invitation. But by then, Dagestan\u2019s extremists were hugely selective. Recruits would be expected to sit for months in isolation, without using cellphones or other contact, before jihadists would admit them to their training in the dense local forests and ranks of committed militants, eager to take innocent life. The caution was a by-product of Moscow\u2019s crackdown. Surveillance was omnipresent. Police would take no chances when intervening with suspects. Often a potential militant would be surrounded, his family permitted to leave, and then his home stormed, with little option for surrender. That was over 10 years ago. Nothing has improved since, and a younger generation have the lurid propaganda of ISIS\u2019s failed caliphate of 2014 to supercharge their fantasies. They face more potent fuel in the preaching and branding of ISIS-K, an offshoot of the Middle Eastern group in South and Central Asia, growing in its reach. But it is still the same problem Putin faced when he sneaked into Beslan in 2004. The extremist manifestation of anger in an impoverished, suppressed and exploited satellite region. A horror the Kremlin thought it could conquer, yet just accentuated through their brutality. A place Moscow cares little for, but will never allow to secede. A raging sore for the Kremlin, and a reminder of both how Putin came to power and his limits on it.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/europe/dagestan-putin-extremism-pledge-failure-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Richmond, Virginia \u2014 or \u201cRVA,\u201d as locals call it \u2014 has top-notch museums and intriguing neighborhoods, and it\u2019s a great spot for dining, drinking and getting outdoors. There\u2019s an impressive arts scene and a nearly year-round lineup of festivals. And the city is taking a hard look at its complicated history \u2014 as the capital of the Confederacy during the Civil War and a historic slave trading hub \u2014 and working on ways to better tell the city\u2019s full story. Now\u2019s a great time for visitors to see for themselves how Virginia\u2019s capital city has evolved. Fine food and beverages A thriving food scene is a must for any vibrant US city \u2013 and Richmond delivers with diverse flavors and a high concentration of black-owned restaurants. Chef Michael Lindsey and his wife, Kimberly Love-Lindsey, opened their first restaurant \u2013 Lillie Pearl \u2013 in 2020, mid-pandemic. The restaurant blends West African heirloom ingredients, Southern African-American cuisine and a range of global influences. Lindsey Food Group followed Lillie Pearl by opening two locations of fried chicken fast-casual spot Buttermilk and Honey, and it has added several more restaurants to the portfolio, including modern Chophouse ML Steak downtown and in Chesterfield. Kali Love, a California fusion concept, just opened in June. Global cuisine is evident all over town, from the deliciously messy birria tacos at Maya Latin Kitchen to Afghan fine dining at The Mantu. Discover Richmond Tours offers a handful of food tours that offer visitors a great way to maximize their options and explore the city\u2019s neighborhoods at the same time. The beverage scene is also booming. Scott Jones, co-owner of Triple Crossing Beer, has been part of Richmond\u2019s rise as a beer destination, thanks in part to the city\u2019s extensive Beer Trail, which features more than 30 craft breweries. Since opening the first of three locations in 2014, Jones has witnessed a transformation of the local culture. \u201cThe food scene, the arts scene, music and beer \u2013 they have a symbiotic relationship, and over the years they have melded together and blossomed to help make Richmond a place for people to come visit,\u201d he says. \u201cWe set a high standard for breweries,\u201d says beer columnist Annie Tobey, author of \u201c100 Things to Do in Richmond Before You Die.\u201d \u201cRVA has so many quality breweries that represent a wide range of styles.\u201d Scott\u2019s Addition, a trendy neighborhood that has been designated Richmond\u2019s \u201ccraft beverage capital,\u201d is home to a collection of breweries, including V\u00e4sen and The Veil.

Kelli Lemon, co-owner of the Richmond Black Restaurant Experience, opened the caf\u00e9 six years ago as a community gathering and networking space. Lemon\u2019s company is aimed at supporting black-owned culinary brands. Busy neighborhoods full of history Lively neighborhoods make up Richmond\u2019s center, each contributing to the character of the city. Richmond is also home to more than 150 murals, part of an explosion of dynamic street art around town. Known for its cobblestone streets, Shockoe Slip in southeastern downtown features contemporary restaurants and historic architecture bordered on the south by the James River. Just to the east, one of Richmond\u2019s oldest neighborhoods, Shockoe Bottom, holds centuries of history that the city is working to highlight (more on those plans below). Today, the neighborhoods offer a variety of bars, entertainment venues and historical sites, including a museum dedicated to onetime Richmond resident Edgar Allan Poe as well as markers along the Richmond Slave Trail, a self-guided walking route that tells the somber history of slavery in the city. The downtown core is home to business and government buildings, including the Virginia State Capitol, and the American Civil War Museum. One of the museum\u2019s three sites, the American Civil War Museum at Historic Tredegar, currently features \u201cThe Impending Crisis,\u201d an exhibit that explores the division of the United States on the verge of the Civil War. Guided tours are offered of the 1818 White House of the Confederacy, another unit of the museum located in the Court End neighborhood. While Richmond\u2019s Civil War history is well known, the city also played a role in the American Revolutionary War. Patrick Henry, a Founding Father and Virginia\u2019s first post-colonial governor, gave his famous \u201cGive me liberty \u2026 or give me death\u201d speech in 1775 at Historic St. John\u2019s Church in Church Hill. North of the city center, Jackson Ward, once called the Harlem of the South, is a vibrant cultural hub that is home to the Black History Museum & Cultural Center of Virginia. The exhibit \u201cVirginia is for Music Lovers: A History of Virginia\u2019s Black Excellence in Music\u201d opened at the museum recently. West of downtown, the Fan District on the edge of Virginia Commonwealth University campus is known for beautiful Victorian architecture, tree-lined streets, trendy cafes and upscale shops. Art lovers will enjoy the four galleries and rotating common spaces at\u00a0Institute for Contemporary Art\u00a0at VCU, which is free and open to the public Farther west, the Museum District features most of the area\u2019s major museums, including the renowned Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and the Virginia Museum of History & Culture. Just south of the Museum District, Carytown \u2014 Richmond\u2019s \u201cmile of style\u201d \u2014 is known for specialty shops, restaurants and the historic Byrd Theatre, a \u201cgrand movie palace\u201d that dates to 1928 and still shows a range of films. Across the James River from downtown, up-and-coming Manchester is known today for its industrial-chic vibe, art studios and scenic views of the river and downtown skyline. The Richmond Slave Trail starts here at the Manchester Docks. A hard look at the past In northeast Richmond, the statues of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and other Confederate leaders that once lined Monument Avenue have been removed. Once home to more Confederate statues than any US city, their removal amid protests against racial injustice beginning in 2020 has been part of the city\u2019s reckoning with the long and complicated shadow the Civil War and slavery cast over Richmond\u2019s reputation. \u201cTheir removal has been part of a broader effort to engage with the city\u2019s complex history,\u201d says Carla Murray, director of marketing communications for Richmond Region Tourism. \u201cThe history is controversial, but we are committed to telling the full story.\u201d The monuments were transferred to the care of the Black History Museum & Cultural Center of Virginia, with oversight by the Valentine Museum. One of the statues is on display at the Valentine. The Jefferson Davis statue \u2014 the work of sculptor Edward Valentine, the museum\u2019s first president \u2014 was erected on Monument Avenue in 1907. The sculpture is covered in paint and displayed tipped over on its side, as it was when it was toppled by protesters in June 2020. The Valentine family pushed the \u201cLost Cause\u201d myth reframing the Civil War, which is the subject of a new exhibit. The Shockoe neighborhoods downtown are the focus of the The Shockoe Project, a City of Richmond effort to bring greater emphasis to the story of enslavement with numerous planned sites, including a National Slavery Museum. The city still has work to do in sharing a new story with would-be visitors, says Lemon, of the Richmond Black Restaurant Experience, who also sits on the board of Virginia Tourism Corporation. \u201cI truly want people to visit this area, but you\u2019re going to have to take the old way of thinking out if you want to enjoy this city. In the years since \u2018RVA\u2019 became an official brand \u2026 the community has worked to change the narrative,\u201d says Lemon, referring to the successful RVA rebranding push launched more than a dozen years ago. Lemon hopes that while taking in the city\u2019s history, visitors will also come to know RVA as the center of diversity, entrepreneurship and creativity that it is. Outdoor entertainment That human creativity is joined by the city\u2019s natural assets and appetite for fun. Nature lovers will adore Maymont, a sprawling 100-acre Victorian estate and public park that sits along the James River. Maymont plans to unveil its Virginia Wildlife Trail\u00a0in fall 2024, which will more cohesively and accessibly connect trails winding through the habitats of 300+ native and domestic animals and add facilities that present educational programming. Not far from Maymont, the gorgeous 50-acre Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden will soon celebrate its 40th anniversary with a major renovation. The city\u2019s diverse festival season is nearly year-round. The 20th Richmond Folk Festival, one of Virginia\u2019s largest events, runs from September 27-29.\u00a0 On August 11, nearly 100,000 attendees will flock to the Carytown Watermelon Festival, Virginia\u2019s largest single-day festival for music, a vibrant summer atmosphere, and, of course, watermelon. RVA\u2019s beloved Minor League baseball team, the Flying Squirrels, is gearing up for a new 10,000-seat stadium expected to open in 2026. In the meantime, games are played at The Diamond, the city\u2019s baseball home since 1985. And opening in summer 2025, the 7,500-seat Riverfront Amphitheater will be a four-acre, open-air venue with stunning views of the downtown skyline and the James River. The river offers plenty of recreation opportunities on its own. The 600-acre James River Park system features more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) of trails and water activities, including rare urban Class IV white water rapids. \u201cIt is simply amazing,\u201d says Tobey. \u201cYou can be on the trails or paddling the rapids, and when you\u2019re done, you can be at a great restaurant in 10 minutes.\u201d That easy hop from one interesting spot to the next is just one more reason to head to Richmond right now.

The company had worked with IBM to develop and test AI-driven, voice-automated ordering at some of its restaurants. The fast food giant says it\u2019s still working on AI-related solutions at a time when its rivals are making similar investments. It plans to shut off the technology in restaurants participating in the test \u201cno later than July 26, 2024,\u201d according to reporting from trade publication Restaurant Business. \u201cIBM remains a trusted partner and we will still utilize many of their products across our global System,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in an email sent to franchisees and shared with CNN. But the company suggested it will look at AI partners other than IBM. McDonald\u2019s and IBM launched their partnership in 2021, announcing the development of Automated Order Taking (AOT) technology to create a more convenient and simplified ordering experience for its customers and restaurant teams as a part of its \u201cAccelerating the Arches\u201d growth plan. IBM said the AOT\u00a0technology that emerged from the partnership has \u201csome of the most comprehensive capabilities in the industry, fast and accurate\u201d in\u00a0demanding conditions. \u201cWhile McDonald\u2019s is revaluating and refining its plans for AOT, we look forward to continuing to work with them on a variety of other projects,\u201d IBM said in a statement. McDonald\u2019s says this is not the end of\u00a0its AI efforts. It plans to\u00a0\u201cevaluate long-term, scalable solutions\u201d for voice-ordering by the end of 2024. \u201cAI is clearly going to be a part of restaurant automation and efficiencies going forward, but the technology is still in its infancy,\u201d said David Henkes, senior principal and head of strategic partnerships at Technomic. \u201cThe McDonald\u2019s experience and commitment to AI shows the potential upside, but it also shows the limitations of the technology at the present time.\u201d McDonald\u2019s is not the only fast-food chain experimenting with AI. Other companies like White Castle tested out an automated drive-thru ordering system in 2021, and Wendy\u2019s expanded its partnership with Google Cloud to roll out its own AI ordering tool in May last year. Despite fast-food companies\u2019 enthusiasm to integrate AI-powered solutions into their daily operations, the technology has still hit snags. Some customers have complained about AI getting their orders wrong \u2014 a result of the technology\u2019s inability to recognize some accents and distinguish the customer\u2019s voice from background noise.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/17/tech/mcdonalds-ai-drive-thru-program/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_24_sport_barnabas-varga-injury-szoboszlai-hungary-scotland-euro-2024-spt-intl", "text": "Hungary captain Dominik Szoboszlai has called for a change to medical protocols after the team\u2019s striker, Barnab\u00e1s Varga, sustained a serious injury during its match against Scotland on Sunday at Euro 2024. Varga fell to the ground after appearing to collide with Scotland goalkeeper Angus Gunn in the Scotland box midway through the second half. The 29-year-old\u2019s teammates could be seen signaling for medical attention to be brought onto the pitch to help Varga. When it arrived, sheets were raised around him while he received treatment. Subsequently, 10 minutes of stoppage time was added to the end of the Group A match at the Stuttgart Arena. Cameras showed Szoboszlai seemingly in tears after the incident and appeared to be concerned at the speed at which the stretcher was being carried onto the pitch to help Varga. The Hungary captain then helped run with the stretcher in an effort to speed up the process. Varga was eventually taken off the field to applause from both sets of fans. Shortly after the game \u2013 in which Hungary\u2019s Kevin Csoboth scored a 100th-minute winner to give them a chance of qualifying for the knockout stages of the competition \u2013 the Hungarian FA confirmed that Varga was in a \u201cstable\u201d condition in a nearby hospital and that he had concussion and a broken cheekbone which required surgery. \u201cIt looked bad, it was bad, he felt bad,\u201d Szoboszlai told reporters as he reflected on Varga\u2019s injury. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what the [medical] protocol [is], I don\u2019t know how it works but if our doctors say we need someone immediately to help, then I don\u2019t think they should walk. \u201cIt\u2019s not my decision but I think we need to change something. Even if somebody is on the ground, and you see that it was a big crash then just go [onto the pitch]. Even if the referee is saying don\u2019t go on, just go on. And if you see it\u2019s nothing serious, then you can just go down and its finished. But seconds can help a lot.\u201d When contacted by CNN about whether it was reviewing its medical procedures, UEFA \u2013 European soccer\u2019s governing body \u2013 said in a statement: \u201cWith regards to the medical intervention following the head injury suffered by Barnab\u00e1s Varga of Hungary, we would like to clarify that the intervention of the team doctor happened within 15 seconds of the incident, followed immediately by the second stadium doctor, to conduct a first assessment of the injury and provide appropriate treatment, as per customary medical procedures. \u201cThe qualified pitchside emergency team were waiting pitchside, according to their protocol, and arrived with the stretcher as soon as their intervention was requested by the medics to evacuate the player for his immediate transfer to hospital. \u201cThe coordination between all the medical staff on site was professional and everything was done in accordance with the applicable medical procedures. There was no delay in the treatment of and assistance to the player.\u201d Csoboth celebrated his late winner with a shirt with Varga\u2019s name on the back and the whole team posed with a similar shirt after the victory in support for the striker. \u201cIt was a confusing situation,\u201d Hungary coach Marco Rossi told reporters after the match. \u201cWhat I heard from the players is that Barny at that moment looked like he was not conscious so everyone was really worried about his condition and also worried about the fact that the doctors arrived a bit late, we can say. \u201cBut of course, they probably didn\u2019t realize it was a dangerous situation. Now fortunately, we can say that Barny is not under any kind of risk. \u201cProbably he will be operated in the coming hours because he suffered a fracture here [pointing to his cheek/eye socket]. But he\u2019s healthy, that\u2019s the most important thing. If we go through the competition of course he will not be part of the team anymore.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/sport/barnabas-varga-injury-szoboszlai-hungary-scotland-euro-2024-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_22_weather_heat-wave-new-york-washington-dc-weekend", "text": "A dangerous heat wave is bringing sweltering temperatures to much of the US this weekend, including over parts of the Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic. Meanwhile, a tropical system could develop this weekend through the southwest Gulf of Mexico. Here\u2019s the latest: \u2022\u00a0Millions of Americans under heat alerts: More than 100 million Americans, including those in the highly populated I-95 corridor, are under heat alerts through the weekend. A heat emergency is in effect for Washington, DC, where the temperature skyrocketed to 100\u00ba F, the first time the city has recorded a temperature that high since 2012. \u2022\u00a0Tropical system could develop: A new tropical system could develop quick this weekend on the heels of Alberto. A system with a medium chance of tropical development could mimic Alberto\u2019s track through the southwestern Gulf of Mexico and into northeastern Mexico this weekend, according to the National Hurricane Center. While this system is not expected to be as large as Alberto, it could bring more rain to South Texas and trigger new flooding concerns there and along the Gulf Coast. \u2022\u00a0Sizzling temperatures return to California: Heat alerts in California span parts of southern and central California, including in Colusa County, where firefighters are working to rein in the Sites Fire spanning over 19,100 acres. High temperatures between 100 and 106 are expected and could hinder firefighting efforts. California is seeing an active\u00a0early fire year, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Since the start of the year, more than 89,700 acres have burned, compared to 5,747 acres during the same period last year. \u2022\u00a0\u2018Catastrophic flooding\u2019 in Iowa: On Saturday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for 21 counties in northwest Iowa and directed all available state resources to assist Rock Valley and other communities in response to \u201ccatastrophic flooding.\u201d In Rock Valley, all residences north of Highway 18 were being evacuated amid high floodwaters. There\u2019s a level 2 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall Saturday over northern Iowa, and that corner of the state has seen an estimated 10-plus inches of rain based on radar. The heaviest rain is expected further east. And in nearby Sioux Falls, South Dakota, nine people have been rescued in the past 24 hours from rising water due to heavy rainfall, according to City Emergency Manager Regan Smith. \u2022 Flood threat in fire zone: A flash flood warning was issued for Ruidoso and other New Mexico areas burned by the South Fork Fire after 0.5 inches of rain fell in the morning and more rain was expected into the late afternoon hours. Rain earlier in the week created a flash flood emergency with water rescues as a torrent of mud and water rushed from burned areas. Ground charred by fire, also known as a burn scar, loses its ability to effectively absorb water and more easily floods. \u2022 Search for \u201cmore loss of life\u201d in New Mexico fires: In New Mexico, authorities reported\u00a0that at least two people\u00a0died, 1,400 structures were destroyed and more than 8,000 residents were evacuated as a result of\u00a0wildfires. The mayor of hard-hit Ruidoso said they were preparing for more fatalities in the fires and bringing in dogs to help the search for \u201cmore loss of life.\u201d The South Fork and Salt fires have together burned an estimated 24,000 acres and were still 0% contained as of Friday. Evacuations are still in effect for Village of Ruidoso and City of Ruidoso Downs residents and additional evacuation orders have been issued in at least seven more areas. Ruidoso residents will be allowed to return to their homes Monday, and authorities ask that they bring at least a week\u2019s worth of food and drinking water, as grocery stores are not operating at full capacity. Meanwhile, FBI special agents have joined the investigation into the cause of wildfires. Heat wave to intensify and expand this weekend More record daily high temperatures are possible through the weekend as heat expands into new areas and intensifies in others. The extreme heat and humidity will combine to push the heat index \u2013 or how hot it feels \u2013 to 100 to 105 degrees over a widespread area, with 110 degrees possible in the southern mid-Atlantic. Record overnight low temperatures will\u00a0increase health risks\u00a0by reducing the ability for people to cool down at night. The nation\u2019s capital could potentially hit 100 degrees for the first time in eight years. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser said an extended\u00a0heat\u00a0emergency will remain activated throughout the weekend and into next week. The National Weather Service said widespread temperatures in the upper 90s and even triple digits will be possible in the city. The city officially recorded a temperature of 100 degrees Saturday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Thursday signed a state of preparedness declaration ahead of the potentially hazardous\u00a0heat\u00a0wave. An\u00a0excessive\u00a0heat\u00a0watch\u00a0has been issued for most of the region for Saturday, according to the National Weather Service, with dangerous\u00a0heat\u00a0possible and the\u00a0heat\u00a0expected to feel between 105 and 110 degrees. The heat wave\u2019s prolonged nature is a serious concern. New York City residents could experience 90-degree temperatures or higher this weekend into early next week. The stretch would be the longest ever in June in the city. For the first time this year, the National Weather Service has issued a\u00a0heat\u00a0advisory\u00a0for the city. Gov. Kathy Hochul on Tuesday announced the opening of the state\u2019s emergency operations center, which she said will monitor conditions and share resources with emergency management personnel across the state\u2019s 62 counties. Earlier this week, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said cooling centers will be open across the city. Philadelphia has extended a heat\u00a0health emergency through midnight on Sunday, according to the state\u2019s Department of Public Health. Philadelphia has\u00a0heat\u00a0alerts in place through the weekend, with temperatures expected to feel close to 99 degrees. New Jersey\u2019s\u00a0heat\u00a0alerts are in effect until 8 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.\u00a0It will feel around 100 degrees across the state Saturday and Sunday. Heat is also returning in full force in the West following a brief break. Heat alerts are already in place for portions of California, Arizona and Utah. Temperatures are expected to jump back up to 10 to 15 degrees above normal for Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Sacramento and Bakersfield, California, through the weekend.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/22/weather/heat-wave-new-york-washington-dc-weekend/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

He was followed by Kenny Bednarek in second with a time 9.87 seconds (a personal best), while Fred Kerley was third with a season\u2019s best 9.88. Both sprinters \u2013 who won a silver medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in the 100m and 200m respectively \u2013 also qualified for Paris. Lyles \u2013 the reigning 100m, 200m and 4 x 100m relay world champion \u2013 missed out on the 100m in Tokyo after finishing seventh at the trials. He made it into the 200m event however, winning a bronze medal. \u201cThree years ago I got second to last.

{"id": "2024_06_14_tech_apple-openai-partnership", "text": "When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman attended Apple\u2019s annual developer conference this week, he walked the campus, mingling with current and former executives, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Nearly an hour later, the iPhone maker announced a much-rumored partnership with OpenAI to bring its ChatGPT technology to devices later this year. But Altman, who has emerged as the poster child for generative AI in the 18 months since the launch of ChatGPT, was not featured in Apple\u2019s formal presentation, neither in person or via livestream. Nor did he join Apple CEO Tim Cook and other executives in a private press event about privacy and security and the partnership between the two companies. \u201cI was not surprised Sam Altman did not appear on stage,\u201d said Ben Wood, an analyst at market research firm CCS Insight in an interview with CNN. \u201cApple had to manage the message carefully. OpenAI is merely the vehicle to address broader AI-powered inquiries that are not core to the Apple experience. Having him in the livestream would have only created an unnecessary level of confusion.\u201d Earlier this week, Apple showed off a handful of AI-powered features coming to the iPhone, iPad and Mac in the fall \u2013 the majority of which are fueled by the company\u2019s own proprietary technology, called Apple Intelligence. The company will offer OpenAI\u2019s viral ChatGPT tool in a limited capacity, usually only when Siri is activated and needs more assistance answering an inquiry. The move to invite Altman to the announcement but not have him appear before the public also represents in some ways how Apple is cautiously moving forward with the partnership. OpenAI, along with other AI companies, continues to face concerns from researchers, industry experts and government officials around misinformation, biases, copyright, privacy and security, and more. The deal also comes at a time when the industry is moving quickly, and government regulators, companies and consumers are still figuring out how to engage with the technology responsibly. Apple hopes that a big push into AI could spur growth for iPhone sales as the device has languished without a major upgrade for years and users are now waiting longer to upgrade their devices as a result. An uncertain economic environment is also weighing on consumers, particularly in China. The company also faces regulatory scrutiny in Washington and was recently passed by chip maker Nvidia as the second-largest public company in the US. In the 60 hours after Apple\u2019s Monday event, however, the company\u2019s stock price (AAPL) rose by as much as 10%, boosting Apple\u2019s market capitalization by more than $300 billion, rocketing past Nvidia and putting Apple back in contention with Microsoft for largest market value. The timing is further noteworthy: Apple is not always first to adopt and integrate emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect new tech for years before including it in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the latest buzzy technology. \u201cApple needed to deliver an AI story and Apple Intelligence should help placate nervous investors and reassure them that Apple is keeping pace with its rivals,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThe partnership with ChatGPT is a major development which beefs up Apple\u2019s AI offerings, and new features like a significantly improved Siri will be welcome to users.\u201d But the partnership could also open Apple up to some vulnerability, as it has no control over OpenAI\u2019s models or what it does with user inputs. Apple alignment with a company and a technology that have yet to win public trust could also cause some challenges down the road. A limited partnership Although Apple has been working on its own AI program for years, a partnership with OpenAI marks a way for it to fill in the competitive gaps. When a user has a question beyond Siri\u2019s scope, ChatGPT can step in. In the demo following the keynote, Apple showed CNN how someone could upload a picture of vegetables at a farmer\u2019s market and ask what they could make for dinner. Siri may suggest that the question is better suited for ChatGPT, and provide the user with a prompt to give consent to use the service. Apple using ChatGPT as a complimentary service could potentially cut down on risks associated with the company. It\u2019s also very possible Apple could partner with other AI companies in the future too, such as Google\u2019s Gemini or more niche providers with certain expertise, such as in healthcare. \u201cI think Apple will take a pragmatic approach to the OpenAI partnership,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf Apple finds that the relationship with OpenAI starts to affect the overall user experience or worse, create challenges around security and data integrity, it might look to add further guardrails, or find other ways to deliver AI-powered content.\u201d A focus on privacy and security Apple has been vocal about how it intends to keep user data private and secure when using its own proprietary technology, noting most AI functions will be done on the phone and inputs will be kept away from a far-off server cloud. \u201cAs we look to build in these incredible new capabilities, we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products, it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you,\u201d Cook said during the keynote. \u201cIt has to be intuitive and easy to use. It has to be deeply integrated into your product experiences.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, it has to be built with privacy, from the ground up,\u201d he added. Apple said it will not share any personal user information with OpenAI, so inquiries made through ChatGPT won\u2019t be linked to an Apple user\u2019s account. And the repeated consent prompt to require users to opt into using ChatGPT with Siri is noteworthy too; each time Siri wants to kick over a question to ChatGPT, it\u2019ll ask for permission first. Wood believes the consent prompts and other guardrails that Apple is implementing \u201creflect its nervousness.\u201d Meanwhile, Reece Hayden, a principal analyst at ABI Research, told CNN that Apple\u2019s approach is smart because it provides customers with a choice of how to deal with their data. \u201cBy providing a phased approach that blends ChatGPT and native capabilities, users will worry less about the partnership,\u201d he said. \u201cApple can also continue to highlight their own AI capabilities and mitigate some of the risks of being associated with OpenAI, which remains in a state of flux.\u201d Industry concerns Companies like OpenAI have acknowledged the serious risks posed by AI \u2014 from manipulation to a loss of control that could potentially result in human extinction \u2014 but many experts, researchers and AI employees believe they should be doing more to educate the public about risks and protective measures. Just last week, a group of OpenAI insiders demanded that artificial intelligence companies be far more transparent about the concerns over the technology they\u2019re building. So it came as no surprise when some industry watchers, including Elon Musk, were quick to react to Apple\u2019s partnership with OpenAI. In a post to X Monday, Musk said he would ban Apple devices at his companies \u2014 which include Tesla, SpaceX and X, among others \u2014 if the iPhone maker went ahead with its AI plans. If Apple \u201cintegrates OpenAI at the (operating system) level,\u201d Musk said that would constitute \u201can unacceptable security violation.\u201d Although concerns over how employees are using AI models is a topic of worldwide discussion at the moment across many industries, Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said Musk\u2019s reaction is a bit misdirected and the topic is not specific to iPhones. \u201cAny employee with a smartphone should follow company policies and not enter any private information into the open domain of ChatGPT,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not specific to the iPhone \u2026 or Tesla.\u201d Andrew Cornwall, senior analyst at Forrester, told CNN he thinks it\u2019s unlikely that Apple users will become loyal to ChatGPT, as many people won\u2019t use the service unless the iPhone maker can\u2019t provide an appropriate response. \u201cWhen users do query ChatGPT, Apple will track the prompts and gather metrics to improve its own models,\u201d he said. \u201cApple may switch providers or even use more than one third party \u2014 until it has mastered its own model. At that point, Apple will shut the garden gate.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/14/tech/apple-openai-partnership/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Here\u2019s the latest: \u2022\u00a0More than 11 million people are under a tornado watch: A tornado watch was issued Sunday for much of New England, including the entire states of Vermont and New Hampshire and parts of New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. The threat continues until 8 p.m. ET for cities including Burlington, Vermont; Albany, New York; Hartford, Connecticut; Providence, Rhode Island; and Portland, Maine, plus the suburbs of Boston. A line of strong thunderstorms could bring tornadoes, damaging winds up to 70 mph and hail the size of ping pong balls, according to the Storm Prediction Center.  \u2022\u00a0Heat wave shifts to mid-Atlantic: As heat alerts persist for over 100 million people over the weekend, the\u00a0extreme heat risk\u00a0will spread from the Ohio Valley on Saturday to the mid-Atlantic on Sunday. Highs across the Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic have been 10 to 15 degrees above average. \u201cAn intense heat wave will continue across the Mid-Atlantic, where record high temperatures are likely. In the West, triple-digit high temperatures are possible in central and southern California, Arizona, and Utah,\u201d the National Weather Service said Sunday on its website. \u2022\u00a0Temperatures break records: Triple-digit heat broiled Baltimore and Washington, DC, on Saturday. The nation\u2019s capital hit the 100-degree mark Saturday \u2014 the first time that\u2019s happened since 2016. It\u2019s also the first time DC has recorded a temperature that high this early in the summer since 2012. Baltimore also hit 101 degrees, breaking the daily record of 100 degrees set back in 1988. The combination of this heat coming early in the summer season and persisting over several days \u201cincreases the level of heat stress for those without reliable air conditioning,\u201d the weather service said. \u2022 Iowa flooding prompts evacuations and disaster proclamation: In Rock Valley, Iowa, all homes north of Highway 18 were evacuated amid high floodwaters Saturday. \u201cI cannot even believe what I\u2019m seeing right now,\u201d said Daniel Heitritter, who evacuated his neighborhood in Spencer on Saturday. As water in his home reached shin-deep, he flagged down a boat to come pick him, his wife and cat up, he said. On Saturday, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for 21 counties in northwest Iowa and directed all available state resources to assist Rock Valley and other communities in response to \u201ccatastrophic flooding.\u201d On Sunday, Reynolds said she submitted a request for an expedited presidential major disaster declaration. She is asking for additional federal assistance for nine counties and public assistance for 22 counties. \u2022\u00a0People rescued from rising water in South Dakota: In Sioux Falls, South Dakota, nine people were rescued from rising water due to heavy rain, according to City Emergency Manager Regan Smith. Emergency personnel responded to five stranded drivers, 30 vehicles stalled in water, 10 calls regarding water problems and 75 traffic accidents, according to Smith. City of Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken on Saturday signed an emergency declaration in response to the flooding. The cumulative rainfall amounts for the Sioux Falls region range from 6.5 to 8 inches over the last 72 hours, TenHaken said. \u2022 Emergency flood operations readied in Minnesota: Parts of Minnesota were under flood warnings Saturday night, prompting Gov. Tim Walz to declare an emergency authorizing the Minnesota National Guard \u201cto be available to provide support for emergency flood operations as areas across the state experience extreme flood conditions,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said. Water in lakes Tetonka and Sakatah has reached \u201cuncontrollable\u201d levels. \u201cResidents have been evacuated and the flood has already caused significant damage,\u201d the governor\u2019s office said. \u201cIntense rain has had catastrophic effects. Flooding has left entire communities under feet of water, causing severe damage to property and numerous road closures,\u201d Walz said in a statement. The warnings were still in effect on Sunday for southern parts of the state, as well as northwest Iowa and southeast South Dakota.  \u2022 New Mexico residents to return home after wildfire: The Salt and South Fork blazes in New Mexico have together burned over 25,300 acres. The South Fork Fire was 31% contained and the Salt Fire was 7% contained as of Sunday morning. Residents of the village of Ruidoso will be allowed to return to their homes Monday, and officials advised them to bring at least a week\u2019s worth of food and drinking water as grocery stores are not operating at full capacity. Although rain in the area could help with fire suppression, it can also cause flooding as well as mud and debris flows\u00a0in the burn scars. Meanwhile, the FBI is offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading them to the cause of the wildfires. \u2022 Storms move into Northeast: Severe thunderstorms were pouring down on areas of New England on Sunday, and a severe thunderstorm watch has been issued for parts of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia until 10 p.m. ET. There is also an excessive risk of rainfall in the Upper Midwest on Monday and Tuesday. New England is facing the potential for damaging winds, a few tornadoes and isolated hail, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Elsewhere, monsoon-like conditions may also produce isolated flash flooding in the Four Corners region, the weather service said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/weather/flooding-upper-midwest-heat-wave-mid-atlantic/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_21_middleeast_israel-west-bank-bezalel-smotrich-settlements-intl-latam", "text": "Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has spoken about preventing the occupied West Bank from becoming a part of an independent Palestinian state, according to leaked audio of a speech he gave earlier this month. Smotrich, a leading far right member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet, said the way to prevent a Palestinian state that would endanger the state of Israel was to develop Jewish settlements. \u201cThe goal is to change the DNA of the system for many, many years,\u201d he told the gathering. The transcript and audio of the speech were provided to CNN by the Israeli NGO Peace Now, which had a representative in the room during the speech. Israel\u2019s Supreme Court defines Israeli control over the West Bank as a temporary military occupation rather than the annexation of territory under a civilian administration. But Smotrich, who lives in a settlement himself, has opposed the creation of an independent Palestinian state. He has also long advocated for the expansion of Jewish settlements that are considered illegal under international law and by much of the international community. Smotrich\u2019s office confirmed Friday that the speech had taken place. In a press release earlier this month, his office said Smotrich would be attending an event about Jewish settlement - and the goal was \u201cpreventing a terrorist state in the heart of the State of Israel.\u201d The press release noted \u201cthe structural changes that the Minister is leading in the Ministry of Defense and the Settlement Directorate that he established in the Ministry.\u201d Smotrich was quoted then as saying: \u201cAfter October 7th it is a consensus in Israeli society. The way is to develop settlements and we are focusing on doing broad structural processes that will result in the State of Israel developing settlements in an orderly manner.\u201d In the audio, Smotrich said that a separate civilian system had been created for the occupied West Bank, even as the Defense Ministry remained in control of the area. \u201cWe created a separate civilian system, there is an office within the Ministry of Defense. There is a minister there. There is an administration there, it\u2019s like an office, there is a CEO for the administration, he is accepted as the CEO of a government office, there is a whole system within the administration,\u201d Smotrich said. As more countries call for an independent Palestinian state, Smotrich spoke about the extensive planning powers of the minister and administration and the prospect of developing mass transit and road systems in the West Bank over the next few years to encourage settlement there. \u201cThis is a revolution: this is how you bring a million people to Judea and Samaria,\u201d Smotrich said, using the term by which many Israelis describe the occupied territory. In his half-hour speech, Smotrich said he was able \u201cto convince the Prime Minister\u201d, Benjamin Netanyahu, about creating a civilian administration in the West Bank. \u201cI will say a good word about him because, to his credit, it will be said that as soon as he understood the event, he was fully with us.\u201d CNN is reaching out to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office for a response. The official position of the government is that the status of the West Bank is subject to future negotiations. Israel has expanded settlements in the occupied West Bank over decades despite signing a series of peace agreements with the Palestinians in the 1990s, called the Oslo Accords, that envisaged the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza as part of a negotiated resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/21/middleeast/israel-west-bank-bezalel-smotrich-settlements-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_20_style_holocaust-survivor-vogue-germany-scli-intl", "text": "A 102-year-old Holocaust survivor whose family was murdered at Auschwitz is the cover star for the July/August edition of Vogue Germany. Margot Friedl\u00e4nder, n\u00e9e Bendheim, was born in Berlin in 1921. According to a brief bio on the website of Berlin\u2019s Jewish Museum, Friedl\u00e4nder spent the early part of the war with her mother and younger brother Ralph after her parents separated. They had plans to flee the country but in 1943 her brother was arrested by the Gestapo. Their mother confronted the Gestapo, which led to her being deported to Auschwitz with her son, where they were both murdered. But before leaving, she left behind a message for her daughter that read: \u201cTry to make your life.\u201d Friedl\u00e4nder, then just 21 years old, went into hiding but was ultimately betrayed by \u201ccatchers\u201d and was sent to Theresienstadt camp in the then-Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia in 1944, according to the museum. In her interview with Vogue Germany, Friedl\u00e4nder said: \u201cI am grateful. Grateful that I made it. For being able to fulfill my mother\u2019s wish. That I have made my life.\u201d Vogue Germany said they\u2019d met with Friedl\u00e4nder four times this year and that the cover pictures were shot in April at the Botanical Garden in Berlin. Kerstin Weng, head of editorial content at the magazine, said that the theme of the issue was love, featuring their \u201cfavorite pieces, favorite people.\u201d The front of the collector\u2019s issue includes the word \u201clove\u201d written by Friedl\u00e4nder, as well as her signature. The multi-page piece, which includes numerous shots of Friedl\u00e4nder, covers a range of topics, from growing up in Nazi Germany to her commitment as a Holocaust survivor today. Weng said: \u201cThe most positive person I know is on this issue\u2019s cover: Margot Friedl\u00e4nder. To many she is known as a Holocaust survivor. But she not only survived the Nazis, she also overcame betrayal and loss. She would have all reason to be bitter, but remains open-minded and refuses to take sides. She stands up against forgetting and for humanity and togetherness. \u201cAt 102, she seeks to engage with the younger generation and proves that dialogue is still possible.\u201d \u2018Carry my story onward\u2019 Friedl\u00e4nder met her future husband, Adolf, while in the Nazi concentration camp, and married him soon after liberation. The pair emigrated to the US in 1946 and lived in New York for more than six decades. But in 2010, following her husband\u2019s death aged 88, Friedl\u00e4nder moved back to Berlin. Ever since, she has been campaigning as a Holocaust educator. Her tireless efforts have earnt her numerous awards, including the Federal Cross of Merit First Class. Friedl\u00e4nder told Vogue Germany that she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the growth of right-wing populism and the rise of antisemitic attacks. When addressing the issue of society becoming more polarized, she said: \u201cLook not toward what separates us. Look towards what bring us together. Be People. Be sensible.\u201d Grateful for the opportunity to pass on her message, she said: \u201cYou will carry my story onward. That this never comes to happen again.\u201d Although more than 100 years old, Friedl\u00e4nder is not Vogue\u2019s oldest cover model.

{"id": "travel_best-towns-america-2024-intro", "text": "You\u2019ve elbowed into the Empire State Building, admired the architecture along the Chicago River and huffed and puffed up and down the streets of San Francisco. Big US cities have attractions in spades \u2014 and crowds, too. This summer, we\u2019re looking at smaller cities that aren\u2019t already at the top of everyone\u2019s travel list \u2014 places where you\u2019ll often find small-town vibes and loads of personality as well as plenty to see and do for a few days or more. At CNN Travel, we tapped our network of contributors for nominations for our inaugural list of America\u2019s Best Towns to Visit. We evaluated their favorites and winnowed the finalists to 10 by looking at each town\u2019s attractions, food and beverage offerings, nightlife and cultural scene, sense of identity, proximity to other interesting spots and wow factor. We also looked at travel essentials, including lodging options and the ease of getting there and around. Our choices range in size from about 50,000 residents to about 225,000. They\u2019re spread across the country and serve as a reminder of what\u2019s great about the United States: communities committed to making their towns better. You\u2019ll see that spirit in revitalized neighborhoods and downtowns and in residents who have put all their passion, creativity and know-how into endeavors that feed souls and bellies. Here are our 2024 picks: 10. Duluth, Minnesota High scores: Cool lakeside setting, outdoor activities, beverage scene A small city best known over the years as an industrial, ore-shipping port on the Great Lakes, Duluth is now gaining a reputation as a refuge from the climate crisis. Its summers are typically quite temperate thanks to its setting alongside Lake Superior. The hilly city offers plenty of outdoor activities, a great beer scene, a cluster of lakeside attractions and a revitalized neighborhood showcasing handmade goods. You can join friendly Duluthians in a community sauna followed by a dip in cool Amity Creek. 9. Knoxville, Tennessee High scores: Down-to-earth vibe, live music, outdoor access You may know Knoxville as home of the University of Tennessee and its orange-and-white tsunami of fandom during sports events. Or you may know it as the host of the 1982 World\u2019s Fair and its distinctive glass tower. But did you know this eastern Tennessee city also offers a burgeoning music scene (watch out Nashville and Memphis!), delightful classic theaters and delicious eats? And there\u2019s a 1,500-acre Urban Wilderness for easy access to outdoor adventure. 8. Grand Rapids, Michigan High scores: Art and design, beer scene, outdoor activities With a world-class sculpture park and public art all over town, Grand Rapids is far more than \u201cBeer City USA.\u201d But with more than 100 breweries, distilleries and cideries, Michigan\u2019s second-largest city comes by its beverage moniker honestly. Museums showcase Grand Rapids\u2019 deep design roots, while the Grand River nods to its family-friendly outdoor assets. And a planned amphitheater along the river\u2019s banks is just part of a bigger waterfront revitalization effort. 7. Macon, Georgia High scores: Musical heritage, cultural attractions, architecture With museums and a revived studio dedicated to its musical heritage, Macon scores high on cultural attractions and the sorts of local institutions that remain beloved for generations. Macon\u2019s revitalized downtown has made way for new restaurants, bars and a boutique hotel. And with a push to turn a site holding thousands of years of history into Georgia\u2019s first US national park and preserve co-managed by the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, the city is paying attention to how its earliest history speaks to its future. 6. Flagstaff, Arizona High scores: Dark skies, outdoor activities, scenery, retro vibe Sunny days and starry nights are big draws in this high-elevation city. Enjoying lovely landscapes and the wonders of the cosmos is easy in Flagstaff, thanks to the San Francisco Peaks, numerous national monuments, the Lowell Observatory and Flagstaff\u2019s status as a Dark Sky City. Route 66 runs through here, where retro hotels cater to travelers stopping in, and downtown has seen a renaissance. The area\u2019s Native American history is another reason to visit. 5. San Luis Obispo, California High scores: Gorgeous scenery, retro vibe, outdoor activities, wineries If you\u2019re dreaming of old-school, relaxed California vibes, the super-pricey Bay Area and traffic-choked Southern California wouldn\u2019t be it. But there\u2019s a place figuratively and literally in between that\u2019s a delightful throwback to the chill, 20th-century Golden State. After all, they don\u2019t call San Luis Obispo \u201cSLO\u201d for nothin\u2019. Here, you can indulge in everything from wine trails to hiking trails without a crush of humanity. The stunning natural environment, with the Pacific nearby, is the cherry on top. 4. Portland, Maine High scores: Next-level food scene, coastal setting, outdoor access This historic harbor town offers some seriously up-to-date dining alongside classics reflecting Maine\u2019s status as the US lobster capital. The food scene here has put it squarely on the map as a culinary destination, with two new James Beard Awards just added to the city\u2019s collection. You\u2019ll also find a booming craft beer scene and tons of opportunities to get out onto the water or into the woods. Strolling the bustling center offers a window onto centuries of maritime history and a Victorian-era rebirth. 3. Tacoma, Washington High scores: Stunning setting, outdoor access, arts scene City settings don\u2019t get much better than this. Tacoma\u2019s location between Puget Sound and Mount Rainier makes for exceptional outdoor recreation in and around town. There are some pretty spectacular sights in the city, too, thanks to Dale Chihuly, the art glass master and Tacoma native.\u00a0At the Museum of Glass, exhibits and glassblowers at work in its hot shop tell the story of the medium. And flightseeing tours will give you a good look at the sacred ancestral lands of the Puyallup Tribe. 2. Providence, Rhode Island High scores: Art, architecture, design, food scene Providence\u2019s dazzling downtown riverfront exists thanks to decades of ambitious work relocating rivers and roads to beautify and preserve the city. Downtown\u2019s rivers have been dancing in the firelight of beloved art installation WaterFire for decades, and public art is everywhere. The city is also home to the renowned Rhode Island School of Design and its museum. Architecture buffs will find plenty to admire, and Providence\u2019s culinary history (with top-notch seafood and Italian cuisine) and diverse restaurants mean you\u2019ll be treated to a global feast. 1. Richmond, Virginia High scores: Cultural attractions, dining and drinks, intriguing neighborhoods Richmond, Virginia \u2013 or \u201cRVA\u201d \u2013 deserves more of the national attention enjoyed by that other capital city a couple of hours to the north. Richmond earns high scores for its top-notch museums and dynamic neighborhoods, and it\u2019s taking a hard look at its complicated history. Plus, it\u2019s got a diverse, chef-driven food scene, more than 30 breweries and ready access to surrounding wine country. And there\u2019s a nearly year-round lineup of festivals \u2014 mark your calendars for the Richmond Folk Festival in the fall.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/best-towns-america-2024-intro/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

In truth, the host could and should have extended its lead but failed to make the most of the numerous chances that came its way. Balogun did think he had scored a third for the US, but his 53rd-minute effort was ruled out for an offside in the build up. Tougher tests to come The US will face Panama in its next Group C match before facing a much sterner text against Uruguay in its final group game. Despite boasting several talented players, including the likes of Timothy Weah, Pulisic and Balogun, serious questions remain about whether the US men can consistently be competitive against teams outside of its CONCACAF bubble.

Video shows the man lying across the front of the Israeli jeep as it drove through a neighborhood of Jenin. The man appeared\u00a0slumped\u00a0on the hood of the vehicle as it drove past Palestinian Red Crescent\u00a0(PRCS)\u00a0ambulances. The PRCS said the Israeli military had prevented its crews from providing first aid to an injured man in the Jabarat area of Jenin. \u201cThey then placed the injured person on the front of a military jeep and detained him before later allowing our crews to transfer him to the hospital,\u201d the PRCS said. The man\u2019s condition and identity are unknown. In response to questions about the incident,\u00a0the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)\u00a0said Saturday that its forces violated \u201corders and standard operating procedures\u201d and an investigation would be launched. \u201cThe conduct of the forces in the video of the incident does not conform to the values of the IDF. The incident will be investigated and dealt with accordingly,\u201d the IDF said in a statement. The IDF said the incident happened Saturday morning during counterterrorism operations to apprehend suspects in the Wadi Burqin area west of Jenin. It said the man was a suspect who was injured and apprehended after an exchange of fire. He was transferred to the Red Crescent to receive medical treatment, the Israeli military added. There has been an uptick in violence\u00a0in the occupied West Bank since the start of Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza began in October, following the militant group\u2019s unprecedented and deadly attacks on Israel. More than 500 Palestinians, including over 100 children, have been killed in the West Bank since October 7, according to the United Nations\u00a0Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\u00a0(OCHA). Almost three quarters of those fatalities took place during operations by Israeli forces, the UN agency said. As well as Israeli military raids in the West Bank, there has been an increase in violence carried out by Israeli settlers against Palestinians. More than 700,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in settlements that are considered illegal under international law and widely seen as one of the main obstacles to a two-state solution. Last Friday, the Biden administration imposed sanctions on the Israeli group Tzav 9 for disrupting humanitarian convoys headed to Gaza, the latest punitive measure taken under an executive order targeting those perpetrating violence in the West Bank.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/middleeast/west-bank-jenin-israeli-military-palestinian-man-jeep-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_20_middleeast_hagari-netanyahu-destroy-hamas-israel-intl", "text": "Israel\u2019s top military spokesman has said Hamas cannot be made to \u201cdisappear,\u201d casting doubt about whether the government\u2019s war aim of defeating the militant group can be achieved and drawing a sharp rebuke from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cThe idea that it is possible to destroy Hamas, to make Hamas vanish \u2014 that is throwing sand in the eyes of the public,\u201d Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Wednesday in an interview with Israel\u2019s Channel 13. Hagari\u2019s comments prompted a terse response from Netanyahu\u2019s office, which said Israel\u2019s security cabinet \u201chas defined the destruction of Hamas\u2019 military and governing capabilities\u201d as one of the aims of its war in Gaza. \u201cThe IDF, of course, is committed to this,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said. The IDF later sought to clarify Hagari\u2019s remarks, confirming it is committed to the government\u2019s war goals and claiming that Hagari was only referring to Hamas \u201cas an ideology and as an idea.\u201d Despite the IDF\u2019s attempt to soften Hagari\u2019s remarks, cracks appear to be deepening between the Israeli government and its military. Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from members of his government and Israel\u2019s allies, including the United States, to devise a strategy for the post-war governance of Gaza after Israel\u2019s devastating bombardment of the isolated enclave. In response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks on Israel, when militants killed more than 1,200 people and took some 250 others hostage, Israel launched its war in Gaza with the primary goals of recovering the hostages, destroying Hamas\u2019 ability to govern there and ensuring another attack could not be launched from the Palestinian territory. But after eight months of war, and with the prospect of many more to come, Hagari\u2019s comments echoed the growing fears that Israel\u2019s military campaign may be unable to achieve those aims and that the group could remain a potent ideological force, despite Netanyahu\u2019s claim to have killed more than 14,000 Hamas fighters. CNN cannot independently verify that figure. \u201cTelling the public that there will be no terror in Gaza, no military operatives, no rockets and no armed men is a lie,\u201d Hagari said in a separate interview with CNN affiliate Kan 11. \u201cThere will be terror in Gaza. Hamas is an idea, deeply rooted in the hearts of the residents of Gaza.\u00a0To replace those who handle civil services and distribute or steal food, something else needs to be established. This is a decision for the political echelon, and the army will implement it.\u201d In a sign that Israel\u2019s cabinet may be tempering its initial war aims of destroying Hamas in its entirety, government spokesperson David Mencer said that eliminating Hamas\u2019 \u201cmilitary and government capabilities\u201d does not \u201cnecessarily mean\u201d killing every member of the group. Mencer told reporters Thursday that Hagari\u2019s comments had not harmed the war effort, but stressed it was the military\u2019s responsibility to carry out \u201cthe will of the elected government.\u201d During discussions about the US-backed ceasefire plan, Netanayhu also appeared to have retreated from his maximalist rhetoric at the war\u2019s outset. A statement issued last week \u2013 reportedly from the Prime Minister\u2019s office \u2013 said Israel will not end the war \u201cbefore achieving all its war objectives: destroying Hamas\u2019s military and governing capabilities, freeing all the hostages and ensuring Gaza doesn\u2019t pose a threat to Israel in the future.\u201d The statement did not reference Netanyahu\u2019s oft-repeated promise of total victory, nor the elimination of Hamas in full. Hagari\u2019s comments sparked the latest in a growing series of public disagreements between Israel\u2019s government and military. Last weekend, the IDF announced a daily \u201ctactical pause\u201d of military activity along a route in southern Gaza to allow aid to be distributed \u2013 a decision that rankled Netanyahu, an Israeli official told CNN. Netanyahu contacted his military secretary and said the idea was unacceptable, but later backed down after being assured the fighting in Rafah would continue, according to the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The IDF\u2019s decision to implement tactical pauses also drew fierce criticism from the increasingly rancorous far-right wing of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said whoever made the decision \u201cis evil and a fool who should not continue to be in his position.\u201d An IDF spokesperson later told CNN the decision for the \u201ctactical pause\u201d was approved by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. While Israel has had some success in returning those abducted on October 7 \u2013 both through a ceasefire-for-hostage deal in November and a daring rescue operation to retrieve four people earlier this month \u2013  hope that Israel will be able to return the hostages may also be dwindling. A senior Hamas official told CNN he has \u201cno idea\u201d how many of the 120 remaining hostages in Gaza are still alive, and that any deal to release them must include guarantees of a permanent ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/20/middleeast/hagari-netanyahu-destroy-hamas-israel-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_23_middleeast_egypt-hajj-tourism-companies-revoke-licenses-intl", "text": "Saudi Arabia said Sunday that more than 1,300 people died on this year\u2019s Hajj pilgrimage \u2013 with \u201cnumerous cases\u201d due to heat stress and \u201cunauthorized\u201d trips accounting for more than four out of five of the fatalities. \u201cThe health system addressed numerous cases of heat stress this year, with some individuals still under care. Regrettably, the number of mortalities reached 1,301,\u201d the Saudi government said in a statement as it released its first official figures. The statement said 83% of those who died were \u201cunauthorized to perform Hajj\u201d and \u201cwalked long distances under direct sunlight, without adequate shelter or comfort.\u201d There were \u201cseveral elderly and chronically ill individuals\u201d among the deceased, it said, adding that the families of all the dead had now been identified. Extreme heat has been named as a main factor behind the hundreds of deaths and injuries reported this year during the Hajj. Mecca, the holy city that is central for Hajj pilgrims, saw temperatures soar to a record-setting 125 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday. Various authorities have also said the problems have been compounded by the number of unofficial pilgrimages. Saudi Arabia requires each pilgrim to acquire one of the 1.8 million available licenses to legally access Mecca. These licenses can cost several thousand US dollars. Unlicensed pilgrims typically don\u2019t travel in organized tour buses with air conditioning or easy access to water and food supplies. The Saudi government also appeared to suggest the unauthorized nature of many of the trips had been a factor in how long it had taken to issue an official death toll as this had complicated the identification process. \u201cIdentification completed, despite the initial lack of personal information or identification documents. Proper processes were followed for identification, burial, and honoring the deceased, with death certificates provided,\u201d the statement said. Some pilgrims have lamented the poor infrastructure and organization of this year\u2019s Hajj. Even pilgrims on official tours spend the bulk of their day walking outdoors in the scorching heat. Some witnesses have told CNN of how they saw worshipers losing consciousness and walked past bodies covered in white cloth. Egypt to clamp down on illegal pilgrimages The announcement from Saudi Arabia comes as the Egyptian government vowed to revoke the licenses of 16 Hajj tourism companies involved in making illegal pilgrimages to Mecca and refer the company\u2019s managers to the public prosecutor amid fears hundreds of Egyptians are among the dead. Egypt\u2019s decision was made in a cabinet meeting on Saturday after a report highlighted the dubious nature of how some tourism companies operate. The official toll among Egyptians stands at 31, but it is being reported by Reuters news agency and other outlets that as many as 500 to 600 Egyptians died during the pilgrimage. The report, which was reviewed by cabinet, said some operators had not issued correct visas, so holders could not enter the holy city of Mecca and were instead forced to enter \u201cthrough desert paths on foot.\u201d It also accused some companies of failing to provide proper accommodation, leaving tourists exposed to the heat. In the meeting, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly offered his \u201csincere condolences and sympathy\u201d to the families of the deceased pilgrims committing to providing them with the necessary support. Hajj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and Saudi Arabia requires each pilgrim to acquire one of the 1.8 million available licenses to legally access Mecca. But as the cost of one of these licences costs several thousand US dollars, many pilgrims try to access the site illegally and typically don\u2019t travel in organized tour buses with air conditioning or easy access to water and food supplies. The timing of the Hajj is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar which this year has fallen during scorching temperatures in Saudi Arabia. Pilgrims made this year\u2019s journey in extreme temperatures of up to 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit). Ahmed, a 44-year-old from Indonesia, told CNN he saw many people falling ill and even dying from the heat. \u201cAlong the way home, I saw many pilgrims who died. Almost every few hundred meters, there was a body lying and covered with an ihrom [white fabric] cloth.\u201d \u201cEvery time there is a distribution of water from local residents or certain groups, it is immediately overrun by the pilgrims,\u201d he added, saying that he didn\u2019t see health workers or a single ambulance along the road. As part of the pilgrimage, the faithful perform a series of rituals in and around the holy city of Mecca, often involving many hours of walking in the scorching heat every day. The exact death toll for the total number of deaths in this year\u2019s Hajj may still rise, as governments are only aware of pilgrims who have registered and travelled to Mecca as part of their country\u2019s quota.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/middleeast/egypt-hajj-tourism-companies-revoke-licenses-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_24_americas_migration-us-mexico-border-tohono-oodham-intl-latam", "text": "The thermometer hit 111 Fahrenheit\u00a0as we rolled up to a battered tent deep in the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation reservation in Arizona.\u00a0Under its shade lay around a dozen dazed looking families, many with small children.\u00a0A stressed-looking mother of two paced back and forth. They had walked for five hours to get here, and had been waiting all day. But they looked at us \u2013 and the\u00a0tribal dignitaries\u00a0on whose land they were trespassing \u2013 with only mild curiosity.\u00a0They were asylum seekers, looking for the green uniforms of US Border Patrol so that they could turn themselves in. Chairman Verlon Jose, leader of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, considered addressing them, and then turned away. \u201cThis is nothing that the nation can solve,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever I say to them is not even going to be relevant, other than our prayers for their journey.\u201d The Tohono O\u2019odham, or \u201cpeople of the desert,\u201d have lived in the Sonoran desert for thousands of years, their\u00a0ancestral\u00a0homelands stretching from what is now Pima County, Arizona, all the way to Mexico\u2019s Sea of Cortez. The\u00a0US-Mexico border now slices across those lands, a 62-mile line of low metal fencing weaves between ancient saguaro cacti and\u00a0that\u00a0marks the southern limit of the\u00a0Nation\u2019s\u00a0federal Indian reservation\u00a0\u2013 and the edge of the United States. The Tohono O\u2019odham do not recognize this border; enrolled members speak their own language, live on both sides and travel back and forth. But it has become impossible to ignore amid\u00a0record numbers of migrants crossing into the US from Mexico\u00a0and a bitter political storm over what to do with them. You could drive for miles on the sprawling Tohono O\u2019odham reservation without encountering anyone beside the free-ranging cattle. But for decades, migrants and asylum seekers, northbound drug smugglers and southbound arms traffickers, and US Border Patrol agents have roamed here in endless pursuit across the rocky terrain. The toll of all this traffic on the environment is obvious; discarded clothes, trash, diapers and even ID cards line the border. In December, during the peak of recent border crossings, thousands of asylum seekers camped out on\u00a0the Nation\u2019s territory, burning the reservation\u2019s wild mesquite trees for warmth as they waited to be apprehended. The sight of the broken branches, piles of abandoned plastic bottles and human waste left in the migrants\u2019 wake was heartbreaking to the tribe, Jose told CNN. \u201cYour heart feels for the migrants and so forth like that\u2026 but then other part says look at the destruction that they\u2019re causing us\u2026 look at the trash that they\u2019re leaving,\u201d Jose told CNN. The chairman and Arizona governor Katie Hobbs\u00a0wrote in a joint letter to the federal government last year requesting ramped up staffing and resources from the US Customs and Border\u00a0Protection (CBP)\u00a0to deal with the surge. But the\u00a0Nation\u2019s\u00a0longstanding reliance on the federal government to enforce the border means an uneasy trade of tribal sovereignty for security. Border\u00a0police have had violent run-ins with members, and the thought of a potential border wall is seen as a travesty here \u2013 a mutilation of the land itself. \u201cAll we want is safe passage to our traditional homes, to our sacred areas. The drug activity, the migrant activity is going to go on and go on. And we\u2019re caught in the middle of this,\u201d Jose said. Strangers in the desert The Tohono O\u2019odham reservation\u00a0is part of Arizona\u2019s Tucson sector and\u00a0one of the busiest immigration sectors in the country in both apprehensions of border crossers and marijuana seizures, according to the Customs and Border\u00a0Protection\u00a0website. Across the sprawling reservation, the tribe works closely with CBP, providing land for checkpoints, forward operating bases, surveillance infrastructure, and putting forward indigenous-led special units that investigate and track drug smuggling. The\u00a0Nation says that it spends an average of $3 million annually to assist with border security. Still, strangers walk onto the reservation all the time. In the small southern community of\u00a0Menagers\u00a0Dam, just a 15 minute walk from the border, people turn up asking for water or a phone, others march straight into homes to raid their kitchens, said Annette Mattia, 61, who lives in the village. Some\u00a0Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u00a0members put out water or food for the migrants, others are afraid to. Some members have been involved in smuggling themselves, she says. \u201cWe\u2019re always calling (Border Patrol) because where we live is a bushy area with the trees still there and everything. And that was like the gateway for smugglers. You can just go walk in our yard and in the little trees, and you\u2019ll find the slipper shoes the smugglers use, or their camouflage clothes,\u201d she says. Still, seeing Border Patrol\u2019s trucks and helicopters on the reservation and frequent questioning by agents also makes many\u00a0of the Nation\u2019s residents\u00a0bristle. \u201cIf you decide to go out into the mountains for the day, if you want to pick the cactus fruit or get materials from the desert, Border Patrol will be out there, and they will be on you: \u2018What are you doing here, why are you out here?\u2019,\u201d Annette Mattia told CNN. \u201cYou know, this is our reservation. It\u2019s our nation. We can go hunting if we want to go hunting, we can gather if we want to gather,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re here because the border\u2019s here.\u201d A deadly landscape Sprawling across 2.8\u00a0million acres, it\u2019s easy to imagine getting lost in this desert reservation. Massive rock formations are the only landmarks, rising between low plains dotted with dry shrubs and cactus forests. Many migrants who cross here never make it out alive; the remains of at least 1,650 people have been found across the Tohono O\u2019odham reservation since 2000, according to local organization Humane Borders, which\u00a0works with the Pima County Medical Examiner\u2019s office to track deaths. Last year, the bodies of 81 people were found on the reservation, according to Humane Borders. So far in 2024, 10 bodies have been found here, according to the Humane Borders map, all discovered on the San Miguel corridor \u2013 the same route where we met dozens of people waiting with children as young as toddlers. Most, but not all, are reduced to skeletons in the arid desert. In May, one unidentified man found close to the border was found \u201cfully fleshed\u201d \u2013 he had\u00a0died from heat exposure within a day of being found, according to the county medical examiner\u2019s report. In February, the body of a 22-year-old woman was found on the Baboquivari Peak\u00a0mountain range; she was the victim of blunt force injuries, the medical examiner assessed. Summer is the deadliest time for border crossings. But while migration through the Sonoran Desert has historically slowed during these searing months, that\u2019s no longer the case today, a CBP spokesperson told CNN; human traffickers who\u2019ve made a business of promising asylum in America now push migrants through the border year-round in order to maximize profits. Demand for traffickers is high, despite the risks \u2013 which migrants may not always understand. Since the pandemic, people fleeing stuttering economies, climate change, crime and authoritarian governments have flocked to the US southern border, a CBP spokesperson told CNN \u2013 nearly all those journeys were facilitated by criminal groups. \u201cNo one crosses on their own anymore,\u201d the spokesperson told CNN. Cartels\u2019 grip on the border area is near-complete, he confirmed; attempting to cross the Mexican side of the desert into the US without paying is another way to end up dead. Migrants sent one way, drugs another Today, faced with vast numbers of asylum seekers in a blistering landscape, the day-to-day work of Border Patrol often ends up being humanitarian. In the Tucson Sector, Border Patrol agents perform dozens of rescues each week, according to statistics posted online by the agency, and frequently end up treating dehydrated or injured migrants in the desert. Even more often, agents simply ferry families from the desolate border where asylum seekers politely wait to be apprehended, to detention centers further inland \u2013 a task that one agent likened with annoyance to babysitting or Uber driving. Some describe with nostalgia a Wild West version of their jobs from decades past, chasing drug runners across a dramatic landscape. \u201cBack in the day when it was just single males with a lot of narcotics, it was dangerous but kind of exciting,\u201d said the agent, who requested anonymity because he did not have permission to speak publicly. \u201cSecure the border. We didn\u2019t have to babysit. We were up in the mountains getting narcotics and stuff, chasing gun traffickers, drugs. But now it\u2019s moms and infants. It sucks. Nobody wants to deal with a mama and baby.\u201d Border Patrol agents and Nation\u00a0members say migrants, on whom so much national attention is focused, are often used as a distraction for law enforcement on the reservation. Cartels funnel large groups toward remote areas that are difficult and time-consuming to reach, in addition to being more dangerous for the travelers, while smugglers trek with drug-loaded backpacks\u00a0up another route. \u201cThe cartels want migrants to cross in rural areas to pull us away, so drugs and stuff can make it through while we\u2019re busy\u2026 You\u2019ve got to drive the freaking 30 or 40 minutes out there, pick them up, drive 30 or 40 minutes back. You ain\u2019t got time to go chase three or four people with backpacks walking through the desert,\u201d the agent told CNN. Urban crossing areas are also often more closely patrolled than the desert wilds and are more likely to be blocked by a towering steel barrier, unlike these lands. Mike Wilson, a Tohono O\u2019odham Nation\u00a0member who has gained celebrity in human rights circles for years spent putting out water for migrants on the reservation, says many of the deaths on the reservation were predictable. In a recently published memoir, \u201cWhat Side Are You On?\u201d Wilson blames a US border policy of deterrence \u2013 blocking irregular migration at urban crossing points \u2013 for driving asylum seekers into Tohono O\u2019odham lands and the most perilous parts of the desert. The strategy, which originated in the 1990s, included a calculation that deaths resulting from the dangerous trek would deter future migrants. The number of illegal border crossings has risen since then. Security vs. sovereignty Frustrations over the border here came to a head last year, when Annette\u2019s brother Raymond Mattia was shot and killed by a group of Border Patrol agents at his home. Nothing to do with immigration \u2013 they\u00a0were supposed to be backing up a local Tohono O\u2019odham police unit\u00a0that was looking into a 911 call reporting two gunshots had been heard. Footage from\u00a0the agents\u2019 body cameras\u00a0showed their flashlights casting through the dark of the Arizona desert, choppily illuminating saguaro cacti and low shrubs in the neighborhood in search of movement in the area, before noticing the unarmed 58-year-old \u00a0standing in his front yard. Obeying agents\u2019 orders, he removed his hand from his pocket, withdrawing a cell phone. They began firing immediately. \u201cI thought they were yelling and shouting at illegals,\u201d she recalled, describing their attitude as a \u201chyped up and ready to hunt.\u201d \u201cThey had flashlights going like crazy, shouting, yelling at each other, and I was like, \u2018What the heck is going on?\u2019 Then I realized they were going to Ray\u2019s house.\u201d It is unclear if Raymond Mattia was the person they were looking for; authorities made no allegations following the incident. The US Attorney\u2019s Office in Arizona has chosen not to press charges over the killing, prompting the Mattia family to launch a wrongful death lawsuit. But holding border agents to account has been\u00a0increasingly hard to do following\u00a0a 2022 Supreme Court ruling\u00a0that gave federal agents broad legal protection against claims of excessive force. \u201cI know they\u2019re here to protect the border: for the terrorists, the immigrants, the smugglers. But when they\u2019re coming to the reservation to shoot a Native American person who is at home, they should be accountable for that kind of action,\u201d Annette Mattia said. In a statement last year criticizing the US Attorney\u2019s decision not to prosecute, Jose linked Mattia\u2019s death to a larger failing of border management. \u201cThe US government\u2019s refusal to enact sensible border solutions has brought undue hardship to O\u2019odham and other border communities,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile politicians waste time debating walls and other ineffective and divisive ideas, our people are persecuted\u00a0and in this case, killed by federal agents.\u201d The chairman sees the federal approach toward the border as all too focused on maintaining an imaginary line and scoring political points, and expressed frustration\u00a0with the failure of Congress to find a bigger-picture, bipartisan solution\u00a0\u2013 something that in recent weeks has led the Biden administration to rely on executive orders instead. \u201cWhy would we want to protect a border? We want to protect the environment. We want to protect the people. We want to protect the communities around here,\u201d\u00a0Jose said. That\u2019s his mandate from Nation\u00a0elders, he said. What the US should do, he said, is focus on \u201ckicking its drug habit\u201d to shrink demand for smuggled narcotics, and widen sustainable immigration pathways for economic migrants that allow them to come, work and eventually leave. Still, as long as migrants keep coming here, so will Border Patrol \u2013 and the tribal government has been clear that it wants the federal agency to handle the immediate crisis. New buildings designed to serve as sleeping and living quarters for Border Patrol agents are currently being built on the reservation. Standing on the border halfway up a mountain, where the low posts that mark the border stop, and the rocks and dry shrubs flow seamlessly between the US and Mexico, Jose was clear on his own red line: While much is out of the Nation\u2019s\u00a0hands, he will resist any kind of border wall \u2013 a prospect that has haunted the nation since the Trump administration, and which looms again with the former President\u2019s reelection bid. From his view, the very first migrant surge started at Plymouth Rock. \u201cIf ever there was a time to build a wall,\u201d he said, \u201cit would have been 500 years ago.\u201d Edited by CNN\u2019s Rachel Clarke in Atlanta.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/americas/migration-us-mexico-border-tohono-oodham-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned.

{"id": "2024_06_23_middleeast_netanyahu-israel-us-weapons-spat-intl", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended his decision to go public about delays in the supply of weapons from the United States, saying months of private discussions did not yield any results. At the beginning of a cabinet meeting Sunday, Netanyahu said that \u201cafter months of no change in this situation, I decided to give it a public expression. I did this based on years of experience, and knowing that this step is essential to extracting the cork.\u201d Netanyahu claimed on Tuesday that the Biden administration was \u201cwithholding weapons\u201d in a video posted to X, claiming that Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u201cassured me that the administration is working day and night to remove these bottlenecks.\u201d In response, US envoy Amos Hochstein told Netanyahu that his comments were \u201cunproductive\u201d and \u201cmore importantly, completely untrue.\u201d While not the first time Netanyahu has publicly lambasted the Biden administration\u00a0in the course of the Israel-Hamas war, the dispute comes as the stakes around the war in Gaza and a potential further conflict between Israel and Hezbollah remain high. The US remains Israel\u2019s most important ally and biggest supplier of arms but has voiced increasing concern over the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza. Speaking during the meeting Sunday, Netanyahu said: \u201cAbout four months ago, there was a dramatic drop in the supply of armaments arriving from the US to Israel. For weeks we asked our American friends to speed up the shipments. We did it time and time again.\u201d \u201cWe did it at the highest levels, and at all levels, and I want to emphasize - we did it in private rooms. We got all sorts of explanations, but one thing we didn\u2019t get: the basic situation didn\u2019t change.\u201d Netanyahu went on to say that \u201cin light of what I have heard in the last day, I hope and believe that this issue will be resolved in the near future.\u201d Israeli defense minister heads to the US Amid the dispute, Israeli\u00a0Defense\u00a0Minister\u00a0Yoav Gallant on Sunday reiterated the importance of Israel\u2019s relations with Washington ahead of a visit where he is scheduled to meet his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin, Blinken and other senior US officials. \u201cThe United States is our most important and central ally. Our ties are crucial and perhaps more important than ever, at this time,\u201d Gallant told reporters, according to a statement from the\u00a0Israeli\u00a0defense\u00a0ministry. Gallant is set to discuss Israel\u2019s war against Hamas and \u201cefforts to ensure the return of the hostages\u201d as well as \u201cmeasures required to achieve regional stability,\u201d according to the statement. The Israeli defense minister has clashed with Netanyahu, who is facing an ongoing battle to keep his government together. While Gallant - a retired general - went public earlier this year and said there should be no Israeli rule in post-war Gaza, far-right members of the cabinet oppose any future independent Palestinian state. In his statement, Gallant spoke of the transition to a \u201cPhase C\u201d in Gaza. It\u2019s unclear whether he was referring to a different stage in the fighting or how to prepare for post conflict.

{"id": "travel_knoxville-tennessee-best-towns-america", "text": "Knoxville residents have a slogan for their city: Keep Knoxville scruffy. It\u2019s a tongue-in-cheek response to a slight from a Wall Street Journal reporter writing about Knoxville\u2019s ultimately successful bid to host the 1982 World\u2019s Fair. When he referred to this locale as \u201ca scruffy little city,\u201d residents decided to wear the insult as a badge of honor \u2013 and still do. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be fancy and polished,\u201d goes the thinking. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of our patina. It\u2019s so much more interesting.\u201d Not to mention friendly. \u201cI came here for college in 1987 and never left,\u201d says Tanya Kanczuzewski, a locally based marketing director. \u201cThis is a strong community town. Anywhere you go, people are happy to stop and have a conversation, point you in the right direction, or give you tidbits of advice. Other than the traffic on I-40, it doesn\u2019t feel overwhelming here like bigger cities.\u201d Knoxville\u2019s tallest building is 27 stories, yet it has a distinctive skyline thanks to the Sunsphere, a golden glass ball 75 feet in diameter sitting atop a 198-foot steel tower that was built for the aforementioned World\u2019s Fair. The glass contains 24-karat gold dust, making the sphere glow when the sun hits it. The observation deck inside provides a 365-degree view, including the Great Smoky Mountains to the south. A welcome center is currently under construction on the level below the observation deck. Another huge ball of note is the 30-foot tall, 10-ton basketball (the world\u2019s largest) outside the Women\u2019s Basketball Hall of Fame. This is the only facility of its kind devoted to all levels of women\u2019s basketball, and it\u2019s here for good reason. Knoxville is home to the wildly popular University of Tennessee Lady Vols basketball team and was also home to legendary coach Pat Summitt, whose 1,098 career wins were the most in Division I college basketball history \u2013 for men\u2019s or women\u2019s teams \u2013 at her retirement in 2012. The city also goes crazy for the university\u2019s football team, which plays in the perpetually sold-out 102,000-seat Neyland Stadium. On fall game days, everything is awash in orange and white, the university\u2019s colors. (Knoxville has no pro sports teams, but the AA baseball team \u2014 the Knoxville Smokies, a minor league affiliate of the Chicago Cubs \u2014 will get a boost when they open their 2025 season in a new, multipurpose stadium on the edge of downtown). The university is central to the city\u2019s history. James White, the founder of Knoxville, set up a fort and some cabins in 1786 in the Great Valley at the headwaters of the Tennessee River, on lands that were hunting grounds of the Cherokee Indians. The settlement was known as Knoxville by 1791, and by 1794, the town was home to Blount College. Today, it\u2019s known as the University of Tennessee. \u2018Best sound\u2019 around Market Square, Knoxville\u2019s most popular gathering place, is a pedestrian plaza in the heart of downtown that offers eclectic boutiques, restaurants and rooftop bars. There\u2019s a farmer\u2019s market here from late spring to early fall, free concerts (including jazz performed by the Knoxville Jazz Orchestra) in summer and an ice-skating rink in winter. The Gay Street historic district just a block away is also a hot spot. This 10-block stretch includes art galleries, shops, bars, hotels and restaurants housed in buildings that date as far back as the late 1800s. A popular First Friday art walk is held here monthly, with galleries and other businesses offering free drinks and snacks. \u201cFirst Friday is a blast,\u201d says Colby McLemore, a professional photographer who has a studio downtown. \u201cI love the diversity of the art and the relaxed and inviting vibe. It\u2019s one of my favorite things about Knoxville.\u201d Gay Street is also home to three historic theaters, all gems. You can\u2019t miss the Tennessee Theatre, with its six-story vertical sign that lights up at night. This grande dame was built in 1928 and underwent a $25 million renovation in 2005. Its original decor includes crystal chandeliers and Italian terrazzo flooring. While it\u2019s home to the city\u2019s symphony orchestra and opera company, you can also see other musical and theatrical performances and even vintage films here. The Bijou Theatre sits two blocks down Gay Street. Its opening show in 1909 starred George M. Cohan. Performances today include all manner of concerts in a fairly intimate 700-seat theater known for its stellar acoustics. \u201cIt has the best sound of any venue I\u2019ve ever been in, including those in Nashville and Atlanta,\u201d says Jody Collins, host of the podcast \u201cRamblin\u2019 Man,\u201d who often interviews entertainers, such as local and touring musicians who come through town. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a bad seat in the house.\u201d The Regal Riviera Theatre, a modern movie theater with an old-fashioned-looking facade, occupies the same site as\u00a0an Art Deco movie house\u00a0also called the Riviera Theater that was\u00a0built in 1920\u00a0but torn down in 1988. It\u2019s\u00a0one block in the opposite direction from the Tennessee Theatre. Tucked into the northeast corner of downtown is Old City, more or less the Greenwich Village of Knoxville. This offbeat urban neighborhood has the city\u2019s most concentrated collection of restored Victorian buildings and is filled with funky coffee shops, diverse dining spots, art galleries, beer joints and spiffy cocktail bars (including Brother Wolf, which enjoys a national reputation). \u2018Best soft-serve in the Southeast\u2019 You may not expect to find world-class dining in a small Southern city, but it\u2019s here. Joseph Lenn, owner of J.C. Holdway, was the first chef in the state to win a James Beard Award. He cooks his inventive fare in a wood-fire oven. \u201cI think some restaurants here hold up against a Pete Wells New York Times review,\u201d notes native New Yorker and longtime Knoxville resident Steven Friedlander, an editor and writer. He names Osteria Stella (Italian) and Kefi (Greek), both in Old City, and Vida (pan-Latin) on Gay Street as his favorite examples. \u201cThen skip dessert at the fancy restaurants and go to Cruze Farm on Gay Street for ice cream,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a local dairy that sells some of the best soft-serve in the Southeast.\u201d The craft beer craze is alive and well here. The Knoxville Area Brewers Association promotes an Ale Trail highlighting 27 breweries. Clusters of them exist in the Central Street/Broadway area north of downtown and on Sevier Avenue, just over the bridge from downtown in South Knoxville (christened SoKno by the neighborhood\u2019s young adult population). More are sprinkled about town and in the suburbs. \u201cX\u00fcl Beer Company in the Old City is my personal favorite,\u201d Kanczuzewski says, \u201cbut my secret pleasure is Abridged, a brewpub in a converted mechanic\u2019s garage in Bearden,\u201d a suburb close to downtown. \u201cIt\u2019s my go-to place for the best burger in town.\u201d Before they\u2019re famous It\u2019s already known as the \u201cCradle of Country Music\u201d thanks to its role in developing the careers of stars like Dolly Parton, Chet Atkins and Roy Acuff, but Knoxville is fast gaining a more modern reputation as a great place for live music. This is due in large part to the growing popularity of a music festival founded in 2009 known as Big Ears\u2014music industry slang for an especially acute and perceptive listener, according to festival founder Ashley Capps. Big Ears, named \u201cmusic festival of the year\u201d by Spin in 2023, is undeniably Knoxville\u2019s biggest music coup. People come from all over the United States and even overseas to attend. (Last year, 70% of the 30,500 attendees were out-of-towners.) The festival offers diverse genres in multiple downtown venues, from big theaters to hole-in-the-wall bars. Cellist Yo-Yo Ma has shown up, as has Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. This year, multiple-Grammy winner Andre 3000 (half of the hip hop duo Outkast) gave a flute concert at St. John\u2019s Cathedral. \u201cWe are not the next big thing, we are our own thing,\u201d explains Collins about Knoxville\u2019s music scene in general. In addition to attracting major acts, Collins notes, \u201cThis is also a great place to see underground bands before they break.\u201d He saw Green Day in 1992 (pre \u201cDookie\u201d) at a local pub, and he saw Lake Street Dive (before the band was big) with only seven other people in the audience. He also saw heavy metal band System of a Down before they racked up so many Grammys. \u201cMy dad and his uncles saw Alabama when they were a bar band on The Strip,\u201d he adds, using a locals\u2019 term for Cumberland Avenue, a street that runs from downtown through the adjacent campus of the University of Tennessee. Of the handful of bars he frequents for live music, the Pilot Light in Old City is his favorite. \u201cThe capacity is only 75,\u201d he says, \u201cso you can often experience something that may never be replicated.\u201d Another intimate music experience is the Blue Plate Special, a free live concert presented at noon at the visitor\u2019s center on Gay Street and broadcast on WDVX. (Concert-goers are even invited to bring their lunch.) All types of local and internationally famous artists appear here. \u201cAmy Ray of the Indigo Girls will be passing through town and play at the Blue Plate Special,\u201d Collins notes. 10 minutes from a trailhead While the city is about an hour from Great Smoky Mountains National Park (the most visited US national park and home to beautiful luminous evening displays by fireflies), you don\u2019t have to go that far to commune with nature. Knoxville\u2019s 1,500-acre Urban Wilderness includes five city parks, four Civil War sites, wildlife areas, a nature preserve, several waterways and more. Its 60-plus miles (100 kilometers) of hiking and mountain biking trails and greenways connect downtown with the surrounding area. \u201cIn 10 minutes from downtown, you can be at a trailhead,\u201d says Jeff Shmerler, a retired tech industry engineer who is active in the local mountain biking club. No need to bring your own equipment \u2013 some hotels rent or lend bikes to guests, and numerous rental shops can set you up with bikes and watercraft. \u201cYou can go canoeing, hiking and biking all in the same day,\u201d Shmerler notes. The nonprofit Ijams Nature Center is a core part of the Urban Wilderness, with more than 300 acres of forests, meadows, wetlands and creeks. It\u2019s also home to an independently operated adventure park with zip lines, swinging bridges, balance challenges and more. Shmerler sums it up well: \u201cThis is a cool place to be.\u201d Next town: Duluth, Minnesota is No. 10 How outdoor activities and a creative spirit make it cooler by the lake.", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/knoxville-tennessee-best-towns-america/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

The officer was arrested on Monday \u201con suspicion of misconduct in public office,\u201d a Metropolitan Police spokesperson said Wednesday. \u201cWe can confirm that on Friday, June 14, the Met were contacted by the Gambling Commission who informed us that they were investigating alleged bets made by a police constable from the Met\u2019s Royalty and Specialist Protection Command, which were related to the timing of the General Election,\u201d the spokesperson added. The constable\u00a0was removed from his operational duties and the matter was immediately referred to the Met\u2019s Directorate of Professional Standards, which opened an investigation, the spokesperson said. The arrest comes days after the Guardian newspaper reported that a close aide of Sunak made a \u00a3100 ($127) bet\u00a0on a July election date before the prime minister had publicly announced the date. Craig Williams apologised for making the bet, telling the BBC: \u201cI clearly made a huge error of judgment that\u2019s for sure and I apologize.\u201d The police spokesperson said the country\u2019s Gambling Commission continues to lead its probe into \u201calleged betting offenses, and our investigation is running in parallel to that.\u201d When asked for comment, the prime minister\u2019s press office told CNN they had nothing to add to the Met police statement. Meanwhile, on Wednesday afternoon shortly before the police released their statement,\u00a0Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party posted a\u00a0campaign ad on social media\u00a0that said, \u201cIf you bet on Labour, you can never win,\u201d alongside a video of a roulette wheel.

Five years ago, Xi Jinping was offered the same open-top ride\u00a0with Kim when he became the first Chinese leader to visit Pyongyang in 14 years. At the time, the two leaders vowed to strengthen ties and deepen cooperation, but the language paled in comparison with the \u201cbreakthrough\u201d new partnership struck by Kim and Putin. In a wide-ranging treaty spanning political, trade, investment, and security cooperation, North Korea and Russia pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked. Putin said Russia and North Korea have ramped up ties to a \u201cnew level.\u201d Kim, meanwhile, called the new \u201calliance\u201d a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d in bilateral relations. The\u00a0new landmark defense pact agreed by the two nuclear-armed regimes rattled the United States and its Asian allies. Japan voiced \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about Putin\u2019s vow not to rule out cooperation with Pyongyang on military technology.\u00a0South Korea responded by convening an emergency national security meeting and said it would now consider sending arms to Ukraine. In contrast, the reaction from\u00a0China,\u00a0the main political and economic patron for both Russia and North Korea, has been all but muted. A spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the treaty, calling it a bilateral matter between Russia and North Korea. Beneath the official reticence, however, China is likely watching warily, analysts say. China \u2018aims to control the situation\u2019 The deepening ties between two wayward autocrats risk creating new uncertainty for Xi, who needs\u00a0peace and stability in Northeast Asia as he grapples with a raft of domestic challenges, especially the slowing economy. Beijing is worried that Moscow\u2019s assistance to Pyongyang \u2013 especially on military technology \u2013\u00a0would further enable and embolden the erratic Kim regime, which has drastically accelerated the buildup of nuclear\u00a0weapons and missile programs, said Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor focusing on Chinese politics at the City University of Hong Kong. \u201cWhen it comes to the North Korea issue, China aims to control the situation and prevent escalation, but it also does not want North Korea to completely collapse either\u201d \u2013 a scenario that Beijing fears would allow the US to extend its control right to its doorstep, Liu said. Previously, Russia had been\u00a0largely aligned with China on the issue, but its desperate need for North Korea to support its grinding war in Ukraine risks undermining the delicate balance. Russia has received more than 10,000 shipping containers \u2013 the equivalent of\u00a0260,000 metric tons\u00a0of munitions or munitions-related material \u2013 from North Korea since September, according to a US\u00a0statement\u00a0in February. Both Russia and North Korea have rejected the claim. And while\u00a0the US has accused China of providing Russia with dual-use goods that bolster the warring nation\u2019s military industrial complex,\u00a0Beijing has refrained from offering direct military assistance to Putin and has steered clear of supporting Kim\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. \u201cIf Putin provides more support to North Korea on nuclear issues, including some technical assistance, it will become more difficult for China to control the situation on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Liu said. The mutual defense pact signed by Kim and Putin harks back to a 1961 treaty between North Korea and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. That deal was replaced with one that offered much weaker security assurances after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But North Korea\u2019s mutual defense treaty with China, also signed in 1961, remains in place after multiple renewals. The Sino-North Korea Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance is the only formal military alliance treaty China has signed with another country, though Beijing doesn\u2019t admit it as such and remains deliberately vague about whether China is obliged to automatically come to North Korea\u2019s defense when a war breaks out. Similarly, it remains unclear what Russia and North Korea are willing \u2013 and able \u2013 to do for one another under the new defense pact. The new treaty comes\u00a0amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, where Kim has ramped up fiery rhetoric and scrapped a longstanding policy of seeking peaceful reunification with South Korea.\u00a0After the end of the Korean War in 1953, a formal peace treaty was never signed between the two Koreas, leaving them\u00a0technically in a state of war. But the political message of the pact is loud and clear. Driven by a shared hostility to the US and its allies, the two autocratic nations are seeking to undermine and create an alternative to the Western-led global order \u2013 a goal shared by China. Speaking after his meeting with Kim, Putin rankled against what he called \u201cthe imperialist policy of the United States and its satellites.\u201d A month ago, Putin and Xi delivered a similar swipe at the US during the Russian leader\u2019s visit to Beijing. In a sweeping joint statement, the two \u201cold friends\u201d took aim at what they described as a global security system defined by US-backed military alliances \u2013 and pledged to work together to counter it. Western observers have warned against a loose but growing coordination of interests among China, Russia, North Korea and Iran \u2013 something one\u00a0senior US military commander\u00a0recently likened to a new \u201caxis of evil.\u201d As Moscow and Pyongyang deepen their alliance, Beijing would be cautious to keep a distance, Liu said, adding that \u201cChina certainly doesn\u2019t want to be seen as part of a new Axis.\u201d But despite the absence of Xi, China would have been the elephant in the room throughout Putin and Kim\u2019s meeting. \u201cAny such meeting will also include discussion of China,\u201d said Edward Howell, a lecturer in politics at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who focuses on the Korean Peninsula. \u201cRussia will know full well that China does not want to be left out of any substantial negotiations involving North Korea, not least since China is far more important \u2013 compared to Russia \u2013 to North Korea.\u201d Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank, said China doesn\u2019t feel it can control the pace and extent of the deepening engagement between Russia and North Korea. \u201cBut they do know that China plays an irreplaceable role for both Russia and North Korea,\u201d she said. China remains the largest trade partner to both Russia and North Korea, providing a crucial lifeline to the heavily sanctioned economies. Beijing also lends significant political support and diplomatic cover to the two international pariahs. \u201cChina doesn\u2019t think that an alliance between Russia and North Korea would be a betrayal,\u201d said Liu with the City University of Hong Kong. \u201cNeither of the two countries has the capacity to betray China. They still need to rely on China despite their alliance.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/23/china/china-wary-putin-kim-new-alliance-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}

Slater, 19, went missing after attending the NRG festival in the south of the island, and was last heard from between 8 and 9 a.m. local time (3-4 a.m. ET) on June 17, according to a GoFundMe fundraising campaign set up to help find him. The campaign was organized by a friend of Slater\u2019s named Lucy Mae, who said she had left the festival before Slater on Sunday. Slater called her around 8.30 a.m. local time the next day and said he was \u201clost in the mountains\u201d and his phone only had 1% battery, according to the fundraiser. The page includes a map showing Slater\u2019s last known location, in the Teno Rural Park in northwestern Tenerife, around 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the festival site. According to the fundraiser, Slater told Lucy Mae he left the festival with two men he met there and traveled with them to a remote location. Spain\u2019s Guardia Civil, which is leading the search for the teenager, posted a video on X showing officers searching dry, mountainous terrain and flying over rocky ravines in a helicopter. CNN has contacted the Guardia Civil for comment on the search. Police from Slater\u2019s home region of Lancashire, northern England, said they had been in contact with the Guardia Civil. \u201cWhilst this case falls outside the jurisdiction of UK policing, we have made an offer of support to the Guardia Civil to see if they need any additional resources,\u201d the Lancashire Police Force said in a statement published Friday. \u201cThey have confirmed that at this time they are satisfied that they have the resources they need, but that offer remains open and they will contact us should that position change.\u201d In a statement Monday, the United Kingdom\u2019s Foreign Office confirmed to CNN that it is aware of Slater\u2019s case. \u201cWe are supporting the family of a British man who is missing in Spain and are in contact with the local authorities,\u201d said a spokesperson. On Saturday, NRG festival released a statement on Slater\u2019s disappearance. \u201cThat such a devastating situation has arisen has deeply affected us all,\u201d the festival said in a post on Instagram. \u201cWe have been able to give some practical support to the members of Jay\u2019s family who have come to Tenerife in such difficult circumstances, and we are inspired by their resilience and determination.\u201d Tenerife is part of the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago that sits in the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Africa. It has long been a popular holiday destination for its temperate year-round climate. Slater\u2019s disappearance comes after a spate of tourists going missing in sweltering temperatures in Greece. According to CNN meteorologist Monica Garrett, the closest monitoring station to where Slater went missing, which is located at an airport in the south of the island, has seen high temperatures of mid-20s Celsius (upper-70s Fahrenheit), with lows in the upper teens Celsius (mid-60s Fahrenheit). \u201cConditions have been sunny with some occasional clouds,\u201d said Garrett, with no reports of rain.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/24/europe/jay-slater-missing-tenerife-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "06/24/2024", "section": "world"}}
