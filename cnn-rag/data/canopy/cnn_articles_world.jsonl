The female pilot, who was not named in the Navy release, was flying an F/A-18 Super Hornet off the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D Eisenhower as part of Strike Fighter Squadron 32, nicknamed the \u201cFlying Swordsmen.\u201d The aerial victory came against a one-way Houthi attack drone, one of dozens the Yemen-based group has deployed against civilian merchant ships in the Red Sea and nearby waters in reaction to the destruction in Gaza during Israel\u2019s war against Hamas, a release from Carrier Strike Group 2 said. The squadron amassed more than 3,000 combat hours in flying almost 1,500 combat missions as part of operations Inherent Resolve and Prosperity Guardian, the former targeting ISIS and the latter stood up in December 2023 to respond to the Houthi-led attacks on international shipping. The Swordsmen, one of four strike fighter squadrons that deployed on the Eisenhower, fired more than 20 air-to-air missiles against the Houthi drones during those missions, the Navy said. \u201cDuring one mission, VFA-32 became home to the first American female pilot to engage and kill an air-to-air contact,\u201d it said. The first air-to-air victory by a female pilot comes 30 years after Lt. Kara Hultgreen became the first carrier-based female fighter pilot in the Navy, flying the F-14 Tomcat off the USS Abraham Lincoln that year. Female aviators also joined the Eisenhower in 1994. The Eisenhower-led carrier strike group returned to US bases on July 14 after a nine-month deployment, an exceptionally lengthy deployment for a carrier. Normal deployments last about six to eight months. Cmdr. Jason Hoch, commanding officer of VFA-32, praised the squadron\u2019s performance in \u201cincredibly demanding conditions\u201d during the deployment. Besides the air-to-air encounters, the Swordsmen led two of seven strikes against Houthi ground targets in Yemen, destroying munitions and command and control facilities, the release said. \u201cWe proved over and over again that the flexibility a carrier strike group brings to the fight is unmatched,\u201d Hoch said. Overall, Carrier Strike Group 2, which besides the Eisenhower included the guided missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea and the destroyers USS Mason and USS Gravely, hit more than 460 Houthi targets in Yemen, according to the Navy. The group\u2019s warships fired 155 standard missiles and 135 Tomahawk land-attack missiles during those strikes, while the strike group\u2019s aircraft fired 60 air-to-air missiles and released 420 air-to-surface weapons, the Navy said. The Houthis are an Iran-backed Shia rebel group that controls swathes of Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Middle East and a nation that has been ravaged by years of civil war. Since Hamas\u2019 attacks on October 7 and Israel\u2019s subsequent ground and air offenses in Gaza, the Houthis say they have been seeking revenge against Israel for its military campaign by targeting Red Sea shipping as well as Israel itself with drones and missiles. Both the United Kingdom and the United States have responded to the attacks on shipping by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. Over the weekend,\u00a0Israel struck inside Yemen for the first time following a deadly drone attack launched by Houthi rebels on Tel Aviv.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/middleeast/us-navy-first-air-to-air-kill-female-fighter-pilot-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

A 29-day \u20ac5 reservation entrance fee and reservation experiment, which began on April 25 and ran on selected days until July 14, brought in \u20ac2,425,310 (around $2.64 million), according to\u00a0Venice\u00a0mayor Luigi Brugnaro. The city initially expected to collect around \u20ac700,000 (about $762,163) when the plan was introduced, the mayor had said in April. A total of 3,618,114 individuals made reservations, of whom 1,398,084 were exempted from payment because they stayed in hotels. Other exemptions included 651,254 workers who travelled to the city on days the fee was in place, as well as 466,819 students and 217,589 residents who were not required to pay the entrance fee. Additionally, 78,224 people were exempted because they were related to residents, and 107,146 were exempted for \u201cother\u201d reasons including being born in the city, religious activities such as the papal visit, and those participating in cultural events, according to data released by the city of\u00a0Venice. Saturdays are most popular \u201cFrom a first reading of the data it appears that day-trippers and tourists prefer Saturday to Sunday, and that during all 29 days of experimentation a peak attendance day, equal to that recorded on 30 April 2023, was not reached,\u201d the city said in a statement, adding that the number of people coming to the city on \u201cred flag days\u201d gradually decreased over time. \u201cThe experiment worked and we can move forward. A more in-depth analysis of the data collected in the autumn,\u201d Brugnaro said at a press conference Friday. A CNN team on the ground in\u00a0Venice\u00a0noted that local residents told them that the crowds seemed noticeably smaller than normal and that while still busy, the local residents felt that crowds leading up to the city\u2019s summer event, the Redeemer Festival, haven\u2019t been as bad as previous years. The entrance fee officially ended July 14, but the mayor\u2019s office said they will now determine if they should reinstate it during busy times of the year. No official date to do so has yet been announced. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive balance: The first 29 days of experimentation have finally given the city a tool that has allowed us to know how many people would objectively arrive in\u00a0Venice\u00a0and will be able to give us a way to act accordingly,\u201d tourism councillor Simone Venturini said in a statement. The mayor of\u00a0Venice\u00a0and two aides are currently under investigation for corruption tied to allegedly approving a 3.7-million-square-foot commercial property development by a Singapore developer in exchange for $164 million, according to police. Brugnaro has publicly denied the allegations, but one member of the council has resigned.

Motifs associated with Paris and the Games, namely the Eiffel Tower and the Olympic flame also feature. The outfits took an average of 20 hours each to craft, according to the Mongolian National Olympic Committee. The uniforms have attracted attention on\u00a0social media \u2014\u00a0especially TikTok, where fashion and sport commentators applauded the designs. \u201cThey just won the Olympics before it even started,\u201d said style writer Ryan Yip in a video viewed over 2 million times.

Hungary\u2019s far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n has ruffled feathers among EU leaders by claiming recently that the union has a \u201cpro-war policy.\u201d Borrell responded to Orban\u2019s comment during a press conference in Brussels, saying, \u201cI understood that we have to send a signal, even if it is a symbolic signal, that being against the foreign policy of the European Union and disqualifying the policy of the European Union as the \u2018party of war\u2019 has to have some consequences.\u201d \u201cWe analyzed the statements and the actions implemented\u201d by the Hungarian prime minister and foreign minister, the chief diplomat of the EU said. \u201cI can say that all member states, with one single exception, were very much critical about this behavior,\u201d he added. \u201cEuropean Union policy is not a pro-war policy. We strongly rejected that,\u201d Borrel said, adding, \u201cthe only one who is pro-war is Putin.\u201d The informal EU Council meetings of foreign and defense ministers were due to take place in Budapest from August 28 to 30, according to the EU council website, with Hungary currently holding the rotating European Union presidency. Borrell\u2019s decision comes after European Council President Charles Michel firmly hit back at Orb\u00e1n\u2019s claim that the EU has led a \u201cpro-war policy\u201d in a letter published last week. \u201cRussia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the victim exercising its legitimate right to self-defense. Russia is leading a war of aggression in blatant violation of international law, Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty in accordance with the UN Charter,\u201d Michel wrote. Orb\u00e1n further upset EU lawmakers with his recent so-called \u201cpeace missions\u201d at the beginning of July \u2013 meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing, and most recently former US President Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The authoritarian Hungarian leader has sought to cast himself as a peacemaker in the Ukraine conflict, but his stance is at odds with most EU leaders, who have pledged unequivocal support for Ukraine as it attempts to repel Russia\u2019s military effort. In his letter to those leaders, Orban said that during the meetings there was a \u201cgeneral observation\u201d that \u201cthe intensity of the military conflict\u201d in Ukraine \u201cwill radically escalate in the near future.\u201d A letter signed by over 63 European lawmakers, addressed to the three EU chiefs, said Orban had \u201ccaused significant damage\u201d through his meetings. They called on the bloc\u2019s leaders to suspend Hungary\u2019s voting rights in the European Council, arguing that \u201cmere verbal condemnation\u201d of Hungary has \u201cno effect.\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later slammed the Hungarian prime minister\u2019s visit to Moscow as an \u201cappeasement mission.\u201d In response, Orb\u00e1n told CNN he was simply fulfilling his \u201cChristian duty\u201d by visiting Putin. \u201cIf you have a position and you can have an impact on bad things to improve it, you have to do so,\u201d Orban told CNN last week.

Parts of Kerala are among those most at risk globally for outbreaks of the virus, a\u00a0Reuters investigation\u00a0showed last year. Nipah, which comes from fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can cause a lethal, brain-swelling fever in humans.

Dr. Anoop Kumar, director of critical care medicine at Aster MIMS Hospital in Calicut, said one positive case of Nipah had been diagnosed in a school boy and people who had been in contact with him were being watched. \u201cThere is a minimum chance of an outbreak of Nipah virus at this stage,\u201d he said, adding that the situation would be monitored for the next seven to 10 days.

Other people who might be at risk were asked to isolate at home. The state government said it is working to trace any affected people to contain the spread of the virus.

The prospect of \u201ccamp\u201d was way more daunting. \u201cI was nowhere near as afraid of talking about grief as I was afraid of being in a new space, doing something new, alone, with new people,\u201d Galloway-Cole tells CNN Travel today. Galloway-Cole, a New Yorker in her late 20s, is a recent widow. Last November, her wife, Megan, passed away from a sudden cardiac event. \u201cLosing my wife felt like losing my center of gravity,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cEverything in the world felt upside down and I felt untethered to reality.\u201d About a month after Megan\u2019s death, one of Galloway-Cole\u2019s close friends sent her details about Experience Camps, a US-based nonprofit that runs summer camps for grieving kids. In recent years, Experience Camps has expanded its program to include an annual adults-only grief retreat. When the organization appeared on Galloway-Cole\u2019s radar, Experience Camps was accepting applications for its summer 2024 adult getaway. Sitting in her parents\u2019 home in Kansas, Galloway-Cole scrolled through the details. The MO, according to Experience Camps, is that bereaved adults gather to \u201cgrieve, connect and play\u201d in the beautiful surroundings of a historic summer camp in the Poconos. On the agenda: traditional camp activities including campfires, arts and crafts and sports \u2013\u00a0 interspersed with opportunities for grief-based connection and contemplation. Galloway-Cole wasn\u2019t a camp kid. She spent her childhood and teenage summers taking extra classes at local colleges rather than sitting around a campfire toasting s\u2019mores. And while camp as a concept sounded fun \u2013 at least if Lindsay Lohan in \u201cThe Parent Trap\u201d was anything to go by \u2013 Galloway-Cole was unsure of the reality of \u201csleeping in a cabin in bunks with strangers.\u201d But in the wake of her wife\u2019s death, Galloway-Cole had adopted what she calls a \u201ckitchen sink\u201d attitude to grieving: She\u2019d try pretty much anything in the quest to adjust to her stark new reality. \u201cAt that point, I was also just looking for any sort of way to form connections with other people in the grief space \u2013 trying to just create and build a community,\u201d adds Galloway-Cole. \u201cBeing a widow in my 20s, I don\u2019t have as many people around me who relate to that grief experience. So, when I found out about the camp, I signed up the day I found out.\u201d \u2018A big leap of bravery\u2019 After a phone call with Experience Camps\u2019 program director, Galloway-Cole paid the requisite $425 fee \u201cand then put the dates in my calendar and didn\u2019t think about it too much.\u201d Then, suddenly \u2013 somehow \u2013 it was June 2024. Seven months since Galloway-Cole\u2019s wife passed away. Six months since she\u2019d signed up for grief camp. In that intervening period, Galloway-Cole had waded through the heavy haze of grief to rebuild something of a routine. She\u2019d left the comfort of her parents\u2019 house in Kansas and returned to the New York City apartment she\u2019d once shared with Megan. She\u2019d gone back to her job working in nonprofit communications. She\u2019d reconnected with friends. She\u2019d gone to therapy. She started blogging about her experiences on her Substack, Good Gay Grief. Life wasn\u2019t easy, but there was some semblance of \u201cnew normal\u201d that Galloway-Cole embraced as much as possible. Interrupting this routine to embark on a grief-focused summer camp was daunting, to say the least. But Galloway-Cole put on her favorite T-shirt, packed her suitcase, mapped out the route via GPS, and readied herself to drive two and half hours northwest to Equinunk, Pennsylvania. \u00a0 It was the first time she\u2019d gone on a vacation or trip since her wife died. \u201cSo, that was a big leap of bravery \u2013 and a big milestone to pack the car on my own,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. Galloway-Cole and her wife loved a road trip. (\u201cIf it was between a flight or a 10-hour drive, we would usually drive,\u201d she says). But Galloway-Cole was used to having Megan in the car, by her side. \u201cThere were so many times we would take a 10-hour drive, and we wouldn\u2019t even turn on music, because we would just talk the whole time,\u201d she recalls. As Galloway-Cole got behind the wheel, she was acutely conscious of the empty passenger seat. \u201cI got in the car knowing, \u2018I don\u2019t have my companion anymore. I don\u2019t have my person. I have to find a way to get through this and do it on my own,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd what that looked like for me was I put on a playlist that was high energy, trying to just sing along and keep myself motivated.\u201d Galloway-Cole sang as loud as she could as she navigated the concrete gridlock of New York City and headed toward the rural greenery of upstate New York. As she crossed the Pennsylvania border and got close to Equinunk, the views out the window got vaster, more verdant. Parking up at Camp Equinunk and Blue Ridge, her home for the weekend, Galloway-Cole felt her heart hammering in her chest. The nerves were in full swing. But almost immediately, Galloway-Cole began chatting to another recent arrival. \u201cShe turned out to be another camper who was also there for the weekend, who had previously been involved with Experience Camps before \u2013 so she knew what she was doing,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cI told her it was my first time and we talked a little bit about it \u2013 so I wasn\u2019t confused for long, there was someone helpful there right away to say, \u2018Here. Come with me. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u2019\u201d This first interaction was indicative of what was to come \u2013 Galloway-Cole was immediately welcomed into the fray. Only a couple of hours after arriving, she found herself sitting with other campers, making name necklaces to wear for the weekend. Threading beads onto the string, Galloway-Cole opted for her nickname \u201cMac\u201d over her full name \u201cMackenzie.\u201d She didn\u2019t usually skip straight to the abbreviation, but Gallowy-Cole figured she was about to share some pretty intimate stuff with her fellow campers, so why not skip the niceties? Opening up In the lead up to the weekend, the campers had been sent a schedule of activities, meals and sharing circles. \u201cI didn\u2019t memorize the schedule,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cI looked at it once and said, \u2018OK, I guess I\u2019ll figure out what all that means when I get there.\u2019 I think it was just a combination of nerves, but also I was open to letting whatever was supposed to happen, happen \u2013 and letting go and releasing a bit of the control. Just saying, \u2018I\u2019m here, I\u2019m open. And I\u2019m ready to see what this weekend is all about.\u2019\u201d That first day, Galloway-Cole found herself in a sharing circle with a handful of other campers and tried to embrace this mantra. She listened as other campers were candid about their bereavement experiences, watched as they oscillated between laughter and tears. Galloway-Cole stood back at first, taking everything in, feeling \u201cevery emotion on the emotional spectrum,\u201d but gradually she felt less daunted about the prospect of opening up herself. \u201cI was able to see how open everyone else was, in sharing their lives and sharing stories and fun tidbits about the people they love who they\u2019ve lost,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really empowered me to realize part of what\u2019s going to make this whole weekend so impactful is sharing, is pushing myself to share the hardest parts of my life with the strangers that I just met, minutes or hours ago.\u201d So, swallowing her nerves, Galloway-Cole started talking. She spoke about her late wife\u2019s love of basketball, and she was heartened by the reactions of her fellow campers. They were encouraging, nodding along. Afterward, someone suggested a game of pick-up basketball. Galloway-Cole was fighting back tears as she dribbled the ball, but she also felt a sense of lightness, a feeling of joy that had eluded her for a long time. It helped that everyone was so kind and welcoming. Galloway-Cole\u2019s fears about making friends were proved unfounded. While many of the campers knew each other already \u2013 either they\u2019d worked as Experience counselors at a kids\u2019 grief camp or attended previous iterations of the adult grief retreat \u2013 others were newbies like Galloway-Cole. And the old-timers and newbies were equally approachable. There were no cliques at grief camp. The campers ranged in age from early 20s to mid-60s, although the majority were around Galloway-Cole\u2019s age, late 20s to early 30s. In Galloway-Cole\u2019s everyday life, her grief sometimes feels like a stumbling block to connection with other young people \u2013 she doesn\u2019t always know when to mention her loss, can\u2019t predict how her peers might react and she\u2019s always conscious being a 20-something widow is relatively unusual, even shocking. \u201c\u2018Do I mention it? Do I not? Do I bring it up? Will other people feel uncomfortable? Will it sour the mood? Will someone say something and then I\u2019ll get annoyed that what they said was not what I needed to hear, because they don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m going through \u2026\u2019 Those are all the different types of thoughts that I unconsciously am filtering through constantly,\u201d explains Galloway-Cole. But at grief camp, everyone was united by loss, and everyone was there to talk about it. Grief was a fast track to connection, not a hurdle. Over the weekend, Galloway-Cole met other people who\u2019d lost their partners. Others who\u2019d suffered sudden, traumatic loss. Other people in their 20s. Other New Yorkers. Other queer people. She felt a sense of camaraderie and connection that she realized was sometimes lacking in her day-to-day life. While she\u2019s got a great support network of friends and family \u2013 who are also grieving the loss of Megan \u2013 there was something specifically comforting about meeting people going through the exact same experience. And while other campers\u2019 stories of loss were heavy, Galloway-Cole says there was also a consolation in knowing they were all supporting one another. \u201cGrief is so heavy, but it\u2019s the heaviest when you\u2019re holding it on your own,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when you do get to share parts of it with others, it\u2019s like they\u2019re helping you hold up this boulder. At grief camp, there were 100 people helping you hold up a boulder, it\u2019s a lot easier to hold than when you\u2019re doing it on your own.\u201d Marrying joy and sadness For the Experience Camps team, this idea of mutual support is at the center of everything they do \u2013 as is the idea that a moment of intense sharing could be swiftly followed by a freeing, spontaneous game of basketball. Experience Camps\u2019 years of operating summer camps for grieving kids mean the team puts joy and grief on equal footing. \u201cJoy and grief belong together,\u201d says Jesse Moss, Experience Camps\u2019 marketing director. \u201cYou can\u2019t be 100 percent sad all the time, because you won\u2019t be able to function and heal and grow and you can\u2019t be 100 percent joyful all the time \u2013 because then you\u2019re just pushing your grief down. \u2026 But I think joy and play really can get rid of your inhibitions, and kind of break you down in the same way that grief can \u2013 and so you\u2019re just your most authentic self.\u201d Experience Camps\u2019 kids camps have been running since 2009, meaning a whole generation of kids has now grown up with the program. The adults\u2019 retreat launched in 2022, inspired by feedback from the organization\u2019s adult volunteers. Many of them had their own grief stories, but they didn\u2019t have much opportunity to share them with one another, given their responsibilities at the kids camp. The pilot iteration of the adults retreat was exclusive to Experience Camps volunteers. There were around 30 attendees. In 2023, they extended the remit, opening up the retreat to any adults 21 and over who\u2019d experienced the loss of a parent, caregiver or sibling. Some 60 people signed up. In 2024, the parameters expanded to include anyone dealing with the death of someone important to them, and more than 100 campers gathered for the weekend. According to Experience Camps, interest continues to grow with many people discovering the program via TikTok. The adult camp is oversubscribed, and Experience Camps are looking at ways of expanding the program. Experience Camps isn\u2019t the only organization to run grief retreats \u2013 take Camp Widow, which hosts conference-style events for people grieving a partner across the country, or the kids-focused Comfort Zone Camp. But most of the grief retreat options available for adults don\u2019t include \u201csilly dances and an egg drop competition,\u201d two highlights of Galloway-Cole\u2019s June weekend. Experience Camps, which relies on donations and volunteers, also prides itself on its relative accessibility. The kids camp is free, and the adults camp costs $425 a person inclusive of all meals and activities, with adult scholarships available on a case-by-case basis. While some adult grief retreats lean into the luxury, wellness angle, Experience Camps firmly believes the less glamorous structure of summer camp lends itself perfectly to the grief space. Speaking to CNN Travel, the Experience Camps team suggests that embracing your inner child via games, campfire singalongs, dance competitions and friendship bracelets is the ideal counterpart to heavier moments of reflection and contemplation. These activities are a break from routine \u2013 from jobs, adult responsibilities, day-to-day mundanity. The only real difference between the kids program and the adult version, says Moss, is the adults have more freedom to do their own thing \u2013 and don\u2019t have to be told when to brush their teeth or go to bed. \u201cIn your personal life, you don\u2019t get to be silly, and do competitions and make up dances with your friends anymore. That was something 10 year olds did. But at this camp weekend, you\u2019re talking about your grief, but you\u2019re also making up dances with your friends,\u201d says Moss. \u201cIt\u2019s a really nice balance of nurturing your grief, nurturing your inner child, playing again and being vulnerable and meeting people who are like you.\u201d Michelle Cove, Experience Camps\u2019 director of communications, suggests campers are also better able to navigate their way through tougher moments of reflection and contemplation because they always know \u201cjoy and play is going to be on the other side of it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s really conducive for having these discussions, which you may or may not have if you\u2019re at a spa retreat with your girlfriends,\u201d Cove tells CNN Travel. The team suggests traveling is a great way of helping to process trauma, too. And it helps when the surroundings are so beautiful. Galloway-Cole calls the campground a \u201cmuch needed and wanted change of pace\u201d compared with life in New York City. \u201cThere\u2019s greenery everywhere,\u201d describes Galloway-Cole. \u201cThere\u2019s a lake, a big green lawn and there\u2019s a flagpole that we meet around every morning.\u201d During her time at camp, Galloway-Cole went for a solo walk around the grounds before each day\u2019s activities began. \u201cI would cross the bridge and head over to the lake. I would sit there, on the docks and just breathe some fresh air, center myself, wake up,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was really just a beautiful and tranquil way to start my day, every morning, to be alone with myself and my thoughts and try to connect with my wife a little bit before diving into a packed day.\u201d Making connections Experience Camps\u2019 kids camps have always been places where friendship thrives, and the Experience Camps team are happy to see this reflected in the adult campers\u2019 experiences so far. \u201cThe crossover between the kids camp and the adult camp is the word \u2018lonely,\u2019\u201d says Cove. \u201cHow lonely it is to be grieving. \u2026 And so having this space \u2013 whether it\u2019s for kids at camp or adults at camp \u2013 just to be with everybody who gets it, that\u2019s the star player.\u201d Since her wife passed away, one of Galloway-Cole\u2019s struggles is the idea that new people she meets won\u2019t get to meet Megan. \u201cI feel like they will never know this huge part of me,\u201d she says. But at grief camp, because she was encouraged to speak about Megan freely, Galloway-Cole felt as though she had introduced her partner to her new friends. On the last night of the retreat, the campers enjoyed some drinks and dancing. Toward the end of the evening, Chappell Roan\u2019s song \u201cHot To Go\u201d started blaring out of the speaker. For Galloway-Cole, this was both a joyous moment and a \u201cgut punch.\u201d The couple went to see the pop artist live last October, not long before Megan passed away. Since then, Chappell Roan has become a chart-climbing, global star. For Galloway-Cole, it\u2019s surreal and sad that Megan isn\u2019t able to witness one of her favorite artists hit the mainstream. In her normal life, Galloway-Cole might have swallowed down these thoughts and feelings \u2013 might have worried voicing them aloud would kill the vibe, worried about people\u2019s reactions. But at grief camp, Galloway-Cole didn\u2019t have these hesitations. Instead, she shouted over the music to her new friends: \u201cThis was the last concert Megan went to before she died!\u201d Rather than feeling like she\u2019d brought down the mood of the room, Galloway-Cole felt like she\u2019d just introduced Megan into the room. Her friends hugged her, cheered and the group spontaneously toasted Megan. It\u2019s a moment Galloway-Cole\u2019s thought about a lot since returning home. \u201cMegan\u2019s passing doesn\u2019t change the things she loved, it doesn\u2019t change the things we got to do together. And being able to just talk about her and who she was, and who she always will be, openly, I think is something that I will definitely bring more into my life.\u201d The experience at grief camp led Galloway-Cole to realize she can \u201ccontinue to introduce people to my wife, even though she\u2019s not with us anymore.\u201d She loves it when her grief camp friends reach out to mention something that\u2019s made them think of Megan, whether it\u2019s basketball news or pop music updates. \u201cThose are people that never got to meet her and know her while she was alive. But even they, through what I share with them, feel like they now have a connection to her,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cThat has been so impactful to hear from other people, and to see that she really does continue to be with me, and I can continue to bring her and introduce her to every person in my life that I come across.\u201d Galloway-Cole and her fellow campers are already planning future meet-ups and weekend trips together \u2013 as well as hopefully reuniting for the 2025 Experience Camps\u2019 adult grief retreat. Next year\u2019s applications aren\u2019t live yet, but those interested can still sign up to be the first to receive information. Galloway-Cole\u2019s also enjoyed sharing stories of grief camp with her friends and loved ones back home. She wrote a piece called \u201cGrief Camp is My Happy Place,\u201d for her Substack, describing her experiences. She set up a new, public Instagram to document her thoughts and feelings. \u201cI think a lot of people hear \u2018grief camp\u2019 and think it\u2019s going to be sad all the time. They think, \u2018Oh, that sounds awful, or how sad.\u2019 Meanwhile, I feel like I came back from grief camp, and I was the happiest and the lightest I had been since my wife passed, because I got to have such a joyous release,\u201d says Galloway-Cole. \u201cWe got to have those hard conversations, but also got to really experience community and connection and joy. And realize that it\u2019s OK for all of these things to coexist, because that\u2019s just what grief and a life with grief looks like.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/grief-camp-experience-camps-mackenzie-galloway-cole/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_europe_macron-france-attal-resignation-intl", "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron has accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and his government, but asked him to remain in post to act as a caretaker until a new cabinet is appointed. Attal offered to step down last week after Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance was defeated in the second round of France\u2019s snap parliamentary election, but the president refused, asking him to stay on for a short period to maintain stability. Eight days later, Macron accepted Attal\u2019s resignation after a meeting at the Elysee in Paris, but once again asked him to remain in post until a new government forms, meaning France remains in political limbo, with no clear successor in sight. \u201cIn order for this period to end as quickly as possible, it is up to Republican forces to work together to build unity around projects and actions in the service of the French people,\u201d the Elysee said in a statement. The French constitution states that the president appoints a new prime minister, but it does not detail how nor the timeframe within which they must do so. Until a new government is appointed, a caretaker government sits in place, able to respond to emergencies but not empowered to enact any legislative reforms. Separately, French lawmakers will meet Thursday to elect the president of the National Assembly, in two votes requiring a majority of the 577-seat body.\u00a0If the first two votes don\u2019t elect someone, the candidate with the largest support in parliament will be selected in a third vote. Following their resignation, Attal and his fellow ministers who are lawmakers will be allowed to vote in the election of the National Assembly president, potentially providing key ballots in the divided body. The assembly president holds a position comparable to the speaker of the House of Representatives, organizing the legislative agenda and steering the appointment of key commission posts. No obvious successor While Attal\u2019s resignation paves the way for Macron to appoint a successor, there is no obvious candidate to replace him. The newly elected National Assembly looks set to be gridlocked after the second round of voting delivered a hung parliament. Although the election was inconclusive, it was heralded as a victory for the French mainstream and a measure of voters\u2019 overwhelming desire to keep the far right from gaining power. Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally (RN) party had taken a commanding lead in the first round, stirring fears that France could be on the cusp of electing its first far-right government since the collaborationist Vichy regime of World War II. But, after a week of political bargaining that saw more than 200 centrist and left-wing candidates withdraw to avoid splitting the vote, the RN slumped to third place in the second round. In a shock result, the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) alliance won the most seats of any bloc. It is customary for the French president to appoint a prime minister from the largest group in parliament. But it is still not clear from which party within the NFP this will be. The hastily assembled alliance, which formed just days after Macron called the election last month, comprises several parties straddling vast ideological ground, from the hard-left France Unbowed party to the more moderate Socialist Party and Place Publique. But, more than a week after the vote, the alliance has still not put forward a prime ministerial candidate, in a potential sign of the divisions within the capacious \u2013 and potentially fractious \u2013 coalition France Unbowed won the most seats of any party within the NFP, and so might have been expected to be called on to put forward a candidate to succeed Attal. But Macron\u2019s allies have repeatedly said they will not work with its leader, the populist firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, saying his party is just as extreme \u2013 and therefore unfit to govern \u2013 as the RN. Even if Macron does appoint a prime minister from the NFP, the party will still need to enter into yet another coalition \u2013 likely with Ensemble \u2013 in order to pass laws. Another option is a \u201ctechnocratic\u201d government. Macron is not constitutionally obliged to appoint a prime minister from the largest bloc, and so could call on a candidate outside of mainstream politics to manage day-to-day matters. Italy took this option when it appointed Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, to run its government.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/europe/macron-france-attal-resignation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_17_style_rajesh-vora-punjab-architecture-snap", "text": "Looking down a street in Daulatpur, a rural village in Punjab, India with a mishmash of eclectic, colorful architecture, photographer Rajesh Vora felt he had struck lucky. In front of him, was a large facsimile of an Air-India plane on top of a pale green\u00a0building. Facing it from across the street, a replica of an army tank atop a yellow residence pointed its gun, the painted figure of a soldier rising from its hatch. Though the designs could have been plucked from an amusement park, they were actually elaborate rooftop water tanks of private homes. Vora\u2019s images of this phenomenon \u2014 a vernacular tradition of architectural icons that sprung up across the\u00a0across the northwestern state some five decades ago \u2014 became a multiyear project that the Mumbai-based photographer is\u00a0now exhibiting at Les Rencontres d\u2019Arles\u00a0in France this summer.\u00a0He visited 150 villages and photographed hundreds of these designs. The ostentatious d\u00e9cor is \u201ca brilliant idea combining form and function,\u201d Vora said in a phone call with CNN. The first time he noticed the water tanks while on assignment in the region in 2014, he was \u201camused, like anybody would be seeing this kind of sculpture,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut then I realized, as an architecture photographer, what amazed me was the integration of the sculptures on the houses, built by local artisans.\u201d Crowning the tops of these homes, the unusual status symbols are often commissioned by Indian emigrants\u00a0who return home during the year, or by their families who still live in the region. Some are functional water tanks while others sit on top more traditional plumbing designs. Each tell a specific story, he explained. \u201cIf somebody plays sports, they\u2019ll put up a football there, if they are a chef they will put a pressure cooker\u2026 if somebody likes a nice drink, they\u2019ll put a bottle of whiskey,\u201d he explained. Planes, tanks and cars became popular motifs, too. \u201cAll their personal aspirations are embodied in their houses.\u201d Last year, Vora published a book, \u201cEveryday Monuments\u201d that features images from some the villages he visited and brings together texts from architectural, scholarly and curatorial experts to explore the unique tradition. Through their research, they approximate that there are around 30 artisans in the region who work with homeowners and their families via word of mouth to create these lively sculptures. Diasporic icons Vora came across the buildings by chance, as he visited a gurdwara\u00a0\u2014 a Sikh temple \u2014 in the village of Talhan while working on a commissioned photo story about global migration. Known as Hawaijahaj, or \u201cAirplane,\u201d gurdwara, visitors bring offerings of model aircraft in hopes that they will be blessed with swift visa approval to leave India. He heard that many who were successful eventually returned to their villages to add planes to the exteriors of newly built homes, he explained. Over the course of six trips from 2014 to 2019, Vora began to better understand the full scope of the trend. It had begun sometime in the 1970s, as Punjabi diasporic communities flourished in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, among other countries.\u00a0As the popularity of custom-designed water tanks grew, local builders became specialized in their craft. The favored icons tend to shift in popularity over the years \u2014 when the country began manufacturing its popular Maruti van, for example, in the 1980s, it began appearing on homes, too. He also observed how architectural styles from different countries began to mix into the villages as owners brought back ideas from abroad to unique effect. But documenting the water tanks proved difficult when he first began. The remote areas of Punjab weren\u2019t yet mapped by Google, he explained, so he visited villages and hoped for the best. \u201cSome days are lucky \u2014 you might get three or four kinds of water tanks; others, you might not get anything,\u201d Vora said. Daulatpur Village, where multiple designs could be seen in one frame, was a rarity. Vora doesn\u2019t know how the tradition will grow or change as the region continues to see major shifts \u2014 especially as Indians from marginalized backgrounds gain more economic mobility and second- or third- generation immigrants amass wealth overseas. \u201cWill they come back to India? Will they build their own houses? Will they take care of these houses?\u201d We don\u2019t know,\u201d Vora said of younger generations. \u201cThese houses are perishable if you don\u2019t maintain them after 30 or 40 years\u2026 maybe they will disappear.\u201d The photographer hopes to continue to create an archive of Punjab\u2019s distinctive architectural legacy \u2014 and he\u2019ll keep looking out for a home that bears the icon of what he would choose if he were commissioning a design. \u201cIt would have to be a camera,\u201d he said with a laugh.

{"id": "2024_07_18_tech_att-cyberattacks-data-privacy-laws", "text": "This week, AT&T notified millions of customers that their data was likely stolen in an April leak that the company disclosed earlier this month. Meanwhile, comprehensive laws that would protect customers from hacks keep struggling to pass, as AT&T and its rivals have fought back against and heavily influenced a patchwork of data laws \u2013 arguing the approach has failed to rein in the problem. AT&T customers\u2019 pilfered information was so valuable to cybercriminals that the FBI asked the company to delay filing a disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission because of potential national security and public safety concerns. The data was breached from \u201cnearly all\u201d of AT&T\u2019s cellular customers and the customers of wireless providers that used its network between May 1, 2022, and October 31, 2022. It\u2019s not the first time \u2013 even this year \u2013 that AT&T has been breached. The company was already grappling with an unrelated data leak that took place in March. At that time, AT&T said personal information, such as Social Security numbers on 73 million current and former customers, was released onto the dark web. Consumer advocates and some lawmakers have long argued for more protection of customer data. Though state laws have passed across almost 20 states, \u00a0the patchwork of regulations across states and agencies that regulates data privacy, can lead to inconsistencies, contradictions and lacunae. Complicating things further, lobbies from Big Tech to phone carriers have been heavily influencing many of these state and local regulation efforts. In a statement, AT&T said, \u201cWe have long supported a comprehensive federal privacy policy protecting all Americans that applies across the internet ecosystem. We continue to believe that a federal privacy policy should establish a consistent set of protections, enforced by a single regulator, for all consumers.\u201d Lobbies are at the \u2018crux of the problem\u2019 Keepers of private information like who you texted, what you\u2019re watching \u2013 in addition to your address and Social Security number \u2013 makes telecom companies\u2019 data a high-value target. \u00a0That could be invaluable data for phishing and targeted scam attempts. The data phone carriers hold is \u201cthe gateway into everything else on the internet,\u201d Dominic Sellitto, a cyber security professor at University at Buffalo, said. \u201cEvery communication that we have, everything goes through a telecom provider or internet service provider.\u201d And that wealth of data draws hackers. \u201cThese larger companies, because of their size and the treasure trove of data, certainly have a target on their backs,\u201d Sellitto noted. They\u2019re not alone: In just the past year, large cyberattacks have frozen car dealerships and delayed ambulances. Currently, data privacy laws exist in 19 states covering at least 150 million Americans, though differing in scale and scope. There are federal regulations on specific areas of privacy, like laws covering medical data or information about children, and agencies like the FCC regulate telecommunications. But there is no large, comprehensive data privacy law at the federal level, and many state laws are basically written by industries through their lobbyists, said Alan Butler, executive director and president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \u201cThe crux of the problem in legislating telecoms is the lobbyists and their effectiveness over many, many decades,\u201d said Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath. Cybersecurity and data privacy go hand in hand. The heaviest proposed regulation would impose data minimization rules \u2014 meaning if companies collected less data, there would be less available for hackers to steal in the first place. There would also be stricter data security and notification rules if a hack does happen. It\u2019s unclear whether those rules would have prevented AT&T\u2019s hacks or better protected their customers. But consumer advocates have lambasted the telecom industry for getting in the way of more comprehensive laws. Trade groups stressed that realistic privacy laws have had success passing through many states. \u201cIn the absence of workable federal data privacy legislation, our multi-sector coalition is proud to have been one of many stakeholders that have worked on a comprehensive privacy framework that now covers well over 100 million Americans and has received overwhelming bipartisan support across state legislatures with dramatically different political dynamics,\u201d Andrew Kingman, counsel to the State Privacy and Security Coalition said in a statement. Industry trade groups say that while cyber security and data privacy can be interrelated, there is tension between those concepts that might not be fully covered in a data privacy law. What it\u2019s like trying to pass data privacy laws When Collin Walke, a data privacy and cybersecurity attorney, was in the Oklahoma House, he focused on data privacy legislation. After California passed its landmark data privacy law in 2018, he attempted to get similar legislation passed in his state. \u201cWe had lobbyists from Amazon. We had lobbyists from Google. We had all of that. But the number one impediment to us getting it passed in Oklahoma was AT&T and Verizon,\u201d Walke said to CNN. Verizon declined to comment. In a statement, Amazon said it supports \u201cU.S. federal privacy legislation that requires transparency, access to one\u2019s own personal information, and the ability to delete personal information, and prohibits the sale of personal data without consent. In the absence of congressional action, we support well-crafted state laws that protect consumers\u2019 privacy, while continuing to allow for innovation.\u201d Monica Priestley, a state representative in Vermont, said lobbyists from across industries \u201ccame out in full force at the last minute,\u201d even hosting webinars and calls at the town or city level, against a landmark privacy bill this year. One lobby, the State Privacy & Security Coalition, represents AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Meta, as well as automobile, healthcare and payment card companies. The Vermont governor vetoed the bill in June, which would have been one of the strongest in the country. Industry trade groups said that the ability to sue companies for data violations and strict data minimization requirements would have been too costly for Vermont small businesses to comply to. \u201cThe hardest part about these bills is they are so technical in nature, and the industry tends to hand the state a policy and encourage them to run with that,\u201d Priestley said. \u201cIndustries created this monster that is out of control, and they themselves are at risk. And something\u2019s got to change.\u201d Why doesn\u2019t a national privacy law exist? Advocates say Big Tech lobbies and telecommunications lobbies have shifted their focus from squashing the federal conversation to getting deeply involved at the state level. \u201cA national law puts everyone on a level playing field,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cIt establishes the baseline of what good looks like for these critical infrastructure providers, including telecommunications companies, and then it gives the government a standard to enforce.\u201d Advocates for a sweeping law say the average consumer shouldn\u2019t have to parse dense user agreements to find out what is going on with their data. In a statement, AT&T said, \u201cOur customers can manage how we use and share their information for certain activities including advertising and marketing, and can opt out at any time.\u201d But tighter regulations mean companies must spend more resources beefing up their cybersecurity. Companies also lobby against allowing individuals to sue for damages. A lot of a telecommunication company\u2019s business is rooted in the data brokerage market, multiple privacy experts told CNN. And it\u2019s valuable data. \u201cLike many other industries, the telecommunications industry sees the commercialization of data for advertising uses as an additional revenue source,\u201d Butler said. In April, the FCC fined AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon nearly $200 million for illegally sharing customers\u2019 personal data without their consent. The fines stem from allegations in 2020 by the Federal Communications Commission that for years, the companies had improperly shared users\u2019 geolocation histories to third parties, including to prisons, as part of their commercial programs. In response to the FCC fines, all of the wireless carriers said they expect to appeal the decision. The FCC is also not the only regulator for telecom companies, which can be giant entities. \u201cIt\u2019s a very opaque space that is begging for clarity, and that clarity can only come through regulation,\u201d Noonan said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/tech/att-cyberattacks-data-privacy-laws/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_asia_israel-invitation-to-hiroshima-japan-sparked-controversy-intl-hnk", "text": "Hiroshima, the Japanese city devastated by a US atomic bomb in 1945, is at the center of a growing controversy after local officials dismissed calls to disinvite Israel from its annual ceremony promoting world peace as war rages in Gaza. Every year on August 6, Hiroshima gathers foreign officials, along with locals, in a minute of silence at 8:15 a.m. to mark the exact moment the bomb dropped, killing tens of thousands of people and leading to the end of World War II. Some activists and atomic bomb survivors\u2019 groups say the ceremony is no place for Israel, which is pounding Gaza with strikes as it seeks to eradicate\u00a0Hamas in response to the Palestinian militant group\u2019s devastating attack on October 7 last year. They say the Hiroshima city government should exclude Israel from this year\u2019s ceremony, as it has Russia and Belarus for the past two years over Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. But Hiroshima authorities say they have no intention of excluding Israel. \u201cIt is not a double standard. Our policy is to invite all countries. However, Russia and Belarus are exceptions due to the invasion of Ukraine,\u201d a Hiroshima city government spokesperson told CNN. \u201cRussia and Belarus are not invited in order to ensure the ceremony goes smoothly.\u201d Authorities in Nagasaki, the\u00a0Japanese city hit by an atomic bomb just days after Hiroshima, told CNN they haven\u2019t decided whether to invite Israel to their peace ceremony on August 9. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza may \u201cprevent the smooth execution of the ceremony,\u201d they said, stressing the move was not a gesture of protest but a practical consideration. Calls for Israel\u2019s exclusion Of the two ceremonies, Hiroshima\u2019s is the largest with representatives from\u00a0115 countries and the European Union set to attend this year. Envoys from Russia and Belarus haven\u2019t attended since Hiroshima excluded them in 2022 following Moscow\u2019s invasion of\u00a0Ukraine in February that year. Russia used Belarus as one of the launch pads for its assault and later moved some of its tactical nuclear weapons there. This year\u2019s Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony takes place against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel\u2019s bombardment has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and displaced nearly the entire enclave\u2019s more than 2 million people, who now face severe shortages of food, shelter, water and medical supplies. \u201cWhy invite Israel if they are committing genocide-like crimes, just like Russia and Belarus?\u201d said Tetsuji Kumada, executive director of Hiroshima\u2019s Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organization, one of the groups opposing Israel\u2019s presence. \u201cIt is very disappointing that our request wasn\u2019t taken into account,\u201d he told CNN, adding that the organization wrote to the Hiroshima government in June to ask for Israel to be disinvited. Another group, Hiroshima-Palestine Vigil Community, launched an online petition in May, calling for Israel\u2019s representatives to be excluded, saying that \u201ccurrent global protests against Israel clearly outnumber those against Russia in both scale and frequency.\u201d The petition has since amassed more than 30,000 signatures. Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations from critics as well as rights groups and experts that it has broken international humanitarian law with the breadth of its response to Hamas\u2019 attacks. It argues its war is against Hamas, not Palestinians, although anger over the extent of the destruction and civilian deaths in Gaza has swelled globally. CNN has reached out to the Israeli embassy in Japan for comment. Japan has taken a strong stance in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, pledging to stand with Kyiv, offering billions of dollars in humanitarian aid and military vehicles and equipment for mine-clearing operations. It has also imposed sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, Tokyo has offered humanitarian aid to Gaza, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d for the critical situation in the strip and supports a two-state solution to the conflict. According to Japanese news agency Kyodo News, the Hiroshima government referred to the war in Gaza in its invitation to Israel, urging the country to cease its offensive. The invitation said it was \u201cdeeply regrettable that the lives and everyday existences of many people are being taken away,\u201d Kyodo reported. Palestinians not invited The bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and Nagasaki three days later led to Japan\u2019s unconditional surrender and brought an end to World War II. But it also killed tens of thousands of people, both instantly and in the months and years to come due to radiation sickness. Every year, diplomats in Japan are invited to Hiroshima to join the commemoration that highlights the importance of peace and cautions against the use of nuclear weapons. But while some advocacy\u00a0groups urged Hiroshima to shun Israel, others supported its presence. \u201cAs a city of international peace, Hiroshima city needs to invite all nations, regardless of whether they are at war or not,\u201d said Kunihiko Sakuma, president of Hiroshima Hidankyo, an atomic bomb survivors\u2019 advocacy group. However,\u00a0the Permanent General Mission of Palestine in Tokyo complained on social platform X that it had not been invited to the ceremony. \u201cThis decision is a double standard,\u201d it said. Its envoy was never invited to the ceremony, the office told CNN. Hiroshima authorities said they only send invitations to countries with embassies in Japan and have never invited Palestinian representatives to the ceremony. At a news conference last week, Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa reiterated Japan\u2019s support for a two-state solution. \u201cWe continue to comprehensively consider the recognition of Palestinian statehood, taking into account how to advance the peace process,\u201d she said.

If Monday\u2019s bid had been successful, the tiny West African country would have been the first in the world to relegalize FGM after criminalizing it. MP Amadou Camara, who chairs a joint health and gender committee that recommended that FGM should remain outlawed, told CNN that none of the clauses seeking the repeal of the ban in the Women\u2019s (Amendment) Bill 2024 was passed. Parliament Speaker Fabakary Jatta\u00a0ruled that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for the bill, which passed a second reading four months ago, to be read a third time and to pass without those clauses. \u201cI so rule that the bill is rejected, and the legislative process exhausted,\u201d Jatta said at plenary meeting Monday. FGM was prohibited in Gambia in 2015 by former president Yahya Jammeh who authorized the\u00a0imposition of fines and prison sentences\u00a0of up to three years for individuals who engaged in it. The law also punished perpetrators with life sentences in cases where the practice led to death. Pro-Islamic groups and lawmakers pushed back against the criminalization, saying that female circumcision was \u201cone of the virtues of Islam.\u201d Other prominent Gambians, such as opposition leader and former interior minister Mai Ahmad Fatty also defended the practice, arguing that: \u201cThere is no FGM in Gambia. We circumcise, not mutilate.\u201d Human rights organization Amnesty International earlier described efforts to revoke the FGM ban as a \u201cbackward move\u201d for the protection of human rights in the country. In Gambia, 73% of women aged between 15 and 49 years had experienced FGM as of 2020, according to the United Nations. More than 65% of those women were subjected to the practice \u201cbefore the age of five years,\u201d the UN said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Women\u2019s Day in March that he was \u201coutraged\u201d by moves by Gambia\u2019s parliament to legalize FGM, describing the practice as \u201chorrific.\u201d Despite the ban, FGM has still been performed on children in parts of the country. Last year, three women were convicted of performing the practice on eight female minors\u00a0and ordered to pay fines of around 15,000 Gambian Dalasi ($220) each or face a one-year jail sentence.

The Eugenic Protection Law, in place from 1948 to 1996, allowed authorities to forcibly sterilize people with disabilities, including those with mental disorders, hereditary diseases or physical deformities and leprosy. It also allowed forced abortions if either parent had those conditions. At least 25,000 people were sterilized\u00a0under the law, Kishida told a meeting at his official residence of about 130 survivors, many now elderly and in wheelchairs, public broadcaster NHK reported Wednesday. \u201cI decided to meet with you today in order to personally express my remorse and apology for the tremendous physical and mental suffering that many people have endured based on the former Eugenic Protection Law,\u201d Kishida said. The law was unconstitutional and had violated individuals\u2019 human rights and dignity, the prime minister said, adding he had ordered authorities to prepare a new compensation plan for survivors, without sharing the details. Plaintiffs and their supporters have argued that a previous government compensation offer of 3.2 million yen (about $20,000) each was too low.\u00a0They won a significant victory\u00a0earlier this month, when Japan\u2019s Supreme Court ordered the government to pay 16.5 million yen (about $105,000) each in damages to plaintiffs of several lawsuits and 2.2 million yen ($14,000) to their spouses. One plaintiff, Kikuo Kojima, described being taken to the hospital when he was 19, where he said he was \u201cgiven the nickname \u2018Schizophrenic\u2019 and forced into eugenic surgery.\u201d \u201cI will never forget that,\u201d he said, according to NHK. Other plaintiffs said they were bedridden for years following their operations, faced a lifetime of discrimination, were unable to work due to the physical and mental toll, and wished their bodies could return to their \u201coriginal\u201d state, NHK reported. Eugenics law Japan experienced a brief baby boom after World War II, alarming authorities as they struggled to deal with severe nationwide food shortages and a war-ravaged economy, according to academics and Japanese medical associations. The government leapt to implement population control measures, including a national campaign to promote contraception \u2013 and the Eugenic Protection Law, which \u201cmade abortions and sterilizations available,\u201d and was described as \u201cgovernment policy in the population field\u201d in a 1972 report by the government-run Institute of Population Problems.

Under the quota system, some 30% of sought-after civil service jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971 - with many of the country\u2019s contemporary political elite related to that generation. Since the roles are linked to\u00a0job security and higher pay, the quota system has angered many in the country, particularly students and young people, as Bangladesh faces high unemployment levels. Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which saw demonstrators gather on streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities. In 2018, the civil service quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case. On Sunday, the country\u2019s top court dismissed the earlier ruling that brought back the quotas, directing that 93% of government jobs will be open to candidates on merit, without quotas. Speaking to local media in Dhaka following the announcement, Shah Monjurul Hoque, a lawyer representing students said that the Supreme Court \u201cgave a final solution to this quota system.\u201d \u201cThat is 93% quota for general people, 5% quota for freedom fighters and their kin, 1% for ethnic minority community, and 1% for third gender and physically disabled,\u201d he said. Bangladesh Attorney General A.M. Amin Uddin told Reuters, \u201cI am hoping normalcy will return after today\u2019s ruling and people with ulterior motives will stop instigating people,\u201d noting that students \u201chave clearly said they are in no way part of the violence and arson that have taken place in Bangladesh since Monday.\u201d \u201cI will ask the government to find out the culprits behind the violence and take strict action against them,\u201d he added. Ahead of the ruling, Bangladesh on Sunday extended a curfew imposed on Friday to try to quell the violence and deployed soldiers to patrol the streets of the capital Dhaka, according to Reuters. According to local media, the curfew was extended until after the Supreme Court hearing and will continue for an \u201cuncertain time\u201d following a two-hour break for people to gather supplies, Reuters reported.

Archaeologists in the square outside the Archbasilica of St John Lateran in the city center unearthed a complex architectural structure including walls believed to have protected the Patriarchio, a monumental basilica envisaged by Emperor Constantine in the 4th century, the ministry said in a statement. \u201cThis is an extraordinarily important find for the city of Rome and its medieval history, as no extensive archaeological excavations have ever been carried out in the square in modern times,\u201d the ministry said. The initial structure of the building, which follows Constantine\u2019s declaration of tolerance for Christianity in the Roman Empire in 313, was expanded in stages between the 9th and 13th centuries and housed the papacy until 1305 when it temporarily moved to Avignon in France, the ministry added. The area around St John Lateran is being spruced up ahead of the Jubilee, a year-long event starting in December that is expected to attract more than 30 million pilgrims and tourists to the Italian capital. During a Jubilee, Catholics can obtain special indulgences, or remission of their sins, if they fulfill certain conditions and do good works or make pilgrimages.

{"id": "2024_07_17_uk_king-charles-iii-unveils-keir-starmers-plans-for-britain-in-state-opening-of-parliament", "text": "Keir Starmer, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, pitched himself as an antidote to \u201cthe snake oil charm of populism\u201d on Wednesday, unveiling sweeping plans to target housebuilding, crime, illegal migration and a breakdown in public trust during the first ceremonial King\u2019s Speech of his government. King Charles III formally opened a new session of parliament by reading out Starmer\u2019s agenda at a grandiose event that brings together Britain\u2019s royal pageantry and political class, two weeks after his landslide landslide election win brought a 14-year era of Conservative rule to an emphatic end. The speech focused on Starmer\u2019s central slogan of \u201cnational renewal,\u201d and included pledges to nationalize Britain\u2019s railways, tackle a housing crisis by changing planning laws to build more affordable homes, and intensifying efforts to tackle illegal migration. Starmer more broadly took swipes at the Tory governments that had ruled Britain since 2010, and at the swell of populism that has rippled across the UK and Europe, attempting to lay claim to Britain\u2019s center ground with a public push for pragmatism. \u201cNo more wedge issues. No more gimmicks,\u201d Starmer told lawmakers in the House of Commons as debate on his agenda began, insisting his government would \u201csolve problems, not exploit them.\u201d \u201cThe fight for trust is the battle that defines our political era,\u201d Starmer said. His 40-bill agenda includes measures crafted to appeal to both older and younger generations, as Starmer seeks to maintain the broad coalition of voters that put him into Downing Street earlier this month. But his introduction to that agenda also contained an effort to counteract the rise of populism in the UK and Europe. \u201cThe snake oil charm of populism may sound seductive, but it drives us into the dead end of further division and greater disappointment,\u201d Starmer said. While the speech fleshed out some of the growth-orientated vision Starmer pitched during the summer\u2019s election campaign, it was light on details on other areas, including how Starmer would meaningfully bolster Britain\u2019s border security after an election campaign disrupted by public concern over small boat crossings to the UK. And Starmer opted to swerve some of the thornier constitutional and voting changes he had pledged to make during the campaign, including an upper age limit on peers allowed to sit in the House of Lords, and the lowering of the voting age to 16. Pomp and politics collide The state opening of parliament is a rare collision of pomp and politics, featuring a series of centuries-old flourishes and conventions that catch even many of Britain\u2019s lawmakers off guard. The production began when King Charles III and his wife, Camilla, made their way by carriage from Buckingham Palace to the Houses of Parliament, before MPs were summoned by Black Rod \u2013 a role established in the 1300s \u2013 to watch his speech in the House of Lords chamber. Starmer and his defeated rival, Conservative leader Rishi Sunak, shared a warm conversation before and after the speech, their roles dramatically reversed after the election on July 4 that saw Labour win a landslide in parliament, although with a modest share of the votes. Once the speech began, focus shifted to the first Labour legislative plan in a decade and a half. It put at its heart an effort to build, after a decade of stalled growth that had seen housing and infrastructure projects scuppered across Britain. Starmer also formalized plans to renationalize Britain\u2019s rail network in the coming years, and to create a publicly-owned renewable energy company. Other parts of the speech continued Labour\u2019s efforts to appeal to traditionally conservative voters who have lost faith in the Tory party after a tumultuous stretch in government. In particular, Starmer promised a clampdown on illegal migration and small boat crossings across the Channel \u2013 an issue that plagued successive Conservative governments and gave rise to a surge in support for Reform UK, a populist anti-migrant bloc that won more than 4 million votes in the election. The speech pledged extra powers for law enforcement to investigate people smuggling, including stopping and searching at the border, and the creation of a new Border Security Command. It also promised to clear Britain\u2019s vast asylum backlog, which has ballooned to near 100,000 people in recent years and forced the government to accommodate asylum seekers in hotels and detention centers for months while they await news on their claim. At home, a number of institutions were targeted for modernization \u2013 most awkwardly, the very room in which Charles gave his speech. Under government plans, hereditary peers will no longer be able to sit and vote in the House of Lords, in a \u201cfirst step in wider reform\u201d to the chamber. A new draft Race Equality Bill will meanwhile make it mandatory for large employers to report ethnicity and disability pay in the same way they currently report gender pay. And legislation for a long-awaited ban on both gay and transgender conversion therapy \u2013 efforts to change someone\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity \u2013 was announced, having been first trailed by Theresa May in 2018 but never brought to light. Sunak tells Starmer he \u201cmust now deliver change\u201d Starmer acknowledged a breakdown in belief among the British public that politics can be a force for good \u2013 trust in politics is at record lows, studies have suggested, after a lengthy period dominated by scandal in Westminster. But his agenda will be underpinned by a large dealing of skepticism that Britain\u2019s public services can be revived without a much larger infusion of cash than the government is offering. Little in the speech focused on Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS), or on its social care sector, where the priority will be management rather than new legislation. After the King read Starmer\u2019s speech, MPs gathered in the Commons to debate Labour\u2019s agenda, with former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promising to lead the opposition constructively while a drawn-out contest to replace him as Conservative leader takes place. \u201cThe party opposite has successfully tapped into the public\u2019s desire for change, but they must now deliver change,\u201d Sunak said. He and Starmer had shared warm exchanges earlier in the day \u2013 which Starmer said had partially focused on England\u2019s football team \u2013 but the rigor of Britain\u2019s politics returned and tension crept back into the chamber as Sunak criticized the scrapping of his plan to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, and claimed that Labour had inherited, thanks to his work, an economy on an upward trajectory. And Sunak urged Starmer to match his committment to increase the UK\u2019s defense spending to 2.5% of its GDP, saying it \u201cwill show the Americans that we do not expect them to bear every burden\u201d within NATO. Those arguments will intensify in the coming weeks, as Labour introduces its first bills to Parliament \u2013 beginning with three priority measures from the speech later this week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/uk/king-charles-iii-unveils-keir-starmers-plans-for-britain-in-state-opening-of-parliament/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

Brett Clibbery, 70, and his wife, Sarah Packwood, 60, had been sailing on their 42-foot sailboat the SV Theros, but their bodies were found in a lifeboat that washed up on Sable Island, Nova Scotia, according to a statement from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), published July 12. The couple left Halifax Harbour, Nova Scotia on June 11 en route to the Azores, a group of Portuguese islands in the mid-Atlantic, around 2,000 miles away. They were reported missing on June 18 and their bodies were found on July 10. It is not clear why the couple abandoned the Theros and got into a lifeboat. An investigation is ongoing, the RCMP said. CNN has contacted the RCMP for comment. Sable Island is a 27-mile long sandbar around 186 miles southeast of Halifax. It is known as \u201cthe graveyard of the Atlantic\u201d and there have been more than 350 recorded shipwrecks there since 1583, according to the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic. Clibbery\u2019s son James paid tribute to his father and Packwood in a post on Facebook. \u201cThey were amazing people, and there isn\u2019t anything that will fill the hole that has been left by their, so far unexplained passing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLiving will not be the same without your wisdom, and your wife was quickly becoming a beacon of knowledge, and kindness.

The pair met every day for the few weeks after their first encounter, before Clibbery helped Packwood to care for her dying mother and she then looked after him after his kidney operation. They stayed in touch after Clibbery moved back to Canada and Packwood visited him in Salt Spring Island near Vancouver, where the Theros was docked, in spring 2016. \u201cHe took me on my first ever yacht trip and I loved it,\u201d Packwood told The Guardian. \u201cBrett proposed to me in the main cabin of the boat.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/americas/sable-island-shipwreck-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_tech_google-wiz-acquisition", "text": "Google owner Alphabet is in advanced discussions to buy fast-growing cybersecurity startup Wiz for roughly $23 billion, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. A takeover of Wiz, which makes cybersecurity software for cloud computing, would represent a major bet by Google on cybersecurity, marking the tech giant\u2019s biggest-ever acquisition. Discussions between Google and Wiz began after the startup raised $1 billion from venture capital investors earlier this year, the source said. Terms of a potential deal have not been finalized and talks could still collapse, according to the source. News of the Google-Wiz talks was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Neither Google nor Wiz returned CNN\u2019s requests for comment. The deal would easily surpass Google\u2019s purchase of Motorola for $12.5 billion about a decade ago, the biggest takeover in company history. Google offloaded Motorola just two years later for a massive loss. A $23 billion price tag on Wiz is nearly double the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. In March 2022, Alphabet bought cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion as part of its efforts to help companies better address cyber threats and bolster its cloud computing business. Google Cloud is central to the company\u2019s efforts to diversity revenue beyond its core search advertising business. Although its cloud sales have grown, it has struggled to compete with similar services from Microsoft\u00a0and Amazon. Buying Wiz would be a \u201cshot across the bow\u201d at Microsoft and Amazon, showing that Google is making a \u201cmajor bet on the cyber security space to complement its flagship offering in the cloud,\u201d Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at\u00a0Wedbush, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Cloud security has become especially important in recent years as companies have spent heavily to move data to cloud platforms. Just last week, AT&T revealed that nearly all of its wireless customers\u2019 call and text records were exposed in a massive breach caused by an \u201cillegal download\u201d on a third-party cloud platform. The Google-Wiz deal talks come despite intense antitrust scrutiny under the Biden administration of tech giants. However, that antitrust scrutiny could be dialed back somewhat if Trump once again takes hold of the White House, Ives said, making the Federal Trade Commission \u201cmuch weaker\u201d and sparking an \u201caccelerated merger and acquisition environment to take place for Big Tech.\u201d If the acquisition gets finalized and closes, it would mark a massive exit for Wiz and its founders \u2014 Assaf Rappaport, Ami Luttwak, Yinon Costica and Roy Reznik. The four executives met years ago when they were drafted into Unit 8200, the cyber intelligence division of the Israel Defense Forces. Since starting up in March 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, New York City-based Wiz has enjoyed explosive growth. Today, the company says 40% of Fortune 100 companies are its clients. Notable customers include BMW, Slack and Salesforce, and it works with major cloud companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Google.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/tech/google-wiz-acquisition/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_19_middleeast_israel-west-bank-jerusalem-occupation-icj-opinion-intl", "text": "The United Nations\u2019 top court said Friday that Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal, in an unprecedented opinion that called on Israel to end its decades-long occupation of territories claimed by Palestinians for a future state. The advisory opinion, while non-binding, was the first time the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has expressed its view on the legality of Israel\u2019s presence in territories it captured in the 1967 war. An advisory opinion is not legally binding but carries moral authority and can shape international law,\u00a0according to the ICJ. Friday\u2019s opinion prompted condemnation from Israeli leaders and praise from Palestinian officials. In its sweeping judgment, the ICJ ran through a list of Israeli practices that it said violated international law, including confiscating land, building Israeli settlements in the territories, and depriving Palestinians of natural resources and the right to self-determination. The court called on Israel to\u00a0cease new settlement activity, evacuate settlers and make reparations for the damage caused. \u201cThe sustained abuse by Israel of its position as an occupying Power, through annexation and an assertion of permanent control over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, violates fundamental principles of international law and renders Israel\u2019s presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory unlawful,\u201d the opinion read. Judge Nawaf Salam, the president of the ICJ, which is based in The Hague in the Netherlands, said the court observed that \u201clarge-scale confiscation of land and the degradation of access to natural resources divests the local population of their basic means of subsistence thus inducing their departure.\u201d The court also found that Israel\u2019s declaration of Jerusalem as its capital helped to \u201centrench Israel\u2019s control of the occupied Palestinian territory\u201d and said that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are \u201cin violation of international law.\u201d During the 1967 war, Israel captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights from neighboring Arab states. Soon after, it began establishing Jewish settlements in those territories. The Palestinians want the West Bank and Gaza for a future state, with East Jerusalem at its capital. Israel considers the entirety of Jerusalem as its \u201ceternal capital.\u201d In its opinion, the court concluded that all states and international organizations, including the United Nations, are under an obligation \u201cnot to recognize as legal the situation arising from the unlawful presence of the State of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\u201d The case predates the current Israel-Hamas war, and stems from a 2022 request for an advisory opinion by the UN General Assembly. The 15 judges on the court were asked to consider \u201cthe legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.\u201d It is also separate from the ICJ proceedings held in January over an accusation from South Africa that Israel was committing genocide in its war against Hamas following the October 7 attacks \u2013 a claim Israel has vehemently denied. \u2018False decision\u2019 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other politicians rejected the ICJ opinion. \u201cThe Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement. \u201cNo false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth, just as the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\u201d Foreign Minister Israel Katz also condemned the opinion, calling it \u201cfundamentally warped, one-sided, and wrong.\u201d Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, himself a settler, also spoke out against the court.\u00a0\u201cThe answer to The Hague \u2013 sovereignty now,\u201d Smotrich\u00a0said on X, a call for Israel to annex the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority (PA) welcomed the opinion, calling it \u201ca watershed moment for Palestine, for justice, and for international law.\u201d The opinion \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more timely or sorely needed,\u201d the PA said in a statement, adding that it \u201cis a vindication of their steadfastness and perseverance.\u201d The PA also urged all states and the UN not to recognize the legality of the settlements and to \u201cdo nothing to assist Israel in maintaining this illegal situation.\u201d Implications of the ICJ opinion While the ICJ has previously given advisory opinions about Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank, Friday\u2019s announcement is a step further, some experts said. The ICJ in 2004 delivered an advisory opinion on the Israeli separation barrier around the majority of the West Bank, urging Israel to remove it from occupied land. The nonbinding opinion had found that Israel was obligated to return confiscated land or make reparations for any destruction or damage to homes, businesses and farms caused by the barrier\u2019s construction. \u201cIf the 2004 opinion held that Israel had to dismantle the wall, or at least the parts of it that encroach onto the West Bank, (Friday\u2019s opinion) holds that Israel has to withdraw as rapidly as possible from the occupied territories,\u201d Eliav Lieblich, a professor of international law at Tel Aviv University, told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s a major difference \u2013 not the legality of the settlements per se, but the implications of the settlements and the entire practice around them,\u201d Lieblich said. While ICJ opinions are not binding, they are perceived as \u201cvery authoritative statements of international law as is,\u201d he said, adding that they may have an impact on international organizations taking this opinion to domestic courts, demanding for example that individual counties refrain from exporting weapons that may be used in the occupied territories.

Houthi spokesperson Yahya Sare\u2019e said the\u00a0operation was performed by a new drone capable of \u201cbypassing the enemy\u2019s interception systems.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy\u2019s massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Sare\u2019e said. \u201cOur operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.\u201d The attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis. In a televised briefing on Friday, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range.  A second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli territory to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders. An Israeli military official said the drone was detected by an Israeli aerial defense system, but not intercepted due to \u201chuman error.\u201d It was armed with a warhead\u00a0and crashed into an apartment building, the official added, without providing further details of the device\u2019s payload. The official didn\u2019t provide details about what the human error was but noted that Israel\u2019s aerial defense systems don\u2019t always operate autonomously. The Iron Dome defense system, for example, can operate in manual mode, where its radar detects and tracks incoming threats but needs input from an operator before launching an interceptor missile. According to an initial inquiry \u201cno sirens were activated\u201d during the incident,\u00a0the IDF said earlier. Jack Lew, the US Ambassador to Israel, said Friday he was \u201cshocked by the brazen Houthi drone attack\u201d and sent his condolences to the victims\u2019 families. \u201cWe are thankful our US Embassy Branch Office personnel are safe,\u201d he added. Deadly explosion The explosion occurred in a central district home to a number of diplomatic missions, and hit about 100 meters (330 feet) from a US Embassy branch office, according to CNN analysis and information from local authorities. There was no damage to the US diplomatic mission\u00a0and\u00a0no reports of injuries of US personnel or \u201clocally engaged staff,\u201d the US State Department said. \u201cWe are in close contact with Israeli authorities to fully investigate the source of the explosion and its intended target,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding the embassy in Jerusalem and the branch in Tel Aviv are ready to provide consular assistance to US citizens. Emergency crews responded to \u201can object\u201d that had exploded on Shalom Aleichem Street, Israel\u2019s Magen David Adom (MDA) emergency service said. \u201cThe dead man had suffered penetrating injuries,\u201d MDA paramedic Roi Klein said. At least four of the injured sustained shrapnel wounds, the MDA said. Israeli far-right\u00a0National Security\u00a0Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and opposition leader Yair Lapid criticized the Israeli government for being unable to protect the country, saying on social media that the attack showed the government \u201ccannot give security to the citizens of Israel.\u201d \u201cThere are no policies, no plans, all public relations and discussions are about themselves,\u201d he said. Ben Gvir said the attack on Tel Aviv and other areas of Israel are \u201cprecisely why I insist on being around the table in determining Israel\u2019s\u00a0policy.\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June disbanded the country\u2019s war cabinet after former war cabinet member Benny Gantz announced his withdrawal from the body, and Ben Gvir asked to join. Houthi attacks The Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted Israel with drones and missiles since the start of the country\u2019s war with Hamas, most of which have been intercepted by Israel\u2019s defenses. The Houthis have also been attacking US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza following Hamas\u2019 October 7\u00a0attack, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 others kidnapped. Israel\u2019s air and ground offensive\u00a0on Gaza has killed more than 38,000 people in the enclave, according to Palestinian authorities. The war has displaced almost all of the strip\u2019s population of more than 2 million people, turned swaths of the territory into rubble and triggered a massive humanitarian crisis. The war has raised fears of a wider regional conflict, with the potential consequences of further human suffering and shocks to the global economy. The Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, for instance, have forced some of the world\u2019s biggest shipping and oil companies to suspend transit through one of the most important maritime trade routes. Sare\u2019e, the Houthi spokesperson, said the operation targeting Tel Aviv was carried out with a new drone called \u201cYafa\u201d that can \u201cbypass the enemy\u2019s interception system and (is) undetectable by radars.\u201d Fabian Hinz, a research fellow for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, wrote on X that Houthi claims shouldn\u2019t be taken at face value. \u201cIn general, Houthi claims are a mixed bag. Sometimes they are accurate, sometimes they are exaggerated, sometimes they are just straight-up fabrications,\u201d he wrote, adding that \u201ctheir factual claims have to be taken with a much bigger grain of salt than Iran\u2019s or Lebanese Hezbollah\u2019s.\u201d He said however that the drone used in the Tel Aviv attack is likely to be a Sammad, \u201cthe Houthi\u2019s standard long-range strike drone\u201d that has already been used in attacks against Israel, but with a more powerful engine. For the Houthis, he wrote, an extended drone range would be attractive \u201cas it would allow them to strike targets further away, fly routes evading enemy defenses, and attack from unexpected angles.\u201d Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, told CNN that the Houthis are likely to capitalize on the attack, especially as Israel\u2019s defenses failed to intercept it. \u201cThey will capitalize on it, not just inside Yemen but also outside Yemen,\u201d Nagi said, adding that the attack took place ahead of the rebel group\u2019s weekly rallies, which take place every Friday in support of Gaza in Houthi-controlled Yemeni cities. The attack \u201cgives momentum\u201d to these rallies, he said. The drone attack Friday in Tel Aviv comes after the Houthis claimed earlier this month that they had targeted ships in the Israeli port of Haifa with a number of drones in joint military operations with Iran-backed militias based in Iraq. The IDF told CNN at the time that it was not aware of such an incident.

{"id": "2024_07_15_africa_rwanda-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "Rwandans lined up on Monday to elect their next president, with early results putting incumbent Paul Kagame in the lead in a vote widely expected\u00a0to give him a fourth term and extend his near quarter century in charge of the East African country. The two men standing against him \u2013 Frank Habineza from the Democratic Green Party and independent Philippe Mpayimana \u2013 said they were hoping to make some progress, but analysts and rights groups said Kagame\u2019s overwhelming victory was all but certain. Kagame, who got more than 93% of the vote at the last three elections, won praise from Western and regional leaders at the time for helping end\u00a0the 1994 genocide in\u00a0Rwanda. The US State Department and others have also lauded the development of the economy. Rwandans are also voting on Monday for members of the lower house of parliament and provisional results are expected by July 20. Polling stations were open until 3 p.m. (1300 GMT). The overall voter turnout was 98% of the 9 million registered voters, Oda Gasinzigwa, chair of the National Electoral Commission, said in a statement on the national broadcaster later on Monday evening. Of 78.94% of the votes counted at about 2017 GMT, Kagame was ahead with 99.15% of the votes, data from the commission showed. Campaign groups, including Human Rights Watch, have accused authorities of cracking down on journalists, the opposition and civil society groups before the vote. Kagame has dismissed such accusations and described himself as the stability candidate. His reelection could signal a measure of political stability for his corner of a fractured region, but also continued global scrutiny, given the accusations of abuses and of\u00a0supporting rebels\u00a0in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 a charge he has also denied. Earlier on Monday, at the Rwandexco polling center in the capital Kigali, Barimukije Pheneas said he would vote for the 66-year-old incumbent. \u201cWe voted smoothly without any crowding, and we are happy,\u201d Pheneas said. \u201cI voted for Paul Kagame because he has achieved a lot for us; he united us.\u201d Motorcycle taxi driver Karangwa Vedaste said the voting process was calm and peaceful, but declined to say who he had chosen. \u201cI voted for a leader I trust. The one I voted for is a secret in my heart. We will share it when he wins,\u201d Vedaste said. The electoral commission barred eight other candidates, including Kagame\u2019s most vocal critics, from running, citing a range of reasons including missing and incomplete registration documents. Democratic Green Party candidate Habineza, whose deputy was found dead and almost beheaded in the run-up to the 2010 vote, said there had been signs of progress. \u201cWe toured the entire country, and wherever we went, people welcomed us warmly. They gave us gifts and assured us they would vote for us,\u201d Habineza said after voting. \u201cWe have to maintain this momentum and not regress,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are confident, each of us is confident, it\u2019s half and half,\u201d independent presidential candidate Mpayimana told journalists after casting his vote. The US State Department says on its website\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0has made \u201cprogress in developing national and local government institutions, economic development, maintaining security (and) promoting reconciliation.\u201d It also says it backs\u00a0Rwanda\u00a0efforts to \u201cincrease democratic participation (and) enhance respect for civil and political rights.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/africa/rwanda-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_middleeast_benjamin-netanyahu-washington-dc-visit-mime-intl", "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu landed in Washington on Monday to far less fanfare than he would have expected just a day earlier. His highly-anticipated visit \u2013 chock-full of meetings with top US officials and a prized address to Congress \u2013 will now undoubtedly be overshadowed by US President Joe Biden\u2019s stunning decision to drop out of the presidential race. But as detailed ceasefire negotiations aimed at turning a framework agreement into a final deal stretch into their third week, Netanyahu\u2019s visit will still be critical to the prospects of a ceasefire in Gaza. Senior US officials say a deal is within reach,\u00a0but the prospects of a deal\u00a0may hinge on the answer to one key question: Does Netanyahu actually want a deal? The conventional wisdom in Israeli media, politics and on the streets of Tel Aviv would tell you that the answer to that question is no \u2013 that Netanyahu has much more to gain by prolonging the war and much more to lose by ending it. The war has allowed Netanyahu to delay his share of accountability for the failures leading up to\u00a0the\u00a0October 7\u00a0attacks, rebuffing calls for new elections with stiff wartime resolve. His party\u2019s prospects in the next election have actually improved in recent months. And the right-wing coalition partners keeping him in power have threatened to bolt if Netanyahu cuts a deal that ends the war. Even Biden\u00a0has said \u201cthere is every reason\u201d for people to believe Netanyahu is prolonging the war in Gaza in order to stay in power. There are also indications that Netanyahu is throwing up eleventh-hour obstacles to reaching a deal. He reneged on a key Israeli concession regarding allowing Palestinians unrestricted access to northern Gaza that was included in Israel\u2019s latest ceasefire proposal and now appears to be insisting on Israel maintaining control of the Philadelphi Corridor, a 14km strip of land that serves\u00a0as\u00a0a buffer zone on the border between Egypt and Gaza. And publicly, his rhetoric has undermined confidence in Israel\u2019s commitment to reaching a deal that could end the war. And yet, Netanyahu and his negotiating team have also steadily engaged in negotiations, exchanging proposals with Hamas and bringing the two sides closer than ever to a potential deal. A growing share of the Israeli public, led by hostage families, is demanding the government strike a deal. And Netanyahu\u2019s allies insist he is earnest in his desire to strike a hostage release deal \u2013 just the right deal, one that could allow Israel to resume fighting in Gaza. That tension will be inescapable now Netanyahu has arrived in Washington, where he has often sought to bolster Israel\u2019s standing in the US as well as his own political standing at home. While Netanyahu will look to showcase the support he still has in\u00a0Washington (and a standing ovation from a majority of lawmakers in Congress should do the trick), his visit is also an opportunity for top US officials and lawmakers to push, prod, nudge and cajole him toward a deal \u2013 in both public and private. Chief among those eager to make that case will be the US president, who will meet face-to-face with Netanyahu this week\u00a0for the first time since Biden flew to Israel in October in a dramatic show of wartime support. The warmth and sympathy that filled the air during that October visit is likely to be replaced by something much frostier. Biden has grown steadily more critical of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza \u2013 where\u00a0more than\u00a039,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health \u2013 and Netanyahu has resisted US pressure, often publicly thumbing his nose at the White House. Even as he has maintained strong support for Israel, Biden became the first president since Ronald Reagan to withhold some US munitions to Israel \u2013 suspending shipments of 2,000-pound bombs in May amid concerns about civilian casualties in Gaza. Netanyahu, meanwhile, has not only resisted US calls to rein in Israeli military operations in Gaza, but has used his defiance of the White House\u2019s calls for restraint to bolster his political standing in Israel \u2013 including in a speech just days before his trip to the US in which he talked up his refusal to bow to Biden\u2019s pressure to wind down the war and abandon a planned offensive in Rafah. Biden\u2019s decision to drop out of the presidential race just two days before he sits down with Netanyahu will unquestionably shift the dynamic between the two men even further \u2013 exactly how remains to be seen. Netanyahu will be the first foreign leader to sit down with the now effectively lame duck president \u2013 albeit one who still has six months in office during which he will continue to steer US foreign policy. Loosened from the constraints of electoral politics and with a keener eye on his legacy, how will Biden now approach Netanyahu, the future of the war in Gaza and US policy toward Israel? And to what extent will Netanyahu feel compelled to heed Biden\u2019s pressure? As the Israeli prime minister weighs that new dynamic, Netanyahu \u2013 a keen observer of US politics \u2013 may be looking to someone else\u00a0as he decides whether to take a leap toward a ceasefire: former US President Donald Trump. Trump has a track record of unflinching support for Israel and has been critical of Biden\u2019s efforts to rein in Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza. During his speech at the Republican National Convention, he warned that the hostages \u201cbetter be back before I assume office, or you will be paying a very big price.\u201d But Trump in April also urged Israel to get its war in Gaza \u201cover with, and get it over with fast.\u201d And Netanyahu no longer enjoys the cozy relationship he once had with Trump. \u201cThe first person to congratulate Biden was Bibi (Netanyahu). And not only did he congratulate him, he did it on tape,\u201d Trump told CNN analyst Barak Ravid in 2021. \u201cHe was very early\u00a0\u2014 like, earlier than most. I haven\u2019t spoken to him since. F**k him.\u201d Netanyahu will have plenty of opportunities to assess whether that sentiment still stands as he meets with Trump allies in Washington this week. There are currently no known plans for\u00a0him to meet\u00a0with Trump.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-washington-dc-visit-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_americas_venezuela-election-maduro-bloodbath-speech-intl-latam", "text": "The United States has raised concerns about the recent arrests of Venezuelan democratic opposition figures ahead of the country\u2019s elections this month, as authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro told his supporters he must win at the polls to avoid a possible \u201cbloodbath.\u201d \u201cIf they do not want Venezuela to fall into a bloodbath, into a fratricidal civil war,\u201d the ruling party must win the presidential elections on July 28, Maduro told a campaign event in Caracas on Tuesday. Only a win for his party would ensure \u201cpeace\u201d in the country, Maduro said, adding that he expects \u201cirreversible results\u201d in his favor. CNN has reached out to Maduro\u2019s office for further comment on his statements. Maduro\u2019s remarks come as his government attempts to cling on to power for another six years while facing a credible challenge from opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia. Many experts believe the opposition has a real chance of pushing Maduro out of office. In the run up to the vote, Venezuela has \u201cunjustly detained\u201d democratic opposition figures, civil society members and journalists, according to the US State Department, which called for their release in a statement Wednesday. Strongman Maduro has been in power in for more than a decade, having assumed the presidency following the death of predecessor Hugo Chavez in 2013, during which time his government has often been accused of rigging votes and silencing the opposition. The 2018 election that returned Maduro to office was largely boycotted by the opposition. The poll was described as illegitimate by an alliance of 14 Latin American nations, Canada and the United States and as a \u201cfarce\u201d by the Organization of American States. There were hopes the 2024 election might be different after Maduro promised Washington last year in a historic agreement that he would hold free and fair elections in exchange for sanctions relief. However, more recently the opposition has accused him of reneging on that pledge. Two opposition candidates \u2013 Maria Corina Machado and Corina Yoris \u2013 have been barred from running while a report this week by a human rights group suggested there had been a spate of \u201carbitrary detentions\u201d since the beginning of the campaign season on July 4. Human rights NGO Laboratorio de Paz reported Monday there had been 71 arbitrary detentions in the first 10 days of campaigning, the majority of them involving people who had provided some type of service to the campaign command of the opposition candidate Gonz\u00e1lez, of the Democratic Unitary Platform. Two days after Laboratorio\u2019s report came out, the barred opposition leader Machado said in a post on X that her security chief had also been arrested. Machado said her security chief Milciades \u00c1vila was \u201ckidnapped\u201d on Wednesday \u201cby the Maduro regime and accused of gender violence against some women.\u201d The opposition leader said the women who accuse \u00c1vila of gender violence tried to \u201cattack\u201d her and Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia in a restaurant last Saturday. \u201cThere are dozens of witnesses and videos that demonstrate that this was a planned provocation to leave us without protection 11 days before July 28,\u201d Machado wrote. CNN has reached out to Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office for comment on \u00c1vila\u2019s arrest and to determine whether he has legal representation. The US was concerned about \u00c1vila\u2019s arrest and called for his immediate release, a State Department spokesperson said Wednesday. The US also urged Venezuela to release all those who were \u201cunjustly detained\u201d during the presidential election campaign. Costa Rica, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Panama meanwhile called on Venezuelan authorities to guarantee that elections are \u201cfree, fair, and transparent,\u201d in a joint statement released Wednesday by the Alliance for Development in Democracy. CNN has asked the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry for a response to the joint statement. Maduro is one of 10 candidates vying for the presidency, however, several of them have minimal support and are viewed by the main opposition as government allies.

{"id": "2024_07_19_style_skywalkers-rooftopping-documentary-culture-queue", "text": "What was your most thrilling first date? In 2016, two young Russians known for their extreme \u201crooftopping\u201d adventures \u2014 where they attempt to illegally climb vertiginous landmarks like La Sagrada Familia and the Eiffel Tower \u2014 skipped the perfunctory happy hour cocktail and instead ascended China\u2019s tallest incomplete skyscraper, the 1,957-foot-high Goldin Finance 117. At the time, Ivan Beerkus and Angela Nikolau didn\u2019t know they\u2019d end up together. Beerkus had invited Nikolau, a rare female member of the rooftopping community (she was scaling the proverbial glass wall before breaking it), to join him for the climb to produce sponsored social media posts. But it was the beginning of a long romantic and creative partnership, which has led them to travel thousands of miles\u00a0\u2014 and thousands of feet in the air \u2014 together. Eight years later, the documentary film \u201cSkywalkers: A Love Story\u201d takes an intimate look at their unusual romance through hundreds of hours of footage that, of course, includes heart-dropping POV footage from impossible heights and the occasional run-in with law enforcement. Like all couples, Beerkus and Nikolau have their ups and downs, and when they argue the stakes are a just bit higher than most (in one scene, Beerkus\u00a0bravely accuses his girlfriend of being \u201ctoo negative\u201d as she gears up to nail a precarious acrobatic pose literally above the clouds). Through the pair\u2019s unusual lifestyles, \u201cSkywalkers\u201d becomes a meditation on trust and commitment, though their stunts will also get your palms sweaty, if that\u2019s your thing. Directed by Jeff Zimbalist, a filmmaker with rooftopping experience of his own, and co-directed by Maria Bukhonina, \u201dSkywalkers\u201d debuted at Sundance Film Festival in January and is now streaming on Netflix. It follows the couple, who utilize Nikolau\u2019s background as a trained gymnast to create acrobatic stunts on narrow ledges, poles and scaffolding, as they take on increasingly difficult challenges and navigate their own budding relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the fear of falling from heights, but more about the fear of falling in love,\u201d Zimbalist said in a video call with CNN. \u201cAngela first told me that they were\u2026 competitors and rivals. But you could sense under the surface that there was this bubbling flirtation there.\u201d An architectural dare As the documentary progresses, the pair plot out their most difficult climb yet: Kuala Lumpur\u2019s Merdeka 118, the world\u2019s second-tallest building. The gleaming 2,227-foot-tall tower, which opened earlier this year, is crowned with a 527-foot-tall spire whose apex is only accessible via a narrow internal ladder. In 2022, when Beerkus and Nikolau made their plans, the \u201csupertall\u201d skyscraper had topped out but was still under construction. Evading security and reaching its apogee safely required an intense and elaborate scheme \u2014 one conjured while they worked through relationship issues. (At the time of their climb, the tower\u2019s owner said police were investigating the pair for trespassing, although Malaysian authorities did not respond to CNN about whether further legal action was taken.) Rooftopping is a contentious pastime \u2014 both for the danger it poses and participants\u2019 reliance on illegal trespassing.  With the urban \u201csport\u201d emerging as one more of the more extreme ways to get likes on social media, several harrowing deaths have followed. For \u201cSkywalkers\u201d the film crew followed Beerkus and Nikolau to document their stunts, but only to a point. Zimbalist emphasized his team\u2019s safety measures, which were designed to ensure the crew neither endangered themselves nor presented any distractions for the couple. \u201cWe talked a lot with Ivan and Angela, saying, \u2018Please, don\u2019t go do anything additionally crazy beyond what you would usually do,\u2019\u201d Zimbalist said. \u201cBecause to us, this isn\u2019t a movie about whether or not you succeed at Merdeka or any other climb\u2026 the genuine suspense here is if you choose to trust each other.\u201d An \u2018expanded state of mind\u2019 For the couple, rooftopping isn\u2019t just about thrill-seeking. Nikolau, the daughter of circus performers, says in the film that pushing herself to her limits was engrained from childhood and that she is always striving to better herself. For Beerkus, who scaled buildings alone in Moscow for years, rooftopping offers a sense of mental clarity. \u201cThe higher I went, the easier it was to breathe,\u201d he says to camera, recalling his earliest climbs. \u201cThis extreme life, this expanded state of mind, it\u2019s essential for me.\u201d Zimbalist recognizes the dangers of rooftopping and says his film is not\u00a0 about\u00a0\u201cdefending what they do against critics.\u201d Instead, he hope that \u201dSkywalkers,\u201d in addition to its message on love and trust, provides a rare look at the hard work and planning behind the rooftoppers\u2019 \u201cpolished\u201d social media posts. \u201cWith any activity that\u2019s dangerous, social media tends to disguise the difficulty,\u201d he said. \u201cTelling the story behind a stunt helps to give context and just how challenging and how dangerous some of these things are.\u201d Believe it or not, Nikolau maintains that she is afraid of heights, something she has had to confront repeatedly to keep up with her chosen line of work. \u201cThe fear never really went away; I just got better and better at facing it,\u201d she explains in one clip. So while the makers of \u201cSkywalkers\u201d would probably rather you don\u2019t climb your nearest skyscraper, their film encourages us to dare \u2014 and say \u201cyes\u201d to the thing that scares us the most. \u201cSkywalkers: A Love Story\u201d is available to watch on Netflix Add to Queue: Such great heights WATCH: \u201cFree Solo\u201d (2018) If you prefer watching daring feats on rock cliffs instead of skyscrapers, this Academy Award-winning documentary by filmmaker Chai Vasarhelyi and photographer-mountaineer Jimmy Chin follows climber Alex Honnold as he prepares to summit Yosemite\u2019s very vertical 3,000-foot-tall rock formation, El Capitan, without a rope or a harness.

{"id": "2024_07_11_tech_apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets", "text": "Apple has yielded to pressure by European regulators to give rivals access to the contactless payments technology on iPhones, meaning that their users will no longer be limited to the Apple Pay mobile wallet. The development on the tap-to-pay technology underscores mounting regulatory scrutiny of Apple (AAPL) in the European Union, where it is also facing a potential huge fine for allegedly breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, announced this and other changes to Apple\u2019s business practices Thursday, saying they would open up competition in mobile payments on iPhones. \u201ciPhone users will (now) be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores\u2026 while enjoying all the iPhone functionalities, including double click, tap-and-go and Face ID,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager told journalists. The tech giant has until July 25 to implement the changes, which will remain in force for 10 years and apply throughout the 30 countries in the European Economic Area. Under the agreement, third-party mobile wallet developers will gain free access to the standard technology used for contactless payments with iPhones, known as near-field communication (NFC) technology. Apple will also allow iPhone users to choose which mobile wallet to make the default wallet on their phones. \u201cApple is providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and\u00a0contactless\u00a0transactions for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets\u00a0from within their iOS apps,\u201d Apple said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cApple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the European Economic Area for users and developers.\u201d The European Commission first raised objections against Apple\u2019s tap-to-pay practices in 2022, having opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple Pay two years earlier. The regulators found that Apple had abused its dominant market position by restricting access to the NFC technology needed to make payments on mobile devices. That means rivals wanting to create apps or wallets using the tap-to-pay features on iPhones have been unable to do so and users have been forced to use Apple Pay for mobile payments. \u201cFrom now on, Apple can no longer use its control of the iPhone ecosystem to keep (competing) mobile wallets out of the market,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cCompeting wallet developers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice while keeping payments secure.\u201d The commitments do not extend to Apple Watches, however. \u201cOur impression was that the number of people who use Apple Watches for payments is rather small,\u201d said Vestager, adding that there was \u201climited harm done\u201d from excluding those devices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/tech/apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

He is president and design director of architecture and engineering firm NORR, which is behind some of the city\u2019s best-known landmarks, including the Atlantis and Shangri-La Hotels. Now he is working on one of his most ambitious creations. Due for completion by the end of 2024, Ciel Dubai Marina, formerly known as Ciel Tower, will have more than 1,000 rooms and suites spread over 82 floors \u2014 and at around 1,200 feet (365 meters) high, it is set to become the world\u2019s tallest hotel. A passion project For the project, Jan was tasked with designing the skyscraper on a triangular plot of land at Dubai Marina with an area of just 2,500 square meters \u2013 small for a building of that height. \u201cIt\u2019s a property that\u2019s very compressed,\u201d he told CNN in 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s like what you would face in Manhattan or London. The constraints were tremendous, and yet we had to make it work.\u201d A glass observation deck will offer 360-degree views of the city, as well as the coastline and iconic landmarks such as the Palm Jumeirah man-made island, according to the developer, The First Group. Visitors will also be able to take in the sights from a rooftop swimming pool and restaurants. As well as appealing to the senses, the project is energy efficient, using 25% less power for air conditioning than is typical for similar buildings, Jan said. \u201cThis project is not just about architecture. It\u2019s about architecture and engineering coming together,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why I love the project so much. It \u2026 is my passion, the convergence of science and art.\u201d Throughout the build, Jan said he has been \u201cextremely involved\u201d in the work. \u201cWhen you design a project as complex as the Ciel, you can never let your guard down, you can never say it\u2019s over,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuous process.\u201d An extended stay When Jan first arrived in Dubai in 1996, he never envisioned he would leave such a legacy, designing some of the city\u2019s most iconic office developments, residential towers and malls. He grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, and moved to the US aged 18 on a scholarship. After studying structural engineering at Princeton, he got a Master\u2019s in architecture. After that, Jan worked in the US for nine years and had no intention of leaving until he received a job offer as a senior designer working on the Emirates Towers office and hotel complex. Now aged 61, he said that he never planned to stay in the UAE for so long, now having spent 28 years in Dubai. \u201cI got carried away with the excitement here,\u201d he said. As for Ciel Dubai Marina \u2014 named for the French word for sky \u2014 Jan hopes that it will come to be seen as timeless, like the Empire State Building or the Chrysler Building in New York City. \u201cThe reason I like the fact that it\u2019s called Ciel is because I believe in our own lives the sky is the limit, and that\u2019s the case certainly in my own life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a chance to grow, to do things that I didn\u2019t think I would get a chance to do.

In a statement, Gr\u00e9goire Goodstein, IOM\u2019s chief of mission in the country, blamed the tragedy on Haiti\u2019s spiraling security crisis and the lack of \u201csafe and legal pathways for migration.\u201d \u201cHaiti\u2019s socio-economic situation is in agony.

{"id": "2024_07_19_asia_bangladesh-job-quota-protests-explainer-intl-hnk", "text": "Huge protests across Bangladesh escalated into deadly violence this week with clashes\u00a0between students, pro-government supporters\u00a0and armed police fueling\u00a0widespread\u00a0anger over civil service job quotas opponents say are discriminatory. Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and hundreds injured in the violence, which has seen riot police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters and crowds of demonstrators armed with sticks filling the streets and university campuses in the capital Dhaka and other cities. State broadcaster Bangladesh Television (BTV) was off air on Friday after student demonstrators allegedly set fire to its headquarters, according to local media, and protesters have called for a nationwide shutdown in a major challenge to the government of longstanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. A curfew has been imposed, mobile and internet services cut, schools and universities ordered to close, and security forces deployed to quell the unrest, with human rights groups accusing authorities of using unlawful force against protesters. On Sunday, Bangladesh\u2019s Supreme Court rolled back most of the controversial quotas on government jobs, with officials saying they hope it will bring normalcy back to the streets. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Why are students protesting? Many Bangladeshi students are demanding an end to the government\u2019s quota system, which reserves more than half of\u00a0civil service posts for certain groups. Some 30% of those highly sought-after jobs are reserved for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, a seminal moment in the nation\u2019s history as it successfully won freedom from a much larger ruler. Many of the country\u2019s contemporary political elite are related to that generation \u2013 including Prime Minister Hasina, a daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the widely regarded founder of modern Bangladesh who was assassinated in 1975. The reserved roles are linked to\u00a0job security and higher pay, and protesters say the quota system is discriminatory and favors supporters of Hasina\u2019s ruling Awami League party. They are demanding recruitment based on merit. \u201cA government job is a really good opportunity,\u201d said Maruf Khan, 29, a Bangladeshi studying in Australia, who has joined rallies supporting the protests in Sydney. \u201cAbout 500,000 to 600,000 people are competing for 600 to 700 government jobs and on top of that it includes a 56% quota. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d Driving the anger is high unemployment levels in the country, especially among young people. Bangladesh has seen strong economic growth under Hasina, but it has slowed in the post-pandemic era and, as the World Bank notes in its latest overview, inequality has \u201cwidened in urban areas.\u201d\u00a0In a nation of 170 million people, more than 30 million are not in work or education. In 2018, the quota system was scrapped following similar protests but in June the High Court reinstated it, ruling its removal was unconstitutional. On July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the quotas for one month while it took up the case. Critics and protesters say the quota system creates a two-tier Bangladesh where a politically connected elite benefit by their birth. \u201cThe freedom fighters have sacrificed a lot for the nation \u2026 for that reason this quota was a logical thing in the past,\u201d said student protester Tahmeed Hossain. \u201cBut there have been at least two generations after that. Nowadays, the quota \u2026 has rather become a form of discrimination. It has become a cultural propaganda to create a stronghold in the country.\u201d On Sunday, the country\u2019s top court dismissed the earlier ruling that brought back the quotas, directing that 93% of government jobs will be open to candidates on merit. Shah Monjurul Hoque, a lawyer representing students, said of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling: \u201cThat is 93% quota for general people, 5% quota for freedom fighters and their kin, 1% for ethnic minority community, and 1% for third gender and physically disabled.\u201d Why did the protests escalate? The protests began at the prestigious Dhaka University on July 1 and later spread to other campuses and cities nationwide in almost daily street gatherings that included rail and road blockades. The demonstrations became violent on July 15 when members of the Bangladesh Chatra League \u2013 the\u00a0student wing of the ruling Awami League party \u2013 reportedly attacked student protesters inside the Dhaka University campus. Since then, clashes between security forces, protesters and government supporters have escalated, with Bangladesh deploying its paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion, which was sanctioned by the United States in 2021 after \u201cwidespread allegations of serious human rights abuses.\u201d The student protester Hossain told CNN he was wounded at a rally at Dhaka University on Wednesday when a projectile was thrown into the crowd. \u201cSomeone threw a small thing at us that blew up and I heard shots. I started running and realized that I had been hurt by some splinters in my hands. The police then attacked us with tear shell in the building,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my friends got hit by a (rubber) bullet in the leg. Some of my friends got their heads smashed and are currently under treatment in the hospital.\u201d Another protester in Dhaka, Hassan Abdullah, said Thursday: \u201cThere are tear (gas) shells just 50 meters away from me as I am talking to you. The police are constantly bursting sound grenades right now.\u201d CNN cannot independently verify the accounts but the sounds of protest commotion, including multiple audible cracks, could be heard during the conversation with Abdullah. Reports of the number of people killed has varied widely, with the Dhaka-based newspaper Prothom Alo saying 19 people were killed on Thursday alone and the Agence France-Press news agency reporting\u00a032 deaths, citing its own tally compiled from hospital data. Authorities have also moved to block online communications. Internet monitoring site Netblocks confirmed a \u201cnear-total national internet shutdown\u201d across Bangladesh on Thursday. \u201cThe new measure follows earlier efforts to throttle social media and restrict mobile data services,\u201d it said on X. What has the government said? The demonstrations are the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Hasina since she secured a fourth consecutive term in January elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition party to protest what they said was a widespread crackdown on their ranks. Hasina has announced a judicial investigation into the killings and called on protesters to await the verdict of the Supreme Court. \u201cI especially urge everyone to wait patiently until the Supreme Court verdict comes. I believe our students will get justice from high court, they will not be disappointed,\u201d Hasina said in a news conference Thursday. But she has been accused of enflaming\u00a0protester anger by reportedly calling them \u201crazakar,\u201d\u00a0 an offensive term used for those who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistani army during the 1971 independence war. \u201cWe expected an apology from our prime minister for comparing us to traitors of 1952 and 1972, and a solid solution to quota reform,\u201d said protester Salman Farsi. \u201cWhat did the students do to deserve this tag?\u201d Student protesters CNN spoke to say their demonstrations have gone beyond frustration over the quota system and their anger is now directed at Hasina and her government, which human rights organizations have long warned are headed toward a one-party system. \u201cThis is a people\u2019s movement against the authoritarian government,\u201d Hossain said. \u201cThis is not just about quota protests anymore, this is much bigger than that, in simple quota protests the government wouldn\u2019t go around hurting and shooting students. This shows the current fascist and autocratic nature of the government, who has been upholding the power without any proper voting system.\u201d What has global reaction been? Bangladeshi students have held smaller protests elsewhere,\u00a0including in New York\u2019s Times Square, the Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney and the Danish capital Copenhagen. The US said it was \u201ccontinuing to monitor the reports of violence from the ongoing protests in and around Dhaka,\u201d a State Department spokesperson said in a briefing on Thursday. \u201cFreedom of expression and peaceful assembly are essential building blocks to any thriving democracy, and we condemn the recent acts of violence in Bangladesh.\u201d UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u00a0called for restraint on all sides and urged the government to investigate all acts of violence, according to UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. \u201cThe secretary-general encourages the meaningful and constructive participation of youth to address the ongoing challenges in Bangladesh. Violence can never be the solution,\u201d Dujarric  said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/19/asia/bangladesh-job-quota-protests-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

Before a trilateral meeting with US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. CQ Brown and South Korean Adm. Kim Myung-soo, Japanese Gen. Yoshihide Yoshida said China was trying to \u201cchange the status quo by force\u201d in the East China and South China seas, while North Korea was carrying out \u201crepeated ballistic missile launches and continuous arms transfers\u201d to Russia. Yoshida called on Japan, South Korea and the United States to \u201cdemonstrate our strong unity domestically and globally to ensure regional peace and stability.\u201d But bilateral cooperation between Japan and South Korea is the most noteworthy result of this week\u2019s meeting in Tokyo. On Wednesday, Yoshida met South Korea\u2019s Kim for the first such meeting between the East Asian defense chiefs in six years - a moment a US defense official stressed was significant. Kim said he and Yoshida \u201cshare a lot of the same thoughts,\u201d an acknowledgment of the mutual perspective on the regional threat posed by China and North Korea. \u201cWe developed strong trust between us,\u201d said Yoshida, adding the meeting sets the stage for the Japan-South Korea bilateral \u201cdefense cooperation to achieve a new height.\u201d Regional analyst James Brown said the Japan-South Korea meeting showed just how far the bilateral relationship has come under South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who succeeded Moon Jae-in in 2022. \u201cThe political mood has improved significantly, and now we\u2019re having the defense side of things aligning with that,\u201d said Brown, a professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo. \u201cThe Japanese government\u2019s feeling about this is that this is the relationship they\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d Japan felt the previous administration in Seoul was \u201cfixated on historical issues\u201d as it \u201cdemonized Japan\u201d and tried to improve relations with North Korea, Brown said. Last month, Japan and South Korea joined the US in the inaugural Freedom Edge in the Pacific, a military exercise that focused on ballistic missile and air defense, anti-submarine warfare and more. The goal of the exercise, which is set to expand in future years, was to allow the militaries to better work together against a common adversary. For years, historical acrimony between the two East Asian countries prevented high-level meetings and cooperation, with decades of deep mistrust dating back to Japan\u2019s colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula a century ago. But as the countries faced an increasingly assertive China and threats from North Korea, efforts to cooperate quickly supplanted past animosity, driven in large part by the efforts of US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. In March 2023, the two countries promised to resume ties at a fence-mending summit in Tokyo. Four months later, Biden hosted the leaders of Japan and South Korea at Camp David, where they pledged to \u201cinaugurate a new era of trilateral partnership.\u201d Then last month, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met his Japanese and South Korean counterparts on the sidelines of a security conference in Singapore, where they announced joint military exercises - nearly unthinkable just a few years ago. The trilateral meeting of the chiefs of defense at the Japanese Defense Ministry on Thursday, held for the first time in Tokyo, underscored the rapidly developing cooperation. \u201cI expect that the three of us sitting here in Tokyo today will send a message to the regional threats but also more globally on the strength of our relationship, our alliances, and the work that we need to continue to do,\u201d said Gen. Brown, sitting alongside his counterparts at the beginning of the meeting. The meeting comes on the heels of the NATO summit held last week in Washington, on the 75th anniversary of the alliance. The NATO communique specifically mentioned the importance of the Indo-Pacific, \u201cgiven that developments in that region directly affect Euro-Atlantic security.\u201d In their opening remarks Thursday, the Japanese and South Korean defense chiefs both mentioned their concern over Russia\u2019s expanding relations with North Korea. Earlier this week, Brown told CNN: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is NATO nations increasing interest in what happens in the Indo-Pacific, and Indo-Pacific nations having an interest in what goes on in Europe as well.\u201d Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said there was some sense of urgency behind the rapidly developing cooperation. The East Asian nations, he said, want to triangulate a coordinated response to common adversaries before potential changes in Seoul or Washington could put the relationship in jeopardy. \u201cDomestic politics remain complicated in Seoul and Tokyo, but policymakers and military professionals want to lock in coordinated responses to North Korea, Russia, and China before any major political changes occur in Washington,\u201d Easley said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/18/asia/japan-south-korea-military-ties-china-north-korea-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

According to his LinkedIn profile, he worked as an emergency medical technician for the German Red Cross and as an armed security officer for the US Embassy in Berlin. Krieger was sentenced in the Minsk Regional Court on June 24, Viasna said on its website on Friday. Krieger was charged under six articles of the Criminal Code of Belarus, according to Viasna, including \u201cmercenary activity,\u201d \u201cagent activity,\u201d an \u201cact of terrorism,\u201d the \u201ccreation of an extremist formation,\u201d \u201cintentional disrepair of a vehicle or communication lines,\u201d and \u201cillegal actions in relation to firearms, ammunition and explosives.\u201d Viasna also reported that Krieger was found guilty of \u201carranging an explosion in order to influence decision-making by authorities, intimidate the population, [and] destabilize public order.\u201d It is unclear exactly what led up to Krieger\u2019s alleged crimes or when they occurred. \u201cThe Federal Foreign Office and the Embassy in Minsk are providing consular support to the individual concerned and are working intensively on his behalf with the Belarusian authorities,\u201d a spokesperson from the German Foreign Office told CNN on Saturday, in an apparent reference to Krieger. \u201cThe death penalty is a cruel and inhumane form of punishment that Germany rejects under all circumstances. We are actively working worldwide to abolish it and are strongly advocating against its execution in all affected cases,\u201d the spokesperson added. Belarus says it has ensured consular access to a German national,\u00a0Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Anatoly Glaz\u00a0said in a statement on X.\u00a0Minsk has \u201cproposed a number of options\u201d to Germany \u201cfor the development of the situation,\u201d he said, according to\u00a0Belarusian state media BelTA.\u202f \u201cThere have been contacts with the German side on this topic, of course. This criminal is a German citizen and we understand the German side\u2019s concern for him,\u201d said Glaz, according to BelTA.\u201dConsultations on this topic are being held by the foreign ministries of the two countries,\u201d he added. The German Red Cross (DRK)\u00a0told CNN\u2019s German affiliate N-TV\u202fthat while \u201cthe man in question,\u201d without naming Krieger, had previously worked for them, his stay abroad was not related to his work with the DRK. CNN has also reached out to the German Red Cross for comment. \u201cI am concerned by news that German citizen Rico Krieger was sentenced to death by Lukashenko\u2019s regime in Belarus,\u201d exiled Belarusian opposition figure\u00a0Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said\u00a0on X on Friday. \u201cWe are collecting more information on his case at the moment.

Eight activists were participating as part of a Palestinian grassroots campaign called Defend Palestine, which calls on international volunteers to travel to the Israeli-occupied West Bank to protect Palestinians from Israeli settler attacks. Two Americans and a German national were taken to hospital with suspected fractures after the attack, their campaign said, adding that another American volunteer suffered minor injuries. One of the Palestinian farmers was hospitalized. Three of the foreign victims, Vivi Chen, David Hummel, and Jedda, who declined to give her last name, spoke with CNN about the attack from hospital in the West Bank city of Nablus, where they were receiving treatment. They said they were accompanying Palestinian farmers to their olive fields, which they haven\u2019t been able to access since October because of attacks by Israeli settlers. At some point, the group was approached by several young settlers on a hill. \u201cThey sort of stood there for a while and then they came up to our group of international volunteers and they started hitting us with these thick wooden sticks almost like baseball bats,\u201d Chen said. Videos recorded by the activists show them trying to retreat as they were attacked. One of them immediately falls to the ground, another tries to shield himself with his arms as he is struck, and at least one is kicked in the leg and hit with a rock hurled by an attacker. One woman fell down the hill and was also struck with a rock. The settlers then \u201csmashed her phone and she lost her documents and cards,\u201d Chen told CNN. \u201cWe were doing nothing,\u201d the Hummel said. \u201cOur hands were up and we were backing up and trying to protect each other. So eventually, we tried to keep moving back because we had been hit so many times.\u201d Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war and soon started settling Jews on the land. There are currently more than 700,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank. The international community however considers the area to be occupied and Israeli settlements there illegal. The Palestinians want the territory for a future independent state. The International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations\u2019 top court, said Friday that Israel\u2019s presence in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is illegal, in an unprecedented opinion that called on Israel to end its occupation. It called on Israel to cease new settlement activity, evacuate settlers and make reparations for the damage caused. \u2018Dire need\u2019 for international protection The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledged the attack on Sunday, saying in a short statement to CNN that \u201ca number of masked Israeli civilians assaulted a group of foreign citizens while they were planting trees in the area.\u201d The IDF said it condemns any acts of violence, adding that its soldiers were sent to the scene and that it will operate to maintain security in what it considers its jurisdiction.\u00a0It added that soldiers were dispatched to the scene and fired warning shots into the air, causing the attackers to flee. But the activists said that when the soldiers arrived, they immediately pointed their guns at a Palestinian man who was accompanying the volunteers and fired shots in his direction. \u201cHe was our friend and everyone was screaming, \u2018No, no! He\u2019s our friend, he\u2019s our friend!\u2019 And they shot live bullets at him,\u201d the activists said. The IDF didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s question about the alleged targeting of the Palestinian volunteer. The injured activists were taken for treatment by the Palestinian Red Crescent to a hospital in Nablus. Pictures taken at the hospital showed the victims with multiple cuts and bruises across their bodies. The face of Hummel, the German activist, was severely swollen on the right side. Mohammed Khatib, an organizer with the Defend Palestine campaign, said: \u201cThe attack today, not even 24 hours after the ICJ ruled that Israeli occupation is illegal and that settlers enjoy impunity when exercising violence, serves as further proof for the dire need for international civil protection in Palestine.\u201d Chen said the group didn\u2019t expect to encounter violence but was \u201caware of settler violence\u201d against Palestinians. \u201cOur injuries are very minor compared to what the Palestinians face every day,\u201d she said. Sunday\u2019s assault followed a separate attack on Saturday in the West Bank, south of Hebron.

{"id": "2024_07_22_china_china-floods-climate-change-intl-hnk", "text": "As temperatures soared across parts of central China\u2019s agricultural heartland last month, farmers struggled with day after day without rain. In sweltering Henan province, many scrambled to irrigate parched crops during what is usually a key growing period, while authorities ordered water use to be limited and for clouds to be artificially seeded in an effort to prod rain clouds, state media reports said. Just one month later, however, parts of the province were awash \u2013 pounded by extreme rain\u00a0that inundated tens of thousands of acres of cropland and forced more than 100,000 people to evacuate their homes, according to state media. Parts of Henan\u2019s hardest-hit Nanyang city saw more than 600 millimeters (about 24 inches) of rain in 24 hours\u00a0\u2013 three-quarters of what they would normally expect in a whole year. Rescuers navigated streets on speedboats, at times wading through waist-deep floodwaters to pluck people from their homes, footage circulating online showed. It\u2019s a story playing out across China. In the past two weeks, tens of thousands have been evacuated across multiple provinces in the country following deadly floods and landslides, which have blocked highways, destroyed homes and caused devastating financial losses as they wiped out crops and livestock. The lurch from dry weather to flooding also throws into sharp focus the major challenge for the Chinese government as emergency response and recovery becomes a regular occurrence \u2013 and as extreme weather is only expected to become more frequent due to human-driven climate change. The flooding in Henan and surrounding provinces last week \u2013 and the double hit of arid heat and floods in a matter of weeks \u2013 has prolonged what has already been a devastating period of extreme weather across China that\u2019s forecast to continue. Torrential rainfall has hit southern, central and eastern parts of the country and led to major emergency response efforts\u00a0in a flood season that has started some two months ahead of its typical schedule and only last week entered what\u2019s known as its peak period. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party acknowledged the urgency of the situation last week, when a communique following a landmark meeting of its top members led by Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to \u201crefine the measures for monitoring, preventing, and controlling natural disasters, especially floods.\u201d The government has in recent years grown increasingly alert to the domestic risk of climate change \u2013 including its potential impact on food security as drought and floods hit lands critical for the national grain supply. China, the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas emitter, has looked to position itself as a leader in the global transition to green energy \u2013 even as it\u2019s met challenges weaning itself off coal due to high demand for power. Authorities are meanwhile grappling with the latest crises amid mounting social frustration with China\u2019s stuttering economy and the broader direction of the country \u2013 and as local governments\u00a0strapped with high levels of debt are tasked with recovery efforts. Before last week\u2019s floods, natural disasters\u00a0had already cost nearly $13 billion in direct economic losses and affected 32 million people this year, China\u2019s Ministry of Emergency Management said on July 12. \u201cLast night I couldn\u2019t sleep at all,\u201d one farmer in Henan\u2019s\u00a0Nanyang city said as he surveyed submerged crop fields in a video posted to social media and shared by a government-linked account. \u201cAll my hard work for a year has come to nothing.\u201d Deepening challenge As the heavy rains moved across central China in recent days, accounts of loss and devastated livelihoods also spread across social and local media. At least 34 people have been killed since last weekend due to flooding and landslides, including 15 who died in a bridge collapse in Shaanxi province Friday following flash floods and heavy rain. It comes after flooding and landslides late last month killed at least 71 people in southern China. One video posted on social media showed a farmer in Sichuan province wading through chest-high waters to pick corn \u2013 clearly determined not to lose his harvest. Meanwhile, a farmer in flood-hit Hunan lost more than 800 pigs \u2013 taking a hit of about $275,000 \u2013 after his barn was inundated this month, he told state-backed Agricultural Television. Retailers and farmers have also taken to social media to sell flooded crops at a discount \u2013 for many a last-ditch attempt to salvage an income in a country where research shows insurance coverage is low compared with other major economies. As of Sunday, 10 provinces were under emergency alerts for flooding, according to national weather authorities, with more heavy rain expected in the coming days. A typhoon that hit China\u2019s Hainan island Monday is expected to make landfall on the mainland as a tropical storm Tuesday, while a cyclone that could strengthen to a typhoon is expected to hit coastal China later this week, according to CNN Weather. China\u2019s government has mounted a top-down effort\u00a0to revamp how the country responds to extreme weather in recent years after 2021 floods in Henan\u2019s Zhengzhou killed more than 300 people. And climate scientists earlier this month issued a stark warning, calling the country a \u201chotspot where the impacts of climate change are acutely felt.\u201d Observers say authorities have made progress, especially when it comes to early warnings and response, weather monitoring and certain infrastructure development \u2013 but they also note more must be done in China \u2013 like many countries grappling with climate change \u2013 to prepare for the impact of more frequent extreme weather. \u201cWhile policies and strategies are being developed and implemented, the pace and scale of action often fall short of what is needed to effectively mitigate the risks and impacts of climate change,\u201d said Hongzhang Xu, an adjunct research fellow at the Australian National University. That need may be more acute in remote, rural or mountainous regions, often populated by vulnerable elderly populations and with fewer resources, as well as provinces not historically prone to severe flooding, like in China\u2019s northeastern breadbasket, which endured extreme rains last year. Guangtao Fu, a professor of water intelligence at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, said that although the government has been investing in water infrastructure to boost flood protection there was a \u201csignificant gap\u201d in investment to maintain existing systems. That urgency was underscored earlier this month when a dike alongside China\u2019s second-largest freshwater lake burst after 17 days of heavy rains \u2013 flooding nearly 20 square miles of land and displacing at least 7,000 people, according to official reports. Another challenge, experts say, is bolstering recovery from severe flooding, where damaged croplands, destroyed homes and devastated livelihoods can take months to recover. Local governments are typically tasked with managing reconstruction efforts, while the central government plays a role in planning and financing. But there have been past issues of misappropriation of state recovery funds, for example following the deadly 2021 floods in Zhengzhou. And only about 8% of an aggregate $25 billion in losses in China from flooding caused by Typhoon Doksuri last summer were covered by insurance, according to data from global insurance firm Munich Re. \u201cFarmlands need to be re-plowed, and fully restoring soil quality would take several months,\u201d said Li Zhao, a senior researcher at Greenpeace East Asia in Beijing. \u201cFor the residential houses, each household should spend a lot of money to rebuild \u2013 just to recover from this kind of event is very difficult.\u201d Those living in flood-prone areas also face a tough choice as the risks grow, she added. \u201cMaybe in the future, we will see how people make the decision,\u201d she said. \u201cAre they moving to a safer place? Or will they go back to the villages (and rebuild)?\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/china/china-floods-climate-change-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_20_europe_ukraine-zelensky-uncertainty-russia-negotiations-intl", "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky struck an unusually subdued tone as he addressed his nation this week, hinting at a willingness to negotiate with Russia for the first time since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion more than two years ago. Zelensky suggested Moscow should send a delegation to the next peace summit that he hopes to hold in November. Russia was not invited to the previous peace conference, held in Switzerland last month, as Zelensky said any talks could only happen after a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine. Kyiv is currently facing the double whammy of a difficult frontline situation and political uncertainty over the level of future support from Ukraine\u2019s closest allies. While the progress Russian troops are making in eastern Ukraine has slowed significantly since US weapons started arriving in the country in May, it has not stopped entirely. Russia is still gaining territory, albeit at a much slower pace. At the same time, questions are emerging about the willingness of some of Ukraine\u2019s closest and most important allies \u2013 notably the United States and Germany \u2013 to continue pouring resources into the conflict in support of Kyiv. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Zelensky said Ukraine was not receiving enough Western assistance to win the war, pointing out that its outcome will be determined way beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders. \u201cNot everything depends on us. We know what would be a just\u00a0end to the war, but it doesn\u2019t depend only on us. It depends not only on our people and our desire, but also on finance, on weapons, on political support, on unity in the EU, in NATO, in the world,\u201d the president said. Former US Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst said it was plausible Zelensky\u2019s shift in tone was a reaction to the events unfolding in the United States, where former President Donald Trump on Monday announced a staunch critic of sending support to Ukraine, JD Vance, as his running mate. Speaking to CNN from the Aspen Security Forum, Herbst said that it was possible Zelensky was trying to reach out to the potential future Trump administration by stressing he would be willing to negotiate \u2013 as long as the deal on the table is just. \u201cIt has to be (a) reasonable peace, which does not permit Russian occupiers to continue to torture, repress and murder the people of Ukraine who are being occupied,\u201d he said. Russia has repeatedly denied accusations of torture and human rights abuses in Ukraine despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Trump and Zelensky spoke on Friday in what Trump called a \u201chad a very good phone call\u201d. The former president said he would \u201cbring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives\u201d while Zelensky said the two discussed \u201cwhat steps can make peace fair and truly lasting.\u201d Unacceptable terms Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeated several times in recent months that he would be willing to negotiate with Ukraine \u2013 albeit on terms that remain completely unacceptable to Ukraine and its Western allies. Putin said Russia would end its war in Ukraine if Kyiv surrendered the entirety of four regions claimed by Moscow: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Large swathes of these regions remain under Ukrainian control, so he is essentially asking Ukraine to give up territory without a fight. Putin also said any peace deal would require Ukraine to abandon its bid to join NATO, prompting Kyiv to call the proposal \u201coffensive to common sense.\u201d Orysia Lutsevych, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, said that considering Putin\u2019s public demands, Zelensky\u2019s words were likely meant as a message to the rest of the world. \u201cIt\u2019s both a signal to Russia and a signal to the global south that Ukraine is not some kind of obstructive force. It is willing to sit at the negotiating table. But this cannot be totally on Russian terms, and it cannot lead to (the) capitulation of Ukraine to Russia \u2026 Putin is demanding the control of regions he can\u2019t conquer militarily,\u201d she told CNN. Lutsevych believes Putin has stepped up his calls for negotiations because he knows his window of opportunity may be closing. Despite being considerably bigger and stronger than Ukraine, Russia has not managed to fulfil its territorial goals \u2013 even when Kyiv was receiving only limited help from the West. Moscow\u2019s initial attempt to take the capital ended up in a defeat and the front lines have not moved considerably in more than a year. Uncertainty ahead New US military assistance started reaching the front lines in Ukraine in May, after months of delays caused by political deadlock in the US Congress. At the same time, Ukraine finally received permission from some Western nations to use their weapons to strike targets inside Russia \u2013 although only in limited circumstances and in areas near the border with Ukraine. While this\u00a0has helped slow Russian progress and averted a possible reoccupation of the Kharkiv region, Ukraine is still defending territory, rather than pushing forward to reclaim areas currently under Russian occupation. \u201cUkrainian forces are going to have to accumulate equipment, material and manpower for a future counteroffensive operation, and that\u2019s part of the Russian calculus that we are seeing \u2013 the Russian military command very much appears to be pursuing a strategy where they are conducting consistent, grinding offensive operations throughout the entire front line,\u201d said Riley Bailey, a Russia analyst at the US-based Institute for the Study of War. By making gradual, creeping advances along the more than 600-mile-long (1,000 kilometer) front line, Russia is forcing Ukraine to commit to defensive operations rather than gear up for a counteroffensive, Bailey said. \u201cThey will need to degrade the Russian forces and capabilities that are part of the offensive operations, which would bring some more flexibility and ease some of the pressure,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cUkraine can then start making some operational choices that it hasn\u2019t been able to make in the past few months.\u201d But the success of any future Ukrainian counteroffensive will depend primarily on how much support it receives from its Western allies going forward. Zelensky said this week that the current level of support was enough to hold off further Russian advances, but not win the war. This week brought more uncertainty on that front, as Trump announced that he had picked Vance as his vice-presidential nominee. Vance has previously suggested Ukraine should negotiate with Russia because the US and other allies do not have the capacity to support it. Trump himself has claimed he would \u201cend the war in one day\u201d and said the US shouldn\u2019t be sending money to Ukraine with no strings attached. At the same time, it emerged that Germany, which is among Ukraine\u2019s biggest supporters, plans to halve its military aid to Ukraine next year \u2013 although it suggested Ukraine should be able to meet the bulk of its military needs with the $50 billion in loans from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets approved by the G7 last month. If the worst-case scenario for Ukraine was to materialize \u2013 if the US stopped providing aid, Europe didn\u2019t step up its assistance and Ukraine wasn\u2019t able to access the frozen Russian assets \u2013 Russia would likely start to make much bigger gains. Herbst said that if the Democrats win the US presidential election in November, the current US policy of supporting Ukraine is likely to continue, with more aid flowing in. \u201cIf Trump were to win, we don\u2019t know what he will do. But we know that there are serious people on his national security team who will understand that Putin is a direct threat to American interests and that it is important or critical to the US that Putin lose in Ukraine,\u201d he added. But Herbst said there is one more factor which could convince a possible Trump administration to keep helping Ukraine. \u201cIf his team cuts off aid, and Ukraine collapses, that will be a major defeat to the United States, caused by the Trump team. And a defeat that would dwarf the embarrassment and the damage done by Biden\u2019s incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. And there will be people on his team that will understand that,\u201d he said. Analysts expect the Ukraine aid package \u2013 the more than $60 billion approved by the US Congress earlier this year \u2013 to last Kyiv about a year to 18 months, which could be enough time for Ukraine to regroup and launch a new counteroffensive. Lutsevych said that Ukraine desperately needs to make battlefield gains and then see if there is a real desire by Russia to negotiate \u2013 which she says doesn\u2019t currently come across as genuine. \u201cBut what evidence do we have that Russians are willing to negotiate? Putin is putting his country on a total war footing,\u201d she said, adding that the war will likely end only if Moscow begins to feel threatened. \u201cI think this war will end when Putin begins to feel that the Russian control over Crimea is threatened.\u201d Ukraine has already stepped up its attacks against the peninsula, illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 and home to Moscow\u2019s Black Sea fleet. Kyiv claims its military has struck and sunk or severely damaged several Russian warships in the area, disabling at least a third of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet. Ukraine has also managed to hit and temporarily shut down the Kerch Strait bridge that connects Crimea with Russia on several occassions. The southern front \u2013 which stretches from the Donbas in eastern Ukraine across the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, with Russian-occupied territory creating a land bridge between Russia and Crimea \u2013 will be a key target. While Zelensky\u2019s tone might have shifted this week, his position on what a peace deal should look like hasn\u2019t, or at least not publicly. The majority of Ukrainians do not want the government to give up any territory at all. \u201cRight now, it is politically difficult, if not impossible, to state that a peace can be achieved without the full return of all Ukrainian territories.

The demonstration calling for limits on tourist numbers saw protestors carrying signs that read, \u201cTourists we love you when you don\u2019t buy our land,\u201d and \u201cYour paradise is our nightmare,\u201d while marching through the city of Palma de Mallorca, located on the south coast of the island. Around 50,000 people took part in the protest on Sunday, which began at around 7 p.m. local time\u00a0time (1 p.m. ET) according to organizers Menys Turisme, Mas Vida (Less Tourism, More Life), although police put the figure at around 12,000, RTVE reported. The organizers claim the island\u2019s tourism model \u201cimpoverishes workers and enriches only a few.\u201d They demanded an \u201calternative tourism model,\u201d alongside \u201caccess to decent housing,\u201d the \u201cimprovement of public services,\u201d and the \u201cconservation and regeneration of natural areas.\u201d Tourism pushback The demonstration included around 110 groups and social movements, according to Spanish public broadcaster RTVE. It came amid growing tensions over the impact of tourism on local areas in Spain. The Balearic Islands, made up of Mallorca, the largest of the islands, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera, attracted 14.4 million foreign visitors last year, according to the Spanish National Statistics Institute. Earlier this month, protesters demonstrating against mass tourism in Barcelona sprayed visitors with water and marched through the city, chanting: \u201cTourists go home.\u201d The Balearic Islands issued new rules banning drinking in the streets in key tourist areas on the islands of Ibiza and Mallorca, with an exception for terraces and other licensed areas, back in May. In April, a hunger strike was called by locals in the Spanish Canary Islands, protesting against excessive tourism, which protesters said is pricing out locals and leading to environmental damage.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/travel/mass-protest-on-spanish-island-mallorca-calls-for-limits-on-tourism/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_style_cloudboom-strike-spray-on-running-shoes", "text": "We\u2019ve seen spray-on hair, a spray-on dress and now \u2014 marathon-winning spray-on shoes. Swiss sportswear brand On is the latest company to embrace advanced \u201cspray-on\u201d materials with a \u201crevolutionary\u201d robot-made sneaker it believes can improve performance at this month\u2019s Olympics. The Cloudboom Strike LS is lace-free and weighs less than the latest iPhone. Designed to be more adaptable, dynamic and supportive than your average running sneakers, the $330 shoes already have a convincing track record: Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri, an Olympic silver medalist and the only woman to have won indoor, outdoor and cross-country world titles, triumphed at this year\u2019s Boston Marathon wearing a pair. She will don them again to compete in the Paris 2024 Games this summer. Zurich-based On credits its shoes\u2019 success to a combination of biomechanics, physiology and extreme lightness. (A men\u2019s US size 8.5 weighs just 170g per shoe, over 100g lighter than several popular running shoes of the same size.) \u201cMore than anything, we want (the athletes) to win,\u201d said senior director of innovation, Ilmarin Heitz, in a promotional video published Monday. \u201cThat is our gauge of success.\u201d With no heel-cap, laces or tongue, the translucent, sock-like sneaker looks like a running shoe that has shed its skin. Its inventor, Johannes Voelchert, came up with the idea as a student after seeing a Halloween-themed hot glue gun that shot decorative spider webs. \u201cI saw that there was a quick way of creating a textile onto a complex shape,\u201d Voelchert, now On\u2019s senior lead of innovation concept design, said in the brand\u2019s video. \u201cA shoe seemed to be the right object.\u201d Voelchert brought his idea to the Milan Design Fair, where he caught the Swiss sportswear brand\u2019s attention. According to On, the shoe\u2019s uppers (the material above the sole) are made from a type of thermoplastic and colored and branded in three minutes using just a robotic arm. The upper is sprayed in one go and can be attached to the carbon-fiber and foam rubber sole using heat, not glue. The company claims its technology reduces the carbon emissions of producing a shoe\u2019s upper by 75%, compared to its other sneaker models. The material, which it dubs LightSpray, has \u201cthe potential\u2026 to move us towards a more sustainable, circular future,\u201d said Marc Maurer, On\u2019s co-CEO, in a press release. Sprayed-to-measure The technology will be on display at a pop up in Paris later this month as people flock to the capital for the 2024 Olympic Games. And while it is not yet known if which athletes other than Obiri will wear them at the Games, a number of Olympians have recently raced in the Cloudboom Strike LS, including Australian middle-distance runner Olli Hoare. The brand told CNN via email that it hopes athletes going to Paris who have previously worn the shoes \u2014 such as Irish 1,500-meter runner Luke McCann \u2014 will \u201ccontinue to choose them this summer.\u201d On is not the first company to experiment with spray-on textiles. In October 2022, luxury French fashion house Coperni made headlines when it sprayed a custom-fit dress onto model Bella Hadid at Paris Fashion Week. The label partnered with Manel Torres, whose brand Fabrican has been producing \u201cclothes-in-a-can\u201d for over 20 years. Spray-on fibers have also been used in the beauty industry, with \u201chair in a can\u201d solutions used to conceal bald spots and thinning hair. Having initially been made available to the public in April, the Cloudboom Strike LS will again go on sale to consumers later this year.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/style/cloudboom-strike-spray-on-running-shoes/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_17_weather_summer-heat-temperatures-us-climate", "text": "Heat is normal during the summer, but this year\u2019s has been anything but, and halfway through the season\u2019s hottest month it\u2019s clear this one is for the record books. Hundreds of cities in nearly every US state \u2013 including parts of Alaska and Hawaii \u2013 are on track for one of their 10-warmest summers on record. About 100 of these cities are enduring their hottest start to summer on record. The deadly heat has not been unexpected. Forecasters have been warning of a searing\u00a0summer for months due to the troubling combination of a budding La Ni\u00f1a and a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Last summer was the warmest on record globally and one of the warmest for several states. But so far, this summer has felt even worse for many in the US. Extreme heat has baked almost all of the\u00a0Lower 48 so far this summer, but the worst of it has concentrated in the East Coast states and West. Average daily temperatures \u2013 calculated by taking the average of each day\u2019s high and low \u2013 have soared several degrees above normal for hundreds of cities since June 1. These temperatures are a more complete indicator of how hot the season has been, as they factor in both hotter days and warmer nights. Summer nights in the US have been warming nearly twice as fast as summer days since records began in the late 1800s, according to data from NOAA. Warmer nights increase the danger of heat by compounding heat stress through a reduction in the amount of time the body has to cool down naturally. Las Vegas is experiencing its hottest summer on record and holds the top spot in the entire country. Many of the cities experiencing the most exceptional summer heat are in the West, notably in or near California\u2019s Central Valley. Searing heat there has been relentless since it started in early June. On the opposite coast, a historic mid-June heat wave has only been spelled by brief bouts of relief. Dozens of cities from New England to the Mid-Atlantic are experiencing their hottest start to the summer on record, including Washington, DC, which just smashed a high temperature record Tuesday when it hit 104 degrees. Some of the most abnormal heat in the region is focused in New England and New York state. The\u00a0South has also sweltered under more than its fair share of historic heat so far this summer.\u00a0Atlanta and Tampa, Florida, are both on pace to record their hottest summer on record.\u00a0For some locations in the region, it\u2019s the second consecutive year summer has had a blistering start. Last summer ended up quite warm for the Lower 48, but the worst heat was confined to the Gulf Coast. By mid-July last summer, the season was pacing as one of the warmest on record for cities nearest the coast, including cities like New Orleans, Houston and Brownsville, Texas. But in other parts of the country, last summer was downright cool compared to this year\u2019s extreme heat. Washington, DC, is currently on track to record its hottest summer on record, but it was only the 44th-warmest summer by this time last year. Sacramento, California, is experiencing its hottest start to summer on record. But this time last year California\u2019s capital city was experiencing is 62nd-warmest summer. Forecasts for the rest of the season aren\u2019t cool, either. Despite some upcoming brief periods of respite, much of the Lower 48 is expected to endure above-average temperatures through August and into September, according to the Climate Prediction Center.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/17/weather/summer-heat-temperatures-us-climate/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_22_style_bond-tower-tirana-albania", "text": "In Albania\u2019s capital Tirana, where a spate of new towers will soon\u00a0transform the skyline, architects have revealed plans for a new\u00a0double skyscraper that will bend elegantly like a ballet dancer\u2019s pli\u00e9, or a lover leaning in for a kiss. These were two of the visual cues for Bond Tower, a 50-story residential building and hotel that seems to trick the eye. Designed by Portuguese architecture firm OODA, the skyscraper will feature two connected structures that gently separate before rejoining one other, giving it a warped effect. Residents will stay on one side and hotel guests on the other, with office space and retail mixed in on several of the floors. The rolling mountains surrounding the city will be visible in the negative space between the buildings, explained Diogo Brito, a partner at OODA. Located on the corner of a major avenue, the silhouette of Bond Tower shifts depending on which direction it\u2019s approached from, he added. \u201cWe found this idea of having this dance between these two volumes\u2026 like a gentle encounter on the corner,\u201d Brito said in a phone interview. \u201cIt is very important to us to have this equilibrium \u2014 this balanced the beauty of form and shape.\u201d The architectural team designed the shape using multiple visual references, including the \u201cgrace\u201d of a ballet dancer\u2019s movement and the romantic gesture of Gustav Klimt\u2019s famous 1908 painting \u201cThe Kiss.\u201d But OODA also wanted to integrate Tirana\u2019s natural landscape into the design, which Brito said is sustainability-minded thanks to its carbon-absorbing stone cladding. \u201cThe thing that strikes you the most when you land in Tirana is the presence of those mountains, and to have\u00a0(them visible) through that gap is something that was also interesting for us to picture,\u201d he added. Aside from its visual appeal, the the unusual shape also offers structural sturdiness in an area prone to earthquakes, Brito explained. The project will break ground by the end of the year, according to the architect, with the tower scheduled for completion by the end of 2028. It will be one of many new buildings sending the Albanian capital\u2019s skyline soaring and turning the city into an architectural destination. Earlier this month, Albania\u2019s National Territorial Council approved a new tower that would become the city\u2019s tallest building, according to local news reports. Several other high-rises are already under construction in the capital, including two 58-floor skyscrapers: Mount Tirana by Denmark\u2019s CEBRA architecture and Tirana Tour by Spain\u2019s Bofill Arquitectura. And, in January, Architectural Digest magazine\u00a0recognized one of the city\u2019s newest jewels \u2014 a monumental, colorful pyramid by Dutch studio MVRDV, revamped from a dilapidated former museum \u2014 as one of the world\u2019s best new architectural projects. OODA alone is working on three other projects in the city, including a new television station headquarters inspired by a stack of film reels. This month, OODA will break ground on a greenery filled residential tower called Hora Vertikale that was designed as a \u201cvertical village,\u201d according to the firm. On the avenue where Bond Tower will rise, Brito expects that OODA\u2019s design will soon be joined by other high-rise companions. \u201cIn Albania, the years to come \u2014 let\u2019s say the next 10 to 15 years \u2014 will be something really special,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/style/bond-tower-tirana-albania/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "travel_us-couple-moved-to-thailand-built-home", "text": "With his retirement fast approaching, Jim Dolan, from the US, felt as though his future was more or less mapped out. He and his wife Som Dolan would build a house in her native country, Thailand, and split their time between the Southeast Asian destination and the States. But the couple ended up leaving the US for good after their home in Houston was severely flooded during Hurricane Harvey, a Category 4 storm that hit Texas in 2017. \u201cOur finances were such that we couldn\u2019t live what was thought to be our dream life,\u201d Jim Dolan, who previously worked for NASA, tells CNN Travel. Virtual romance He hadn\u2019t ever really envisioned being based in Thailand permanently. In fact, Jim Dolan \u2013 originally from Worcester, Massachusetts \u2013 hadn\u2019t even visited the country before meeting his future wife, from Bangkok, online in 2006. \u201cWe got to know each other, virtually at first,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we visited together a number of times before we decided that we were soulmates.\u201d The pair later got engaged, and Som Dolan moved to the US on a fianc\u00e9e visa. \u201cI was not ready to leave the United States at that point,\u201d Jim Dolan explains. \u201cI had a good job and a good career. So I wanted to bring her there. \u201c The couple tied the knot that same year and quickly began building a life in the US together. \u201cThe first couple of years were kind of challenging to me, because of the language,\u201d admits Som Dolan, who speaks both Thai and English, but had only used English for work purposes previously. \u201cIt was very hard for me to understand because the people speak very fast.\u201d It took several years for Som Dolan, who previously worked in IT, to find her feet career-wise, and she briefly worked as a waitress in a Thai restaurant, and as her husband\u2019s assistant. \u201cI had a good job (in Thailand,)\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I moved here, it was hard for me to find a job where I could use my experience.\u201d The Dolans spent 10 years living in the US together and had been looking forward to \u201ca dual Thailand and US kind of lifestyle\u201d in the future. However, that all changed after a series of financial setbacks. Jim Dolan explains that he lost \u201ca lot of money in the stock market in the financial crash in 2009.\u201d Although he says he was able to recover much of this in the following years, the damage inflicted on their home after Hurricane Harvey devastated the Texas Gulf Coast resulted in another financial blow. Financial woes \u201cWe had to rebuild our house in Houston while still living in it,\u201d he says. \u201cThink of trying to change a tire on a race car while the car is going round the track. It was a challenge.\u201d The couple didn\u2019t have flood insurance, something Jim Dolan describes as a \u201cregrettable decision.\u201d Needless to say, the repair work cost them a considerable amount of money, and the Dolans realized that they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to live as comfortably as they\u2019d hoped if they remained in the US. The pair, who sold their home in Houston and moved to Washington, DC in 2019, soon began looking into the prospect of relocating to Thailand permanently. \u201cIt was not a hard choice to make,\u201d says Jim Dolan. \u201cI had traveled to Thailand a number of times, I really liked being here. \u201cI like the food. I like the culture. I love the climate. It\u2019s a beautiful country. And obviously, Som is a native here. So she\u2019s very comfortable here. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so much more affordable than the United States. It was ultimately a pretty easy decision.\u201d When the global Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, the Dolans decided to bring forward their plan to build a house in Thailand. \u201cIt was right around the time that I was just approaching retirement age,\u201d explains Jim Dolan. \u201cAnd so we just decided to make the move at that time. We had enough money to build a house, and we were ready to do it.\u201d The couple then bought some land \u201csight unseen\u201d in Sam Roi Yot, located in the province of Prachuap Khiri Khan, for around $50,000. Big move Jim Dolan explains that they deliberately chose the area in the Gulf of Thailand as its position meant that they were less likely to be badly impacted by a natural disaster again. \u201cThere\u2019s no risk of earthquakes or tsunamis on this side of the peninsula,\u201d he says, explaining that while they hadn\u2019t been to Sam Roi Yot before, the couple were familiar with the area, which is about 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of the capital, Bangkok. \u201cSo we don\u2019t have to worry about that. We don\u2019t have fires. We don\u2019t have hurricanes.\u201d Jim Dolan was able to obtain a Thailand Marriage Visa, which currently requires applicants to have at least 400,000THB (around $11,000) in a Thai bank account or a monthly income of no less than 40,000THB (about $1,100). Once they had their affairs in order, the Dolans packed up their lives in the US, shipping some of their belongings over in a container, while taking a \u201cfew necessary things to make our lives a little more comfortable.\u201d In October 2020, they left the US for Thailand \u2013 the couple were given special visas due to the travel restrictions in place at the time. After undergoing a mandatory quarantine period, the Dolans briefly stayed with one of Som Dolan\u2019s relatives in Bangkok, before renting a home to live in while their house was being built. According to Jim Dolan, one of the biggest challenges of the relocation was the process of transporting their beloved pugs Morgan and Gwennie. \u201cThe dogs are difficult to move because they have a very short snout, and that makes their breathing suspect to respiratory problems and some carriers won\u2019t deliver them,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo it took a lot for us to get the two dogs here.\u201d The couple says they found the process of building their three-bedroom home, which they designed themselves, particularly tough, stressing that achieving the result that they desired meant a lot of back and forth with builders and contractors. \u201cIn the last four months of the building period, we had to come to visit the site every single day, to make sure that all the details would be the way that we wanted,\u201d says Som Dolan. The entire process took about a year and a half and cost around $300,000 \u201cincluding fence, fill and landscaping.\u201d \u201cIt turned out to be just what we wanted, and what we had hoped for,\u201d says Jim Dolan. \u201cIt was hard getting here. But the end result is what we wanted, and we\u2019re happy with it.\u201d He goes on to state that Thailand has proven to be more affordable for them, stressing that he and his wife feel \u201cfinancially comfortable\u201d now. \u201cI joined a golf club for about $1,100 to play as many rounds as I want to for a year,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could do that in the United States.\u201d He also feels that their overall quality of life has improved immensely as a result of being based in Thailand. \u201cIt\u2019s very natural,\u201d says Jim Dolan. \u201cWe eat locally grown vegetables that are plentiful and really cheap. The food is great.\u201d When it comes to healthcare, he\u2019s opted to pay for private medical insurance in Thailand, and finds that it provides \u201cbetter benefits than my Medicare would in the United States and for much, much cheaper.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of things that the average person might expect to be able to do in their retirement that are available here,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a different culture. But it\u2019s not a different planet\u2026 You adapt. You learn and you experience. It\u2019s good.\u201d More than four years since their big move, the couple is now very settled in Sam Roi Yot, known for the Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, and love living there. Happy retirement \u201cIt\u2019s very quiet. Very peaceful. Very safe,\u201d says Jim Dolan. \u201cI feel safer here in Thailand than I think in any of the cities that I lived in the United States. \u201cI lived in Denver, Houston and Austin. And all of them have much, much higher rates of crime.\u201d While he and his wife are grateful to be able to live a very comfortable lifestyle in Thailand, Jim Dolan acknowledges that many Thai people \u201clive on a very, very, very small budget\u201d and \u201cservices and taxes are much lower\u201d as a result. He explains that pumps need to be incorporated into the build for certain new homes, as water pressure is \u201cminimal\u201d in the country, and the roads are \u201ca little bit rougher.\u201d \u201cThere are many of those little kinds of issues\u2026\u201d he says. \u201cThe infrastructure, I think, in the United States is more sophisticated, and perhaps more reliable. \u201cBut you pay for it. Your taxes are high. We don\u2019t pay any property taxes here. Our tax burden is virtually zero. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could have built a brand new, three-bedroom, 3,000-square-foot house, within a mile of the ocean in the United States, on what we did here.\u201d Although he speaks other languages, including Spanish, Jim Dolan has struggled to learn Thai, pointing out that it\u2019s challenging \u201cfor the Western ear because it\u2019s a tonal language.\u201d \u201cThai language is a very, very difficult language to learn,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I must admit, I haven\u2019t really tried very hard because I have a built-in translator in my family.\u201d And while Som Dolan is thrilled to be living in her native country once again, she says that going from speaking English constantly for a decade to using both Thai and English regularly has been confusing. \u201cI still have to speak English all the time. All day, every day,\u201d she says, pointing out that the majority of her husband\u2019s friends aren\u2019t Thai nationals, and she often finds herself acting as an interpreter. Although Jim Dolan admits that things haven\u2019t always been \u201csmooth sailing,\u201d he\u2019s confident that relocating to Thailand was the right choice for him and his wife. \u201cI think she had a bigger challenge moving to the United States than I had coming here,\u201d he says. He\u2019d advise anyone thinking of making a similar move to visit the country they\u2019re hoping to relocate to first, and avoid the temptation to \u201cup and buy a property on some remote place, halfway around the world, sight unseen.\u201d \u201cWe had traveled to Thailand a number of times and knew the area, knew what we were getting into,\u201d he adds. The Dolans haven\u2019t been back to the US since moving to Thailand, but eventually plan to return for regular trips. Jim Dolan is going to visit his family soon, but his wife has decided to stay behind to look after their dog Gwennie, who is nearly 15 years old\u00a0\u2013 Morgan passed away in 2022. \u201cNo one else would take care of her the way Som takes care of her,\u201d he says. \u201cSo as long as Gwennie is still with us. I\u2019ll be traveling back to the United States solo.\u201d Although he has no regrets about their move, Jim Dolan admits that there are some things that he misses about living in the US. \u201cI miss northeast seafood,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I miss my siblings. They\u2019ve lived on the East Coast for much of my life. \u201cAll of my family members were just a drive away (before) and now it\u2019s a big trip to visit. So that\u2019s a bit of a sacrifice. \u201cBut overall, I think we\u2019re much better off here than we would have been in the United States had we stayed there.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/travel/us-couple-moved-to-thailand-built-home/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_16_europe_orban-trump-eu-ukraine-letter-intl", "text": "Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor\u00a0Orban\u00a0has told European leaders that Donald Trump is \u201cready to act as a peace broker\u201d between Russia and Ukraine if elected president, amid concerns across the continent that Trump would attempt to force Kyiv into ceding territory to Moscow. Orban\u2019s letter, addressed to European Council President Charles Michel and sent to all European Union leaders, was written in the wake of\u00a0his controversial meetings with former President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. \u201cI can [\u2026] surely state that shortly after his election victory, he will not wait until his inauguration, [Trump] will be ready to act as a peace broker immediately. He has detailed and well-founded plans for this,\u201d\u00a0Orban wrote. The authoritarian Hungarian premier has sought to cast himself as a peacemaker in the conflict, but his stance is at odds with most EU leaders, who have pledged unequivocal support for Ukraine as it attempts to repel Russia\u2019s military effort. In his letter to those leaders,\u00a0Orban\u00a0said that during the meetings there was a \u201cgeneral observation\u201d that \u201cthe intensity of the military conflict\u201d in Ukraine \u201cwill radically escalate in the near future.\u201d Orban\u00a0also hinted at Trump\u2019s plans to potentially pare back aid to Ukraine if elected, saying: \u201cI am more than convinced that in the likely outcome of the victory of President Trump, the proportion of the financial burden between the US and the EU will significantly change to the EU\u2019s disadvantage when it comes to the financial support of Ukraine.\u201d Trump, who has a propensity to make sweeping pronouncements on foreign policy, said during a CNN town hall last year that, \u201cIf I\u2019m president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.\u201d In last month\u2019s CNN debate with President Joe Biden, Trump said that Putin\u2019s terms for an agreement \u2013 which would include Ukraine ceding the four territories currently occupied by Russia \u2013 are \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d But the former president, who is set to formally accept the Republican nomination at the party\u2019s national convention later this week, has also criticized US military aid to Kyiv. Orban \u2013 a rare, longtime ally of Trump in the EU \u2013 has undertaken what he has previously called his \u201cpeace missions,\u201d\u00a0meeting Putin\u00a0in Moscow on July 5 and\u00a0Xi in Beijing\u00a0on July 8. Last Thursday he met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. He also visited\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv at the start of July, marking his first visit to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began. Orban called on EU leaders to try to find a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to usher in a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in EU policy in his letter, urging them to \u201cmake an effort to decrease tensions and/or create the conditions for a temporary ceasefire and/or start peace negotiations\u201d in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Hungary took over the rotating EU presidency last month, unveiling a slogan \u2013 \u201cMake Europe Great Again\u201d \u2013 that mimicked Trump\u2019s 2016 election motto. But his visits with Putin, Xi and Trump have gone down poorly with EU lawmakers, who have accused\u00a0Orban\u00a0of vitally \u201cmisrepresenting\u201d and \u201cundermining\u201d the EU\u2019s stance on foreign policy.  In a letter to Orban Tuesday, European Council President Charles Michel hit back against many of the points made by the Hungarian prime minister. \u201cThe most direct way to peace is for Russia to withdraw all of its forces from Ukraine and respect Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and the UN Charter,\u201d Michel wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. Michel wrote that \u201cno discussion about Ukraine can take place without Ukraine\u201d and rejected Orban\u2019s claim that the EU has led a \u201cpro-war policy,\u201d saying that \u201cit is quite the opposite.\u201d \u201cRussia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the victim exercising its legitimate right to self-defense. Russia is leading a war of aggression in blatant violation of international law, Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty in accordance with the UN Charter,\u201d Michel wrote. Michel noted \u201cthe EU\u2019s position on Ukraine is agreed by consensus by the European Council, and was confirmed most recently in June.\u201d The European Council president also told Orban that Hungary, which holds the rotating presidency of the council until the end of the year, \u201chas no role in representing the (European Union) on the international stage and received no European Council mandate to engage on behalf of the union.\u201d \u201cI made this clear even prior to your visit to Moscow and this was subsequently reiterated by High Representative Borrell in his statement of July 5,\u201d Michel wrote. Michel said in his letter that he would share it with the other members of the European Council, and would \u201calso inform Ukraine of this exchange.\u201d A separate\u00a0letter signed by 63 European lawmakers, addressed to the three EU chiefs, said\u00a0Orban\u00a0had \u201ccaused significant damage\u201d through his meetings. \u201cIn his so-called peace mission, Prime Minister\u00a0Orban\u00a0deliberately left the impression that he was acting on behalf of the entire European Union, whereas in reality he has no authority to represent the EU or any other member state other than his own,\u201d the Members of European Parliament said. The lawmakers called the meetings particularly damaging considering that Hungary currently holds the presidency of the European Council, saying\u00a0Orban\u00a0was guilty of \u201cabusing\u201d the position that he assumed at the beginning of July. EU lawmakers finished their letter by calling on the bloc\u2019s three leaders, Michel, Ursula von der Leyen and Roberta Metsola, to suspend Hungary\u2019s voting rights in the European Council, arguing that past examples had shown that \u201cmere verbal condemnation\u201d of Hungary has \u201cno effect.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/16/europe/orban-trump-eu-ukraine-letter-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_style_leather-clothes-summer-trend-lotw", "text": "As the sun baked down on New York City on Tuesday, warming the concrete jungle to temperatures upwards of 80 degrees, actor and \u201cLonglegs\u201d star Maika Monroe stepped out in a surprising textile: Patent sheep leather. Similarly, last week, Monroe arrived at the LA premiere of the 1990s-inspired serial killer thriller dressed in a Courr\u00e8ges leather sarong and matching bra. Both outfits seemed like a bold choice for what is shaping up to be a sweltering summer across many parts of the Northern Hemisphere. But Monroe isn\u2019t alone in choosing this unseasonal material. Despite it being July, Mia Goth \u2014 another veritable scream queen \u2014 opted for a leather corseted midi dress from Versace for her appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live earlier this month. And at the premiere of \u201cMaXXXine\u201d in LA, Goth wore an edgy Ludovic de saint Sernin halter-neck dress \u2014 the main event being her peek-a-boo leather bralet. You don\u2019t have to be a horror film starlet to pull off a summer leather look, either. On July 11, Kate Hudson was snapped in Manhattan\u2019s Soho in a sultry pair of lace-up leather pants; while across the pond, British radio and TV presenter Vick Hope arrived at Wimbledon in a full burgundy leather vest, shorts and a collarless leather overcoat (granted, London\u2019s weather has been a little more accommodating to leather this summer). Rita Ora \u2014 who has, it seems, committed to exclusively wearing scarlet in promotion of her new film \u201cDescents: The Rise of Red\u201d \u2014 wore not one, but two entirely leather outfits around New York. At what point did we start to see the off-season potential of leather? Once a firm staple of winter wardrobes, the material is seemingly summer\u2019s hottest trend. It began with Bottega Veneta, the Italian fashion house largely credited with pushing the boundary of the textile \u2014 symbolically and literally. In September 2022, creative director Matthieu Blazy sent a stream of leather optical illusions down the Fall-Winter runway.\u00a0Since then, we\u2019ve had blue jeans, plaid shirts and woven beach bags rendered in meticulous detail, redefining what leather could be. Or could it be a case of a trickle-down effect from our reigning pop stars? Dua Lipa opened her Glastonbury Festival headliner set in a custom Chrome Hearts leather mini-dress; while Rosal\u00eda \u2014 also known to her fleet of fans as Motomami \u2014 wore a pair of high-shine leather pants for her Coachella set in Palm Springs. Charli XCX, creator of the unequivocal album of the summer, \u201cBrat,\u201d has spoken openly about her love for scuffed-up YSL leather coats, and is often spotted off-duty donning a variety of biker jackets. Wherever the trend has come from, one thing is for certain: A leather jacket is no longer just for Christmas, but all year round.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/style/leather-clothes-summer-trend-lotw/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_americas_venezuela-presidential-election-explainer-intl-latam", "text": "Millions of Venezuelans are expected to cast their ballots on Sunday, July 28, in what many see as the most consequential election in the country since strongman leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro came to power more than a decade ago. The vote pits the authoritarian Maduro \u2013 who has overseen unprecedented levels of poverty and emigration from the country \u2013\u00a0against Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia \u2013 a quiet, bird-loving grandfather who has built a strong following despite being the opposition\u2019s third choice after its two preferred candidates were barred from running. But experts warn that the result of the vote may well be contested. Maduro has a habit for clinging to power, they point out: his government has long been accused of rigging votes and the 2018 election that returned Maduro to office was described as illegitimate by an alliance of 14 Latin American nations, Canada and the United States. The populist and the former diplomat Maduro, who took the mantle of the populist Chavismo movement after his predecessor Hugo Chavez\u2019s death in 2013, is seeking his third consecutive six-year term in office.\u00a0His last race was largely boycotted by the opposition. The Organization of American States called that vote a \u201cfarce,\u201d noting that it was \u201cheld with a generalized lack of public freedoms, with outlawed candidates and parties and with electoral authorities lacking any credibility, subject to the executive power.\u201d At campaign events this year \u2013\u00a0usually\u00a0rollicking, dance-filled affairs\u00a0\u2013 Maduro has framed his opponents as \u201cfascist\u201d and \u201cmanipulable,\u201d claiming that they would privatize the country\u2019s healthcare and oil industry and \u201cgive away our wealth.\u201d Though under his watch,\u00a0Venezuela\u00a0has seen the rapid collapse of its democracy and nearly eight million of its people flee the country.\u00a0Inflation has soared and food shortages spread as the country\u00a0underwent \u201cthe single largest economic collapse for a non-conflict country in almost half a century,\u201d\u00a0as the International Monetary Fund put it. Gonzalez, a former diplomat, is standing for an opposition coalition known as the Democratic Unitary Platform. His priorities include taming inflation, currently running at 64% year on year, and restoring trust in the country\u2019s institutions of power, like its judiciary, which is currently stacked with Maduro sympathizers. However, he has not given a roadmap on how he would convince an authoritarian government to voluntarily give up control and lead a democratic transition. In recent weeks, his rallies, alongside\u00a0Maria Corina Machado, the charismatic leader of the opposition coalition who was banned from running for president earlier this year (along with her fellow leader Corina Yoris), have drawn staggering crowd sizes, including parts of the population long devoted to Chavismo.\u00a0The pair have promised to build a country that can welcome home the millions of Venezuelans who have left in droves in recent years out of economic desperation. Several other candidates are also running, but they have minimal support and are viewed by the main opposition as government allies. According to Oswaldo Ram\u00edrez, the managing director of ORC Consultores, the opposition has found support in \u201cnearly every corner of the country.\u201d \u201cThe electoral energy is back in the streets of Venezuela,\u201d he said. \u201cNever in the years since this political era began has the opposition had a voting intention that favored it in such a broad way.\u201d Will the election be fair? Twenty-five years after Ch\u00e1vez brought his socialist vision to the halls of power in Caracas, the election marks a rare opportunity for Venezuelans to remake the country \u2013 if Maduro is willing to relinquish control in a defeat. But analysts point to Maduro\u2019s history of alleged election meddling in suggesting he is unlikely to go down quietly. \u201cThis could be the last best shot for Venezuela for a long time to restore democracy,\u201d said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe level of fraud that (the Maduro government) is going to necessitate is going to be so obvious to all that there\u2019s no way they can move forward credibly with the election. They\u2019re going to be caught with their hand in the cookie jar.\u201d The ruling party has already been interfering with the election for months. In January, Machado was\u00a0barred from holding public office\u00a0for 15 years by the Maduro-controlled Supreme Court.\u00a0The US said the decision\u00a0flew in the face of a\u00a02023\u00a0pledge the Venezuelan government had made\u00a0to hold free and fair elections.\u00a0Gonzalez was made the candidate after Machado\u2019s\u00a0designated replacement Yoris was similarly blocked from running. Maduro\u2019s government has meanwhile claimed to have thwarted a string of dubious opposition-backed plots to\u00a0sabotage public infrastructure\u00a0and interfere with the election.\u00a0Analysts see those as the seeds of a pretext that Maduro could use to postpone or cancel the election at the last minute. Experts\u00a0warn Maduro could\u00a0also\u00a0move to provoke a military crisis with neighboring Guyana after he and his supporters scaled up their threats to annex an oil-rich piece of that country\u2019s land. Some have speculated that Maduro could use the crisis as an excuse to suspend the election. Maduro\u2019s government has also been accused of trying to sow confusion ahead of election day, including by\u00a0renaming some 6,000 schools, places that typically serve as polling stations. The government has also created significant impediments for the Venezuelans who left the country to vote, including widely unattainable passport and residency requirements, election experts said. How will the vote play out? There are more than 21 million registered voters in Venezuela, including about 17 million people currently living in the country. A limited group of election observers,\u00a0including a team from The Carter Center \u2013 a non-profit organization set up by former US President Jimmy Carter \u2013 will be on the ground to monitor the vote after Venezuelan authorities revoked an invitation in May for the European Union to send a delegation, citing the bloc\u2019s sanctions on the country. But the options for the opposition and the international community are limited if Maduro refuses to cede power, Berg, of CSIS, said.\u00a0\u201cThe opposition can get out in the streets, they can mobilize, they can demand certain things, but if the regime gets in and they have the firepower behind them to repress as we\u2019ve seen in other instances under Maduro, it could get very ugly,\u201d he said. If the opposition does clinch victory, a transition period of six months is likely to include an intense negotiation around amnesty for Maduro and members of his government, which analysts say he is certain to require ahead of any potential handover. Maduro currently faces\u00a0drug trafficking and corruption charges\u00a0in the US and is under investigation for\u00a0crimes against humanity\u00a0by the International Criminal Court. Machado has indicated in recent months\u00a0that the opposition has expressed willingness to the Venezuelan government to establish a \u201cserious negotiation with guarantees\u201d for Maduro and his allies \u2013\u00a0should Maduro and his ruling Socialist United Party of Venezuela step aside in the face of defeat. \u201cWe know the responsibility we have with history, and if there are feelings that animate this process, it is about reunification, coexistence, and justice, never about revenge and persecution,\u201d Machado said earlier this month.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/americas/venezuela-presidential-election-explainer-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_africa_uganda-anti-corruption-protest-intl", "text": "Uganda\u2019s hardline President Yoweri Museveni has warned citizens planning anti-corruption protests Tuesday that they are \u201cplaying with fire.\u201d The upcoming protests come after a wave of deadly anti-government demonstrations that rattled neighboring country Kenya where at least 50 people were killed in clashes with security forces, according to figures released by the National Commission on Human Rights. Museveni, 79, who has ruled the East African nation with an iron fist for nearly four decades, said in a televised address on Saturday that the anti-corruption march will not be allowed. \u201cWhat right\u2026 do you have to seek to generate chaotic behavior? \u2026 We are busy producing \u2026 cheap food, other people in other parts of the world are starving\u2026 you here want to disturb us. You are playing with fire because we cannot allow you to disturb us\u2026\u201d, Museveni said in the three-hour-long wide-ranging address. Many young Ugandans say on social media they plan to go ahead with the march to the country\u2019s parliament despite the country\u2019s police refusing to grant a permit for the protest. The Uganda Police Force described the planned protests as \u201cpotentially anarchic\u201d in a statement on Monday, warning it \u201cshall not tolerate disorderly conduct.\u201d Some defiant youth protesters who plan to join the march on Tuesday have begun sharing their photos on social media, urging fellow citizens to remember them if they don\u2019t make it home alive. \u201cJust in case I get abducted or I die in the march, you can use this (photo) for creating awareness. Otherwise, tell mum I played a fundamental role in saving my country! I know she will be happy!\u201d, said one activist Ashiraf Hector on X. Another wrote: \u201cTomorrow, very early in the morning, I will join my fellow young people as we march to parliament against escalating corruption in Uganda. We will come face to face with murderers and in case things go south for me, this is my official portrait.\u201d A group of lawyers and activists said in a letter on Sunday that the police could not, by law, stop peaceful protests. \u201cThe police cannot prohibit a demonstration from proceeding but have powers to regulate it to ensure it takes place within confines of the law,\u201d the letter said while urging President Museveni to \u201censure that the constitutional right to assemble, demonstrate peacefully \u2026 is not violated with impunity by security agencies.\u201d Crackdown ahead of protests Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine\u00a0said on Monday he supported the protest which he clarified was \u201corganized by the young people of Uganda\u201d and not his NUP party. Wine raised the alarm that his party\u2019s secretariat had been cordoned off by security forces and some party leaders had been \u201cviolently arrested\u201d ahead of the Tuesday march. \u201cThe effort by the regime to clamp down and make it (the planned protest) look like\u00a0an NUP\u00a0initiative is meant to weaken it because they want to make it appear like a partisan matter,\u201d he said in a statement on X. Uganda grapples with widespread government corruption with an estimated Sh. 10 trillion\u00a0($2.7 billion) in public\u00a0funding\u00a0diverted\u00a0each year, according to its anti-graft body, the Inspectorate of Government (IGG). Last year, it scored 26 on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index which ranks countries on a scale of zero to 100, with zero meaning \u201chighly corrupt\u201d and 100 signifying that a country is \u201cvery clean.\u201d \u201cThe thieves are parasites that must be stamped out,\u201d Museveni said about his administration\u2019s fight against graft last month, adding that his ruling NRM party \u201cdoes not victimize anybody without proof (of corruption).\u201d \u201cThat is why some people think that the NRM is soft on corruption,\u201d he said, stating that some corruption cases against public officials were being decided in court. However, those agitating for a protest are unimpressed with the government\u2019s handling of corruption, urging Ugandans to \u201c#March2Parliament\u201d on July 23 to \u201c#StopCorruption.\u201d\u2019. Some have also called for the\u00a0speaker of\u00a0the\u00a0parliament, Anita Annet Among, to resign.

{"id": "2024_07_22_europe_paul-watson-whaling-activist-arrested-greenland-japan-intl-hnk", "text": "Veteran environmentalist Paul Watson was arrested in Greenland on Sunday and faces possible extradition to Japan allegedly over anti-whaling activities in the Antarctic years ago, his organization said in a statement. The 73-year-old Canadian-American dual national was detained by police when his ship docked in the Greenland capital Nuuk to refuel, according to the Captain Paul Watson Foundation (CPWF) and Greenland police. The ship John Paul DeJoria and a 25-member crew were en route from Dublin, Ireland to the North Pacific to intercept Japan\u2019s newly launched $48 million factory whaling ship the Kangei Maru, CPWF said. \u201cWe were immediately boarded by a SWAT team and \u2026 police who wasted no time in cuffing Paul Watson, our founder, and arresting him on a decades old Red Notice at the request of Japan,\u201d Ship Operations Director\u00a0Locky MacLean said in a video message onboard the John Paul DeJoria. Police can be seen boarding the vessel and leading Watson away in handcuffs in the video. In a statement, Greenland police said they arrested Watson upon his arrival in Nuuk due to a Japanese arrest warrant. He will be brought before a district court with a request to detain him while a decision is made on his possible extradition to Japan, police added. His foundation believes the arrest \u201cis connected to a previous Red Notice issued for Watson\u2019s anti-whaling activities in the Antarctic.\u201d \u201cThis development comes as a surprise since the Foundation\u2019s lawyers had reported that the Red Notice had been withdrawn. However, it appears that Japan had made the notice confidential to facilitate Paul\u2019s travel for the purpose of making an arrest,\u201d the statement continued. CPWF said it \u201cbelieves the reactivation of the Red Notice against Captain Watson is politically motivated, coinciding with the launch of the new factory ship.\u201d The Japan Coast Guard (JCG) told CNN it was aware that Greenland police have issued a statement about Watson and said, \u201cWe will continue to respond appropriately in coordination and cooperation with related organizations.\u201d Interpol issued a Red Notice for Watson in September 2012, two years after the JCG issued an arrest warrant for him.\u00a0CNN has contacted Interpol for more information. An early member of Greenpeace, Watson went on to found the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an environmental group famous for\u00a0tracking,\u00a0exposing\u00a0and\u00a0occasionally ramming\u00a0Japanese whalers. His attempts to disrupt Japanese whalers at sea gained him fame through Animal Planet\u2019s \u201cWhale Wars\u201d TV show. His activities have also previously landed him in legal trouble. In 2012, he was detained in Germany on an international arrest warrant issued by Costa Rica, which accused him of endangering a fishing vessel off the coast of Guatemala in 2002. He skipped bail but denied wrongdoing in that case. In 2013, the Japan\u2019s Institute of Cetacean Research and the Japanese firm Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha secured a US District Court injunction against Watson and Sea Shepherd, which prohibited him and his group from coming within 500 yards of the plaintiffs on the open sea. Due to the injunction, Watson resigned as president and executive director of the conservation society in the United States and as president of the society in Australia. In June, Kyodo Senpaku launched a brand-new whaling \u201cmothership\u201d \u2013 the Kangei Maru \u2013 a 370-foot, 9,300-ton vessel equipped with state-of-the-art drones able to travel a reported 100 kilometers (62 miles) to allow crews to quickly locate and kill whales. The new ship replaces the\u00a0Nisshin Maru, the infamous whaling factory vessel dubbed by activists as a \u201cfloating slaughterhouse\u201d that was decommissioned in 2020 after more than 30 years of service, during which it frequently\u00a0clashed\u00a0with anti-whaling activists. Watson told CNN ahead of the launch that he believes the ship\u2019s high-powered features \u2013 including a cruising range of 13,000 kilometers (more than 8,000 miles) and its ability to sail for up to 60 days \u2013 suggests that Japan could set its sights on whales far beyond its northern waters. \u201cJapan has never given up on its whaling ambitions,\u201d Watson told CNN at the time. \u201cThe only purpose of a vessel like that is so it can travel long distances \u2026 to hunt whales.\u201d Japan is one of three countries, along with\u00a0Norway\u00a0and Iceland, that continues to hunt whales, and officials argue that the industry is an important part of its culture and history \u2013 and also provides food security. The Kangei Maru boasts a slipway large enough to haul 85-foot whales from the sea that leads to an indoor flensing deck the size of two basketball courts. There, workers will strip away the blubber before cutting up the whale flesh on enormous cutting boards, before vacuum-packing and storing the meat in 40 industrial freezers, ready for sale. Takaaki Sakamoto, director of the Whaling Affairs Office in Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency, told CNN that Japan sent ships to the Antarctic last year to collect numbers and skin surface samples, but those expeditions did not involve killing whales. He said they planned to return this year to do the same. Hideki Tokoro, president of Kyodo Senpaku,\u00a0told CNN the Kangei Maru is not planning on killing whales beyond Japanese waters because it doesn\u2019t make economic sense. Commercial whaling was banned under a 1986 International Whaling Commission moratorium. But Japan has used a loophole to continue hunting whales legally for what it claims is scientific research. In 2018, it announced its withdrawal from the IWC and resumed commercial whaling months later in defiance of international criticism. \u201cWe are proud of catching whales and are very proud of this ship which will allow us to begin offshore mothership-style whaling this year,\u201d Tokoro told reporters in June.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/europe/paul-watson-whaling-activist-arrested-greenland-japan-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_22_world_world-reaction-biden-exit-2024-us-presidential-race", "text": "Messages of gratitude and support for US President Joe Biden poured in following his stunning announcement Sunday that he is exiting the 2024 presidential race and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the next Democratic nominee. It was the second seismic moment in US politics in just over a week, following the assassination attempt against former president Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally on July 13, which saw global leaders rally around him as the Republican nominee. Pressure had mounted on Biden to pull out of the race since his disastrous performance at the CNN presidential debate last month, and on Sunday, he confirmed he would remain a one-term president, prompting a flood of tributes from US allies who thanked him for his leadership. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who met with Biden this month in Washington, said he respects the president\u2019s decision and looks forward to working together for the remainder of his term. \u201cI know that, as he has done throughout his remarkable career, he will have made his decision based on what he believes is best for the American people,\u201d Starmer wrote on X. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thanked Biden for being a \u201ctrue friend\u201d to his country. \u201cHe\u2019s a great man, and everything he does is guided by his love for his country,\u201d he said on X. In a news conference, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Biden deserves to be recognized for \u201conce again not putting himself forward first, but giving his first consideration to being what he believes is in the interests of the United States of America, as he has done his whole public life.\u201d \u201cPresident Biden has dedicated his life to public service, and that is something that deserves much respect,\u201d New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on X. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked Biden for his \u201cunwavering support\u201d in his country\u2019s war against Russia, which the US has backed with weapons, military aid and diplomatic support, despite backlash from Republicans. \u201cMany strong decisions have been made in recent years and they will be remembered as bold steps taken by President Biden in response to challenging times,\u201d Zelensky said on X. \u201cWe will always be thankful for President Biden\u2019s leadership.\u201d Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was \u201cnot too surprised\u201d by Biden\u2019s withdrawal. \u201cIn recent years, what has been happening in the United States has taught us not to be surprised by anything,\u201d Peskov told reporters Monday. \u201cThis topic should concern American voters, but not us,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwhat is very important for us is the future of Russian-American relations, which are now experiencing the worst period in history.\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that, whoever wins the US presidential election, Israel will remain \u201can irreplaceable ally\u201d for Washington in the Middle East. Speaking on Monday from the tarmac of Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion Airport ahead of boarding a flight to the US, Netanyahu said his trip was an opportunity to thank Biden \u201cfor the things he did for the state of Israel, both in the war and during his years of service as a senator, as vice president and as president.\u201d President Isaac Herzog described Biden as a \u201ctrue ally of the Jewish people,\u201d while Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the US president\u2019s \u201csteadfast backing, especially during the war, has been invaluable,\u201d both in posts to X. Biden has been one of the biggest supporters of Israel\u2019s war in Gaza since Hamas\u2019 October 7 attacks. But he has increasingly clashed with Netanyahu over humanitarian aid and the mounting civilian death toll of the conflict. Irish\u00a0Taoiseach\u00a0Simon Harris called Biden \u201ca proud American with an Irish soul,\u201d and thanked him for his \u201cglobal leadership\u201d and \u201cfriendship.\u201d Outgoing Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Monday that Biden was a \u201cgood leader\u201d who\u2019d had \u201cvery good results\u201d with the pandemic and the \u201ceconomic crisis\u201d caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. Other leaders commended Biden for making what must have been a tough decision to drop out of the race. French President Emmanuel Macron in a letter to Biden praised the American leader\u2019s decision to end his reelection bid , saying that it showed \u201ccourage\u201d and \u201csense of duty,\u201d the Elysee Palace press office said on Monday. \u201cI appreciate the courage, the spirit of responsibility and the sense of duty that led you to this decision,\u201d Macron wrote. \u201cMy friend Joe Biden has achieved a lot: for his country, for Europe, for the world,\u201d German chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote on X. \u201cHis decision not to run again deserves respect.\u201d Speaking at a rally Sunday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said Biden made the \u201ccorrect\u201d decision and put his family and health first. He wished him \u201chealth and a long life.\u201d Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X that Biden had made difficult decisions \u201cthanks to which Poland, America and the world are safer, and democracy stronger.\u201d \u201cI know you were driven by the same motivations when announcing your final decision. Probably the most difficult one,\u201d Tusk said. Leaders in South Korea and Japan said they would not comment about domestic politics in the US but emphasized the need to continue to work with the White House. Both nations have a mutual defense treaty with the United States and Biden was a major promoter of deepening ties between allies in Asia, in part to counter the growing assertiveness of China. \u201cI recognize that President Biden\u2019s decision is based on his desire to make the best possible political decision,\u201d said Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. \u201cThe Japan-US alliance is the cornerstone of our nation\u2019s diplomatic security, and we will continue to monitor it closely.\u201d The office of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said it will \u201ccontinue to work closely with the US to further develop the South Korea-US global comprehensive strategic alliance.\u201d Philippine President Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos JR said Biden\u2019s \u201cdecision to withdraw from his candidacy is a demonstration of genuine statesmanship.\u201d \u201cWe thank him for his constant and unwavering support for the Philippines in a delicate and difficult time,\u201d he wrote on X. The Philippines, which is also a treaty ally of the US, has found itself increasingly confronting Chinese vessels in the South China Sea in recent years. There was no official word from Chinese leader Xi Jinping as of Monday morning local time. But \u201cBiden dropping out of the election\u201d was the top trending topic early Monday on Weibo, China\u2019s X-like social platform, with five more related topics including discussions of Kamala Harris and Trump\u2019s assassination attempt together accumulating more than 400 million views. Some Chinese social media users excitedly speculated about the prospect of a woman becoming US president, while others said they believe Trump will win no matter the Democratic candidate. \u201cThe shot was definitely a good deal for Trump!\u201d one Weibo user wrote. One user remarked, \u201cthat one shot didn\u2019t kill Trump but dropped Biden,\u201d while another described the political situation in the US as \u201ca total mess.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/world/world-reaction-biden-exit-2024-us-presidential-race/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_europe_europe-conscription-war-russia-intl", "text": "Before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many, including Kyiv, were skeptical that a major war could\u202freturn to Europe. More than two years on, another shift once unthinkable is underway on conscription. Several European nations have reintroduced or expanded compulsory military service amid Moscow\u2019s mounting threat, part of a range of policies aimed at boosting defenses that are likely to be scaled up even further. \u201cWe are coming to the realization that we may have to adjust the way we mobilize for war and adjust the way we produce military equipment and we recruit and train personnel,\u201d said Robert Hamilton, head of Eurasia research at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, who served as a US Army officer for 30 years. \u201cIt is tragically true that here we are, in\u202f2024, and we are grappling with the questions of how to mobilize millions of people to be thrown into a meatgrinder of a war potentially, but this is where Russia has put us,\u201d he said. The risks for a larger war in Europe have been rising after Russian President Vladimir Putin\u202f\u201cfinally resorted to open conflict\u201d in Ukraine, pursuing his aim to \u201crecreate the Soviet empire,\u201d\u202fsaid Gen. Wesley Clark (Ret.), who served as NATO\u2019s Supreme Allied Commander Europe. \u201cSo we\u2019ve now got a war in Europe that we never thought we would see again,\u201d said Clark, who led NATO forces during the Kosovo War. \u201cWhether this is a new Cold War or an emerging hot war is unclear,\u201d he continued, but \u201cit\u2019s a very imminent warning to NATO that we\u2019ve got to rebuild our defenses.\u201d Those efforts include conscription, he says. Return of conscription underscores new reality A number of European countries halted mandatory conscription after the end of the Cold War, but several nations \u2013 particularly in Scandinavia and the Baltics \u2013 have reintroduced it in recent years, largely because of the Russian threat. Failure to enlist can result in fines or even jail time in some countries. Latvia is the latest to implement conscription. Compulsory military service \u202fwas reintroduced on January 1 this year, after being abolished in 2006. Male citizens will be put up for the draft within 12 months of reaching the age of 18, or graduation for those still in the education system. \u201cAt first there was a lot of pushback,\u201d said Arturs P\u012bl\u0101cis, a 20-year-old student. He\u2019s yet to go up for the draft but voluntarily went on a month-long military course. But ultimately, \u201cthe need for a state defence service was clear,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t really an option where we can stand by and think things will go on as they were before because of the unprovoked aggression in Ukraine.\u201d In April, Norway presented an ambitious long-term plan that will nearly double the country\u2019s defense budget and add more than 20,000 conscripted soldiers, employees, and reservists to the armed forces. \u201cWe need a defense that is fit for purpose in the emerging security environment,\u201d Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said. Conscription in Norway is mandatory and in 2015 it became the first member of the NATO defensive alliance to conscript both men and women on equal terms. Economics student Jens Bartnes, 26,\u202fcompleted his military training at the age of 19. \u201cI am happy I did it, I learned a lot from that year that I wouldn\u2019t learn otherwise \u2013 about myself, about my physical and mental limits and abilities I suppose, but also about teamwork. It\u2019s a whole different way of life,\u201d he said. \u201cI am willing to fight for my country if need be, because I believe in the values that the Norwegian society is built on and I believe those values of inclusion and equality and democracy are worth fighting for,\u201d Bartnes added. Max Henrik Arvidson,\u202f25, was conscripted into the Norwegian military for one year between 2019 and 2020. Like Bartnes, he sees military service as an essential duty. \u201cI know the only way we can stand against more Russian aggression is by keep supplying Ukraine with weapons and aid, while standing strong together with NATO as a whole and the European Union.\u201d \u2018Big mental shift\u2019 Debates about conscription have also been taking place in other European countries that currently don\u2019t require it. In the UK, the Conservatives floated the idea of military service in their ill-fated election campaign. But perhaps the most surprising transformation is underway in Germany, which since the end of World War II has had an aversion to militarization. In another first since the Cold War, Germany this year updated its plan should conflict erupt in Europe, and Defense Minister Boris Pistorius presented a proposal in June for a new voluntary military service. \u201cWe must be ready for war by 2029,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeing the debate now raging. And that\u2019s the first step,\u201d said Sean Monaghan, a visiting fellow in the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen overnight, it\u2019s a big mental shift.\u201d Not everyone is ready to answer the call. In Lithuania, for instance, opinions about military service among students vary, said Paulius Vaitiekus, president of Lithuania\u2019s National Students\u2019 Union. Since the country reintroduced compulsory military service in 2015 due to a \u201cchanged geopolitical situation,\u201d about 3,500 to 4,000 Lithuanians between the ages of 18 and 26 are enlisted each year for a period of nine months. Vaitiekus\u202fsaid students have launched initiatives to send supplies to the Ukrainian frontlines. There was \u201ca shift in the mindset of the youth towards being more active, although not necessarily through conscripting,\u201d he added. With conscription remaining an unpopular topic in some countries, NATO is struggling to meet its new goal of having 300,000 personnel ready to be activated within one month and another half a million available within six months, Monaghan said. \u201cWhile NATO has stated it has already met that goal, the EU has said its members would struggle. NATO relies on American forces to meet its target. European allies need to find new ways to generate personnel. Something has to give here,\u201d he said. Another problem is that that target would only allow NATO to fight a relatively short conflict of up to six months, Monaghan added. Large strategic reserve force models A possible solution is a more nimble, modern military. One of NATO\u2019s newest members, Finland,\u202fhas the capacity to activate more than 900,000 reservists, with 280,000 military personnel being ready to respond immediately if needed. However, during peacetime, the Finnish Defence Forces employs only about 13,000 people, including civilian staff. \u201cFinland is a good example\u201d as its reserve force can be integrated into a very small active force, said Hamilton, of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Historically, he explained, Finland was \u201cwedged\u201d between NATO and the Soviet Union, aligned with neither, so needed to be able to defend itself alone. Norway and Sweden, NATO\u2019s newest member, have similar models, both maintaining significant numbers of reservists, though not as many as Finland. Sweden, where conscription is now also gender-neutral, called up around 7,000 individuals in 2024. The number will rise to 8,000 in 2025, according to the Swedish Armed Forces. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, \u201cwhat we see is that both knowledge and the attitude have changed,\u201d she said. \u201cSweden has had conscription since 1901 so it\u2019s really part of our culture in a way,\u201d said Marinette Nyh Radebo, communications manager at the agency that helps test recruits and reports to the Ministry of Defense. \u201cWhen the conscription was activated again, in the beginning, we said that conscription is good for your CV, for applying for a new job for example,\u201d Radebo said. \u201cBut today our communication is more like, this is a duty that you have to do for Sweden.\u201d Is NATO ready for war? The NATO alliance has been revising its strategy and boosting capabilities over the past decade in response to the growing threat from Moscow. Russia\u2019s full-scale assault on Ukraine in 2022, which followed its support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine and illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, inevitably prompted allies to reassess whether they were ready for war and strengthen their defenses. \u201cSince 2014, NATO has undergone the most significant transformation in our collective defense in a generation,\u201d NATO spokesperson Farah Dakhlallah told CNN. \u201cWe have put in place the most comprehensive defense plans since the Cold War, with currently more than 500,000 troops at high readiness.\u201d But there are calls for allies to increase their capabilities further and faster. While NATO allies \u201care definitely ready to fight tonight,\u201d there is still a question of whether they are ready for a protracted war such as that in Ukraine, Monaghan said, pointing out there is still work to be done in a number of areas. Those include industrial capacity, defense spending and societal resilience \u2013 where the question of conscription would come in. The way military personnel are recruited and trained is a decision for individual nations, Dakhlallah said, adding: \u201cAround a third of NATO members have some form of compulsory military service.\u201d \u201cSome allies are weighing up conscription. However as an alliance we do not prescribe mandatory military service,\u201d Dakhlallah said. \u201cThe important thing is that allies continue to have capable armed forces to protect our territory and our populations.\u201d In addition to the fighting in Ukraine, Russia has also launched a hybrid war across Europe, experts say, involving attacks on infrastructure, cyberattacks, disinformation, sabotage, election interference and the weaponization of migration. \u201cThat has only become more aggressive,\u201d Monaghan said. \u201cAll of which is to say NATO allies face a very different geopolitical situation than they did over the last couple of decades.\u201d The situation could be further complicated by the US presidential election in November. Things will look very different if former President Donald Trump \u2013 who has said he would encourage Russia to do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to any NATO country that doesn\u2019t meet the bloc\u2019s defense spending guidelines \u2013 returns to the White House. \u201cI think there is a very good understanding among the military leaders of NATO that they must cooperate, and there is a desire to do that,\u201d Clark said. This year saw World War II veterans gather for D-Day commemorations, some possibly for the last time. Their descendants may now have to take on the kind of responsibility that it was hoped would not be needed again. \u201cI think young people in Europe and the US will come to realize that this generation, like the generation that fought WWII, it didn\u2019t ask to be the \u2018Greatest Generation,\u2019 but the circumstances thrust that burden on them,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIn democracies, we don\u2019t like to prepare for war, we don\u2019t want to think about these things,\u201d\u202fhe said. However, \u201cI think people will respond to the circumstances that they see.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/21/europe/europe-conscription-war-russia-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_21_middleeast_israel-strikes-houthi-rebels-explainer-intl", "text": "For the first time, Israel has struck inside Yemen, following a deadly drone attack launched by Houthi rebels on Tel Aviv. Since the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel, the Houthis have been targeting shipping in the Red Sea in solidarity - they say - with Gaza. After Israel struck back on Saturday, the Houthis said they launched a fresh barrage of missiles towards Israel, promising a response that will be \u201chuge and great.\u201d Direct attacks on each other\u2019s soil between the Israeli military and the Iran-backed rebel group now risk creating a new front in a conflict that already threatened to spill over into the region, with Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam on Sunday describing the situation as \u201copen war.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know. Who are the Houthis and what is their role in the Gaza conflict? The Houthis are an Iran-backed Islamist group based in Yemen. The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah (Supporters of God), is one side in a civil war that has raged in Yemen for nearly a decade. It emerged in the 1990s, when its leader, Hussein al-Houthi, launched \u201cBelieving Youth,\u201d a religious revival movement for a centuries-old subsect of Shia Islam called Zaidism. Since a ceasefire, the Houthis have consolidated their control over most of northern Yemen. They have also sought an agreement\u00a0with Saudi Arabia,\u00a0a major rival of Iran, that would bring the war to a permanent end and cement their role as the country\u2019s rulers. The Houthis are believed to have been armed and trained by Iran. Since Hamas\u2019s attacks on October 7 attacks and Israel\u2019s subsequent ground and air offenses in Gaza, the Houthis say they have been seeking revenge against Israel for its military campaign by targeting Red Sea shipping. The US and UK have responded to those attacks by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses. In addition, Israel\u2019s army spokesman says the militant group has targeted \u201cIsraeli civilians and civilian infrastructure\u201d about 200 times in the same period. Most of those launches were intercepted by US Central Command, the spokesman said, but Israel\u2019s air defenses have also intercepted Houthi drones and missiles inside and outside Israel\u2019s airspace. What happened in Tel Aviv? A tipping point for Israel appears to have come on Friday, when a drone attack was launched on Tel Aviv, killing one\u00a0Israeli citizen and injuring several others. The attack was claimed by the Houthis, with spokesperson Yahya Sare\u2019e saying the\u00a0operation was performed by a new drone capable of \u201cbypassing the enemy\u2019s interception systems.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to strike these targets in response to the enemy\u2019s massacres and daily crimes against our brothers in the Gaza Strip,\u201d Sare\u2019e said. \u201cOur operations will only cease when the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.\u201d The attack marked the first time Tel Aviv, Israel\u2019s commercial center, has been struck by a drone in an attack claimed by the Houthis. Israel authorities are investigating the circumstances and potential security failures around the deadly drone blast. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said that the military suspects the drone was an Iranian-made Samad-3 model, launched from Yemen, which had been upgraded to extend its range. A second drone was intercepted outside of Israeli airspace to the east at the same time as the attack, he said, adding that Israel is now upgrading its air defenses and increasing aerial patrols of its borders. How did Israel respond? Israel\u2019s response came a day later, when Israeli aircraft hit the Yemeni port of Hodeidah. The attack, which marked the first time Israel has struck Yemen, killed at least six people and injured scores more, Yemeni officials said. The Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said the strikes targeted oil facilities in the port on Yemen\u2019s west coast. Houthi\u00a0spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was \u201cbrutal Israeli aggression\u201d aimed at increasing the \u201csuffering of the people of Yemen\u201d and pressuring the group to stop its support of Gaza. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the port was used by Iran to bring arms into Yemen. \u201cThe port we attacked\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0an innocent port. It was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis\u00a0by Iran,\u201d he said in a statement on Saturday. Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from\u00a0Israel\u2019s borders, showed\u00a0Israel\u00a0was\u00a0serious about responding to threats. \u201cIt makes it clear to our enemies that there\u00a0is\u00a0no place that the long arm of the State of\u00a0Israel will\u00a0not\u00a0reach,\u201d Netanyahu said. How big an escalation is this? Neither side have suggested they are ready to back down. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the Houthi \u2018DNA\u2019 to de-escalate with Israel,\u201d Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute wrote on X. Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree said the\u00a0Houthis\u00a0have\u00a0\u201cprepared\u00a0for a long war\u201d with Israel and that Tel Aviv is still not safe. Israel\u2019s Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, warned that the \u201cblood of Israeli citizens has a price,\u201d and that if Israelis are attacked,\u00a0the\u00a0\u201cresult will be identical\u201d to that which has been seen in Lebanon and Gaza. On Sunday, Israeli military said it had intercepted a missile approaching Israeli territory from Yemen while the Houthis said they launched a \u201cnumber of ballistic missiles.\u201d The war in Gaza has already been accompanied by significantly heightened tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The two sides have been trading cross-border fire since October 8, when Hezbollah fired at three Israeli border posts \u201cin solidarity\u201d with Palestinians. Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi said on Sunday in a televised address on Houthi-run Al-Masirah TV that the group intended to continue \u201cthe fifth stage of escalation in support of Gaza.\u201d Friday\u2019s drone attack on Tel Aviv signaled the beginning of that stage, he also said. But while rising tensions with the Houthis undoubtedly creates fresh challenges for Israel, Hezbollah remains the bigger threat given its extensive arsenal and proximity to Israel. Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) who has served on Israel\u2019s National Security Council, told CNN he believes Israel has until now been restrained in its response. He believes Israel was trying to send a signal to the US and the international community that \u201cenough is enough,\u201d and deliberately chose a target with high visibility. \u201cYou have to signal to a rogue actor that is attacking you that there is a price to pay, and I think this is what Israel tried to do.\u201d Like the Houthis, Hezbollah is also heavily backed by Iran, which makes no secret of its animosity towards Israel. Any increase in hostilities between Israel and Iran\u2019s proxies is seen as deeply destabilizing in the region because it could push the two countries closer towards open warfare.

{"id": "2024_07_20_middleeast_yemen-israel-strikes-hodeidah-intl", "text": "At least six people were killed and scores more injured in Israeli airstrikes on a Yemeni port, Houthi rebels have said, a day after the Iran-backed group claimed a deadly attack on the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its fighter jets struck \u201cmilitary targets of the Houthi terrorist regime\u201d in the area of Yemen\u2019s Hodeidah Port on Saturday, in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was a direct response to the death of a 50-year-old Israeli in a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv on Friday. This is the first time Israel has struck Yemen, according to Israeli officials. The Houthis said at least six people were killed, three are missing while a further 83 people were injured in the strikes, which hit oil facilities. Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the strikes had also hit civilian targets and a power station. He slammed what he said was \u201cbrutal Israeli aggression\u201d aimed at increasing the \u201csuffering of the people of Yemen\u201d and pressuring the group to stop its support of Gaza. Houthi army spokesperson Yehya Saree vowed to respond to the strike, saying the Houthis would not hesitate to strike Israel\u2019s \u201cvital targets\u201d and warning that Tel Aviv \u2013 a major city home to scores of diplomatic missions \u2013 was still not safe. \u201cWe have prepared for a long war with this enemy until the aggression stops and the blockade on the Palestinian people is lifted,\u201d Saree said. On Sunday Israel said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. \u201cThe projectile did not cross into Israeli territory. Rocket and missile sirens were sounded following the possibility of falling shrapnel. The incident has concluded,\u201d the IDF said. \u2018Not an innocent port\u2019 Netanyahu said in a statement on Saturday that Hodeidah was \u201cnot an innocent port.\u201d \u201cIt was used for military purposes, it was used as an entry point for deadly weapons supplied to the Houthis by Iran,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding that Hodeidah had also been used to attack international shipping in the Red Sea. Netanyahu also said the operation, which hit targets 1,800 km (1,118 miles) from Israel\u2019s borders, shows the enemy Israel is serious about responding to threats. \u201cIt makes it clear to our enemies that there is no place that the long arm of the state of Israel will not reach,\u201d Netanyahu said. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a UN statement he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by reports of the strikes. \u201cThe response to the Israeli aggression against our country is inevitably coming and will be huge and great,\u201d Houthi rebels warned in a statement following the attack, adding that they will continue their operations against Israeli, American, and British ships until Israel stops its \u201csiege\u201d on Gaza. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said the strikes were also in response to the roughly 200 missiles and drones the rebel group has launched towards Israel since October, when Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza began. Since the start of the war, the Yemeni rebels have regularly targeted the country with drones and missiles, most of which have been intercepted by Israel\u2019s defenses or those of its allies. However, the Houthis have claimed their drone attack in Tel Aviv Friday \u2013 which also injured 10 people \u2013 was performed by a new drone capable of \u201cbypassing the enemy\u2019s interception systems.\u201d The Houthis have also regularly attacked US targets and commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Both the UK and the US have responded to the attacks on shipping by carrying out strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. However, Israel has not taken part in those responses. An Israeli defense official told CNN that this was a 100% Israeli strike. The official said Israel had previously let the US and UK take the lead on responding to Houthi attacks but decided to respond itself this time because of the death of the Israeli citizen in Tel Aviv. According to the official, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant informed US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin before the strike was carried out. The defense official added that Israel was able to strike so quickly because it had been preparing for this scenario for months. A White House official said US President Joe Biden had been briefed on \u201cdevelopments\u201d in the Middle East. A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said the US had not coordinated with Israel on the airstrikes, but added that the US fully recognizes \u201cIsrael\u2019s right to self-defense.\u201d Who are the Houthis? The Houthi movement, also known as Ansar Allah \u2013 Arabic for \u2018Supporters of God\u2019 \u2013\u00a0is a Shi\u2019ite Islamist political and military organization backed by Iran, that emerged in the 1990s. Similar to chants used by Lebanon-based Iranian proxy Hezbollah, the Houthis\u2019 official slogan reads, \u201cGod is the Greatest. Death to America. Death to Israel. Curse the Jews. Victory to Islam.\u201d In 2014, Houthi forces allied with former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh took control of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sanaa, from the UN-recognized Yemeni government, sparking a civil war that has afflicted the country ever since. Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have led a coalition in Yemen against Houthi forces. More recently, the group has come to be seen in parts of the largely Sunni Muslim world and beyond as champions of the Palestinian cause, defending the people of Gaza against Israel. Since October 7, Houthi rebels have carried out numerous missile and drone attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, asserting that these vessels are linked to Israel and its allies, which has escalated tensions throughout the Middle East. Regional tensions rise In recent weeks Hezbollah has been ramping up cross-border attacks with Israel after months of low-intensity fighting, prompting the Israeli military to warn that it is prepared to launch a large-scale attack on its northern border. Following the Hodeidah strike, Israel\u2019s Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir congratulated Netanyahu on the operation and said Israel should \u201cadopt the same policy against Hezbollah in Lebanon.\u201d Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defense Minister Gallant echoed Ben Gvir\u2019s sentiment. Smotrich said Israel must continue to attack \u201cwith all its might even in distant places,\u201d while Gallant said \u201cthe blood of Israeli citizens has a price,\u201d and that anywhere Israelis are attacked the \u201cresult will be identical.\u201d \u201cThe fire that is currently burning in Hodeidah, is seen across the Middle East and the significance is clear,\u201d Gallant said. Hezbollah in Lebanon condemned the attack on Yemen and said \u201cwe stand firmly with the Yemeni people in defending themselves, their sovereignty, and their heroic and historic stance alongside Palestine.\u201d Hamas also condemned the attack, calling it a \u201cdangerous escalation.\u201d Meanwhile, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz called on the international community to \u201cmaximize sanctions on Iran.\u201d \u201cIran supports, trains, and finances the Houthi terror organization as part of its regional network of terror organizations aimed at attacking Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cIran is the head of the snake \u2013 it must be stopped now,\u201d Katz added. Iran condemned the Israeli strike on Hodeidah. Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani warned of the risk of war in the region, saying Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza were the \u201croot\u201d of the escalating tensions. \u201cThe oppressed but powerful people of Yemen are paying the price for their honorable support of the innocent citizens, women and children of Gaza,\u201d Kanaani said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/middleeast/yemen-israel-strikes-hodeidah-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "style_almudena-romero-photos-onto-plants-spc", "text": "Spanish artist Almudena Romero knew from a young age that she loved plants: \u201cI must have been about four or five - my granny would call and say, \u2018what do you want for your birthday?\u2019 And I\u2019d be like, an olive\u00a0tree.\u201d Now, with her inclusion in exhibitions in London (at the Saatchi Gallery) and Paris (Albert Khan Museum), she\u2019s showcasing her unique plant-based art that\u2019s pushing audiences to question their hyper-consumerism whilst showing that it\u2019s possible to create art in an eco-friendly manner. In her four-chapter series called \u201cThe Pigment Change,\u201d rather than developing photos on photographic paper, she prints them directly onto plants. \u201cI just put a negative on top of the leaf and leave it to the sunlight, and then the image gets recorded on the leaf,\u201d Romero said. \u201cBut I also print on living plants using a digital projector, and the plant makes photosynthesis with the light from the projector and records an image.\u201d In a chapter from that series, called \u201cFamily Album,\u201d she spreads watercress seeds on a stretched canvas, and lets them grow in the dark, before projecting a negative onto the watercress. \u201cThe parts that receive more light produce chlorophyll, hence the dark green tones, and the parts that receive less light remain yellow, pale,\u201d she said. \u201c[It\u2019s] exactly like in a photographic darkroom. But instead of having an enlarger, I have a projector, and my watercress canvas is my photo paper. That\u2019s how I grow photographs.\u201d The chlorophyll process adopted by Almudena\u00a0was popularized in the 90\u2019s by Heather Ackroyd and Dan Harvey, who projected photographs onto grass using\u00a0a negative and light cast by a projector bulb. Allegedly, the British artists came up with the technique when they noticed random outlines of a ladder cast onto one of their grass installations. Despite being an innovative process, it wasn\u2019t simple. It required a lot of space and preparation. Later, Artist Binh Danh enhanced this method by using photosensitive materials from plants, securing a positive straight into a leaf and\u00a0enabling sunlight to bleach the photo onto its surface. Learning from Plants Romero, who was raised in Madrid, used to spend holidays on her grandparents\u2019 avocado farm in Valencia, in eastern Spain. Breathing fresh air, picking fruit, and learning from her grandmother about plants during her formative years instilled in her the eco-conscious values she embraces today. \u201cWhen you grow close to nature, it becomes a really important thing in your life,\u201d she said. \u201cPlants for me are important, partly because of the legacy of my family and because as a photographic material, it\u2019s impressive in quality.\u201d But she concedes that her eco-friendly techniques wouldn\u2019t work for all artists. \u201cIt is a niche because it produces ephemeral pieces, so it\u2019s a lot more difficult to be financially sustainable when your art is ephemeral, but I guess it\u2019s also depending on how you understand life and what you want to do with your practice,\u201d she explained.\u00a0 The 38-year-old is not alone in her love for plants. According to a survey published by consumer analytics platform CivicScience, more than 200 million Americans were houseplant owners in 2020. In the past few years, Millennials have embraced the \u201cplant-parent\u201d craze, sharing photos and care tips on social media. But for Romero, plants are much more than something to look after: they\u2019re beings we can learn from. \u201cPlants have been [around] for way longer than us on the planet and they have succeeded in doing that without causing any extinction,\u201d she said. Romero points to plants in deserts and arid environments that have evolved strategies that limit reproduction, saying they allow her to better argue that it\u2019s not an \u201cunnatural behavior\u201d to choose to be child-free. \u201cI am a person who doesn\u2019t want to have children because of climate change,\u201d she explained. \u201cI simply don\u2019t feel comfortable.\u201d In her series \u201cThe Pigment Change\u201d she questions whether maternity or parenthood is something \u201cbeyond one\u2019s control\u201d or a \u201cquestion of will,\u201d reflecting on plants\u2019 selective reproduction strategies and opening a broader reflection on procreation. In 2020, she won the BMW Residency Award for the project and her work was exhibited at the renowned photography festival Rencontres d\u2019Arles, in France. It\u2019s not only about what we can learn from plants, though. For the Spaniard, we should also consider non-anthropocentric ethics (a philosophical perspective which challenges the idea that humans are the most important beings, emphasizing the value of all living organisms and ecosystems), seeing other species as having their own agendas and intentionality. The artist explained that she sees photoperiodism (the way plants respond and adapt to light changes throughout the seasons) as a performance by plants. \u201cWhy do we tend to think that we only have these capacities as humans?\u201d said Romero. \u201cThe problem is the perspective that we have that we think that we are very different until science proves the opposite.\u201d Studies have shown that plants can be more complex than we may think. According to an article published in The Plant Journal, plants like Arabidopsis feel stressed when touched, which stunts their growth, while in 2019, another research group found that beach evening-primrose respond to the sound of pollinators. Now,\u00a0Romero is\u00a0working on her next project, which is due to be completed by June 2025. Commissioned by France\u2019s National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment, the size of the work is planned to be bigger than a stadium. \u201cI\u2019m working in farming what will be the largest photographic artwork ever produced. We are going to farm an image of 30,000 square meters,\u201d she said. Romero is collaborating with scientist Nicolas Langlade, with the help of AI, to use genetically different wheats and grasses to achieve a color palette sufficiently rich to produce a distinguishable image. The artwork reflects on the human relationship with land and plants, our impact on the environment and our interdependency with nature. For Romero, this art-science project is like coming full circle. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of my family\u2019s background because we are going to farm it,\u201d she said. \u201cI love my passion for plant photography, so I\u2019m really happy about it.\u201d \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d is showing at the Saatchi Gallery, London, until the 28 July. \u201cNatures Vivantes\u201d is showing at the Albert Khan Museum, Paris, until the 31 December.", "source": "http://cnn.com/style/almudena-romero-photos-onto-plants-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_20_europe_cyprus-50-years-division-intl", "text": "Air raid sirens wailed across Cyprus\u2019s divided capital Nicosia at dawn on Saturday as Greek Cypriots mourned, and Turkish Cypriots celebrated, 50 years since Turkey invaded part of the island in response to a brief Greek-inspired coup. The ethnically split island is a persistent source of tension between Greece and Turkey, which are both partners in NATO but are at odds over numerous issues. Their differences were laid bare on Saturday, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan attending a celebratory military parade in north Nicosia to mark the day in 1974 when Turkish forces launched an offensive that they call a \u201cpeace operation.\u201d Later in the day, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis was due to attend an event in the south of the city to commemorate what Greeks commonly refer to as the \u201cbarbaric Turkish invasion.\u201d Mitsotakis posted an image of a blood-stained map of Cyprus on his LinkedIn page with the words \u201cHalf a century since the national tragedy of Cyprus.\u201d There was jubilation in the north. \u201cThe Cyprus Peace Operation saved Turkish Cypriots from cruelty and brought them to freedom,\u201d Erdogan said, criticizing the south for having a \u201cspoiled mentality\u201d and seeing itself as the sole ruler of Cyprus. But Erdogan left open a window to dialogue in deadlocked negotiations. \u201cWe are ready for negotiations, to meet, and to establish long-term peace and resolution in Cyprus,\u201d he said. Peace talks are now stalled at two seemingly irreconcilable concepts - Greek Cypriots want reunification as a federation. Turkish Cypriots want a two-state settlement. Cyprus gained independence from Britain in 1960, but a shared administration between Greek and Turkish Cypriots quickly fell apart in violence that saw Turkish Cypriots withdraw into enclaves and led to the dispatch of a UN peacekeeping force. The crisis left Greek Cypriots running the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus, a member of the European Union since 2004 with the potential to derail Turkey\u2019s own decades-long aspirations of joining the bloc. Remembering the dead Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides, whose office represents the Greek Cypriot community in the reunification dialogue, said the anniversary was a somber occasion for reflection and for remembering the dead. \u201cOur mission is liberation, reunification and solving the Cyprus problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we really want to send a message on this tragic anniversary \u2026 it is to do anything possible to reunite Cyprus.\u201d Turkey, he said, continued to be responsible for violating human rights and international law over Cyprus. Across the south, church services were held to remember the more than 3,000 people who died in the Turkish invasion. \u201cIt was a betrayal of Cyprus and so many kids were lost. It wasn\u2019t just my son, it was many,\u201d said Loukas Alexandrou, 90, as he tended the grave of his son at a military cemetery. In Turkey, state television focused on violence against Turkish Cypriots prior to the invasion, particularly on bloodshed in 1963-64 and in 1967. Turkey\u2019s invasion took more than a third of the island and expelled more than 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south. Reunification talks collapsed in 2017 and have been at a stalemate since. Northern Cyprus is a breakaway state recognized only by Turkey, and its Turkish Cypriot leadership wants international recognition.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/20/europe/cyprus-50-years-division-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_15_style_ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian", "text": "India\u2019s most anticipated wedding of the year came to an end on Sunday after a star-studded three-day celebration that even saw the country\u2019s prime minister arrive to bless the young couple. Billionaire heir Anant Ambani married his longtime girlfriend Radhika Merchant in Mumbai in a lavish ceremony attended by Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, two former British prime ministers, Indian sporting legends and some of Bollywood\u2019s most famous faces. The wedding was followed by a blessing ceremony on Saturday, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi bestowed the young couple and their families with well wishes. The weekend\u2019s festivities concluded Sunday with an extravagant reception, or \u201cMangal Utsav\u201d (festival of bliss), as attendees jetted out of Mumbai. No expense was spared by the family that owns India\u2019s largest private corporation, Reliance Industries. Founded by Anant\u2019s grandfather, the conglomerate is now run by his father Mukesh, who is worth over $122 billion, according to Forbes. The Ambani-owned 16,000-capacity Jio World Convention Centre, which hosted wedding events throughout the weekend, was transformed into a miniature version of the holy Indian city of Varanasi, featuring floral installations and extravagant sets embellished with gold and silver. The couple underwent multiple outfit changes across the three-day bash, appearing in a succession of intricate, custom-made pieces celebrating the country\u2019s heritage and culture. Merchant\u2019s bridal ensemble was designed by Indian label Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and featured ivory zardozi (an elaborate type of metal embroidery) on silk and a 5-meter (16.4-foot) veil. She completed the look with jewels that aunts and sister wore to their own weddings. She later changed into an opulent red and gold outfit for her \u201cvidai,\u201d the ceremony in which Indian brides symbolically bid farewell to their relatives before joining their groom\u2019s family. Ambani meanwhile arrived on the red carpet in a golden sherwani paired with sneakers. For the marriage ceremony, he wore a custom red sherwani by Sabyasachi Mukherjee, with a large green necklace draped around his neck. For Saturday\u2019s blessings ceremony, Merchant once again donned a custom piece by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla, who collaborated with contemporary artist and sculptor Jayasri Burman to create a one-of-a-kind piece embroidered with real gold. The garment celebrates the couple\u2019s union \u201cthrough deeply meaningful imagery,\u201d Merchant\u2019s stylist Rhea Kapoor wrote on Instagram. \u201cThe human figures representing the happy couple radiate a celestial aura that honors the divinity in their humanity. The fauna depicts Anant\u2019s fondness for animals, particularly elephants that are considered auspicious and beautiful.\u201d For the reception Sunday, guests interpreted the \u201cIndian chic\u201d dress code by mixing classic Indian fashion with contemporary styles. Merchant wore a gold metallic corset from Dolce and Gabbana\u2019s Alta Moda couture line, along with a skirt and dupatta in the same shade by Indian designer Anamika Khanna. Months of planning It is not known precisely how much the Ambanis spent on the celebrations, which included months of pre-wedding parties, though industry estimates have placed the total firmly in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Insiders worked for months to bring the couple\u2019s vision to life, collaborating with the family to bring the intricate details \u2014 from the floral arrangements to the set designs \u2014 together. Renowned wedding designer Preston Bailey, who has worked with Serena Williams and LeBron James, was commissioned to create larger-than-life floral art installations for the weekend. Speaking to CNN via email ahead of Friday\u2019s ceremony, Bailey commended Ambani\u2019s mother Nita\u2019s attention to detail. It was \u201cnothing short of pure genius and she is really focused on bringing the vast creative talent of India to the world through these weddings,\u201d he said. The inspiration for Bailey\u2019s designs came from the couple\u2019s love for animals and Ambani\u2019s recently opened animal sanctuary, Vantara, in the western Indian city of Jamnagar. His sculptural creations included a giant display of hot air balloons and more than 60 floral animals, including giraffes, two huge toucans, monkeys perched on trees inside the venue and a giant horse made from red and pink flowers. \u201cI have been in business for over 40 years \u2026 (but) I have never seen anything as intricate as this wedding and I believe it will bring such positive feedback and awareness to the great creative culture of artists of India,\u201d said Bailey, who also worked on the weddings of Ambani\u2019s two older siblings, Akash and Isha. Top Indian couturier and the wedding\u2019s creative director, Manish Malhotra, earlier told CNN that \u201cmaintaining the essence of India\u201d had been his \u201cguiding principle.\u201d \u201cEach detail, from the decor and cuisine to the attire and ambiance; each event, from the vibrant Sangeet (a traditional evening of music and dance that saw a performance from Justin Bieber) to the ceremonial wedding day and the grand reception, is designed to immerse guests in an atmosphere of joy, love and celebration,\u201d he said via email. Criticism and sustainability Details of the celebrations dominated local news headlines and set social media abuzz, but many within India \u2014 the world\u2019s most populous nation, with 1.4 billion people \u2014 criticized the opulence on show in a country with a glaring wealth gap and where millions live in poverty. \u201cShame on people celebrating income inequality in a country where we need wealth redistribution,\u201d tweeted comedian and social media critic, Shamita Yadav, who posts on social media as The Ranting Gola. \u201cWe are really a poor country,\u201d Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, Sushant Singh, told Indian news outlet The Wire. \u201cThis is something which is completely unacceptable. But the fact of the matter is half of India\u2019s big media is owned by Mr. Ambani, so it is unlikely that India\u2019s big media is going to say that this is horrible.\u201d Beyond the financial cost of the wedding and festivities is another, less visible cost: the one to the planet. An average Indian wedding of 300 people typically generates between 1.5 tons and 2 tons of waste, and around 30 to 40 tons of carbon emission \u2014 before taking guest travel into consideration \u2014 according to Ashwin Malwade, co-founder of Greenmyna, a Mumbai-based sustainable wedding consultancy. Sources of emissions include large-scale banquets and energy used by extravagant light displays. An event as huge in scale as the Ambani-Merchant celebration would emit far more carbon than even the largest and most lavish Indian wedding, he added. Then there\u2019s the travel, with several high-profile attendees pictured leaving Mumbai via Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport\u2019s private jet terminal. Malwade also pointed to the environmental footprint of the Ambanis\u2019 pre-wedding bash in Jamnagar, attended by public figures from around the world, including Mark Zuckerberg, Ivanka Trump, Bill Gates and Karlie Kloss; the four-day cruise arranged for guests in the Mediterranean; and the emissions required to fly in singers like Rihanna and Justin Bieber to perform at various events.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/15/style/ambani-wedding-mumbai-modi-kardashian/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}

The McLaren driver qualified second and snatched the lead at the start of the Hungarian Grand Prix from teammate Lando Norris and looked set to take claim victory after driving a commanding race. However, Norris came in for his second pit stop earlier than Piastri, \u2018undercutting\u2019 his teammate and eventually emerging ahead after the Aussie had pitted three laps later. McLaren\u2019s plan appeared to be to allow Piastri to pass Norris and retake the lead that he had earned once he caught up him using his fresher tires, but he was unable to close the gap. Norris meanwhile resisted calls from his race engineer to slow down and let Piastri past, knowing that he had the pace advantage in the latter stages of the race. It seemed as though McLaren was headed towards an embarrassing intra-team conflict that likely would have been avoided by simply pitting Piastri first, but Norris eventually eased up to let Piastri through on lap 68 of 70 to give McLaren its first one-two finish since 2021. Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton crossed the line in third to claim a record-extending 200th career podium. Though the celebrations felt somewhat subdued, it was still a career milestone for Piastri. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very special,\u201d said the 23-year-old. \u201cThis is really the day I dreamed of as a kid, standing on the top step of an F1 podium. \u201cObviously, a bit complicated at the end, but I put myself in the right position at the start, and thank you to the team for an amazing effort and amazing car.\u201d Piastri won a sprint race in Qatar last season, though Sunday marked his first official Grand Prix victory, becoming the fifth Australian to achieve the feat. He is also the first driver born in the 2000s to win a race. He admitted that the last few laps made him \u201cnervous\u201d and lamented his lack of pace in the latter stages of the race, but said that he \u201cwas still in the right position to make it happen, so well-executed from the team.\u201d It was a frustrating day for Norris, who saw the lead slip away at the start of the race after qualifying on pole position, before being forced to hand P1 over to his teammate. His race engineer, Will Joseph, pleaded with him over team radio for multiple laps, urging him to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d before Norris eventually gave in. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, but I know what Oscar\u2019s done for me in the past,\u201d said the Briton. \u201cI think this is a little bit different but, yeah, at the same time, I got told to let him past and I did. It\u2019s always tough when you\u2019re fighting for a win, and a win means so much to me and also to him. \u201cYeah, I just had to try put myself in his shoes and understand it that way. Every driver\u2019s selfish and you have to be selfish in this game, but when you\u2019re just thinking of your own benefits, you\u2019re only thinking of the good things. But, of course, I put myself in his shoes and I realized I had to do what was right.\u201d Norris \u2013 who also congratulated Piastri on his win \u2013 won his first Grand Prix in Miami earlier this year and closed the gap on championship leader Max Verstappen, who was involved in one of the race\u2019s most dramatic moments. Chasing Hamilton for third, he made contact with his long-time rival after locking up and going too deep into turn one, briefly vaulting the rear of his car into the air. This came after several heated radio exchanges of his own, with the Dutchman expressing his frustration at his lack of pace and what he believed was a poor strategy from his Red Bull team. He eventually finished fifth behind Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc. Verstappen said after the race that he had no intention of apologizing to his team for his rant and that the group should focus on improving. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to apologize,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need to do a better job. I don\u2019t know why people think that you cannot be vocal on the radio. This is a sport, you know? If some people don\u2019t like that, then stay home.\u201d F1 next heads to Spa this weekend for the Belgian Grand Prix.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/22/sport/oscar-piastri-hungary-grand-prix-f1-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/23/2024", "section": "world"}}
