Pope Francis has recognized a second miracle attributed to Acutis, a gamer and computer programmer who died from leukemia in 2006 at age 15. During his life, Acutis used his technological skills to spread awareness of the Catholic faith, including setting up a website documenting miracles. Born in London 1991, he later moved to Milan, Italy with his family. Although Acutis\u2019 parents were not religious, the young boy\u2019s faith was nurtured by his Polish nanny. After his death, his body was moved to the Italian town of Assisi, where it is now displayed in a shrine, alongside other relics linked to him. Prospective candidates for sainthood normally need to have two miracles attributed to them before they can be canonized. The latest miracle attributed to Acutis relates to the reported healing of a girl from Costa Rica who had suffered a head trauma after falling from her bicycle in Florence, Italy, where she was studying. Her mother said she prayed for her daughter\u2019s recovery at the tomb of Acutis in Assisi. Acutis was beatified and declared \u201cblessed\u201d after his first miracle in 2020, when he reportedly healed a Brazilian boy who had a birth defect in his pancreas that left him unable to eat food normally. Following the attribution of two miracles, the next step is for the Pope to convene a meeting of cardinals to agree on Acutis\u2019 sainthood and decide on a date for the canonization. His story is seen as helpful for the Catholic Church as it seeks to connect better with younger generations in a digital age. Acutis \u2013 considered a millennial as he was born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s \u2013 is remembered by friends and family as enjoying playing video games such as Halo, Super Mario and Pok\u00e9mon.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/europe/carlo-acutis-first-catholic-millennial-saint-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_middleeast_aid-gaza-down-two-thirds-israel-intl", "text": "The amount of humanitarian aid entering Gaza has dropped by 67% since Israel launched a military offensive in the southern city of Rafah earlier this month, the United Nations has warned. \u201cThe amount of food and other aid entering Gaza, already insufficient to meet the soaring needs, has further shrunk since May 7,\u201d the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said Wednesday. A daily average of 58 aid trucks reached Gaza between May 7 and Tuesday, down from an average of 176 aid trucks between April 1 and May 6, OCHA said, a drop of 67%. About 500 trucks per day crossed into Gaza before hostilities between Israel and Hamas began in October, according to figures from the UN, which has long urged that deliveries return to this level. The drop in aid deliveries came after Israel began its assault on Rafah in its attempt to destroy Hamas, which was believed to have regrouped in the south of Gaza after Israel\u2019s destruction of much of the north. Since Israel seized control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing on May 7, aid has been blocked, with supplies piling up in Egypt and the Strip teetering close to famine. A top Israeli security official this week warned that the war in Gaza could spill into next year, apparently dashing the possibility that the Rafah campaign could bring the offensive to an end. In its ruling last week, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said the humanitarian situation in Gaza could now be described as \u201cdisastrous\u201d and ordered Israel to keep the Rafah crossing open for \u201cunhindered provision at scale\u201d of aid. Israel and Egypt have blamed each other for the blockage. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called on Egypt to reopen the crossing; his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry accused Katz of \u201cdistorting the facts,\u201d saying that Israel\u2019s offensive near the crossing \u2013 and the danger it poses to relief workers \u2013 was the reason Egypt is unable to bring aid into Gaza. Rafah had previously been the central artery for aid to flow into Gaza \u2013 and, in November, for some injured Palestinians and foreign nationals to enter Egypt. With Rafah now the epicenter of hostilities, aid has continued to trickle in from two other crossings: Kerem Shalom in the south and Erez in the north. Kerem Shalom was reopened last week after Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and US President Joe Biden agreed to send aid to the UN via the crossing on a temporary basis. \u201cThis will help save lives,\u201d Biden said, while efforts continue to reopen the Rafah crossing. More than 370 aid trucks arrived at the crossing from Egypt on Monday, Israeli officials said. But UNRWA, the main United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, said it had picked up only 30 trucks for distribution on the Gazan side of the crossing. \u201cWhile the Kerem Shalom crossing remains open in principle, it is extremely difficult for aid organizations to access from the Gaza side due to the hostilities,\u201d OCHA said Tuesday. Some Israelis have in recent months staged protests at the crossing, demanding that no aid enter Gaza until Hamas release all of the hostages. In the north, some aid has been able to enter via the Erez crossing. From May 1 to May 20, the World Food Program transferred 500 trucks, carrying 7,000 metric tons of aid, through the crossing. But only the western side of the crossing is open, with Erez East still closed. Meanwhile, the temporary US-built pier to transport aid into Gaza, which cost $320 million and only began operating on May 17, broke apart Tuesday. It will be removed from the Gaza coast and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod for repairs, which will take more than a week.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/middleeast/aid-gaza-down-two-thirds-israel-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_asia_chinese-ships-japan-senkaku-islands-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "China Coast Guard ships have been in waters around Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea for a record 158 consecutive days, according to Tokyo\u2019s latest count released Monday, surpassing the previous record set in 2021. Analysts fear the uninhabited islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China, have the potential to become a flashpoint for conflict between the two Asian neighbors. \u201cThe Japanese government takes very seriously the fact that there have been a succession of vessels sailing in the contiguous zone and trespassing in territorial waters,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said at Monday briefing in Tokyo. The Japanese government chief spokesperson did not say how often Chinese ships entered Japan\u2019s territorial waters, though foreign ships are allowed \u201cinnocent passage\u201d through such waters. A contiguous zone extends another 12 nautical miles beyond a country\u2019s territorial waters, the area that stretches 12 nautical miles from the shore. Foreign warships are allowed into contiguous zone waters \u2013 so the Chinese Coast Guard hasn\u2019t broken any international agreements \u2013 but the continuous presence of the Chinese vessels there is seen as a provocation. Hayashi said Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has raised Tokyo\u2019s \u201cserious concerns\u201d with Chinese Premier Li Gongmin during a trilateral summit with South Korea in Seoul on Monday. \u201cWe will continue to take every possible precaution and surveillance around the Senkaku Islands with a sense of urgency,\u201d he said. Competing claims The uninhabited island chain has been a sore spot in Japan-China relations for years. Claims over the rocky chain, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) southwest of Tokyo but only about 205 miles (330 kilometers) from China\u2019s east coast, date back centuries, and neither Japan nor China is likely to back down over territory considered a national birthright in both capitals. Tensions heated up in 2012, after Tokyo bought some of the islands from a private Japanese owner, which Beijing took as a direct challenge to its sovereignty claims. It has frequently dispatched China Coast Guard and other government vessels to the waters around the islands to assert those claims. \u201cChina\u2019s patrol and law enforcement missions in waters off the Diaoyu Dao are legitimate measures taken by China to exercise its sovereignty in accordance with law and are necessary responses to Japanese provocations in violation of China\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d a 2022 Chinese Foreign Ministry document says. \u201cNo country or force should misjudge the strong resolve of the Chinese government to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d it says. Experts have said China makes a statement and sets up a possible legal argument for sovereignty over the islands by keeping government ships near them. To present an international legal claim to the islands over Japan, \u201cChina simply needs to establish a greater and more enduring presence of its ships in the waters around the islands,\u201d James Brown, an associate professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo, told CNN in 2022. Hayashi, the Japanese government spokesperson, said Monday that Tokyo is answering the Chinese presence around the islands with vessels of its own. \u201cWe ensure a comprehensive security system for territorial waters by deploying Coast Guard patrol vessels that are consistently superior to other party\u2019s capacity,\u201d Hayashi said. Any Japanese-Chinese incident in the Senkakus raises the risk of a wider conflict, analysts note, due to Japan\u2019s mutual defense treaty with the United States. Washington has made clear on numerous occasions that it considers the Senkakus to be covered by the mutual defense pact. China exerts pressure at sea The extended Chinese presence around the Senkakus comes as Chinese forces assert themselves in two other East Asian hotspots \u2013 around Taiwan and near Philippines-controlled features in the South China Sea. China staged its largest military exercises this year around Taiwan last week after the island\u2019s new democratically elected leader, President Lai Ching-te, who is openly loathed by Beijing for championing the island\u2019s sovereignty and distinct identity, was sworn in. China\u2019s ruling Communist Party says Taiwan is part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary. And in the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard has been taking action against Philippine vessels trying to resupply a contingent of Philippine marines on Second Thomas Shoal, using water cannons on that have injured Filipino sailors and damaged their craft. The developments come as leaders and military officials prepare to gather in Singapore for the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia\u2019s premier defense summit. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is scheduled to give the keynote speech Friday evening, with Chinese-Philippine clashes around Second Thomas Shoal expected to be a prime topic. The US and Chinese defense chiefs are also expected to address the conference.

Extreme temperatures throughout Asia over the past month were made worse most likely as a result of\u00a0human-driven climate change, a team of international scientists have said. In Mohenjo Daro, a town in Sindh known for archaeological sites that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization built in 2500 BC, temperatures rose as high as 52.2 C (126 F) over the last 24 hours, a senior official of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Shahid Abbas told Reuters. The reading is the highest of the summer so far, and approached the town\u2019s and country\u2019s record highs of 53.5 C (128.3 F) and 54 C (129.2 F) respectively. Mohenjo Daro is a small town that experiences extremely hot summers and mild winters, and low rainfall, but its limited markets, including bakeries, tea shops, mechanics, electronic repair shops, and fruit and vegetable sellers, are usually bustling with customers. But with the current heat wave, shops are seeing almost no footfall. \u201cThe customers are not coming to the restaurant because of extreme heat. I sit idle at the restaurant with these tables and chairs and without any customers,\u201d Wajid Ali, 32, who owns a tea stall in the town. \u201cI take baths several times a day which gives me a little relief. Also there is no power. The heat has made us very uneasy.\u201d Close to Ali\u2019s shop is an electronic repairs shop run by Abdul Khaliq, 30, who was sat working with the shop\u2019s shutter half down to shield him from the sun. Khaliq also complained about the heat affecting business. Local doctor Mushtaq Ahmed added that the locals have adjusted to living in the extreme weather conditions and prefer staying indoors or near water. \u201cPakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to the impact of climate change. We have witnessed above normal rains, floods,\u201d Rubina Khursheed Alam, the prime minister\u2019s coordinator on climate, said at a news conference on Friday adding that the government is running awareness campaigns due to the heat waves.

Remal made landfall at the start of the week and while it weakened it has brought torrential rain to much of Bangladesh and northeastern India. The death toll across both nations has now risen to 51 people. The northeastern Indian state of Mizoram has been hit hardest with landslides killing 27 people, according to local officials. \u201cElectricity and water supply will be stifled due to damage of infrastructure,\u201d the Mizoram government said in a statement on X. Cyclone-related deaths were also reported in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal and the southern Indian state of Telangana as well as Bangladesh. The Indian Meteorological Department on Tuesday said Remal weakened into a depression over east Bangladesh after losing some force earlier on Monday. It caused widespread damage in both countries, toppling trees, turning roads into rivers and leaving millions without electricity. More than 1 million people in India and Bangladesh were evacuated Sunday as the cyclone made landfall near the border between the two countries. Authorities said that volunteers and army staff were mobilized to assist with clean-up efforts, and distribute food and water to displaced families. Remal made landfall roughly 80 kilometers (50 miles) southeast of the Indian city of Kolkata, packing gusts of up to 135 kilometers per hour (84 miles per hour), and is moving northwards across Bangladesh and its adjoining West Bengal coasts, the Indian Meteorological Department said. The storm weakened after it hit the coast with wind speeds of up to 115 kilometers per hour (71 mph). Remal is expected to dump more than 89 millimeters (3.5 inches) of rain and bring wind-driven storm surges of 2.5 to 3.7 meters to the coasts of the Bay of Bengal, according to CNN Weather. The ports of Mongla and Payra in Bangladesh put up the Great Danger Signal 10 \u2014 the highest alert signal \u2014 on Sunday, and all boats were advised to remain in shelter by the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. About 2 million people live in storm-affected areas in Bangladesh, according to non-profit BRAC.  At least half a million of these people \u201clive in houses made of materials such as clay, wood, plastic sheets, straw or tin,\u201d said Dr. Md Liakath Ali, a disaster expert at BRAC. The country is one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis, studies show.  Millions are without power as authorities shut down electricity supply to many areas in advance to avoid accidents, according to Ali. Fallen trees and broken lines disrupted supply, he said. An especially vulnerable group are the stateless Rohingya communities who fled persecution in nearby Myanmar during a military crackdown in 2017. They are already\u00a0living in the world\u2019s largest refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, which is at risk of landslides and floods, owing to the flimsy structure of their shelters. Many live in bamboo and tarpaulin shelters perched on hilly slopes that are vulnerable to strong winds, rain, and landslides. Video taken by a BRAC volunteer early Monday in Mongla showed a woman struggling to walk through the floodwaters as gusts of wind nearly toppled her over. In India, video from the country\u2019s National Disaster Response Force showed workers removing broken trees in the state of West Bengal as heavy rain lashed down on them. The Coast Guard was closely monitoring Remal\u2019s landfall, with ships and hovercraft on standby to respond to any challenges, it said. Hundreds of flights were also impacted following the closure on Sunday of the main international airport in Kolkata, West Bengal state\u2019s capital. Air traffic in and out of the airport resumed on Monday, but disruptions continued with dozens of flights delayed, according to the airport\u2019s official website. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said he had reviewed disaster management and preparation efforts. \u201cI pray for everyone\u2019s safety and wellbeing,\u201d Modi wrote on X. Cyclones, also known as typhoons and called hurricanes in North America, are enormous heat engines of wind and rain that feed on warm ocean water and moist air. And scientists say the climate crisis is making them more potent. A study published in 2021 by researchers at the Shenzhen Institute of Meteorological Innovation and the Chinese University of Hong Kong and published in Frontiers in Earth Science found that tropical cyclones in Asia could have double the destructive power by the end of the century, with scientists saying the human-made climate crisis is already making them stronger. The cyclone comes as parts of western and central India continue to bake under severe heat, with temperatures soaring beyond 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some cities, causing illness and forcing some schools to close. Climate scientists have long warned that these extremes of weather will only continue to intensify because of the climate crisis, with millions of people in India vulnerable to the risks associated with it.

Many MSF staff members have lost family members or homes during the shelling. Since the fighting began more than two weeks ago, the group said it has treated 979 people. The violence in North Darfur has intensified as the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF) encircle El Fasher. The fighting also affects thousands of displaced people who have fled to El Fasher from the other four Darfur states now controlled by the RSF. According to UNICEF, at least 500,000 people sheltering in the city have been displaced by violence elsewhere in Sudan.

Conille was chosen by consensus after the council conducted hearings of candidates, Leblanc Fils said. Conille briefly served as prime minister from 2011 to 2012 during the presidency of Michel Martelly. He is currently the UNICEF Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean. His appointment is a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti\u2019s government, following the ouster of former Prime Minister Ariel Henry earlier this year. The new prime minister and the nine-member council must also select a cabinet and eventually lead Haiti to new elections. Since February, attacks by an insurgent alliance of gangs in the capital Port-au-Prince mean the city\u2019s international airport and seaport have ceased to function, breaking vital supply lines of food and aid and triggering an exodus of evacuation flights for foreign nationals. The violence erupted while Henry was in Kenya to secure its commitment to a multinational security mission meant to bolster Haiti\u2019s national police. But the then-leader was unable to return to the country amid the bloodshed, and ultimately announced his resignation in March. The resignation pitched the country\u2019s political establishment into weeks of negotiations as they sought to muster a transitional government. The inauguration of the CARICOM-backed presidential council in April has since allowed Haiti to resume planning for the much-delayed foreign mission. That foreign mission, led by Kenya, is now expected to arrive sometime in June. While some commercial flights to Port-au-Prince have tentatively restarted, the city remains\u00a0largely cut off\u00a0from the outside world.

The Virginia resident was fined $9,000, Kimo Tynes, the director of communications for the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, said in a statement. Since he had already served three weeks in jail, the court recognized it as time served, so his prison sentence is complete, the release said. The 31-year-old American faced as much as a 12-year prison sentence. But the Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case and said, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Another American charged with possession of ammunition, Ryan Tyler Watson, pleaded guilty Tuesday, according to Tynes. Watson\u2019s sentencing is scheduled for June 21. Watson and Wenrich are among five Americans arrested in Turks and Caicos in recent months, all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to the 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. Bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden,\u201d according to a\u00a0statement\u00a0from its government. In the Turks and Caicos, possession of firearms or ammunition carries a minimum 12-year sentence, though the law allows reduced sentences under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d  Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Misick said. Meanwhile, the United States has\u00a0more guns than people. On Friday, American Bryan Hagerich of Pennsylvania pleaded guilty and received a 52-week sentence\u00a0suspended for one year\u00a0and a $6,700 fine, his representatives said. He returned to the United States after paying the fine. In addition to Hagerich and Wenrich, one other American \u2013 Michael Lee Evans \u2013 pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling in Turks and Caicos, according to the territory\u2019s government. Evans was allowed to return to the US over a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing, attorney Oliver Smith told CNN. The rest remain in Turks and Caicos. A fifth American, Sharitta Shinese Grier, was arrested last week and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, with the Office of the Premier and Public Policy. The mandatory minimum 12-year sentence for possession of firearms or ammunition is in place to protect those on the islands, and judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences, Turks and Caicos Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick said Thursday. No US citizen has received the 12-year sentence to date.

{"id": "2024_05_29_asia_north-korea-trash-balloons-intl-hnk", "text": "North Korea has adopted a new strategy to contend with its southern neighbor: sending floating bags of trash containing \u201cfilth\u201d across the border, carried by massive balloons. The South Korean military began noticing \u201clarge amounts of balloons\u201d arriving from the North starting Tuesday night, detecting more than 150 as of Wednesday morning, according to the country\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). Photos released by the JCS show plastic bags carried by two giant balloons, with some broken packages spilling scraps of plastic, sheets of paper, and what appears to be dirt onto roads and sidewalks. The balloons so far contain \u201cfilth and garbage\u201d and are being analyzed by government agencies, said the JCS, adding that the military was cooperating with the United Nations Command. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s actions clearly violate international law and seriously threaten the safety of our citizens,\u201d it added. \u201cAll responsibility arising from the North Korean balloons lies entirely with North Korea, and we sternly warn North Korea to immediately stop its inhumane and low-level actions.\u201d Local governments also sent messages to residents in the northern Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces to warn of the \u201cunidentified objects,\u201d and advised against outdoor activities. The packages risk damaging residential areas, airports and highways, said the JCS. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s younger sister Kim Yo Jong \u2013 who is also a senior official in the reclusive regime \u2013 referred to the activities as \u201cfreedom of expression.\u201d In a statement published by state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on Wednesday, Kim said that North Korea had dispersed toilet paper and other waste materials in bags attached to the\u00a0balloons along the Korean border and central areas. Kim compared North Korea\u2019s actions to South Korea\u2019s years-long practice of sending\u00a0balloons with anti-North Korea leaflets towards her nation. \u201cWe\u2019ve done some of the things they always do, but I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re making a big deal like they\u2019ve been hit by a shower of fire,\u201d Kim said. The move, according to North Korean state media KCNA, was to retaliate against South Korean activists who often send materials to the North \u2013 including propaganda leaflets, food, medicine, radios and USB sticks containing South Korean news and television dramas, all prohibited in the isolated totalitarian dictatorship. Campaigners in the South, including defectors from North Korea, have long sent these materials through balloons, drones, and bottles floating down the cross-border river \u2013 even after South Korea\u2019s parliament banned such actions in 2020. \u201cScattering leaflets by use of balloons is a dangerous provocation that can be utilized for a specific military purpose,\u201d said Kim Kang Il, North Korea\u2019s Vice Minister of National Defense, KCNA reported on Sunday. He accused South Korea of using \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d by scattering \u201cvarious dirty things\u201d near border areas, declaring that the North would take \u201ctit for tat action.\u201d \u201cMounds of wastepaper and filth will soon be scattered over the border areas and the interior of (South Korea) and it will directly experience how much effort is required to remove them,\u201d Kim said, according to KCNA. \u201cWhen our national sovereignty, security and interests are violated, we will take action immediately.\u201d Kim also decried joint US-South Korea military drills, which have increased in recent years as tensions have risen in the Korean peninsula. The 2020 law that prohibited sending leaflets also\u00a0restricted\u00a0loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts, which the South\u2019s military once championed as part of psychological warfare against the North until it withdrew the equipment following a 2018 summit between the two Koreas. But even after parliament passed the ban, activists told Reuters they planned to continue \u2013 including the defector Park Sang-hak, who had been sending materials back to his homeland for 15 years, vowing to continue in an effort to give North Koreans a rare glimpse of the outside world. Earlier this month, Park\u2019s organization Fighters for a Free North Korea said in a statement it had sent 20 balloons toward North Korea, containing 300,000 leaflets that condemned Kim Jong Un and 2,000 USB sticks containing K-pop and music videos. \u201cIn order to appeal and urge the North Korean people to rise up and put an end to Kim Jong Un \u2026 the group is sending the leaflets to the compatriots in North Korea,\u201d the organization said in a statement. For decades, North Korea has been almost completely closed off from the rest of the world, with tight control over what information gets in or out. Foreign materials including movies and books are banned, with only a few state-sanctioned exceptions; those caught with foreign contraband often face severe punishment, defectors say. Earlier this year a South Korean research group has released rare footage that it claimed showed North Korean teenagers sentenced to hard labor for watching and distributing K-dramas. Restrictions softened somewhat in recent decades as North Korea\u2019s relationship with China expanded. Tentative steps to open up allowed some South Korean elements, including parts of its pop culture, to seep into the hermit nation \u2013 especially in 2017 and 2018, when relations thawed between the two countries. But the situation in North Korea deteriorated in the following years and diplomatic talks fell apart \u2013 prompting strict rules to snap back into place in the North.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/asia/north-korea-trash-balloons-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

Discovered in Villedieu-sur-Indre, a commune in central France, two of the graves have been fully excavated so far, the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) said in a statement. The horses have been radiocarbon-dated back to somewhere between 100 BC to 100 AD. Archaeologists found 10 complete horse skeletons in one pit and two in the other, all carefully placed in the same manner lying on their right flank with their heads to the south. All these horses were buried at the same time shortly after their deaths, archaeologists said after observing the position of the skeletons and the connections between the bones. Another grave is situated between these two pits but it contains two medium-sized dogs, both lying on their left side with their heads facing west. Archaeologists have yet to fully excavate the remaining graves but have already identified a total of 28 horses from the skulls and coxal bones that appear on the surface. Killed in battle, or ritual sacrifice? However, the horses\u2019 precise cause of death still remains unclear. Archaeologists have ruled out an epidemic since there are no foals or mares in these graves; all the skeletons are fully-grown stallions aged over four years old. That leaves, archaeologists said, the possibilities that these horses were either killed in battle or as part of a ritual sacrifice. When these horses died about 2,000 years ago, there was a fortified Celtic settlement known as an oppidum just a few hundred meters away and this location mirrors that of two other similar horse burial sites that archaeologists had previously uncovered in the same region. Due to this location, they have hypothesized that the horses\u2019 deaths at the sites could be connected to the battles of the Gallic Wars in which Julius Caesar conquered Gaul between 58 - 50 BC. There may be another explanation, however: ritual sacrifice. \u201cThe hypothesis that these animals were sacrificed as part of a complex ritual, of which only a few scraps remain, must also be considered,\u201d the INRAP statement said. If these horses were indeed buried as part of a ritual rather than killed in battle, the sheer number shows the \u201cimportance and extent of the sacrifice,\u201d the statement added. Other finds at the site, which sits on the slope of a valley, include buildings, pits, ditches and a road that archaeologists dated to the late 5th and early 6th centuries.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/europe/horses-remains-graves-france-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

The move, which was quickly called out on social media, has been labeled by some as an attempt at censorship. \u201cAs the Palestinian people are already suffering great trauma and loss due to the vengeful regime of Netanyahu it is most unfortunate that a reputable publication like VF attempts to eliminate support that I or anyone chooses to offer,\u201d Pearce told CNN in an emailed statement. \u201cPersonally I think it is a disgrace.\u201d Pearce was featured in Vanity Fair France last week as part of a series of actor portraits at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, which wrapped its 11-day stint on May 25 and where Pearce was supporting his new film \u201cThe Shrouds.\u201d Featured alongside stars like Sebastian Stan and\u00a0Bella Hadid, Pearce sported a black Yves Saint Laurent suit in his portrait, smiling straight at the camera. But social media sleuths detected an issue. A small Palestinian flag pin, which Pearce had been wearing on his lapel throughout Cannes, was missing from the photograph, though a different photo, featuring the pin, was posted to the magazine\u2019s Instagram the same day the article published. A white, red, black and green bracelet \u2014 the colors of the Palestinian flag \u2014 was still visible on his wrist. The sleuthing went viral on sites like X and TikTok, prompting the magazine to replace the un-edited photo and issue a correction to the article. An apology was also posted to social media on Sunday. \u201cWe have published by mistake a modified version of this photo on the site,\u201d the magazine wrote in French on X in response to a viral post criticizing the edited photo. \u201cThe original version was posted on Instagram the same day. We have rectified our mistake and we apologize.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why a modified version of the picture existed in the first place. Cond\u00e9 Nast, Vanity Fair\u2019s parent company, did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Following the controversy, Pearce also reiterated his support for the Palestinian cause in a post on X, writing \u201cPalestinians are being murdered as we speak. Displaced, traumatised, ruined. The lives and futures of Palestinian children are being eradicated by a vengeful tyrant.\u201d Since October, more than 36,000 people in Gaza have been killed, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave. Israel\u2019s military operation in Gaza started after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. Last weekend, Israel launched an airstrike on a refugee camp in Rafah, killing at least 45 people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the civilian deaths a \u201ctragic error\u201d but would not cease the war, despite international condemnation.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/style/vanity-fair-france-guy-pearce-cec/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_middleeast_gaza-us-munitions-rafah-strike-analysis-intl-hnk", "text": "Munitions made in the United States were used in the deadly Israeli strike\u00a0on\u00a0a displacement camp in Rafah on Sunday, a CNN analysis of video from the scene and a review by explosive weapons experts has found. At least 45 people were killed and more than 200 others injured after a fire broke out following the Israeli military\u2019s strike\u00a0on the outskirts of Gaza\u2019s southernmost city, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian medics. Footage obtained by CNN showed swathes of the camp in Rafah in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. Israel\u2019s escalating assault in Rafah \u2013 where some 1.3 million Palestinians were taking shelter before Israel began its operation there \u2013 has drawn swift international condemnation, with United Nations agencies, aid groups and multiple governments calling on Israel to immediately halt its offensive. Israeli tanks were seen advancing further into Rafah on Tuesday for the first time in Israel\u2019s seven-month war against Hamas, signaling a new phase Israel pressing on with its controversial and destructive offensive. However, US President Joe Biden is not altering his policy towards Israel, suggesting the deadly Rafah strike had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support,  despite him saying in a CNN interview earlier this month\u00a0he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. CNN geolocated videos showing tents in flames in the aftermath of the strike\u00a0on\u00a0the camp for internally displaced people known as \u201cKuwait Peace Camp 1.\u201d In video shared on social media, which CNN geolocated to the same scene by matching details including the camp\u2019s entrance sign and the tiles on the ground, the tail of a US-made GBU-39 small diameter bomb (SDB) is visible, according to four explosive weapons experts who reviewed the video for CNN. The GBU-39, which is manufactured by Boeing, is a high-precision munition\u00a0\u201cdesigned to attack strategically important point targets,\u201d and result in low collateral damage,\u00a0explosive weapons expert Chris Cobb-Smith told CNN Tuesday. However, \u201cusing any munition, even of this size, will always incur risks in a densely populated area,\u201d\u00a0said Cobb-Smith, who is also a\u00a0former British Army artillery officer. Trevor Ball, a former US Army senior explosive ordnance disposal team member who also identified the fragment as being from a GBU-39,\u00a0explained to\u00a0CNN how he drew his conclusion. \u201cThe warhead portion [of the munition] is distinct, and the guidance and wing section is extremely unique compared to other munitions. Guidance and wing sections of munitions are often the remnants left over even after a munition detonates.\u00a0I saw the tail actuation section and instantly knew it was one of the SDB/GBU-39 variants.\u201d Ball also concluded that while there is a variant of the GBU-39 known as the Focused Lethality Munition (FLM) which has a larger explosive payload but is designed to cause even less collateral damage, this was not the variant used in this case. \u201cThe FLM has a carbon fiber composite warhead body and is filled with tungsten ground into a powder. Photos of FLM testing have shown objects in the test coated in tungsten dust, which is not present [in video from the scene],\u201d he told CNN. Serial numbers on the remnants of the munitions also matched those for a manufacturer of GBU-39 parts based in California \u2013 pointing to more evidence the bombs were made in the US. Two\u00a0additional\u00a0explosive weapons experts \u2013\u00a0Richard Weir, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch, and Chris Lincoln-Jones, a former British Army artillery officer and weapons and targeting expert \u2013 identified the fragment as being part of a US-manufactured GBU-39 when reviewing the video for CNN, though they were unable to comment on the variant used. Asked for comment on the munitions used in the Rafah strike at Tuesday\u2019s briefing, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters: \u201cI do not know what type of munition was used in that airstrike. I\u2019d have to refer you to the Israelis to speak to that.\u201d CNN has also reached out to the US National Security Council. Main weapons supplier The US has long been the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), and that support has continued despite the growing political pressure on the Biden administration over the Gaza offensive. Last month, Biden signed a foreign aid bill that included\u00a0$26 billion for the Israel-Hamas conflict\u00a0\u2014\u00a0including $15 billion in Israeli military aid, $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza and $2.4 billion for regional US military operations. CNN\u2019s identification of the munition is consistent with a claim made by IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari in a briefing about the tragedy on Tuesday. Hagari told reporters the strike \u2013 which he said\u00a0targeted senior Hamas commanders \u2013 used two munitions with small warheads containing 17 kilos of explosives, adding these bombs were \u201cthe smallest munitions that our jets could use.\u201d The traditional GBU-39 warhead has an explosive payload of 17 kilos. Hagari said the deadly fire which occurred following the strike was not caused solely by weapons used by the Israeli military. \u201cOur munitions alone could not have ignited a fire of this size,\u201d Hagari said, adding the IDF was investigating \u201cwhat may have caused such a large fire to ignite.\u201d He added that Israel is looking into whether the strike was \u201cunintentionally set off possible stored weapons in a nearby compound.\u201d Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the deadly airstrike in Rafah was a \u201ctragic error,\u201d but said Israel has vowed to press on with its operation despite international outrage and a US warning not to proceed.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/gaza-us-munitions-rafah-strike-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_ammo-arrests-turks-and-caicos", "text": "Five Americans were arrested in Turks and Caicos within the past six months because of tightened gun control laws in the territory that make bringing in firearms or ammunition without prior permission from police a crime with a mandatory 12-year prison sentence. Michael Lee Evans, 72, of Texas; Sharitta Grier, 45, of Florida; Bryan Hagerich, of Pennsylvania; Ryan Tyler Watson, 40, of Oklahoma and Tyler Wenrich, 31, of Virginia, were all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to Turks and Caicos, a 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas.  While some have pleaded guilty, paid fines or returned to the US, others await trial with the road ahead unclear. But what is clear: all have said the ammunition recovered from their luggage was not intentionally packed, according to American lawmakers petitioning for their expedited release. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the Americans and the laws in Turks and Caicos: No constitutional right to carry firearms in Turks and Caicos Even though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said. And that\u2019s a worry for the British Overseas Territory. While it is legal to fly in the US with unloaded firearms and ammunition in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration, bringing firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d Firearm and ammunition offenses carry a mandatory minimum custodial sentence of 12 years and a fine, according to the Turks and Caicos Island Government. The mandatory sentence is in place to protect those on the islands, Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam said. Judges may use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d she said. But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said. \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly,\u201d Misick said. US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials have said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were United States citizens, Misick said last week, and none of them received the 12-year sentence. While the US and Turks and Caicos collaborate in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know so far about the Americans and the laws in Turks and Caicos: Bryan Hagerich Hagerich was the first of the five to return to Pennsylvania after he received a suspended 52-week sentence on Friday, which meant he wouldn\u2019t face immediate incarceration, his representatives said. He was also given a $6,700 fine. The father of two pleaded guilty to possession of 20 rounds of ammunition, according to the Turks and Caicos government.  Hagerich paid the fine and was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory. He flew home Friday afternoon, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign, a group that helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Hagerich said when he was reunited with his children. \u201cA lot of memories to make together. Just so elated to see them. They\u2019ve been so strong through all this.\u201d After Hagerich arrived at Pittsburgh International Airport on Friday night, he told reporters he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d to have his two children jump into his arms, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WTAE. Before Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, his wife packed two suitcases \u2013 one if he was sentenced to prison and another if he were allowed to return home because the couple was unsure how the judge would rule when they walked into the courtroom on Friday, they said in an exclusive interview with \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cIt was dark, you have no concept of time,\u201d Hagerich said about his week-long stay in jail in Turks and Caicos. \u201cI was with three folks that were accused of murder. It was scary.\u201d Tyler Wenrich Wenrich pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. He was sentenced on Tuesday to three weeks in jail and issued a fine. The Virginia resident was fined $9,000, said Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, director of communications for the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands in a news statement Tuesday. Since he had already served three weeks in jail, the court recognized it as time served and he won\u2019t be immediately incarcerated, the release said. The Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case, saying, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Wenrich was charged with possession of two 9mm rounds, according to the Turks and Caicos government. Michael Lee Evans Evans, 72, pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9mm rounds of ammunition and appeared before the court on April 24 via video conference. The Texan was allowed to return to the United States on bail due to a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation, but will be required to return to Turks and Caicos for his next hearing set for June 18, his attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel, said. Ryan Tyler Watson Watson, who lives in Oklahoma, was charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition. The 40-year-old appeared in court on April 24, according to the TCGI, and is currently on bail. Watson pleaded guilty at a hearing on Tuesday, Tynes, with the communications office of the Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, confirmed to CNN. He will be sentenced in June. Sharitta Shinese Grier Grier was\u00a0arrested two weeks ago\u00a0and is awaiting trial after making bail, according to Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b. The Florida mother had no idea that two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, she told CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV earlier this month. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen because I couldn\u2019t believe it was in there,\u201d she said. \u201cThey went through my bag and said they found rounds at the bottom of my carry-on.\u201d Grier was released on bail, but she can\u2019t leave the island until her case concludes and must report to a local police station weekly, the station reported. \u201cI\u2019m just broken,\u201d Grier said. Grier\u2019s next court appearance is on July 5, police said. US lawmakers tried to free Americans A US congressional delegation traveled to the islands last week and asked for the charges for the five Americans to be dropped. One of the US lawmakers, Oklahoma Republican Sen.\u00a0Markwayne Mullin, said in a statement, \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today.\u201d In an interview with ABC News last week, Republican Congressman Rep.\u00a0Guy Reschenthaler said, \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now, (where) every third week an American is being detained wrongfully and Turks and Caicos.\u201d Reschenthaler told CNN the prison on Turks and Caicos has been flagged by the UN for humanitarian concerns. In a House of Assembly address, the islands\u2019 Misick said, \u201cThe (accusations) of congressman (Guy Reschenthaler) against the government and people of the Turks and Caicos Islands are nothing more than diabolic falsehoods.\u201d Reschenthaler told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju he wants to see a \u201cresolution here where the Americans get zero amount of jail time. They should be given time served and be sent home to the United States.\u201d Reschenthaler continued: \u201cThey were innocent mistakes. Any other nation would handle this with a fine in sending that person back to the country of origin. Here, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d On Tuesday, Mullin welcomed the news of Wenrich\u2019s release, saying it\u2019s \u201canother step in the right direction,\u201d according to a post on X. \u201cI again encourage TCI to address the unintended consequences of their law to prevent this from happening again.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sahar Akbarzai, Michael Rios,\u00a0Holly Yan, Fabiana Chaparro, Amanda Musa\u00a0and\u00a0AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/americas/ammo-arrests-turks-and-caicos/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_tech_ai-iphone", "text": "Imagine asking Apple\u2019s Siri to show you an old photo taken from a child\u2019s second birthday, or summarizing lengthy emails and writing drafts. Then consider Siri learning your schedule, preferences, even your personality, so it can better communicate with you throughout the day. Generative AI, artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions and prompts, could potentially breathe new life into Apple\u2019s iPhone lineup at a time when competitors are threatening to leave the company behind in the race to shape what could be a world-changing technology. The company is widely expected to partner with ChatGPT maker OpenAI ahead of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where it will likely show off its first batch of AI tools coming to the iOS software. Although artificial intelligence has powered some of the iPhone\u2019s experiences for years, such as Live Text and improved autocorrect, generative AI could unlock new levels of interaction and personalization. All this during a time when the company is under pressure to catch up to rivals such as Google and Samsung, which are already using the technology in its smartphones. \u201cWe see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call in early May, noting there would be news announced in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d Apple is not always first to adopt to emerging technologies \u2014 it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect them for years before including them in new products \u2014 but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company\u2019s need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology. The debut of an AI iPhone could also entice consumers to upgrade at a time when they\u2019ve been holding onto older models longer. Apple reported first-quarter revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% year over year, as the tech giant continues to struggle with growth challenges, particularly in China, amid an uncertain economic environment. Now all eyes shift to Apple for its take on generative AI. Here\u2019s how that could play out on the iPhone: A much smarter assissant Although it\u2019s unclear what exactly an iPhone in the generative AI world would look like, experts largely believe the biggest entrypoint is through Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record. Integration with OpenAI\u2019s latest ChatGPT-4o model could catapult Siri years forward, essentially turning the feature into an iPhone chatbot. This would enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. Over time, it could learn the user\u2019s preferences and even personality, and respond accordingly. Looking at how competitors have already introduced generative tools, the iPhone will also likely assist users with other tasks, such as offering to summarize and draft emails, or starting an online purchase return process. Samsung\u2019s \u201ccircle to search\u201d feature, which allows users to quickly search for information on a device\u2019s screen with a finger gesture, has received a lot of attention and is featured in marketing campaigns. Multimodal features \u2013 which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time \u2014 like analysis of video footage and in-call spam detection could also form part of the tools, according to Paul Schell, industry analyst at tech intelligence firm ABI Research. \u201cSomething similar would likely be included in an Apple offering, given its relative simplicity and appeal that goes beyond simple image search,\u201d Schell said. \u201cBut verbal interactions with a bot like Siri will be much more natural and fluent, and its capabilities will go far beyond the previous, narrow domains, like news and weather updates.\u201d An AI iPhone could also adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues. \u201cGenerative AI will allow the next generations of iPhones to become a sixth sense, empowering us to scan and interact with the world around us,\u201d said Thomas Husson, an analyst with market research firm Forrester. Generative AI will also likely change Apple\u2019s whole ecosystem by embedding it through its own apps, such as Apple Maps, iMovie and iPhoto, and release tools for developers for brands to develop new experiences through their own apps. Expediting AI Behind the scenes, Apple reportedly has been working on its on-device generative AI capabilities and acquiring companies for awhile, such as Canadian startup DarwinAI. It also has a machine learning research division dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence.  But after the launch of ChatGPT ignited an AI arms race in late 2022, followed by companies such as Google, Microsoft and Meta heavily pouring resources into developing related tools, Apple has remained relatively quiet about its visions for an AI-powered future. Nabila Popal, a senior research director at market research firm IDC, said the pressure to be part of the conversation likely moved up the company\u2019s timeline. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported Apple was closing in on a deal with OpenAI to use its ChatGPT technology on iPhones, after holding similar talks with Google. \u201cApple normally takes their time and doesn\u2019t let the Android race rush [impact its moves], be it with foldables or 5G or even augmented and virtual reality,\u201d Popal said. \u201cAnd Apple then comes out and does it better than anyone else.\u201d \u201cHowever this time, with AI, it is different,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Apple is being forced to show its hand early.\u201d She said consumers are considering AI capabilities of greater importance than any other feature when choosing their premium device, especially in China, where Apple is losing its marketshare. \u201cIt\u2019s not just because of the resurgence of Huawei but also because of \u2018lack of AI\u2019 in their devices,\u201d she said. \u201cChinese consumers want more from their premium phones.\u201d During its most recent iPad event, Apple reminded onlookers that it\u2019s been using artificial intelligence in its products for years, including a neural processing engine to support its A11 bionic chip. But now it needs to show it\u2019s going all in on artificial intelligence to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industry. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a question about whether or not Apple will announce something around generative AI, but Apple has to if they want to achieve growth in this highly competitive and innovative smartphone market, especially in China. \u2026 AI is one train Apple can\u2019t afford to miss.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/tech/ai-iphone/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_style_pompeii-children-drawings-scli-intl-scn", "text": "Children\u2019s sketches depicting violent scenes of gladiators and hunters battling animals have been uncovered at the archaeological park of Pompeii, the park\u2019s superintendent has said. The drawings, thought to be made by children between the ages of five and seven sometime before Mt. Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, were found on the walls of a back room in the residential sector of the archaeological park. They\u00a0show that even children in ancient times were exposed to extreme violence. \u201cIt does not seem to be a problem only of today, between video games and social media,\u201d superintendent Gabriel Zuchtriegel said\u00a0in a statement about\u00a0the latest discovery. \u201cThe difference is that, in ancient times, the bloodshed in the arena was real and that few saw it as a problem with all the possible repercussions on the psycho-mental development of Pompeian children.\u201d As of Tuesday, visitors to the park can see the drawings from suspended walkways above the excavation site as archaeologists continue to work there. The drawings depict a fight scene with two gladiators, spears in hand, facing what is likely to have\u00a0been intended to be\u00a0wild boars. Nearby lies the head of a bird of prey archaeologists say could have been an eagle. There is also a boxing scene with both boxers appearing to be lying on the ground in a \u201cknock-out,\u201d according to the park\u2019s description of the discovery. Other drawings include a child\u2019s outlined hands made with charcoal and figures playing with a ball. An even older drawing on an adjacent wall was presumably made by an older child, with the use of a red mineral pigment rather than charcoal, but it was partially covered in whitewash,\u00a0suggesting\u00a0the room was being repainted to cover up the drawings on the walls,\u00a0archaeologists said. The older painting depicts a more sophisticated marine scene with two ships surrounded by fantastical fish, one of which was caught on a hook. Children likely witnessed violence Pompeii park has started a collaboration with the\u00a0Department of\u00a0Child\u00a0Neuropsychiatry at Naples\u2019 Federico II University to study the children\u2019s art. So far, they have determined that the drawings likely came from \u201cdirect vision\u201d of an event rather than from pictorial models. \u201cProbably one or more of the children who played in this courtyard, among the kitchens, latrine and flowerbeds for growing vegetables, had witnessed fights in the amphitheater, thus coming into contact with an extreme form of spectacularized violence, which could also include executions of criminals and slaves,\u201d Zuchtriegel said. \u201cThe drawings show us the impact of this on the imagination of a young boy or girl, subject to the same developmental stages that are still found today.\u201d In addition to the drawings, archaeologists uncovered the petrified remains of a man and a woman who perished when the volcano erupted, capturing the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in a time capsule that was first discovered in the 16th century. The presumed couple were found in front of a home that was undergoing renovation, based on construction materials found on site. Archaeologists also discovered a painting of a small child wearing a hood that they say is \u201cwithout comparison\u201d in Pompeii, perhaps a homage to a deceased child, according to the park. The child was surrounded by bunches of grapes and pomegranates and a tiny dog and seemed to be looking out into the garden near where the other children\u2019s drawings were found. The ongoing excavations are part of an extensive plan to save the ancient site from collapse after years of neglect. Previous discoveries have included a\u00a0prison bakery\u00a0and a lavish dining room with\u00a0mythological figures\u00a0on the walls.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/style/pompeii-children-drawings-scli-intl-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

She eventually prevailed 7-6 (7-1) 1-6 7-5 on Court Philippe Chatrier, and then \u2013 unusually for a player known for her calm and reserved demeanor on the court \u2013 rebuked the crowd for distracting her during big points. \u201cI have huge respect for you guys and I know that we are playing basically for you because this is entertainment and we are also earning money because of you,\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek said in her on-court interview. \u201cBut sometimes [we\u2019re] under a lot of pressure. When you scream something during the rally or right before the return, it\u2019s really, really hard to be focused \u2026 This is serious for us, we\u2019re fighting our whole lives to be better and better and sometimes it\u2019s just hard to accept that. \u201cThe stakes are big and there\u2019s lot of money here to win. Losing a few points may change a lot. Please, guys, if you can support us between the rallies but not during, that would be really, really amazing.\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek, aiming to win a fifth grand slam title and fourth at the French Open, was cheered by the crowd as she delivered the message. It was also surprising to see so many empty seats for a high-quality encounter between a current and former world No. 1 who each have four grand slam titles. \u201cOsaka vs Swiatek is a brilliant watch,\u201d Andy Murray posted on X, adding that the sport should be doing more to promote the match. It\u2019s not the first time that the French Open crowd has come under the spotlight this week. Belgian player David Goffin said that one spectator spat chewing gum at him during his five-set victory against Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. \u201cSoon, there will be smoke bombs, hooligans and fights in the stands,\u201d Goffin told Belgian media, per\u00a0Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to become ridiculous. Some people are there more to cause trouble than to create an atmosphere.\u201d In a statement to CNN regarding the incident, a spokesperson for the French Open said: \u201cThe public are incredibly enthusiastic, particularly on the outside courts. However, they must of course show full respect to all players while doing so. \u201cOversight bodies are in place to make sure rules are followed. Although it is only natural that fans share their excitement and cheer on their favourites, this may not in any case go against the values of tennis or consideration for the players.\u201d For her part, Osaka said that the atmosphere was \u201creally incredible\u201d for her match against Swiatek, adding that she noticed \u201chow much fun everyone in the crowd was having.\u201d The Japanese star has returned to tennis this year after the birth of her daughter, and her time away from the sport has seen her drop outside the top 100 in the world rankings.  Many expected \u015awi\u0105tek, playing on her favored surface of clay and coming off back-to-back titles in Madrid and Rome, to win comfortably against Osaka, but that was far from the truth. The Polish 22-year-old, who turns 23 on Friday, gained the upper hand in the opening set as she won 12 points in a row for a 3-1 lead before Osaka responded strongly, breaking \u015awi\u0105tek at 4-3 having trailed 40-0 earlier in the game. \u015awi\u0105tek had to save a set point at 5-4, then managed to take a commanding lead in the tie break and wrap up the first set in an hour and nine minutes. The lead was short-lived, however, as Osaka, now hitting with aggression and accuracy, broke Swiatek three times in the second set to level the match. Another break at the start of the final set put her on course for an upset victory against a player so dominant on clay, but a couple of costly misses at 5-3 \u2013 including a netted backhand on match point \u2013 saw \u015awi\u0105tek survive. The defending champion rallied from there, securing two breaks of serve and a thrilling victory in three hours and 13 minutes \u2013 despite Osaka\u2019s impressive performance featuring eight aces and 54 winners. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to have any logical thoughts because it was really intense and on a really high level,\u201d \u015awi\u0105tek told reporters. \u201cI was in huge trouble in the third set but I managed somehow to win this match.\u201d Bidding to becoming the first woman to win three consecutive French Open titles since Justine Henin in 2007, \u015awi\u0105tek will face either Croatia\u2019s Jana Fett or Czech Republic\u2019s Marie Bouzkov\u00e1 in the third round.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/iga-swaitek-naomi-osaka-french-open-crowd-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

Lennon gave the acoustic guitar to a friend, who passed it on to someone \u201cwho took the guitar home, tossed it in the attic, and gave it nary a thought for decades,\u201d the auction house said in a statement published in April. The guitar, manufactured in Germany, has a spruce top, mahogany back and sides and a 19-fret rosewood fretboard, said the auction house, which worked with Beatles expert Andy Babiuk to confirm its authenticity. \u201cIt has some distinctive markings which made it easily identifiable,\u201d said the auction house, but \u201cthe real proof is in the sound.\u201d \u201cWhen strummed, it immediately identifies itself as \u2018that\u2019 guitar.

The remains of Davy and Natalie Lloyd were accompanied in an American Airlines jet by US Ambassador to Haiti Dennis Hankins and US security agents, according to a source with knowledge of the operation. After flying from Haiti to Miami, they will be sent onward to their families. \u201cThis morning, the remains of Davy and Natalie Lloyd safely took off on a flight back to the United States \u2014 there will be a series of layovers, and they will safely reach Neosho, Missouri tomorrow afternoon,\u201d read a statement posted by their families on the X account of Natalie\u2019s father, Missouri State Rep. Ben Baker, requesting privacy during the transfer. \u201cWe are praising the Lord for his hand of protection over this nightmare. Funeral services will be early next week, with more details to come tomorrow,\u201d the statement also said. Their return follows a week of extraordinary negotiation between the US government and Haitian authorities, local organizations and even gang leaders, sources say \u2013 all in a city crippled by the criminal groups that have shut off the import of vital humanitarian supplies, destroyed medical facilities and blocked key roads. A State Department spokesperson told CNN that it had been working \u201caround the clock\u201d to assist in arranging the return, and on Thursday afternoon confirmed that both bodies had arrived in the United States. This month\u2019s reopening of Toussaint Louverture International Airport \u2013 a former target for coordinated gang attacks \u2013 marks an important step in connecting Haiti\u2019s capital city to the rest of the world, after months of violence in the gang-ravaged Caribbean nation. Local carrier Sunrise resumed flights earlier in May. But the progress has been overshadowed by last week\u2019s killing of three missionaries \u2013 the Lloyds and Haitian mission director Jude Montis \u2013 in a high-profile incident that attracted the close attention of US officials and the White House. The three were attacked in the early evening at the Missions in Haiti church and orphanage compound in Port-au-Prince\u2019s Lizon neighborhood, in what began as an armed robbery by one gang that left their compound rampaged and their supplies and aid stolen. A second gang later arrived on the scene and came under fire, precipitating a deadly retribution against mission staff, according to Davy Lloyd\u2019s father and Missions in Haiti founder David Lloyd, who was on the phone with his son that evening. Montis and the Lloyds barricaded themselves inside their residence on the compound, but it was not enough, Lloyd told CNN. Missions in Haiti\u00a0announced their deaths that night. US officials mobilize to recover bodies In the frantic hours following the attack, staffers from the office of Missouri US Rep. Eric Burlison, Missouri US\u00a0Sen. Josh Hawley\u00a0and the US National Security Council reached out to the State Department and US Embassy in Haiti. \u201cAs soon as I found out about the situation, we immediately reached out to the State Department to try and get assistance. Unfortunately, aid was not able to get there in time to prevent the tragedy,\u201d Burlison said in a statement to CNN. \u201cSince their murder we\u2019ve been working closely with Sen. Hawley\u2019s office, State Department, and airlines to bring them home to their families,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to thank everyone who is helping in these efforts.\u201d Natalie Lloyd\u2019s mother, Naomi Baker, is a staffer in Burlison\u2019s office and her father, Ben Baker, is a state representative in Missouri. After the shock of the deaths, it became clear early on Friday morning that Davy and Natalie\u2019s bodies needed to be recovered urgently \u2013 an operation that would be carefully orchestrated by the US government, according to multiple sources. There was no time to spare. \u201cThe bodies could have been either desecrated or kidnapped,\u201d one person involved in the operation told CNN. \u201cSo we pulled them out of a crime scene.\u201d The family of Davy Lloyd contacted private ambulance service HERO Client Rescue to retrieve the bodies on Friday morning, according to a HERO staffer who requested anonymity due to concerns for their safety. The rescue group agreed to coordinate the mission and kept the US embassy updated on it, the staffer also said. But attempts to reach the site were blocked in the road by armed gang members, according to a source with knowledge of the situation, who told CNN that there was an extraordinary intervention by US officials in Haiti, who quickly acted to broker negotiations between multiple gangs in the area to clear access to the bodies. On a phone call with multiple gang leaders, Vitel\u2019homme Innocent \u2013 a gang leader whose armed group Kraze Bary\u00e9 was not involved in the attacks but controls an area around the US embassy \u2013 asserted a claim to the bodies of the two Americans. \u201cFollowing the call, I did everything possible to communicate with the people in control of the area, to get access to retrieve their bodies,\u201d Innocent told CNN. He added, \u201cIt was a sad story when I learned that a Haitian and two Americans who came to serve the population died in a terrible situation.\u201d Innocent himself is the subject of a $2 million bounty for alleged kidnappings of American citizens, which he disputes, saying he hopes to defend himself one day. Emergency vehicles were soon allowed to continue onward to the charred site where they found the three bodies. The remains of Davy, 23, and Natalie Lloyd,\u00a021, were ultimately transferred to a local hospital morgue for safekeeping, according to HERO. Sources involved in the operation told CNN that inspection of the bodies revealed signs of blunt force trauma and severe burns on Davy, but no apparent bullet wounds. To remove human remains from a crime scene is a significant breach of protocol, even in a city plagued by lawlessness. However, Haitian officials agreed to inspect the remains after they were relocated, a source told CNN. Haiti\u2019s National Police did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment for this story, but in a statement last week, police spokesperson Gary Desrosiers told CNN that authorities would work with international law enforcement to investigate and prosecute the killings. Farewell to the bodies Missions in Haiti director Jude Montis, 45, was laid to rest in Port-au-Prince this week.\u00a0Local press showed large crowds gathered outside the church where his funeral services were held, and a mournful band in the procession could later be seen following his hearse down the street. But the bodies of the Lloyds have been waiting to travel back to Missouri until now. Natalie\u2019s father Ben Baker described the continuing hurdles to bring back his daughter and son-in-law on his Facebook page, in a message signed by Baker\u2019s spokesperson Cassidy Anderson. \u201cCurrently, we are working to retrieve the bodies of Natalie and Davy. We have to obtain a waiver that will allow their bodies to be transported without being fully embalmed due to the lack of facilities that provide that service in Haiti. After that, we have to find an airline that will be willing to do the transport. Prayers that this will all go smoothly,\u201d it read. The last remaining hospital in Port-au-Prince with the resources to perform the embalming would be the General Hospital near Champ de Mars, sources told CNN \u2013 but urban warfare between gangs and police have turned the iconic downtown park area into a volatile no-man\u2019s land. Waiting for news of the bodies\u2019 safe return has strained the nerves of family and supporters  with Hawley over the weekend releasing a public letter demanding that the Biden administration assure their security. \u201cNatalie and Davy\u2019s bodies will need to be transported to the final point of departure, and until that time, there are major risks. The situation on the ground in Port-au-Prince remains anarchic,\u201d he warned. But Thursday morning, the bodies of Davy and Natalie Lloyd finally began their long journey home. This is a developing story and has been updated.

{"id": "2024_05_28_middleeast_israeli-tanks-advance-central-rafah-gaza-intl", "text": "Israel\u2019s tanks were seen in central Rafah on Tuesday for the first time since its military entered Gaza\u2019s southernmost city earlier this month, two eyewitnesses told CNN, signaling a new phase in its offensive despite mounting global pressure. They arrive two days after a strike on a Rafah camp killed dozens of displaced Palestinians on Sunday and as the international community urges Israel to stop its assault on the city. Israeli strikes over the past two days in Rafah have forced more displaced people to flee. Two further attacks in Rafah killed at least 29\u00a0Palestinians on Tuesday,\u00a0according to authorities in Gaza. The first hit a displacement camp just 150 meters from the site of Sunday\u2019s strike. The second hit\u00a0a displacement camp\u00a0in the southern coastal town of Al-Mawasi, an area designated by Israel as a \u201csafe zone\u201d where it had earlier ordered thousands of people to evacuate to. Israel has denied striking a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi. Staunch ally the United States said President Joe Biden is not altering his policy toward Israel, suggesting the strikes had not yet crossed\u00a0a red line\u00a0that would force changes in American support. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby asserted on Tuesday there were no indications yet that Israel had waged a military campaign that would prompt Biden to withhold aid or weapons. Biden had said in a CNN interview earlier this month\u00a0that he wouldn\u2019t allow certain US weapons to be\u00a0used in a major offensive in Rafah. His administration has warned against a large-scale ground invasion in Rafah unless the well-being of civilians can be guaranteed. Some 1.3 million Palestinians were sheltering in Rafah before Israel began its operation there, having fled from other parts of Gaza since the conflict began seven months ago. Around 1 million have fled the city since, according to UN figures. Israel\u2019s advance deeper into Rafah comes despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordering it to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its military operation there. The UN and some of Israel\u2019s European allies have called on it to abide by the ICJ\u2019s order, saying it is binding. In Khan Younis, north of\u00a0Rafah, people attempting to evacuate told CNN they do not know where else to go as they try to head north toward Deir El-Balah in central Gaza. Video shows mattresses, wooden panels, chairs, and various other belongings piled on top of vehicles and donkey carts. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now, whether in\u00a0Rafah, Khan Younis or Gaza in general, is the disastrous displacement of people. There is no shelter, no life, no future,\u201d said Ansar Mahdi, a Palestinian who said she has now been displaced four times. Walking on crutches, Mohamed Jarbou, said: \u201cThe elderly have been humiliated. Children humiliated. What\u2019s wrong? They are all civilians.\u201d Tanks in Rafah Alaa Abu Ibrahim, a Rafah resident, told CNN that Israeli tanks were seen at the Al Awda roundabout in the center of the city. Another resident, Salma AlKadoomi, said she saw armored vehicles in the downtown area. \u201cThese vehicles advanced in the middle of the night,\u201d AlKadoomi told CNN. Asked about reports of tanks advancing in the city, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told a media briefing on Tuesday that the military is operating in Rafah in a \u201ctargeted\u201d and \u201cprecise\u201d way. \u201cThere are still Hamas battalions in Rafah. A couple of days ago launchers from Rafah fired (rockets) to Tel Aviv. Millions of people went into bomb shelters,\u201d he said. Israel began a limited ground operation in Rafah on May 7, crossing the Philadelphi Corridor \u2013 a 14-kilometer (about 8.7-mile) buffer zone on the Egypt-Gaza border \u2013 and seizing the Palestinian side of the border with Egypt. Egypt has strongly opposed the operation at its border. On Monday, an Egyptian security worker was killed on the border with Gaza in a shooting that involved Egyptian and Israeli soldiers. Egypt\u2019s state-affiliated Al-Qahera News outlet said \u201cPalestinian resistance\u201d fighters were also involved. Displacement camps hit again: Palestinian officials Palestinian officials said Tuesday\u2019s fresh Israeli strikes had killed 29 people \u2013 at least eight at the Tal al-Sultan camp and 21 at a camp\u00a0in Al-Mawasi, though the IDF has denied striking a humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi. CNN has followed up, asking if the IDF has struck elsewhere in Al-Mawasi, such as the UN warehouse that is in the vicinity of the camp, but has not received a reply. The first strike hit three tents at Tal al-Sultan at around 3 a.m. local time, according to residents and a CNN stringer in Rafah. At least eight people were\u00a0killed and transferred to a field hospital in Tal al-Sultan, according to the Emergency Committee of the Rafah Governorate. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the strike at Tal al-Sultan. The camp hit on Tuesday is approximately 150 meters from another displacement\u00a0camp where an Israeli strike and ensuing fire on Sunday killed at least 45 people. Video from CNN\u2019s stringer in Tal al-Sultan shows displaced people dismantling their makeshift living arrangements, gathering their belongings and evacuating the area on trucks and donkey carts. Al-Mawasi, north of Rafah, is supposedly a \u201csafe zone.\u201d In early May, the Israeli military ordered people in eastern Rafah to \u201cimmediately head to the expanded humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi,\u201d as it stepped up its operations in the area. The Al-Mawasi camp was already crowded with displaced people before civilians in Rafah were ordered to move there. The UN has said it is not \u201cquite suitable\u201d for habitation. Videos obtained by CNN show several dead bodies lying on sand covered in bloodied blankets with dozens of people shrieking and gathering around them. Children are seen crying next to the bodies of women whose faces are covered in blood. Israeli investigation Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday said the civilian casualties caused by Sunday\u2019s strike on the camp in Rafah were \u201ca tragic error.\u201d Israel launched an investigation into the event, and on Tuesday the IDF claimed the deadly fire at the camp could not have been caused solely by the weaponry used by Israel. \u201cOur munitions alone could not have ignited a fire of this size. Our investigation seeks to determine what may have caused such a large fire to ignite,\u201d Hagari said. \u201cWe are looking into all possibilities, including the option that weapons stored in a compound next to our target, which we did not know of, may have ignited as a result of this strike.\u201d He showed aerial footage of a strike on a structure in which he said senior Hamas commanders were meeting and\u00a0said that the military used two munitions with 17-kilogram (37 lbs) warheads.\u00a0\u201cThis is the smallest munitions that our jets could use.\u201d \u201cWe are working to verify the cause of the fire, it is still too early to be determined,\u201d Hagari said.\u00a0\u201cEven when we do find the cause of the fire that erupted it won\u2019t make this situation any less tragic.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/israeli-tanks-advance-central-rafah-gaza-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

The eruption began around 1 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) Wednesday following an earthquake at the Sundhn\u00faks crater, Iceland\u2019s public broadcaster RUV reported. Iceland\u2019s Meteorological Office had earlier warned that a volcanic eruption was likely following \u201cintense seismic activity\u201d at the crater and a build-up of magma in its underground reservoir. Dramatic video and images from the scene showed fountains of red-hot lava shooting into the air along a 3.4-kilometer (two-mile) fissure near Mount Hagafell on the Reykjanes Peninsula. Lava flows initially cut off two out of three roads leading to the fishing town of Grindav\u00edk and were steadily moving along a defensive barrier built to save the town and key infrastructure from being destroyed, Iceland\u2019s Meteorological Office said. But the situation had improved by Thursday, the mayor of Grindav\u00edk said. The town remains without electricity, but both hot and cold water are running in the town with no apparent damage to the piping system, RUV reported. \u201cI like the situation quite well compared to how it looked at the beginning of the eruption yesterday,\u201d Mayor Fannar J\u00f3nasson said. Initial monitoring by the Met Office warned the start of the eruption was \u201cmore vigorous\u201d than previous times, but the lava activity had \u201csignificantly decreased overnight,\u201d it said. Just hours before, V\u00ed\u00f0ir Reynisson, from Iceland\u2019s Civil Defense, had told RUV that \u201clava is flowing outside the defense walls at Grindav\u00edk in several places, and lava is also starting to flow outside the walls at Svartsengi.\u201d He warned that Grindav\u00edk was at risk of becoming completely cut off, though he added that the defense barriers were holding. \u201cThe houses in the west and farthest part of the town would have gone under the lava if it weren\u2019t for the defensive walls, but they are still standing and defending,\u201d Reynisson reportedly said. Grindav\u00edk, a town of about 3,000 people,\u00a0was mostly evacuated before a previous eruption in December. Residents and responders who remain in the town have been urged to leave while they still can, though police told RUV that three residents are refusing to evacuate. Electricity to Grindav\u00edk was cut on Wednesday as a protective measure as lava flows closed in on high-voltage lines and hot and cold pipes in the ground, Kristinn Har\u00f0arsonar, production manager at energy company HS Orka, told RUV. \u201cMost of the high-voltage lines are gone, the pylons are badly damaged and some are on fire,\u201d the Civil Defense\u2019s Reynisson later said. Benedikt \u00d3feigsson, from the Met Office, told RUV that the beginning of this eruption was more powerful than previously due to more accumulated magma in the chamber. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more lava flow than we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d he reportedly said. \u201cThis is reflected in today\u2019s massive lava flows.\u201d Iceland\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a post on X that there was no disruption to international or domestic flights. But for the third time in just over two months, the country\u2019s famous geothermal spa and tourist hotspot the Blue Lagoon was evacuated, according to its operations manager. Just under an hour\u2019s drive from Iceland\u2019s capital and largest city Reykjavik, the Blue Lagoon is one of the country\u2019s most popular tourist attractions. The site is part of southwest Iceland\u2019s Reykjanes Peninsula \u2014 a thick finger of land pointing west into the North Atlantic Ocean from Reykjavik. Iceland is one of the most active volcanic areas on the planet. Rather than having a central volcano, the Reykjanes Peninsula is dominated by a rift valley, with lava fields and cones. The environment agency\u2019s air quality meters are \u201cgreen\u201d across\u00a0Iceland, indicating there is currently no air pollution from the eruption, the monitoring website\u00a0shows. However,\u00a0Iceland\u2019s national police warned a westerly wind could carry gas pollution from the eruption eastward on Thursday into Friday, which might affect areas in South\u00a0Iceland. \u201cAccording to the\u00a0Icelandic Met Office, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the amount of gas emissions from the eruption site,\u201d the police said in a\u00a0statement. While the gas pollution forecasted in Reykjav\u00edk on Wednesday never materialized, police encouraged residents to monitor real-time air pollution levels online.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/europe/iceland-volcano-eruption-grindavik-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_middleeast_spain-ireland-norway-recognize-palestinian-statehood-intl", "text": "Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized Palestinian statehood on Tuesday, cementing a joint move that further isolates Israel over its war against Hamas in Gaza. Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said his country made the decision, which was strongly condemned by Israel, \u201cto keep the miracle of peace alive.\u201d The nations had announced they would take this step last week, but on Tuesday their respective governments simultaneously approved the declaration, meaning it has now officially come into effect. The move also highlights just how split Europe is on whether to recognize Palestinian statehood. A majority of countries around the world do so, and reaffirmed that stance this month in a United Nations resolution in support of Palestinian membership that passed with the support of 143 nations. Among them were many European states. But it is difficult to be truly definitive about how many countries view the issue; some former Eastern bloc countries, for example, recognized Palestinian statehood decades ago while under Soviet rule, but have since distanced themselves from that stance as independent countries. Spain, Ireland and Norway The move by these three countries to recognize Palestinian statehood in tandem sent an impactful message to Israel, and other Western states. Harris said in a statement on Tuesday that Ireland \u201chad wanted to recognise Palestine at the end of a peace process,\u201d but ultimately \u201cmade this move alongside Spain and Norway to keep the miracle of peace alive\u201d \u2013 underlining how the joint declaration gave each nation some level of cover, and may have accelerated the process. \u201cI again call on Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to listen to the world and stop the humanitarian catastrophe we are seeing in Gaza,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,\u201d the Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide added as his country formalized the move on Tuesday. \u201cThe international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.\u201d In Madrid, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said in a nationally televised address that Spain would join \u201cmore than 140 countries that already recognize Palestine\u201d and that it \u201cis the only way to realize the solution that we all recognize as the only possible one to achieve a future of peace: that of a Palestinian state that coexists alongside the state of Israel in peace and security.\u201d But all three countries have received a furious response from Israel since announcing their decision last week. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered the immediate recall of its ambassadors to the trio, and said in a statement: \u201cI am sending a clear message today \u2013 Israel will not hold back against those who undermine its sovereignty and endanger its security.\u201d \u201cAfter the terrorist organization Hamas carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after it committed the most horrific sex crimes the world has seen, these countries chose to give a reward to Hamas and Iran and recognize a Palestinian state,\u201d Katz added. Western Europe In 2014, Sweden became the first major Western European nation to recognize Palestinian statehood. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said the decision was made because it \u201cmet the criteria of international law.\u201d \u201cIn the light of the international law analysis, we see no reason to delay this decision,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a territory of people and a government. Not to recognize Palestine because of the occupation would be against the principle of international law about no fruits of aggression.\u201d But that move did not lead to a groundswell of Western European support for the declaration. Instead, some countries have inched towards supporting Palestinian statehood as part of their wider advocacy for a two-state solution, but have not yet taken the step of formal recognition. Notably, France, Belgium, Poland and Greece voted in favor of the May 10 UN General Assembly resolution that called for Palestinian membership of the UN earlier this month. Denmark was also among the countries that voted \u201cYes.\u201d But on Tuesday, as its neighbor Norway formalized its recognition, Denmark\u2019s parliament voted down a proposal to do so, Reuters reported. Other countries \u2013 including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands \u2013 abstained from the UN vote, which was significant but ultimately symbolic given the United States\u2019 veto. In total, 143 votes were passed in favor of the UN resolution, 25 nations abstained and nine voted against. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u00a0said Friday that the time for a German recognition had not yet come, as there is \u201cno clarity on the territory of the state.\u201d For now, it\u2019s about achieving a long-term ceasefire,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cThe path of symbolic recognition of\u00a0statehood\u00a0is not the way forward.\u201d Eastern Europe Officially, a number of countries that previously fell under the Soviet sphere of influence in eastern Europe recognize Palestinian statehood. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria all take that stance, Reuters reported on Tuesday. But in eastern Europe, that recognition is often complicated, given that the order to formalize ties was given under a Soviet regime that sought to disrupt American global partnerships, such as that with Israel. Some former Soviet-bloc countries, such as Poland, have maintained close ties with Palestinian authorities, and have visited or hosted leaders from the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah. Others have since distanced themselves from their historical declaration of support for Palestinian statehood, such as the Czech Republic, which was one of just nine countries to vote against the UNGA resolution earlier this month. The other nations were Hungary, Argentina, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Israel and the United States. Slovenia\u2019s government will consider a proposal this week to recognize an independent Palestinian state, according to Prime Minister Robert Golob. Golob said in a statement that \u201cafter a series of consultations over the last few days,\u201d a government meeting on Thursday will consider forwarding \u201cthe recognition of Palestine\u201d to the country\u2019s legislature for approval.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/28/middleeast/spain-ireland-norway-recognize-palestinian-statehood-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_world_ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn", "text": "Cancer is often regarded as a disease of the modern age. However, medical texts from ancient Egypt indicate that healers of the time were aware of the condition. Now, new evidence from a skull more than 4,000 years old\u00a0has revealed that ancient Egyptian physicians may have tried to treat certain cancers with surgery. The skull belonged to a man who was about 30 to 35 years old when he died, and it resides in the Duckworth Laboratory collection at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Since the mid-19th century, scientists have studied the skull\u2019s scarred surface, including multiple lesions\u00a0thought to represent bone damage from malignant tumors. Archaeologists regard the skull, labeled 236 in the collection, as one of the oldest examples of malignancy in the ancient world, dating back to between 2686 BC\u00a0and 2345 BC. But when researchers recently peered more closely at the tumor scars with a digital microscope and micro-computed tomography (CT) scans, they detected signs of cut marks around the tumors, suggesting that sharp metal instruments had been used to remove the growths. The scientists reported the findings Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Medicine. \u201cIt was the very first time that humanity was dealing surgically with what we nowadays call cancer,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Edgard Camar\u00f3s, a professor in the department of history at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Coru\u00f1a, Spain. However, it\u2019s unknown\u00a0whether the healers tried to remove the tumors while the patient was still alive, or if the tumors were removed after death, for analysis, Camar\u00f3s told CNN. \u201cIf those cut marks were done with that person alive, we\u2019re talking about some kind of treatment directly related to the cancer,\u201d he said. But if the cut marks were made posthumously, \u201cit means that this is a medical autopsy exploration in relation to that cancer.\u201d Either way, \u201cit\u2019s amazing to think that they performed a surgical intervention,\u201d Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cBut we cannot actually distinguish between a treatment and an autopsy.\u201d Medical \u2018knowledge and mastery\u2019 Medicine in ancient Egypt, documented extensively in medical texts such as the Ebers Papyrus and the Kahun Papyrus, was unquestionably sophisticated, and the new findings offer important, direct evidence of this knowledge, said Dr. Ibrahem Badr, an associate professor in the department of restoration and conservation of antiquities at Misr University for Science and Technology in Giza, Egypt. \u201cWe can see that ancient Egyptian medicine was not solely based on herbal remedies like medicine in other ancient civilizations,\u201d said Badr, who was not involved in the new research. \u201cIt directly relied on surgical practices.\u201d But while this evidence from antiquity was well studied during the 19th and 20th centuries, 21st\u00a0century technologies, such as those used in the new study, are revealing previously unknown details\u00a0about ancient Egypt\u2019s medical arts, Badr added. \u201cThe research provides a new and solid direction for reevaluating the history of medicine and pathology among ancient Egyptians,\u201d he said. The study authors\u2019 methods \u201ctransition their results from the realm of uncertainty and archaeological possibilities to the realm of scientific and medical certainty.\u201d The scientists also found cancer lesions in a second skull from the Duckworth collection. Labeled E270 and\u00a0dating from 664 BC\u00a0to 343 BC, it belonged to an adult woman who was at least 50 years old. The team identified three lesions on the specimen where malignant tumors had damaged the bone. Unlike skull 236, E270 showed no signs of surgery related to the disease. But the woman\u2019s skull\u00a0did contain long-healed fractures, showing the success of prior medical intervention for head injuries. \u201cThat person survived many years after that trauma,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. Writing cancer\u2019s \u2018biography\u2019 The analysis of both skulls \u201cis a remarkable piece of research that provides new and clear scientific evidence about the field of pathology and the development of medicine among the ancient Egyptians,\u201d Badr said. Badr, who collaborates with scientists from Europe and the United\u00a0States to study atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arterial walls) in ancient Egyptian mummies, explained that his work follows the same scientific direction as the skull investigation. By conducting detailed examinations of mummies using 21st century technologies such as CT scans and DNA sequencing, Badr and his colleagues hope to further illuminate the extent of medical knowledge in Egyptian antiquity. \u201cThere is an urgent need to reevaluate the history of Egyptian medicine using these scientific methodologies,\u201d Badr said. \u201cBy utilizing these modern techniques, we will be able to study and gain a more comprehensive and precise understanding of medicine in ancient Egypt.\u201d The new findings also help to complete a portion of cancer\u2019s \u201cobscure biography\u201d by adding a chapter that was written thousands of years ago, Camar\u00f3s added. \u201cThe more we look into our past, the more we know that cancer was much more prevalent, much more present than we thought,\u201d he said. A medical milestone Ancient Egyptians\u2019 perception of cancer centered around the visible tumors that the disease produced. The earliest recorded observation of cancer is in an ancient Egyptian medical text known as the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, which dates back to around 3000 BC to 2500 BC. This text contains 48 case studies covering diverse ailments, including one description of breast cancer. While healers in ancient Egypt may have been aware of cancer, treating it was another story. Most of the medical cases in the Edwin Smith\u00a0papyrus included mention of medicines or strategies for healing. But there was none for the breast cancer patient\u2019s tumors, Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cIt specifically says there\u2019s no treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cThey realized this was a frontier when it came to their medical knowledge.\u201d However, the incisions around the skull tumors suggest that healers in ancient Egypt were trying to change that, surgically removing the tumors to either heal the patient, or to examine the tumors more closely. \u201cWe have these two possibilities: in a way that they tried to treat it, or in a way that they tried to medically understand it, in terms of probably treating it in the future,\u201d Camar\u00f3s said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a milestone in the history of medicine.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/world/ancient-egyptian-skull-cancer-treatment-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city\u2019s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through\u00a0the building \u2013 known locally as B\u00f8rsen \u2013\u00a0from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen\u00a0police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a \u201ccomplicated process.\u201d Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already \u201cconducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.\u201d \u201cBut of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine\u00a0B\u00f8rsen itself,\u201d Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. \u201cMy first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it \u2013 it\u2019s never going to be the same but it\u2019s iconic to\u00a0Copenhagen\u00a0and Denmark,\u201d teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. \u201cIt gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it\u2019s part of European history as a trading continent,\u201d he said. The old stock exchange \u2013 located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg\u00a0Palace \u2013 dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a \u201cpiece of Danish history\u201d was on fire, calling the building \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d Denmark\u2019s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. \u201cHow touching it is to see how the employees at B\u00f8rsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,\u201d he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/17/style/copenhagen-stock-exchange-fire-police-investigation-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 24-year-old mercurial winger has played a key part in the German team\u2019s unlikely journey to the Champions League final after he was loaned from Manchester United in January\u00a0\u2013 with Die Schwarzgelben now on the cusp of winning their second European Cup on Saturday at Wembley Stadium. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for the team and the staff for welcoming me back. So, you know, it\u2019s a nice moment,\u201d Sancho said in an extensive, exclusive sit-down interview with CNN Senior Sport Analyst Darren Lewis in Dortmund earlier this week. \u201cTo be fair, it felt surreal. Again, it still hasn\u2019t hit me. I\u2019m sure in the next couple of days probably when we travel to London, that\u2019s when it\u2019s gonna hit me properly. \u201cI\u2019m a type of person that I don\u2019t like making new friends. I\u2019ve got a big thing on trust \u2013 it\u2019s hard for me to trust people. But I think growing up in South [London], that\u2019s what you\u2019re just taught, it\u2019s like one big family \u2026 That\u2019s why I feel like I connect so much with Dortmund. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy, you know, I don\u2019t think anyone would have expected this\u00a0\u2013 me being in the Champions League final, especially where I came from. I\u2019m just happy.\u201d The final at Wembley is a homecoming for the English star. He came from humble beginnings in Camberwell, south London, and played\u00a0cage football\u00a0on the Kennington Council estate. The chance to win the biggest prize in club soccer on hallowed ground is something that motivates him, but Wembley is a place and memory that still slightly haunts him. Sancho \u2013 along with Bukayo Saka and Marcus Rashford \u2013 missed a spot-kick during the penalty shootout in the\u00a02020 European Championship\u00a0final, leading to a\u00a0barrage of racist abuse on social media following England\u2019s loss to Italy. \u201cThis is still something that\u2019s in my head sometimes. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully recovered yet on that part, but I\u2019m trying my best to get over that,\u201d Sancho admitted to CNN Sport. \u201cThe backlash we got from it, it wasn\u2019t nice. Being in London, not in a million years I would have thought that we would have received [that], especially representing our country. It\u2019s a memory I try to block, but, you know, I can\u2019t act like it didn\u2019t happen. So this is one of those memories that you got to try to get past it and be positive.\u201d Sancho, though, said he\u2019d still be confident taking an important penalty, pointing to one he scored for United in the\u00a0FA Cup semifinal\u00a0last season against Brighton. And he looks to be hitting form at exactly the right time. He was sensational during the semifinal clash against Paris Saint-Germain, putting on a show in front of Dortmund\u2019s famed \u201cYellow Wall\u201d in the first leg as he completed 12 dribbles. The last player to better that mark in the Champions League? Lionel Messi. \u201cTo be behind him is such an honor. What he\u2019s done in the game is outstanding,\u201d said Sancho when talking about his accomplishment. However, ask Sancho who he considers to be the greatest player of all time and he points to his former United teammate Cristiano Ronaldo, who recently became the first player to be the\u00a0top scorer in four different leagues. \u201cHe\u2019s the \u2018GOAT\u2019 (Greatest of All Time) \u2013 what can I say? He deserves it. His dedication to the game is unmatched. You know, always in the gym, always just wanting to be better,\u201d Sancho said. \u201cI had the pleasure to play with him. What a great guy he was for all the young players on the team. I learned so much from him. I\u2019m just happy that I got to assist him against Tottenham, actually, one of his goals, and he got a hat-trick. So yeah, that was definitely a dream come true. You know, just watching him, idolizing him.\u201d This weekend, Sancho will come up against old friend Jude Bellingham, who helped look after him in Germany when his fellow Englishman joined the Black and Yellow four years ago. Sancho is eager to play against the Real Madrid superstar, who was recently named\u00a0La Liga Player of the Season, and said that Bellingham is one of the best players in the world right now, alongside Vin\u00edcius Jr., Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and England captain Harry Kane. \u201cHarry Kane due to the goals he scored and I think if he\u2019d [have] won trophies this year, he would have definitely won the Ballon d\u2019Or,\u201d Sancho said of his countryman who stars for Dortmund\u2019s domestic nemesis Bayern Munich. \u201cVin\u00edcius and Jude, they are both fighting right now [to see] who can win [the Ballon d\u2019Or]. Obviously, they are very close friends, so I\u2019m not saying they are fighting, but they definitely could win it. \u201cMbapp\u00e9 has had an excellent season again, if he won [the Champions League or the European Championships], he would be in the conversation.\u201d On the widely expected and potential prospect of seeing Mbapp\u00e9 play for Los Blancos, Sancho told CNN: \u201cMbapp\u00e9 gives goals, gives assists. He\u2019s a threat to any team in the world. So, you know, to have Vin\u00edcius, Mbapp\u00e9, Bellingham and Rodrygo all on the same team \u2013 it\u2019s scary. It\u2019s very scary.\u201d While all signs point towards a European soccer dynasty forming in the Spanish capital, if Dortmund was to beat the 14-time Champions League winner and press pause on the new era, it would be the stuff of dreams for Sancho \u2013 and perhaps the most meaningful way to overwrite those painful Wembley nightmares as the England star looks set to pen the next chapter of his career.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/jadon-sancho-borussia-dortmund-exclusive-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Nationwide Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU) said on Wednesday during a press conference streamed on its official Youtube channel that its 28,000 members \u2014 just under a quarter of the company\u2019s total workforce in the country \u2014 would strike on June 7, following failed negotiations over pay and bonus arrangements. \u201cWe can no longer afford to see a company that has no will to negotiate,\u201d union representatives said, adding \u201cwe will fight for workers\u2019 rights and interests.\u201d Son Woomok, a union leader, told CNN that many NSEU members worked for Samsung\u2019s flagship semiconductor unit. \u201cWe are demanding transparent and fair performance bonuses and wage increases,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere has never been a proper wage negotiation. It has always been carried out by announcing the (outcome) at the labor-management council, which does not include our union, and the company telling us to accept it,\u201d he added. In a statement to CNN, a Samsung spokesperson said: \u201cThe company remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union, and is making every sincere effort to come to an agreement.\u201d The world\u2019s biggest memory chipmaker has had a rough few years. A historic shortage\u00a0of computer chips during the Covid pandemic was followed by falling demand last year as consumer appetite for electronics remained weak because of global economic uncertainty. In January, Samsung reported an operating profit of just 6.567 trillion won ($4.8 billion) for 2023, its weakest annual performance since 2009, according to the Wall Street Journal. Samsung also lost its crown as the top smartphone maker globally. But things are looking up for the company because of  the AI boom. It is optimistic about a resurgence in demand for mobile devices this year, particularly with the rollout of new products, such as AI-powered smartphones. Last month, Samsung reported a more than 10-fold rise in first-quarter operating profit amid forecasts of high demand for AI and high-end chips, an area in which it competes with Intel (INTC) and Taiwan\u2019s TSMC. The vast majority of the world\u2019s advanced microchips are made in just two places: Taiwan and South Korea.

The ceremonial display on June 8 is the traditional dress rehearsal for the King\u2019s official birthday parade known as Trooping the Colour, which takes place a week later on June 15. It is not yet clear if Kate will also miss that annual military spectacle \u2013 a highlight of the royal calendar full of pomp and pageantry \u2013 at Horse Guards Parade in the British capital. It had been widely hoped that the popular 42-year-old royal might oversee proceedings at the run-through in her capacity as Colonel of the Irish Guards. The regiment will be trooping its colour \u2013 presenting its regimental flags \u2013 at this year\u2019s ceremony. Lt. Gen. James Bucknall will step in to take the salute in Kate\u2019s absence. The former Commander of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps has been to every Sovereign\u2019s Birthday Parade since 2009 when he was appointed Colonel of the Coldstream Guards, having served as a Coldstream Guards Officer for more than 45 years. The Princess of Wales has not carried out any public engagements since December and had been expected to return to official duties after Easter. However, in March, she revealed her cancer diagnosis and that she had started chemotherapy. Following the announcement, a royal source told CNN that she would not be returning to frontline royal duties until she has been cleared to do so by her medical team. There had also been speculation over whether King Charles would participate in next month\u2019s Trooping the Colour as he continues his own cancer treatment. However, Buckingham Palace has now confirmed his attendance. In a slight change from last year, the 75-year-old monarch will inspect troops from a carriage rather than on horseback. He will conduct the review in an Ascot Landau carriage seated alongside his wife, Queen Camilla. The adjustment reflects previous guidance from the royal household that each engagement involving the King would be reviewed, with adaptations made based on doctors\u2019 recommendations. Charles announced his own cancer battle in February but recently resumed public-facing royal engagements as he continues his treatment. The Trooping the Colour celebration usually sees members of the royal family gather on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to wave to crowds after the parade.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/uk/kate-princess-of-wales-to-miss-colonels-review-parade-intl-gbr-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

The 31-year-old L\u00f3pez gave up a two-run home run to Shohei Ohtani in the eighth inning before being ejected by third-base umpire Ramon De Jesus for shouting at him,\u00a0over a check swing call that didn\u2019t go his way. On his way to the dugout, L\u00f3pez untucked his jersey and then threw his glove into the Citi Field crowd.

Comprising of 391 units, Aston Martin Residences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the \u201cUnique Triplex Penthouse,\u201d arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks \u201cthe latest distinct expression of Aston Martin\u2019s ultra-luxury high performance brand.\u201d Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef\u2019s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germ\u00e1n Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the \u201ccosmopolitan city\u201d of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,\u201d said Coto. The structure\u2019s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the drama,\u201d he added. Challenges However, the process wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. \u201cIt was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,\u201d said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. \u201cThey were some of the most amazing challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.\u201d There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Aston Martin touches Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages \u2013 Timeless, Covert and Indulgent \u2013 drawing on the company\u2019s British heritage, as well as the building\u2019s context. \u201cIt needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,\u201d Reichman said. \u201cBut we are in Miami, you don\u2019t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you\u2019ve got to be considerate of the environment that you\u2019re in.\u201d Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company\u2019s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn\u2019t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentley will open in 2026 along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/02/style/aston-martin-tower-miami-scli-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_style_stegosaurus-fossil-auction-scli-intl-scn", "text": "A Stegosaurus skeleton described as the \u201cmost complete and best preserved\u201d of its kind ever discovered is expected to fetch up to $6 million at auction this summer \u2013 but not everyone is happy about it\ufeff. The \u201cexceptional\u201d and \u201cvirtually complete\u201d dinosaur fossil, which is 11 feet tall and 20 feet long, will be sold as part of Sotheby\u2019s annual Geek Week. Paleontologists have questioned the sale of such specimens to private bidders, arguing that these finds should be preserved in museums or other public spaces. Nevertheless, that will not stop the auction of the 150-million-year-old fossil from going ahead in New York on July 17. Apex, as it has been nicknamed, is the \u201cfinest Stegosaurus specimen to come to market,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said in a press release Wednesday. It is expected to fetch between $4 million and $6 million, making it one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils ever offered up for sale, the auction house added. Characterized by its distinctive shape, the Stegosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur with a tiny head and bony plates marching down its back, ending in a spiked tail. A commercial paleontologist named Jason Cooper unearthed Apex on his private land in Colorado, and Sotheby\u2019s said it was involved in the process from the outset. The auction house collaborated closely with Cooper to \u201cdocument the entire process, from discovery and excavation to restoration, preparation, and mounting, ensuring that the documentation and sale of the specimen is handled with the highest standards and transparency.\u201d This collaboration, it said, \u201ccontinues Sotheby\u2019s legacy of pioneering Natural History auctions.\u201d Some, however, see it differently. Steve Brusatte, a professor\u00a0of paleontology and evolution at Scotland\u2019s University of Edinburgh, described the specimen as \u201can important dinosaur fossil,\u201d particularly as there are \u201cfar fewer good (Stegosaurus) skeletons than other famous dinosaurs like T. rex and Triceratops.\u201d This, according to Brusatte, is part of the reason it should not end up in private hands. \u201cIf what the auction house is saying is true, and what I\u2019m seeing in these photos is genuine, then this skeleton really does belong in a museum, where it can be conserved, studied by scientists, and put on display to inspire people from all walks of life,\u201d he said in an email to CNN Thursday. \u201cIt is a great shame when a fossil like this, which could educate and rouse the curiosity of so many people, just disappears into the mansion of an oligarch.\u201d \u201cApex\u201d was discovered in the Morrison Formation in Moffat County, Colorado - and very aptly close to the town of Dinosaur \u2013 in May 2022. It took more than a year to fully excavate the specimen, which was found to have evidence of arthritis, suggesting it lived to an advanced age, with no signs of combat or predation-related injuries. The highest bidder will receive a copy of the dinosaur\u2019s scan data, plus a full license to use any 3D data however they choose. This, according to Sotheby\u2019s, \u201cwill allow primary information about the dinosaur to remain with the specimen and promote collaboration in future research and education.\u201d Brusatte argued, however, that research and education would be best served if the fossil was owned by an institution with an expertise in dinosaurs. \u201cThe uber-wealthy will always be able to outbid museums when a dinosaur is sold on the open market, so my hope is that if there is somebody with the means to buy a fossil like this, and this fossil captures their fancy, that they donate it to a museum,\u201d said Brusatte. \u201cWhat a legacy that would be \u2014 to have your dinosaur on public display, to have your name up in lights as the donor who saved the dinosaur for science, as kids and families stroll by and gawk at this awesome creature from prehistory.\u201d London\u2019s Natural History Museum is home to \u201cSophie,\u201d a comparable fossil - though \u201cApex\u201d is at least 30% bigger, according to Sotheby\u2019s. Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby\u2019s global head of science and popular culture, described Apex as \u201csimply one of the best fossils of its kind ever unearthed.\u201d Visitors to Sotheby\u2019s New York galleries will be able to see Apex as part of a free exhibition of some of the items on sale during Geek Week. Sotheby\u2019s \u201clegacy of pioneering Natural History auctions,\u201d as it refers to it, includes the 2022 sale of an ancient skeleton of a Gorgosaurus, which sold for just over $6 million. It also sold the first standalone T Rex skull with \u201cMaximus\u201d in December 2022. Stan, the world\u2019s most complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton, set a new world record in 2020 when it sold for $31.8 million at Christie\u2019s. At the time of sale, paleontologists feared the fossil was lost to science, but in March the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism revealed plans for Stan to be a star attraction at a new museum of natural history, expected to open in 2025 in Abu Dhabi, as CNN previously reported.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/style/stegosaurus-fossil-auction-scli-intl-scn/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

India\u2019s election is the world\u2019s largest, a mammoth exercise in democracy that has taken place over six weeks. The final day of voting takes place on Saturday and results will be announced three days later. Modi will visit the Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari, a pilgrimage site off India\u2019s southernmost tip, from May 30 to June 1, according to Indian state broadcaster DD News. The site is where popular Hindu monk and philosopher Swami Vivekananda attained enlightenment. Modi has twice before ended an election campaign with meditation. But he has recently been making increasingly grand displays of piety, to capitalize on Hindu-nationalist sentiment as he eyes a third consecutive five-year term in power. In an interview last week with local news channel NDTV, Modi said: \u201cI\u2019m convinced that God has sent me for a purpose, and when that purpose is finished, my work will be done.\u201d \u201cGod doesn\u2019t reveal his cards. He just keeps making me do things,\u201d he continued. India is constitutionally bound to secularism, but since assuming power in 2014 Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have promoted a strident brand of Hindu nationalism that has deepened religious divides. When he first contested national elections a decade ago, Modi chose India\u2019s spiritual capital Varanasi as his constituency, making the ancient city the perfect backdrop to meld his religious and political ambitions. At the end of that campaign, Modi visited Pratapgad in the western state of Maharashtra, where the Hindu-led Maratha forces won a historic battle against the Mughal empire army in the 17th century. Toward the end of the 2019 national elections, which he also won, Modi went to meditate in the revered Kedarnath shrine dedicated to Hindu deity Lord Shiva high in the Himalayas. In January, just months before campaigning began, Modi consecrated the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, a controversial Hindu temple that was built on the site of a destroyed mosque, taking on a role typically reserved for priests. In a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith, critics say Modi\u2019s brandishing of Hinduism has led to rising Islamophobia and persecution of the country\u2019s more than 200 million Muslims. Modi and the\u00a0BJP have increasingly resorted to overtly Islamophobic language during his recent election speeches. In a controversial speech last month, Modi said that if the opposition wins, they would distribute the country\u2019s wealth among \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and \u201cthose who have more children,\u201d in apparent reference to the Muslim community.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/india/india-narendra-modi-meditation-island-election-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

With just hours before the electoral campaigns officially conclude on Wednesday, a string of violent acts against candidates and their staff have been reported across the country, from Jalisco in the west to Chiapas in the south. In Morelos, a state in south-central Mexico, the attorney-general reported that Ricardo Arizmendi Reynoso, a substitute opposition candidate for the municipal presidency of the city of Cuautla, was assassinated in a shooting on Tuesday. In Jalisco state on the same day, Gilberto Palomar, the ruling Morena party\u2019s candidate for the mayorship of the town Encarnacio de Diaz, was hospitalized after an attack by armed individuals on the party\u2019s local offices. In the central State of Mexico, the truck of a mayoral candidate for Chalco, Eduardo D\u00edaz, was shot, according to a local representative of the Green Ecologist Party. Meanwhile, in Puebla, central Mexico, Juan Sandoval, a Citizen Movement candidate in the municipality of Tehuac\u00e1n, was attacked outside his campaign office but was unharmed, his  team reported. As of Wednesday, no arrests have been reported. Several organizations have reported that the run-up to this election has been the most violent in the country\u2019s recent history. However, figures from independent groups and firms differ from those of the Mexican government. The research group Data C\u00edvica has reported 31 homicides, Consultora Integralia has reported 34, and consulting firm DataInt registered 38 in a report published on May 21. The Secretary of Security and Citizen Protection, Rosa Icela Rodr\u00edguez, acknowledged on Tuesday the deaths of 22 candidates during the 2023-2024 electoral process, of which eight victims were candidates accredited by the National Electoral Institute (INE) or before local electoral bodies, according to the official. The Mexican government had previously reported on April 2 that there had been at least 15 candidate deaths since the electoral process began on October 1. On Wednesday, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador claimed that the electoral violence is the result of a link between past governments and criminal groups. \u201cWhat we are suffering in the case of electoral political violence still has to do with that \u2013 links that were established between the authorities and crime,\u201d the Mexican president said in his morning press conference. International electoral observers, accredited by INE to witness Sunday\u2019s general elections, have expressed concern about the violence plaguing the country ahead of the polls. \u201cCertainly, this is more of a call to investigate the facts and take measures so that these issues do not tarnish the elections and do not cause damage to Mexican democracy,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza Salinas, head of the Electoral Observation Mission of the Organization of American States, said Wednesday. Mexico will hold its general election on June 2, when nearly 100 million people will be called to vote.

But he doesn\u2019t want to protect them. He wants to hunt them. To do that his company Kyodo Senpaku has built and launched a brand-new whaling $48 million \u201cmothership\u201d \u2013 the Kangei Maru. \u201cWe are proud of catching whales and are very proud of this ship which will allow us to begin offshore mothership-style whaling this year,\u201d Tokoro told reporters as he escorted them around the 370-foot, 9,300-ton vessel that set sail last Saturday for an eight-month tour of the country\u2019s northern waters. The new ship replaces the Nisshin Maru, the infamous whaling factory vessel dubbed by activists as a \u201cfloating slaughterhouse\u201d that was decommissioned in 2020 after more than 30 years of service, during which it frequently clashed with anti-whaling activists. The Kangei Maru is bigger and faster than its predecessor, the company says, and is equipped with state-of-the-art drones able to travel a reported 100 kilometers (62 miles) to allow crews of smaller boats to quickly locate and kill whales. But activists say the ship\u2019s high-powered features, including a cruising range of 13,000 kilometers (more than 8,000 miles) and its ability to sail for up to 60 days, suggests that Japan is setting its sights on whales far beyond its northern waters. \u201cJapan has never given up on its whaling ambitions,\u201d veteran anti-whaling activist Paul Watson told CNN. \u201cThe only purpose of a vessel like that is so it can travel long distances to the Southern Ocean to hunt whales, (and) what the whalers are doing right now is really just a test run. They are testing out the new ship in their waters.\u201d \u2018We need to cull whales\u2019 The Kangei Maru boasts a slipway large enough to haul 85-foot whales from the sea that leads to an indoor flensing deck the size\u00a0of two basketball courts. There, workers will strip away the blubber before cutting up the whale flesh on enormous cutting boards, before vacuum-packing and storing the meat in 40 industrial freezers, ready for sale. \u201cWhales are at the top of the food chain. They compete with humans by eating marine creatures that should be feeding other fish,\u201d Tokoro said on the tour. \u201cWe need to cull whales to keep the balance of the ecosystem \u2013 it\u2019s our job and mission to protect oceans for the future.\u201d He also told CNN that most of the ship\u2019s catch would be killed \u201calmost instantly\u201d by cannons at sea. \u201cWe aim for perfection, but some of them may suffer. In such cases, we will use a rifle to finish the job.\u201d Besides objecting to the slaughter one of the ocean\u2019s most majestic creatures, marine conservation groups and scientists have highlighted the important role which whales play in helping to tackle the climate crisis through sequestering and storing planet-heating carbon emissions. \u201cWhales are not just consumers in ocean eco-systems \u2013 they recycle a ton of nutrients into the environment which helps stimulate plant-life growth,\u201d\u00a0said marine ecologist Ari Friedlaender, also rejecting pro-whaling arguments that commercial hunts could be \u201csustainable.\u201d \u201cHumans have a very long history of killing whales and have not done a good job of being able to sustainably harvest animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no way to sustainably harvest a wild animal like that.\u201d Why is Japan so determined to keep whaling? Commercial whaling was banned in 1986 under a moratorium by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) after whale populations were almost driven to extinction by humans. Japan is one of three countries \u2013 along with Norway and Iceland \u2013 that continues to hunt whales, and officials argue that the industry is an important part of its culture and history \u2013 and also provides food security. Iceland, which has fiercely defended commercial whaling, said it would end whaling in 2024, citing falling demand for whale meat as well as \u201chigh operation costs and little proof of any economic advantage.\u201d Commercial whaling continues in Norway, which experts say has quietly become the world\u2019s leading whaling nation \u2013 killing more whales than Japan and Iceland combined. For decades, Japan has justified whaling under the guise of \u201cscientific research.\u201d In 2018, it tried one last time to persuade the IWC to allow it to resume commercial whaling \u2013 and failed. So, it withdrew from the body and resumed commercial whaling months later, in defiance of international criticism. \u201cJapan is no longer party to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and can argue that it is no longer bound by provisions and constraints,\u201d Donald Rothwell, an international law professor at the Australian National University (ANU), told CNN. \u201cWithin its waters, it\u00a0has the absolute authority to control the management of living resources \u2013 and that includes whales.\u201d Under Japanese law, three species of whale are permitted to be hunted in its territorial waters and exclusive economic zones \u2013 endangered sei whales and threatened minke whales and Bryde\u2019s whales, with endangered fin whales set to be added to kill lists. \u201cWhales are important food resources and should be sustainably utilized based on scientific evidence,\u201d said government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi this month, as he announced a proposal to hunt fin whales, the second-largest species of whales after blue whales. The World Cetacean Alliance (WCA) marine conservation group said that whale watching in Japan was \u201ca far more successful industry\u201d than harvesting whale meat. \u201cCommercial whaling in the 21st century is unjustifiable,\u201d it said. \u00a0\u201cThe whaling industry in Japan recognizes that it is a challenge to increase whale meat consumption and there is currently no market,\u201d WCA said. \u201cSo why keep slaughtering these wonderful and intelligent animals?\u201d Tokoro ruled out whale watching. \u201cWe will not switch to whale watching but eating whale meat while watching whales might be quite a nice touch,\u201d he told CNN. Demand for whale meat in Japan Over the years, Kyodo Senpaku has launched aggressive public relation campaigns to promote whale meat and win over new generations of young diners. Tokoro says he eats whale meat every day. \u201cWhale meat is not only delicious, it\u2019s good for you,\u201d Tokoro told reporters during the tour of his ship, as he talked\u00a0up the purported \u201chealth benefits\u201d of eating whale, claiming that the meat could cure hair loss and cancer. \u201cI can definitely say whale meat and rice is a really good (combination) for Japanese people. There is no doubt about that, much better than beef and bun.\u201d Last year Tokoro, again wearing his whale hat, launched controversial whale meat vending machines, offering whale sashimi, whale steak and whale bacon. The company has also sponsored influencers from countries such as Russia, Thailand and South Korea \u2013 hosting them at a local izakaya in Osaka, where they sampled dishes like whale sashimi and skewers and encouraging them to take the message back to their followers that whale meat was delicious and acceptable. Japan may have a long and storied history of whaling dating back to the Edo period in the 1600s, but experts say whale meat consumption only really peaked after World War II \u2013 when food sources, especially protein, were scarce. Today, whale meat is now\u00a0considered more of a \u201cluxury\u201d dish, said Nobuhiro Kishigami, a professor at the National Museum of Ethnology, one of the country\u2019s largest research institutes. \u201cThe fact is that there is little interest in whaling and whale meat among Japanese people as a whole,\u201d Kishigami told CNN. \u201cMost young people, especially the majority that live in cities, do not know or care much about whaling and its history and remain indifferent.\u201d The same goes for dolphin meat, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just a sign of the times. But if we were asked to stop eating blue fin tuna, there would be a huge uproar. We would react very badly to that.\u201d Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry estimates that between 1,000 and 2,000 tons of whale meat are consumed annually in the country, compared to average annual totals of more than 230,000 tons during the 1960s. \u201cThere is still certainly a market (for whale meat in Japan) but market size and production volume have shrunk dramatically,\u201d economics professor Mitsuhiro Kishimoto from the Shimonoseki City University told CNN, noting that several major whaling companies had since withdrawn from the trade. \u201cThe demand for whale blubber disappeared after the discovery of oil and petroleum products, so many countries stopped whaling and with international regulations, the number of caught whales decreased and as a result, whale meat production decreased while beef, pork and chicken became more popular,\u201d he said. Scientists have also expressed\u00a0concern about the risks of consuming whale meat, with studies pointing to high levels of mercury found in whale and dolphin meat, which could prove dangerous to consumers \u2013 especially pregnant women and young children. Could Japanese whalers return to the Southern Ocean? Located in deep waters surrounding the entire continent of Antarctica, the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary hosts dozens of whale species including humpbacks, blue whales and fin whales. It was established by the IWC in 1994 to protect whale species after centuries of hunting, but until 2019 Japan took regular trips to the region to hunt for self-stated \u201cscientific research\u201d purposes. Japanese whalers killed 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean in 2018/2019, according to the IWC, before abandoning the region after it left the international body. Takaaki Sakamoto, director of the Whaling Affairs Office in Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency, told CNN that Japan sent ships to the Antarctic last year to collect numbers and skin surface samples, but those expeditions did not involve killing whales. He said they planned to return this year to do the same. Tokoro told CNN that the Kangei Maru is not planning on killing whales beyond Japanese waters because it doesn\u2019t make economic sense. \u201cCommercial whaling is not profitable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take 50 days to get to the Antarctic and back and we are not confident we can make a profit by paying the wages of employees and fuel for 50 days. However, I will go only when the government orders me to go \u2026 Until then, I will not go commercial whaling at all.\u201d But\u00a0activists aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cGiven the ship\u2019s long-range capabilities and drones, and recent announcements from Japan\u2019s fisheries ministry that it is keen to start hunting fin whales, we believe there is a high likelihood that Japanese whalers will return to the Southern Ocean,\u201d said James Anderson, activist and founder of the Whale Defense Agency (WDA). \u201cThe Southern Ocean is a critical habitat for many whale species that provides a safe haven for breeding and feeding \u2026 protecting it is more important than ever due to the increasing threats posed by climate change and illegal whaling.\u201d Rothwell, from ANU, said that if Japan looks to kill whales beyond its territorial waters, it can expect an international response. \u201cIt would immediately trigger global interest and action about the conservation and protection of whales, especially in waters sanctioned by the IWC as a whale sanctuary,\u201d Rothwell said. Watson, the veteran anti-whaling activist, told CNN he\u2019s prepared to mount a physical response \u2013 with a former Japanese fisheries patrol vessel he\u2019s acquired in anticipation of Japanese whalers returning to the Antarctic by the end of the year. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary for a reason \u2013 you don\u2019t kill whales there,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe want to be able to track them down and intercept them like we\u2019ve done before \u2013 and we are more than prepared to do it again.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/asia/japan-whaling-mothership-kangei-maru-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

Sprays of macaw feathers celebrating the vivid traditions of Brazil\u2019s Tapirap\u00e9 people. These are just some of the highlights of \u201cIndigenous Histories,\u201d an absorbing new show recently opened at Norway\u2019s Kode Bergen Art Museum. Curators representing seven Indigenous regions in South America, North America, Oceania and the Nordic region, have chosen to showcase some 280 works highlighting how cultures from across the globe judge the bones of cherished herds and outrageous plumage as equally artistically important as paintings and prints. The exhibition gathers together a vast range of pieces \u2014 both historical and contemporary, by more than 170 artists \u2014 including oil paintings and watercolors, photographs, ceramics, carvings, textiles and conceptual installations. Collectively, they illustrate an anthology of \u201cneglected stories,\u201d says Petter Snare, Kode\u2019s director. In the galleries, each country or territory is given its own space, with rooms dedicated to Brazil, Peru, Mexico, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and S\u00e1pmi, the traditional nation-spanning terrain of the S\u00e1mi. The approach emphasizes regional differences \u2014 how each Indigenous community connects to their specific climate and landscape, their customs and costumes \u2014 but also their shared experiences, most importantly their treatment at the hands of colonial powers. \u201cIndigenous Histories\u201d corresponds with fresh thinking about what is and what isn\u2019t fine art. In recent years, increased public interest in untold aspects in art history and less rigid curatorial programs have put the artistic canon \u2014 with its Eurocentric compass, its predilection for white, male figures and its colonial foundations \u2014under the microscope. Museums are investigating other ways of seeing and showing. At Kode there are pre-Columbian funerary urns alongside masks of satin ribbons made in modern day Brazil; there are 19th-century documentary photographs from Lapland, romantic woodcuts of S\u00e1mi lovers in the 1920s and contemporary sculptures formed from antlers and juniper. Photographs of Peruvian farm laborers, taken in the early 20th century, show how Indigenous workers were known by numbers instead of names; while, in the New Zealand section, organic M\u0101ori motifs out-swirl Europe\u2019s Art Deco designs. For contemporary artists working within these communities, there is sometimes a tension between retaining traditional methods and seeking new approaches, says Katarina Spik Skum, a S\u00e1mi artist from the Swedish part of S\u00e1pmi, who is showing a tent piece made from birch twigs, leather, wool, fur and digitally printed fabric. And for museums, there are unique challenges with the display of works. \u201cYou are concerned that you are using materials that the people who made it would be happy with you using,\u201d explains Philippa Moxon, a textile conservator working on the show. \u201cOne of my colleagues had to condition assess the two reindeer stomachs. They\u2019re fascinating. She was presented with something she\u2019d never seen before.\u201d Vibrant colour, cultural dynamism and anger Perhaps the most recognizable works at Kode are the iconic \u201cdot\u201d paintings of Aboriginal artists, such as Mick Namarari Tjapaltjarri, created in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory in the early 1970s. These are not paintings of landscapes but rather paintings of songs of landscapes. Less well known, but another highlight of the show, are the hugely characterful anamorphic vases with stirrup handles that were created some 2000 years ago by Peru\u2019s Moche civilization. Along with the vibrant color and cultural dynamism, there is righteous anger and political outrage on view, as artists grapple with the legacy of colonial oppression. A section titled \u201cActivisms\u201d explores what curators describe as a \u201chistory of entangled struggle.\u201d The exhibition is a patchwork of creativity and trauma, and is just one example of a drive to reframe Indigenous art that is building momentum. In 2019, Tate established a new curatorial post dedicated to the field. And at the Venice Biennale in 2022, the Nordic Pavilion was transformed into the S\u00e1mi Pavilion, a high-profile showcase for politically charged works. The climate emergency has changed orthodox opinions about Indigenous communities, says Katya Garc\u00eda-Ant\u00f3n, who curated the Venice exhibition and is now director of the Nordnorsk Kunstmuseum\u00a0in Troms\u00f8. \u201cIndigenous peoples\u2019 perspectives on land, fauna, flora, and waters are distinctly different from the modernist \u2014 read western \u2014 perspectives that are responsible for this crisis,\u201d she says. Simultaneously, she adds, social justice movements have \u201cmobilized people\u00b4s awareness of the historic and current hierarchical and discriminatory nature of our societies.\u201d The reindeer skull works of S\u00e1mi artist Mar\u00e9t Ann\u00e9 Sara, exhibited both in Bergen and Venice, were previously brandished at the Norwegian Parliament in Oslo in protest at governmental dictates on reindeer culls. Showing Indigenous art in the setting of a museum funded by the state \u2014 which has impacted rights, conventions and land access and to which much of the art is in response \u2014 prompts awkward questions of hypocrisy. Garc\u00eda-Ant\u00f3n discussed this issue with S\u00e1mi elders, artists and intellectuals before the opening of the S\u00e1mi Pavilion in Venice. \u201cWe all agreed there was more to gain than to lose,\u201d says Garc\u00eda-Ant\u00f3n, adding that the contribution the event made \u201cto the global awareness of Indigenous perspectives in the arts field, proved that the gamble was worth it.\u201d In Bergen, that awareness campaign plunges audiences into a deep well of esoteric knowledge, spiritual beliefs, ecological considerations and fine artistry, all acquired over centuries living in sync with nature and within sustainable rather than exploitative cultures. It also shows that this story \u2014 while written on the walls in Norway \u2014 is ongoing all around the world.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/style/indigenous-histories-kode-bergen/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

More than 280,000 utility customers in Texas were without power as of Wednesday evening, including more than 150,000 in Dallas County alone, according to PowerOutage.us. Both Houston and Dallas were slammed with hurricane-force winds Tuesday as violent storms flooded roads, upended trees and power lines and reduces some buildings to shells of their former selves. The winds collapsed an under-construction home in Magnolia, Texas, killing a 16-year-old working inside of it, according to the Montgomery County Sheriff\u2019s Office. At least eight people have been killed in the state since Saturday as severe weather pummeled the region over Memorial Day weekend. The violent weather is just the latest in an unrelenting series of severe storms that has battered Texas in recent weeks, leaving residents with little time to recover from one storm before the next arrives at their doorstep. Summerlike heat will ease across Texas this week following a sweltering heat wave, but those left without power or a reliable way to cool down could still face the risk of dangerous heat stroke or heat exhaustion. Temperatures across eastern Texas on Wednesday will hover around the mid-80s to low 90s, according to the National Weather Service. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins warned people to prepare to be without power for days as an area utility company reported extensive damage to its infrastructure. The utility, Oncor, shared photos of mangled electricity poles, twisted power lines and massive toppled trees. Widespread outages also hampered primary runoff elections on Tuesday in Dallas County, as more than a third of polling locations were in the dark, according to Jenkins. \u201cCheck on your friends, family, and neighbors, especially anyone elderly,\u201d Dallas County officials advised. \u201cDon\u2019t move debris yet as there could be hidden downed power lines that could still be energized.\u201d Esmeralda Martinez, who lives in the Dallas suburb of Carrollton, is among those now sifting through homes that were reduced to piles of soggy debris and jagged wooden beams, CNN affiliate WFAA reports. She and her family sheltered in a hallway as the storm tore off the roof, damaging every room in her home and soaking their belongings. Across the street, Javon Holloway and his grandmother are grateful their home was spared from more serious damage. The neighbors are thankful no one was harmed. \u201cDon\u2019t take your house for granted. I\u2019ll say that much. Be thankful for what you got,\u201d Holloway told WFAA. Storms continued moving across north and central Texas on Tuesday night and are expected to last through Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service in Fort Worth said. After a brief reprieve, another round of powerful storms will rumble back into the same area Thursday evening, bringing a threat of large hail, damaging winds and localized flooding to the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Houston faces damage d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu Houston-area residents are facing an all-too-familar feeling as they survey the fresh layer of damage left by Tuesday\u2019s storms \u2013 just two weeks after a derecho and a tornado bulldozed through the city, killing multiple people and knocking out power for nearly 1 million homes and businesses. Though 99% of those outages had been restored as of last week, more than 300,000 homes and businesses in the Houston area lost power in Tuesday\u2019s storms, according to the regional utility CenterPoint Energy. A majority of its customers had power restored by Wednesday morning. The latest severe weather also thwarted some of the city\u2019s ongoing recovery after the mid-May storm covered streets with trees and debris, shattered skyscraper windows and damaged buildings. That damage had not yet been fully repaired when Tuesday\u2019s storms tore through, rescattering piles of debris that crews had been collecting off the streets and sending another shower of broken window glass onto Downtown Houston, according to CNN affiliates KTRK and KHOU.

Victoria Premier Jacinta Allan announced Wednesday that state MP Tim Richardson would serve as the inaugural Parliamentary Secretary for Men\u2019s Behavior Change \u2013 the first position of its kind in the country. Richardson said he would focus on the influence the internet and social media have on male attitudes towards women, and on building respectful relationships. It would not be \u201ceasy work, but it is important,\u201d he added. \u201cWe must make Victoria a safer place for women and children and work to end the tragedy of deaths of Victorian women at the hands of men,\u201d Richardson wrote on X. Gender-based violence is plaguing Australia \u2013 31 women have been killed across the country so far this year, according to the Counting Dead Women project. Last year, 64 women were murdered, the group said. Last weekend, a woman and her daughter were shot dead in Perth, Western Australia, by a man who was allegedly trying to find his ex-partner and daughter. In a statement, the man\u2019s daughter said that,\u00a0\u201cwhen my father couldn\u2019t find us he murdered her best friend and her best friend\u2019s daughter.\u201d The country was rattled by multiple violent incidents in April, including when five women were killed by a man armed with a knife at a shopping center in the suburb of Bondi in Sydney. Police said CCTV footage showed it was \u201cobvious\u201d the man targeted women. In another violent incident, a 28-year-old mother was allegedly murdered by her partner, who was already facing charges of raping and stalking her but had been released on bail. Tarang Chawla, who founded the non-profit Not One More Niki after his sister Nikita Chawla was murdered by her partner in 2015, told CNN he hopes the new parliamentary position will make a \u201ctangible difference\u201d to addressing male violence in Australia. \u201cThis role gives me some semblance of hope that the focus is shifting away from this being a women\u2019s problem to solve and instead is a men\u2019s issue that we can take leadership for,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it also requires the Parliamentary Secretary to consult and collaborate on solutions with those working on the ground, with men, to understand their attitudes, the drivers of their actions and work to change their behaviors,\u201d he told CNN. However, not all Australians had a positive reaction to the news. Jane Hume of the opposition Liberal Party, who represents Victoria in the national Senate, questioned the efficacy of the appointment. \u201cIt does sound to me like a little bit of window dressing around a really important issue that involves genuine cultural change,\u201d she told Sky News. Within hours of announcing the position, Richardson took to X, writing:\u00a0 \u201cSome pretty hectic reactions here to an important role and Australian first. It will be about modelling positive role models for boys and men and ensuring we break away from gendered based stereotypes and building respectful relationships. As boys and men we need to lead this.\u201d While the new Parliamentary Secretary for Men\u2019s Behavior Change now exists at a state level, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also announced in May a rapid review into the prevention of domestic violence after calling the problem a \u201cnational crisis.\u201d \u201cWe recognize that governments need to act, but we also recognize that this is an issue for the whole of society.

{"id": "world_africa_new-atlantic-port-of-dakhla-africa-trade-spc-intl", "text": "Dakhla, a small city in the disputed territory of Western Sahara, which is mostly controlled by Morocco, is located on a long spit of sand between the Atlantic Ocean and a saltwater lagoon. Its consistent wind makes it a hotspot for kitesurfing enthusiasts, but a new port, currently halfway through construction, could turn the area into a gateway for trade. The $1.2 billion megaproject is expected to complete in 2028. Spanning 1,650 hectares, the complex will include a trade port with an oil terminal, a fishing port and a shipyard. There will be a bridge linking the port to the land and a 7-kilometer road that connects the port with a national highway that runs along the coast as far north as Tangier and as far south as the border with Mauritania. \u201cWe\u2019re constructing an ecosystem,\u201d Nisrine Iouzzi, the director of construction for the Dakhla Atlantic Port, tells CNN. Once operational, she expects the port to handle 35 million tons of goods a year. This will not only boost Morocco\u2019s economy, she says, but it could help the country become a maritime hub for worldwide trade, connecting regions such as West Africa, the Middle East, Europe, North America, the Canary Islands and even South America. \u201cThe geographic location is key (to) the success of the port,\u201d she says, adding that the project has attracted significant foreign investment, including from the United Arab Emirates. Gateway to Africa The project is part of Morocco\u2019s national port strategy, which aims to modernize and strengthen port infrastructure by 2030, in order to enhance its role in global supply chains. Seaports such as Casablanca, Tanger-Med and Agadir have already been or are being upgraded, but because of its location, the Dakhla port is seen as particularly significant in opening up\u00a0other parts of the African continent for the world to trade with. \u201cWe strongly believe that with this infrastructure \u2013 port infrastructure, road infrastructure, renewable energy \u2013 we will be very attractive for investors that aim to get to one of the fastest growing markets, which is the West African market,\u201d says Mounir Houari, general manager of Dakhla\u2019s Regional Investment Center. With the implementation of Africa\u2019s continental free trade agreement, which aims to create a single market for goods and services, the port could encourage the processing of raw materials within the continent. \u201cLess than 5% of African natural resources are processed in Africa because there is no industrial infrastructure and exporting infrastructure,\u201d says Houari. The Dakhla port \u201cwill encourage many Africans to start processing natural resources in Africa, allowing African countries to create more jobs to improve their skills and know-how and strengthen their own industries.\u201d The Sahel region, especially landlocked countries such as Mali, Chad, Niger and Burkina Faso, are expected to benefit. Houari explains that Morocco has granted the region access to its road and port infrastructure, providing \u201ca door to the Atlantic maritime trade.\u201d Turloch Mooney, head of port intelligence and analytics at research firm S&P Global Market Intelligence, says the development could be beneficial to the region. \u201cIt is very positive to see modern port and trade infrastructure being developed in the Western Sahara where there is potential to support a large hinterland in West Africa and the Sahel,\u201d he says. \u201cQuality port infrastructure and efficient port operations is part of the package of assurance for foreign direct investment and has been a key factor in the successful growth strategies of many developing countries.\u201d But Western Sahara and the Sahel region has a long history of unrest. \u201cLocal disputes can make developing port infrastructure and reliable logistics much more challenging,\u201d says Mooney.

{"id": "2024_05_29_middleeast_israel-gaza-war-seven-months-end-year-intl", "text": "The war in Gaza will likely continue through at least the end of the year, an Israeli official warned Wednesday, seeming to dismiss the idea that fighting would end after the military offensive against Hamas in Rafah. Israel\u2019s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, said the year 2024 has been \u201cdefined as a year of combat\u201d by Israel\u2019s war cabinet. \u201cWe are now in the fifth month of 2024, which means we expect another seven months of fighting to deepen our achievements and achieve our goal of destroying the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Islamic Jihad,\u201d Hanegbi said. The comments came as Israeli tanks \u2013 seen Tuesday in central Rafah for the first time since the operation began earlier this month \u2013 continued to probe the southern Gaza city on Wednesday, despite mounting global pressure to stop the offensive. The Israeli government had previously signaled that entering Rafah would be the final stage of its war against Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 people hostage. In response, Israel launched a devastating offensive in Gaza which has killed more than 36,000 people, according to Palestinian officials. Despite the prospect earlier this month of striking a ceasefire-for-hostages deal with Hamas, the more extreme wing of Israel\u2019s war cabinet had urged that the Rafah offensive go ahead, arguing that destroying the group was more urgent and of greater importance than returning the hostages believed to still be alive in Gaza. But Hanegbi\u2019s comments suggest that the Rafah operation may not mark the end of hostilities, raising questions about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plans to wind down Israel\u2019s campaign and his plans for the post-war governance of Gaza. While Netanyahu has portrayed Rafah as Hamas\u2019 \u201clast bastion\u201d his forces have been operating in northern areas the military previously said it dismantled the militants\u2019 command structure. In a radio interview on the Israeli station Reshet Bet, Hanegbi said \u201cit was honestly stated in the first days of presenting the plans to the cabinet that the war would be long.\u201d \u201cYou need to have patience and know how to stand strong. This resilience is what has allowed this nation to survive for 75 years, and even for 3,000 years before that. Just don\u2019t use a stopwatch on ourselves or set ultimatums,\u201d he said. Israel is pressing ahead with its military offensive in the face of growing global outrage, after an Israeli airstrike on Sunday killed at least 45 people and injured 200 others in Rafah at a camp for displaced people, which Israel had designated as a safe zone. Video from the Tal al-Sultan camp showed scenes of horror: charred bodies being pulled from the rubble, a man holding the headless body of a child, fire raging from tents in the background. A CNN analysis of video from the scene suggests that munitions made in the United States were used in the strike. But US President Joe Biden is not altering his policy towards Israel, suggesting the strike on Rafah had not yet crossed a red line that would force changes in American support, despite him telling CNN earlier this month he would not allow certain US weapons to be used in a major offensive in Rafah. The strike came days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its offensive in Rafah, or any actions \u201cwhich may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d The ICJ said the humanitarian situation in Rafah can now be described as \u201cdisastrous\u201d and could worsen still if Israel\u2019s operation in the city continues.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/middleeast/israel-gaza-war-seven-months-end-year-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

The attack occurred in Kuchi village, Munya district, in Niger state, beginning at about 5:30 p.m. on Friday and lasting until 4:00 a.m. Saturday, according to district official Aminu Abdulhamid Najume. Niger state, which borders Nigeria\u2019s capital Abuja, has experienced repeated kidnappings for ransom by armed groups, including mass abductions, in recent years. Najume reported that about 300 gunmen arrived on motorbikes and stayed for several hours, making themselves at home before leaving with the abductees. \u201cThey made a fire to curb the cold because it was raining throughout that day,\u201d Najume said. \u201cThey cooked and made tea; they made Indomie (instant noodles) and spaghetti.\u201d Some of those killed were members of a local vigilante group who confronted the attackers but were overpowered. Najume added that security forces had not yet started rescue operations. \u201cThe police visited Kuchi yesterday [Sunday] and left, nothing else.\u201d A spokesperson for the Niger State Police Command did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. \u201cThis is not the first or second time Kuchi village has been attacked. This is the fifth time,\u201d Najume said, noting that the area frequently suffers from kidnappings for ransom. The kidnappers have not yet made any demands regarding the latest abduction, he said. Amnesty International said in a post\u00a0on social media platform X on Sunday that it was \u201cdeeply concerned by the abduction,\u201d criticizing Nigerian authorities for leaving \u201crural communities at the mercy of gunmen.\u201d \u201cSince 2021, gunmen have been consistently attacking Kuchi village and raping women and girls in their matrimonial homes,\u201d the agency stated. \u201cThe invasion of the village by the gunmen is yet another indication of the Nigerian authorities\u2019 utter failure to protect lives,\u201d Amnesty added. Nigeria\u2019s security forces have struggled for years to control insurgent groups in the north of the country. The Kuchi abduction comes two months after 21 people, including a newlywed, were killed when gunmen described locally as \u2018bandits\u2019 stormed a market in Rafi, another affected district in Niger. At least 137 schoolchildren were kidnapped earlier in March in Niger\u2019s neighboring Kaduna state but were later released after the kidnappers made an initial demand of 1 billion naira (over $675,000) and threatened to kill them all if their demands were not met.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/africa/gunmen-kidnap-scores-in-nigeria-deadly-raid-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

Satellite imagery from before and after the landslide show a vast section of the landscape in the mountainous Enga region essentially torn away. The vast size of the slide is even more visible from nearer the ground. More than 150 houses in Yambali village were buried in debris, officials said Sunday. The country\u2019s National Disaster Center said almost 2,000 were feared to be buried. The landslide\u00a0hit the remote village of Kaokalam, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby, at approximately 3 a.m. local time on Friday (1 p.m. Thursday ET), leaving a scar of debris that humanitarian workers said was\u00a0as big as\u00a0four football fields. The phenomenon slammed tons of rock and mud into locals\u2019 homes as they slept, and rescuers struggled to reach such a remote part of what is already one of Asia\u2019s poorest nations, leaving villagers with no choice but to dig through the collapsed mountainside with whatever tools they had. The area has remained unstable, with smaller landslides occurring regularly and endangering rescue workers, Sandis Tsaka told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re getting huge rocks and debris that keep falling down and land further beyond the original landslide area are being impacted,\u201d Tsaka said.

There\u2019s the Art Deco curved crown of the Chrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help \u201csupercharge our economy and expand New York City\u2019s iconic skyline,\u201d building on \u201ccontinued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world\u2019s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.\u201d Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city\u2019s recovery. \u201cThis investment opens a new chapter for Midtown \u2014 and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,\u201d said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. \u201cMidtown\u2019s revitalization is being led by its public realm \u2014 including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,\u201d Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has left vast tranches of office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers \u2014\u00a0who often take out huge loans to finance projects \u2014\u00a0to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city\u2019s public review process early next year and the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/20/style/park-avenue-skyscraper-new-york-skyline-intl-scli/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_europe_ukraine-draft-law-conscription-intl", "text": "The air at the Ukrainian military recruitment office where a 30-year-old hairdresser is being interviewed is filled with anxiety. The man has no military experience and is unsure whether any of his skills would be useful. At one point, the recruiter jokingly suggests that he might be able to give everyone a nice haircut. But the man \u2013 who asked to remain anonymous given his pending military status\u00a0\u2013\u00a0is there anyway. \u201cThe time has come,\u201d he told CNN. Under Ukraine\u2019s new mobilization law, which came into effect on May 18, Ukrainian men are now facing a choice: Comply and face the possibility of being sent to the frontlines, or try to evade and risk penalties and condemnation. The hairdresser has chosen to pre-empt the choice and volunteered, becoming one of six men to be interviewed at the Da Vinci Wolves Battalion\u2019s recruitment center in Kyiv that day. The office is housed in an ordinary residential building, hidden from the outside world. Inside though, the walls are decorated with photos and big banners showing the logo of the battalion, a drawing of three teeth-baring wolves inside a stylized Ukrainian trident. The unit\u2019s recruitment slogan is \u201cEveryone will fight\u201d and the recruiter\u2019s laptop is covered in stickers, one of them saying \u201cYour pack is waiting for you.\u201d Ukraine has made no secret of the urgent need to recruit more people as it tries to defend itself against the Russian aggression. While the government doesn\u2019t reveal the number of dead and wounded, estimates made by experts speak of hundreds of thousands of casualties on both sides of the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. One Ukrainian commander who asked not to be named for security reasons said the personnel shortages are having devastating effects on the battlefield. \u201cIf there had been 1,000 to 1,500 more servicemen in Avdiivka, we would have protected the weak spots through which the enemy entered. \u2026 If we had more people, we would have held out much longer,\u201d he told CNN of the eastern industrial city, which fell to Russian forces in February after Ukraine held it for more than a decade. Making the case for a new mobilization, Yurii Sodol, the commander of the Joint Forces of Ukraine\u2019s military, told Ukrainian lawmakers last month that Russian troops outnumbered Ukrainian \u201cseven to 10 times\u201d in eastern Ukraine. This lack of personnel is putting immense pressure on those who are already serving. \u201cThe war is still going on and mobilization is essential. People who have been fighting for two years are tired. Some are going crazy,\u201d said Yaroslav Galas, who is currently serving with the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade. \u201cSoldiers need proper rest for several months. They need to heal, relax and forget. They need to spend the money they have earned with sweat and blood, to solve their economic and personal issues,\u201d he told CNN. To make the recruitment process more efficient and more transparent, the new law requires all Ukrainian men between the ages of 18 and 60 to register with the military and always have their documents on them. However, only men aged 25 to 60 are subject to mobilization under the new law. The lower limit has been slashed by two years from 27 years, but it\u2019s unlikely to make much difference because of Ukraine\u2019s demographic challenges. High emigration and low birth rates in the 1990s and 2000s mean there are far fewer\u00a0people currently in their 20s, compared to those in their 30s and 40s. Women who have medical or pharmaceutical qualifications must also register with the military, although they are not required to serve. The new rules have been controversial \u2013 the draft law was amended more than 4,000 times during the approval process. \u2018Desire to fight\u2019 It is unclear how many people will end up being called up. Late last year, the leader of President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s Servant of the People faction in parliament said the military was looking for an extra 500,000 servicemen and women. But the Commander-in-Chief of Ukrainian Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi said recently that any increase in numbers would likely be significantly lower. Some military officers are already questioning whether it will work. Their main worry is that they\u2019ll end up with units full of men who are only there because someone forced them to be. \u201cWe still want people to join voluntarily. Because there is a big difference between someone who was drafted into the army and someone who went to defend their homeland,\u201d said Dmytro Kulibaba, a soldier with the 114th Territorial Defense Brigade. \u201cThe desire to fight the enemy is very important, in addition to training, equipment and preparedness,\u201d he told CNN. Galas said that many people are worried that if they get drafted, they will be automatically sent to the frontlines \u2013 which he said is not the case. \u201cIf you are a specialist, for example, who in civilian life was engaged in IT, accounting, project management, even cooks, clerks, then the Armed Forces also need you \u2026 and you can also make a fairly large contribution to the common victory by joining the Armed Forces,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cWe have a separate drone unit who are a little further away from the frontline. People who are good at electronics, even those who like to play computer games, will quickly master this specialty.\u201d \u2018Sense of camaraderie\u2019 One Kyiv-based business owner told CNN he had been researching his options long before receiving the draft notice in the mail. He knew it was coming, he said, he just didn\u2019t know when. \u201cI had been preparing for this for about a year or six months. I talked to my friends who are serving, I asked them about everything,\u201d the 35-year-old said, explaining that his goal was to find a unit that would be a good fit for him. The man is currently in a training center and will be joining the army in couple of months, which is why he cannot be named by CNN. \u00a0He is currently considering two options \u00a0\u2013\u00a0reconnaissance or anti-aircraft missile troops. He said agreeing to serve was a clear choice for him \u2013 despite some of his loved ones trying to steer him away from it. \u201cYou think about all the options when you must make such a decision. How can I look my son in the eye when I say that I was somewhere (else)? I don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t work for me. I made a moral and ethical decision for myself. And then I had to decide with whom I would (feel most comfortable) serving with,\u201d he said. Galas told CNN he believes the mobilization campaign has not been going well because it does not give people enough information. \u201cIt scares people away,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what is happening in the combat brigades and it needs to be explained to them.\u201d He said that despite the initial worry, many soldiers adapt well to their new life, giving an example of a young IT specialist who was mobilized within the past few months. \u201cOnce he joined this team, he saw that life in an infantry unit is not what civilians imagine. Yes, it is dangerous and difficult. But good people are there, and the bad ones don\u2019t stay. There is a sense of camaraderie. And this is important,\u201d he explained. The IT man had impressed his commanders immediately, he added. \u201cHe did very well during his first combat mission in Robotyno, holding positions 400 meters away from the Russians. He not only withstood assaults but also took prisoners,\u201d he said. But not everyone is able to adjust to the realities of life on the frontline. The commanding officer who asked to remain anonymous spoke of another problem with the mobilization, saying that in recent times some recruits have not received the training they need to withstand the pressure. \u201cThe infantry being sent to the frontline needs to be given special training to make them real professionals. Because they come in here, drop their weapons, and run away from their positions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be motivation for the current military and those about to serve. We cannot use the methods used in Russia or Belarus \u2013 catching and imposing \u2013 this will not help. It will only lead to people running away and giving up their positions,\u201d he added. Running away But the military clearly isn\u2019t for everyone.\u00a0CNN spoke to one man who is determined to avoid serving no matter what.\u00a0He asked to remain anonymous because he is afraid of retribution. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill people, and in principle, I\u2019m not ready for that.\u00a0If shelling starts on the frontline, I think I will be confused and will only create problems for others,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI think I\u2019d be more useful making money and bringing dollars to the country than digging trenches or guarding military facilities,\u201d he added. He said he believes Ukraine doesn\u2019t have enough weapons to militarily reclaim territory seized by Russia in the war. The only way forward, he said, is a political agreement that would lead to Ukraine regaining its land. The man said that if he was to receive a draft notice, he would leave the country. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave; I know that things are not so beautiful and sunny in Europe. But if I had to choose between going to war or going abroad, I would choose abroad, I would pay a bribe. My life comes first. And I realize that there is a very high chance of being killed,\u201d he said. The soldiers who are currently serving have little patience for men like this one, who say they can\u2019t join the fight. \u201cSoldiers who go on leave or for treatment, who are exhausted \u2026\u00a0of course that (seeing other men) drinking coffee in coffee shops, going to restaurants, pumping their biceps and (saying they were) \u2018not born for war\u2019 make soldiers angry,\u201d Galas said. Unless they obtain a special permit, men between the ages of 18 and 60 have been forbidden from leaving Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion and last month, the government suspended consular services for men who are not registered with the military. Still, many attempt to run away anyway. Andrii Demchenko, the spokesperson for the Border Guard Service of Ukraine, told CNN his officers detain people trying to cross out of Ukraine on daily basis. Some are willing to risk everything trying to escape. The Border Service said that since the start of the full-scale invasion, the bodies of 32 men have been found in the Tysa River on the border with Romania and Hungary.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/europe/ukraine-draft-law-conscription-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_29_asia_thailand-indicts-thaksin-shinawatra-lese-majeste-intl-hnk", "text": "Thailand\u2019s former Prime Minister\u00a0Thaksin Shinawatra has been indicted on lese majeste charges, authorities said Wednesday, the latest\u00a0twist in a decades-long political saga in the Southeast Asian kingdom. The case, filed by police, alleged Thaksin violated Thailand\u2019s notoriously harsh royal insult law during an interview he gave in 2015 to the South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo. \u201cThe attorney general has decided to indict Thaksin on all charges,\u201d spokesperson Prayuth Bejraguna,\u00a0told reporters Wednesday. Thaksin will need to appear before the Office of the Attorney General on June 18, after which he will be taken to court. He could not appear at Wednesday\u2019s hearing due to a Covid-19 infection, the spokesperson said. Thaksin has denied the charges, according to the spokesperson, and has repeatedly pledged loyalty to the monarchy. Thaksin, who served as prime minister from 2001 until he was ousted in a military coup in 2006, made a dramatic return to Thailand last August after 15 years in self-imposed exile and\u00a0was taken into custody. Some experts believe Thaksin may have struck a deal with the country\u2019s powerful conservative and royalist establishment for his return \u2013 given his court convictions and the charges against him. Thaksin has denied the claim. He was sentenced to eight years in prison for conflict of interest, abuse of power and corruption during his time in power, though his sentence was later reduced to one year. In February, the 74-year-old was released from detention after being granted parole, having served just six months in a police hospital. Thailand\u00a0has some of the world\u2019s strictest royal defamation laws, and\u00a0criticizing the king, queen, or heir apparent can lead to a maximum 15-year prison sentence for each offense. Sentences for those convicted under Section 112 of Thailand\u2019s Criminal Code,\u00a0or lese majeste law, can be decades long, and hundreds of people have been\u00a0prosecuted in recent years. Earlier this month, the death of a young Thai activist in pre-trial detention for lese majeste charges shocked many in the country and sparked renewed calls for justice reform. Thaksin, a former owner of Manchester City Football Club, is the head of a famed political dynasty that has dominated Thai politics for the past two decades, boasting two former prime ministers. Even today, Pheu Thai \u2014 the latest party of the powerful Shinawatra clan \u2014 is in government after entering into a ruling coalition with its former military rivals following the May 2023 election. Thaksin\u2019s daughter Paetongtarn is leader of the party. Return from exile Thaksin\u2019s return to Thailand reintroduced a towering and divisive figure to\u00a0Thailand\u00a0at a tense political time. Since his release from detention, Thaksin has traveled the country making a series of public appearances, including to his hometown of Chiang Mai where his support base is concentrated. Throughout his time in power, Thaksin was hugely popular with Thailand\u2019s rural and working class but his policies were loathed by rich elites and conservatives who accused him of being a dangerous and corrupt populist. During his physical absence from the country, he retained an outsized influence on Thai politics and has remained at the center of the country\u2019s tumultuous and often violent political landscape. Thaksin has denied that he remains behind the scenes pulling the strings and insisted he returned to Thailand because he wants to enjoy his retirement and spend time with his family. Some analysts suggest Thaksin sees himself as an \u201celder statesman\u201d figure and that his old adversaries in the establishment still consider him a threat. \u201cThe charge is politically driven, there\u2019s no other way to put it,\u201d said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University. \u201cThey see him as a threat. He didn\u2019t serve a day in jail which caused consternation because it was a double standard, and he wields influence over the Pheu Thai party in government.\u201d Thailand\u2019s Constitutional Court last week accepted a petition seeking to remove Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office over his appointment of a Cabinet member, a lawyer and close Thaksin aide who had served jail time. Pichit Chuenban was jailed for six months in 2008 for contempt of court after trying to bribe Supreme Court officials in a land case involving Thaksin. Thitinan said the two cases are connected, and the lese majeste charge was a \u201cway to keep Thaksin in line.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an indictment and a reminder to Thaksin of who has real power in Thailand,\u201d he said. Calls for reform For years,\u00a0human rights organizations\u00a0and free speech campaigners have said lese majeste has been used as a\u00a0political tool\u00a0to silence critics of the Thai government. And rights groups say the right to freedom of expression in Thailand has come under increased attack since nationwide 2020 youth-led protests that saw millions of young people take to the streets calling for constitutional and democratic reforms \u2013 for the first time, openly criticizing the monarchy and publicly questioning its power and wealth. Those protests came four years after King Maha Vajiralongkorn succeeded his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej who had reigned for seven decades. Despite the change from a military-backed government to civilian leadership last year, surveillance and intimidation against activists and students continues, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. The legal advocacy group said that since the start of those protests in July 2020 and up until March 2024, at least 1,954 people have been prosecuted or charged for their participation in political assemblies and for speaking out, with 286 of those cases involving children. A push to reform the lese majeste laws gained significant traction ahead of the 2023 general election, which saw the progressive Move Forward Party win the most votes. The party was ultimately blocked from forming a government over its reform agenda, and later the Constitutional Court ruled Move Forward violated the constitution through its campaign to amend the lese majeste law and ordered it to stop all related activities.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/asia/thailand-indicts-thaksin-shinawatra-lese-majeste-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) said the new record was measured in the suburb of Mungeshpur, surpassing Delhi\u2019s previous high of 49.2 degrees Celsius (120.5 degrees Fahrenheit), observed in May 2022. Some areas of Delhi are struggling to access water, while others have none at all, said Atishi Marlena Singh, a senior minister in the Delhi government, at a news conference. Areas that normally receive water supplies twice a day will now have their delivery cut to once a day to redirect resources to areas that have had little to no supply at all, Singh said. The water shortages were caused by the \u201cacute heatwave,\u201d as well as a lack of water deliveries from the northern state of Haryana to Delhi, which are not being made as usual, Singh said. Delhi was not alone, as the mercury spiked across northwestern India. The temperature in the city of Churu in the state of Rajasthan soared to 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit). Sirsa, a city in the state of Haryana, saw thermometers reach 50.3 degrees Celsius (122.5 degrees Fahrenheit), Indian authorities said. Heatwave conditions will prevail in Delhi on Wednesday but are expected to subside starting Thursday, the IMD said. Extreme heat is becoming more common and intense in much of the world because of the human-caused climate crisis. India is particularly vulnerable to extreme heat and some places there are pushing the limits of human survivability, experts say. One study found that heat waves have killed more than 24,000 people in the country since 1992.

While polling can be challenging in South Africa, most analysts believe that the ANC faces its stiffest challenge yet with a population deeply frustrated by the country\u2019s direction. If support for the ANC drops below 50% for the first time, the party will be forced to enter into a coalition government. ANC leader and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called Wednesday\u2019s vote \u201cone of the most important elections in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d while addressing a crowd of thousands at Soweto\u2019s FNB soccer stadium on Saturday. \u201cOur people will decide whether our country continues moving forward with the ANC towards a better, brighter future or backwards to a terrible past,\u201d Ramaphosa said. The South African leader, who cast his ballot at a polling station in Soweto, told reporters on Wednesday that he has \u201cno doubt whatsoever\u201d that voters will again trust in the ANC. \u201cThis is the day when South Africa decides, decides on the future of our country, (on) who should lead the government of South Africa, and I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart of hearts that the people will once again invest confidence in the African National Congress to continue to lead this country,\u201d Ramaphosa\u00a0said. South Africa is the most unequal country in the world, according to the World Bank. Citizens are also contending with the highest sustained rate of unemployment in the world, rampant corruption, feeble economic growth, crippling power cuts and\u00a0rising violent crime. Black South Africans, who make up 81% of the population, are at the sharp end of this dire situation. Unemployment and poverty remain concentrated in the Black majority, in large part due to the\u00a0failure of public schooling, while most White South Africans have jobs and command considerably higher wages. Voters in Johannesburg told CNN they headed to vote shortly after polls opened at 7 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) on Wednesday, and many expressed their hopes that the country would move in a different direction. \u201cWe want to see the change,\u201d said Sydney Radebe. \u201cThis is a rich country but people don\u2019t have anything,\u201d the 66-year-old actor and filmmaker added. \u201cWe don\u2019t have land, we don\u2019t have property\u2026 you cannot own nothing and say you are \u2018free.\u2019\u201d Radebe was among the first early morning voters at one of the biggest polling stations in Johannesburg. On a crisp morning as the Southern Hemisphere heads into winter, the line of voters gradually began to grow inside Joubert Park. Events worker Newton Ugboh, 20, was voting for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m looking for change so I came early in the morning,\u201d he said. Ugboh said that some of his friends didn\u2019t want to vote as \u201cthey think things aren\u2019t going to change at all,\u201d but that there are \u201cbig issues\u201d facing young people in the country. The \u201cunemployment rate is crazy,\u201d he said, adding that it\u2019s a \u201cbig-time struggle to find work, most of my friends are unemployed.\u201d Healthcare worker Roselyne Tswakae, 46, said she\u2019s worried about the future of South Africa\u2019s youth and also believes \u201cit\u2019s time for change.\u201d \u201cYoung South Africans were promised that education would be the key to success, they went to university but they are unemployed and often end up getting involved in drugs, drinking, smoking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are hoping for the light,\u201d Tswakae added. Land surveyor David Ngobeni, 31, also said \u201cthere isn\u2019t much hope\u201d for young people in South Africa. He says unemployment, inflation, crime and corruption are the \u201cbig issues facing everyone right now.\u201d \u201cIf you have a job, you are very lucky,\u201d Ngobeni told CNN. He added that he hopes the outcome of this election will lead to inflation going down and boost the economy. At the very end of a long line in Joubert Park was 40-year-old Ncumisa Xabanisa. She said she has been voting for the same party since 1994 and is very loyal to the ANC. \u201cit\u2019s only one party for me, it\u2019s from home, it\u2019s from my grandmother, I grew up knowing them,\u201d Xabanisa told CNN. She said the major problem the country is facing is a lack of jobs. \u201cSome of us we went to school, we graduated but we have the certificates like it\u2019s a display. It\u2019s hurting.\u201d The mother-of-two added that she is educated but is currently sitting at home most of the time, and sells plastic food containers to make a living. There are 52 parties on this election\u2019s national ballot, including new parties formed by previous ANC members such as former President Jacob Zuma\u2019s uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK). Zuma was forced to\u00a0resign as president in 2018\u00a0and served a brief stint in jail in 2021 for contempt of court. The 82-year-old was barred from running for parliament last week after the country\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled that five years must have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. However, his party will still contest the election and his face will remain on the ballot. Capping off a heated few months of election campaigning, many of the largest parties held their final rallies this weekend, including the Democratic Alliance (DA), the official opposition party. \u201cOn Wednesday, the ANC will lose the outright majority it has abused for decades to subject the people of this country to unemployment, corruption and misrule\u2026 we close the ANC chapter of our history,\u201d DA leader John Steenhuisen told supporters in the town of Benoni, east of Johannesburg. The DA has formed a coalition bloc with smaller opposition parties called the Multi-Party Charter. This is the seventh general election South Africa has held since the end of white minority rule 30 years ago. A record 27.79 million people are registered to vote \u2013 the highest number to date, according to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC.) The country\u2019s electoral commission (IEC) said that, by 11 a.m. in South Africa, a \u201csignificant majority\u201d of voters had already cast their ballots, as lines to vote had formed before the polls opened. \u201cThis, we think, is testament to the enthusiasm of South Africans to record their political choice,\u201d the IEC\u2019s deputy CEO Masego Sheburi added during a briefing at the National Results Center. Sheburi said that some voting stations opened late, but by midday \u201cgood progress\u201d was made with \u201cminimal incidences\u201d across the country. One of the issues some polling stations faced was late delivery of ballot papers, mainly in the Johannesburg area, according to the IEC.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/africa/south-africa-elections-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "travel_time-out-best-food-cities-2024", "text": "Some travelers pick a city break based on the destination\u2019s cultural offerings \u2013 shortlisting the best museums and galleries to visit. Others eye up cities with buzzy nightlife or opt for a destination hosting a festival or event. But for many vacationers, the most exciting part of any trip is the food. These are the travelers that wake up on the first day of the trip excited for all the culinary delights awaiting them: from sprawling markets offering local delicacies, to late-night street food, to independent restaurants serving distinctive dishes you won\u2019t forget any time soon. It\u2019s these gourmand travelers Time Out had in mind when the global media organization put together a new ranking of the world\u2019s best foodie cities. \u201cFood is everything when traveling,\u201d Grace Beard, Time Out\u2019s travel editor told CNN Travel. \u201cA good (or bad) meal can make or break a trip \u2013 it\u2019s usually one of the things we remember most.\u201d Coming in at number one on Time Out\u2019s list is the Italian city of Naples, the oft-rumored birthplace of pizza. Unsurprisingly, the cheesy delights of pizza margherita gets a shout out in Time Out\u2019s list as the city\u2019s \u201cmust-eat dish\u201d \u2013 but sumptuous pasta dish Neapolitan rag\u00f9 and sweet sfogliatella are also namechecked. To compile the round-up, Time Out surveyed thousands of citydwellers across the globe, quizzing these locals on the food options in their city, with a focus on quality and affordability. Time Out editors sifted through the results, including the highest-scoring city for each country in the resulting ranking. Pizza and more For travelers keen to sample authentic pizza in Naples, Time Out suggests heading to pizzeria Santa Maradona, located in the city\u2019s Spanish quarter. Santa Maradona\u2019s owner Andrea Viviani told CNN Travel it was a \u201cpleasure\u201d to be spotlighted by Time Out, although he added that \u201cconsidering Naples only as a food destination is truly a waste.\u201d \u201cFood is certainly an important part of our culture, but Naples is much, much more,\u201d said Viviani. \u201cThe idea of Santa Maradona is precisely this: to convey all the facets of Naples.\u201d Viviani\u2019s restaurant, he explained, is a celebration not just of pizza \u2013 but also football. It\u2019s named in honor of Argentinian soccer player Diego Armando Maradona, who played for the Naples team in the 1980s. While Viviani hopes travelers coming to Naples will enjoy more than just the food, he added that it\u2019s exciting that many travelers come to the city with \u201ca great desire to learn about our tradition and taste our fantastic pizzas.\u201d At number two on Time Out\u2019s list is the South African city of Johannesburg, with Time Out quoting Johannesburg food writer Thando Moleketi-Williams, who recommends the central neighborhood of Braamfontein and spots including wine bar Mamakashaka and Friends on De Beer Street, and restaurant and gallery space Artivist. Time Out declares the city\u2019s must-eat dish is kota sandwich, a stuffed bread featuring tasty ingredients such as potato chips, sausage, egg or cheese, and also spotlights bunny chow, a South African street food featuring curry, meat or beans stuffed inside bread. And rounding out Time Out\u2019s top three is Lima, Peru, where Time Out recommends visitors try signature dishes ceviche and arroz con pollo (chicken and rice). The city\u2019s Central restaurant, recently named as number one in the 2023 World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants awards, naturally gets a mention too. Prioritizing affordability Other cities on the list include Ho Chi Minh City (number four), Beijing (number five) and Bangkok (number six). The commonality between all the cities on the list is they\u2019re \u201cundergoing a culinary renaissance\u201d or they\u2019re \u201cparticularly buzzing right now, according to Time Out\u2019s Grace Beard. Beard told CNN Travel that \u201caffordability played as much a role as quality in creating this ranking\u201d and the editors were looking for cities \u201cwhere good-quality meals are accessible to travelers on every budget.\u201d The top US city on Time Out\u2019s ranking was Portland, Oregon \u2013 at number 10. According to Time Out, Portland is another must-visit spot for pizza lovers, with Mexican pizza \u2013 a pizza topped with taco ingredients \u2013 was named by locals as the city\u2019s best-value dish. In the UK, the city of Liverpool just missed out on a spot on Time Out\u2019s top 10, coming in at number 11. Time Out shouted out the city\u2019s signature city dish of Scouse \u2013 a rich stew usually comprised of beef or lamb \u2013 and what Liverpool-based writer Alice Porter calls a \u201cclutch of brand new foodie ventures,\u201d such as Manifest, a restaurant named in the Michelin Guide.

{"id": "2024_05_29_americas_mexico-female-president-violence-miltiarization-intl-latam", "text": "Claudia Sheinbaum was campaigning for president in southern Mexico when hooded men approached her car, filming\u00a0the interaction\u00a0as they implored her to keep their town from being taken over by gangs. One man said he felt helpless, and that the government had \u201cnever done anything for these lands.\u201d They lived in Chiapas, Mexico\u2019s poorest state and an\u00a0increasingly\u00a0important territory for criminal organizations moving illegal drugs, firearms and migrants from\u00a0neighboring Guatemala.\u00a0Sheinbaum thanked the men, shaking one of their hands before her car pulled away. The former Mexico City mayor\u00a0is the frontrunner in a landmark election\u00a0this weekend\u00a0where Mexico is all but certain to emerge with its first female president \u2013 a remarkable achievement in a country known for its patriarchal culture and high rates of gender-based violence, where\u00a0around 10 women\u00a0are murdered every day. Sheinbaum is riding on a wave of popularity\u00a0with the support\u00a0of her long-time ally, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and their leftist Morena party. Trailing her in the polls is former senator Xochitl G\u00e1lvez, from the conservative PAN party, who is representing a coalition of\u00a0opposition parties. But what should have been celebrated as a ground-breaking election\u00a0has become overshadowed by the bloodiest election campaign\u00a0in Mexico\u2019s history,\u00a0and ongoing high levels of violence across the country. At least\u00a034 political candidates or applicants have been murdered\u00a0since\u00a0June 2023\u00a0as gangs try and influence those coming into power, according to a report by research group Laboratorio Electoral, which also found hundreds of attacks on candidates and people related to the current electoral process. And while\u00a0the murder rate has fallen in Mexico\u00a0between 2019 and 2022, in absolute numbers the country is still reeling from historically high levels of homicides of around 30,000 people\u00a0murdered\u00a0each year, say experts. The central challenge for the next president will be\u00a0convincing voters that she can end the near-certain impunity in Mexico;\u00a0around 95%\u00a0of all crimes nationwide\u00a0went unsolved\u00a0in the country in\u00a02022, according to think tank\u00a0Mexico Evalua. \u201cMexico is a country where more than nine out of 10 crimes committed against the population go unpunished,\u201d Stephanie Brewer, Mexico Director at the Washington Office for Latin America (WOLA), told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a country with low levels of reporting of crimes due largely to distrust in authorities, lack of faith in investigations, which can be very well founded.\u201d \u2018Paradoxical\u2019 Mexico is a world leader when it comes to gender equality in elected office, which was cemented in 2019 constitution\u00a0reform.\u00a0It\u00a0outflanks\u00a0several countries in\u00a0terms of women\u2019s\u00a0parliamentary representation. Yet Mexico remains a dangerous place to be a woman, with\u00a0sky-high femicide\u00a0rates for\u00a0the region.\u00a0The most\u00a0recent data\u00a0from Mexico\u2019s\u00a0National Institute of Statistics and Geography found that at least 11,852 femicides were recorded in the first three years of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s presidency \u2013 higher than the 7,439 reported during the same period of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s presidency (2012-2018). With security topping voter concerns, both Sheinbaum and G\u00e1lvez have largely remained coy about their proposals. Neither\u00a0has\u00a0repudiated a nearly two-decades-long approach of relying on the armed forces to tackle organized crime \u2013 which\u00a0has coincided with\u00a0historically high levels of homicides. Sheinbaum, a former climate scientist, has pledged to continue with her predecessor\u2019s policies. She has pointed to her record as Mexico City mayor, with her team indicating having improved conditions for police and better intelligence gathering about criminal networks. Galvez has been critical of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s non-confrontational approach to cartels. She has suggested\u00a0pulling forces back from\u00a0domestic security\u00a0roles, increasing the number of police in violent areas, and building a new high\u00a0security prison. \u201cIn 2018, millions of Mexicans voted for change with hope, but the truth is that it did not happen,\u201d\u00a0G\u00e1lvez\u00a0said during a presidential debate in April, taking aim at the incumbent\u2019s approach to tackling organized crime. \u201cClaudia Sheinbaum is offering to continue the hugs for criminals \u2026 I am offering to build a Mexico where we can end violence, but above all, to bet on health and education.\u201d Both have spoken of the need to strengthen police and civilian institutions, and better use intelligence and coordination. \u201cBut the extent to which either one of them really means to emphasize or follow through on that is very unclear,\u201d Brewer said. Experts have been underwhelmed by the lack of new approaches to the security situation, saying there is a connection between militarization and more bloodshed in the country since its inception\u00a0in\u00a02006,\u00a0when former President Felipe Calder\u00f3n declared an all-out-war against criminal groups. \u201cMexico cannot deploy its way out of problems like impunity or corruption in institutions or lack of effective criminal investigation,\u201d\u00a0Brewer\u00a0told CNN. \u201cMilitarization simply is not a tool that could ever do that.\u201d \u2018Hugs, not bullets\u2019 Incumbent L\u00f3pez Obrador won the presidency in 2018 on a platform of demilitarizing the country\u2019s war against drug cartels,\u00a0vowing\u00a0to restore peace with \u201chugs, not bullets.\u201d Popular social welfare programs would address the root causes of economic insecurity, instead of violent confrontations with criminal groups,\u00a0he promised. It was a strategy that saw the son of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d\u00a0Guzman released\u00a0on the orders of L\u00f3pez Obrador in 2019\u00a0to avoid bloodshed.\u00a0He was later re-arrested and extradited to the US. However,\u00a0he never really de-militarized public security.\u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador instead merged several law-enforcement agencies, such as the federal police, to create the\u00a0National Guard\u00a0that was,\u00a0in principle, to be under civilian command. But\u00a0he soon after\u00a0placed\u00a0the\u00a0body under the Secretary of Defense, sparking criticism across the political spectrum,\u00a0which said\u00a0it was furthering\u00a0militarization\u00a0in Mexico. The Supreme Court upheld an opposition complaint and ordered L\u00f3pez Obrador to return the National Guard to civilian jurisdiction. He said he would follow suit, but the National Guard still reports to the Secretary of Defense. This creation was part of what\u00a0Brewer described as a \u201cpopulist\u2026and highly visible measure that\u201d\u00a0intended to give\u00a0the perception that something is being done about crime. The National Guard has gone on to take\u00a0over several civilian\u00a0functions including building infrastructure projects and airport management \u00ad\u2013 a situation ripe for corruption, warn Mexico watchers. Meanwhile,\u00a0criminal groups have only expanded\u00a0their reach. A May report by the Crisis Group documented limited crime-fighting where there were large military deployments in areas most affected by warring cartels. Instead, the report found that \u201ca set of largely unspoken rules has been established, encouraging illegal groups to reduce and conceal the violence they perpetrate,\u201d the report wrote. \u201cIn exchange, authorities have turned a blind eye to a degree of illegality, enabling these organisations to diversify their trafficking operations (including into newer illicit drugs such as fentanyl), expand their extortion rackets, branch out into legal business, and assume greater control of communities and local governments.\u201d This may have distorted official statistics around homicides, Falko Ernst, a senior analyst on Mexico at the Crisis Group who led the report, told CNN. \u201cBut what we have seen in a number of high conflict states is that while official murders have dropped, disappearances have gone up, even the official ones, so that puts another question mark behind the drop in homicides,\u201d he said. The report found there was also political pressure to reduce the recorded rate of lethal violence has led to \u201cmurders being logged under other causes of death or going unrecorded.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Mexican Secretary of Defence for comment. There is a through line between militarization and gender-based violence in Mexico, say experts. Feminist groups in the country began documenting a \u201cdramatic increase in women being killed by firearms\u201d after 2007 as well as women being targeted in the public sphere,\u201d said\u00a0Gema Kloppe-Santamar\u00eda, assistant professor of Latin American History at George Washington University. Female homicides often fail to get prosecuted, with 88.6% impunity rate for femicide cases, according to Mexico Evalua. Both candidates have recognized the crisis of femicide, but Sheinbaum, who holds a sizeable polling lead against Galvaz, has a tense relationship with some feminists \u201cwho encountered lots of repression by Mexico City police under the purview of Sheinbaum,\u201d said Kloppe-Santamar\u00eda. Sheinbaum has touted her efforts for women and girls, saying there was \u201czero impunity\u201d to femicides in Mexico City during her time as leader, and that there was a large reduction in femicides under her watch. Though the claims have\u00a0not\u00a0borne out\u00a0after some scrutiny, say critics. Amid ongoing \u201cgender-based violence, including femicides and disappearances,\u201d Kloppe-Santamar\u00eda said, getting a female president at this moment feels\u00a0\u201cvery paradoxical.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/americas/mexico-female-president-violence-miltiarization-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

In the videos, horse-mounted police and water cannons can be seen in Tel Aviv\u2019s Democracy Square attempting to disperse crowds refusing to leave, resulting in violent clashes. At a separate protest, police said they arrested two people \u201cfor disorderly conduct\u201d after they allegedly left the approved demonstration site at the Kaplan intersection, headed to the Azrieli intersection and \u201clit fires and began to break the order, not obeying the police\u2019s instructions.\u201d \u201cA police officer declared the demonstration illegal and warned that if they did not disperse the police would be forced to use measures,\u201d police added in a statement. The clashes followed anti-government protest marches that took place in several cities across Israel, calling for the release of hostages taken during Hamas\u2019 surprise attack on Israel on Oct 7, and for a general election. Around 250 people\u00a0were taken hostage during\u00a0Hamas\u2019 surprise October 7 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli officials. Since then, Israel\u2019s retaliatory war on Hamas in Gaza has killed\u00a0more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. Many of the protesters in the streets of Tel Aviv, Haifa, Rehovot and beyond on Saturday took aim at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing his government of corruption and criticizing his handling of the war against Hamas. Families of current and past hostages also held a rally calling for an immediate resumption of negotiations with Hamas to \u201cadvance a deal that will bring them all back.\u201d Israel\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) believes 125 hostages are still being held in Gaza, following the release deal in November that freed more than 100. Of those still in Gaza, 121 were kidnapped on Oct 7; the four others were already being held before the attacks. The PMO believes that at least 37 of the hostages still in the Gaza Strip are dead.

{"id": "2024_05_28_weather_texas-southern-plains-storm-forecast-tuesday", "text": "At least one person has been killed and more than 600,000 customers in Texas remained without power Tuesday night as powerful storms delivered another round of violent weather to a state still reeling from an almost unrelenting parade of destructive and deadly storms in recent weeks. Storms unloaded hurricane-force wind gusts across the Dallas area Tuesday and later tore through Houston in the afternoon, where the city\u2019s George Bush Intercontinental Airport recorded a wind gust of 75 mph. Roughly 40 miles northwest of Houston, one person died after a house under construction collapsed in a subdivision in Magnolia, the city\u2019s fire officials said. The victim \u2013 described as a \u201cjuvenile male\u201d by the Magnolia Fire Department \u2013 was removed from a debris pile by firefighters and pronounced dead. Magnolia Fire Department Division Chief Jason Herrman confirmed to CNN the home\u2019s collapse was related to a Tuesday thunderstorm with \u201csignificant winds.\u201d Videos captured across Houston and Dallas communities revealed scenes of disaster and flooding Tuesday. Footage from north Dallas obtained by CNN showed multiple cars stranded in a flooded roadway, surrounded by frequent lightning as the rain continued. In other communities, powerful winds ripped out trees and forced them onto homes and knocked down neighborhood fences, leaving communities in disarray. The power outages started to ramp up early Tuesday morning in the Dallas area, then extended south with the storms as they roared across the state, according to PowerOutage.us. Hundreds of thousands of outages were in Dallas County, where officials issued a disaster declaration and warned outages could last for days. READ: White House announcing action to modernize electric grid and pave the way for fewer outages These storms have arrived even as some residents are still mourning at least seven people killed in the state during\u00a0violent storms over Memorial Day weekend. In total, at least two dozen people, including four children, were killed across six states as storms hit the central US over the holiday period, and several communities are grappling with significant losses of homes and businesses. Sunday was the busiest severe weather day of the year so far, with more than 600 reports of strong winds or hail across more than 20 states, including gusts over 75 mph and hail the size of softballs. Twenty-six tornado reports also were made in 10 states. Storms turned homes and businesses into piles of rubble, flung cars and brought down power lines. Parts of Texas and extreme western Louisiana faced Tuesday\u2019s most serious threat of severe weather. Large hail, lightning and wind gusts as strong as 80 mph were the main threats with any storm. A few tornadoes were also possible, according to the National Weather Service. The weather also spelled misery for hundreds of travelers. More than 600 flights flying in and out of the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and the Dallas Love Field Airport have been canceled \u2013 and more than 900 flights in and out of the two airports have been delayed, according to FlightAware data. More than 75 flights in and out of Houston\u2019s William P. Hobby Airport and George Bush Intercontinental Airport have been canceled, while more than 530 have been delayed. Power outages could last days in Dallas It could take days to fully restore power in the Dallas-Fort Worth area after violent storms unleashed hurricane-force wind gusts Tuesday morning. Dallas is the second major Texas city to have critical power infrastructure damaged by severe weather in less than two weeks. \u201cThis, unfortunately, will be a multi-day power outage situation, similar to the one that (occurred) in Harris County and Houston,\u201d Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins cautioned during a news conference Tuesday. A derecho and tornado in mid-May blasted 100 mph wind gusts through the Houston metro, killing multiple people and knocking out power for days. The full extent of damage to power infrastructure in the Dallas area is still being assessed, but the current prognosis is concerning, according to Grant Cruise, a spokesperson for Oncor \u2014 the state\u2019s largest utility company. \u201cWe did have a significant number of downed lines because of this weather event,\u201d Cruise said during Tuesday\u2019s news conference. \u201cIn many cases it\u2019s not going to be simple repairs, we\u2019re looking at complete reconstruction for parts of our area.\u201d The storm damage prompted Jenkins to issue a disaster declaration for Dallas County. The outages come as some Texans head to the polls Tuesday for primary runoff elections. More than a third of Dallas County\u2019s polling places were without power Tuesday afternoon, according to Jenkins. Summerlike heat will ease in Texas this week, but those left without power or a reliable way to cool down could still face the risk of dangerous heat stroke or heat exhaustion.

{"id": "2024_05_29_europe_ukraine-war-us-tanks-intl", "text": "Ukrainian crews working on US-supplied Abrams tanks have told CNN of a series of the weaknesses and flaws\u00a0with the armored vehicles, calling into doubt their utility on\u00a0the war\u2019s\u00a0ever-changing frontlines.\u00a0The donation was announced by US President Joe Biden as evidence of the United States\u2019\u00a0\u201cenduring and unflagging commitment to Ukraine.\u201d CNN\u00a0journalists\u00a0were the first reporters to see the M1 Abrams in Ukraine, at a location in the\u00a0country\u2019s\u00a0east, where around six vehicles were visible, hiding in the foliage. Crews trained in Germany said the vehicles\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the US military\u2019s main $10\u00a0million\u00a0battle tank used in Iraq against Saddam\u00a0Hussein\u2019s\u00a0forces and insurgents \u2013 lacked armor that could stop modern weapons. \u201cIts armor is not sufficient for this moment,\u201d said one crew member, callsign Joker. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t protect the crew. For real, today this is the war of drones. So now, when the tank rolls out, they always try to hit\u00a0them.\u201d His colleague, Dnipro, added they are the \u201cnumber one target.\u201d \u201cWithout defense, the crew doesn\u2019t survive at the battlefield,\u201d\u00a0he said. The crew showed CNN their attempts to affix\u00a0active armor to one damaged tank.\u00a0They used\u00a0plates of plastic explosive that,\u00a0when hit by a round,\u00a0detonate and provide a protective counter-blast. All 31 Abrams deployed to Ukraine are engaged near the frontline in the east, according to officials in the 47th Mechanised Brigade, who took receipt of them all. The Ukrainian request for Abrams, complex and heavy tanks, sparked significant debate in early 2023, as the American vehicle has a complex supply chain.\u00a0Some versions even run\u00a0on jet fuel. Pentagon officials said in April that the Abrams were pulled back from the frontline due to the threat of Russian attack drones, although the 47th said some were still in action, despite the deficiencies that had\u00a0materialized. Much of the Ukrainian frontline is now dominated by the use of self-destructing attack drones, tiny and accurate devices that can swarm infantry and even cause significant damage to tanks. The advent of these so called First-Person Vision (FPV) drones, flown by soldiers wearing gaming goggles, has changed the nature of the war, limiting movement and introducing a new element of vulnerability to\u00a0armored\u00a0vehicles. This Ukrainian crew have learned of the Abrams\u2019 limitations the hard way, in pitched battles around the town of Avdiivka, which Russia finally took control of in February. A driver lost a leg when the\u00a0armor\u00a0was penetrated. Yet it is not just innovation that is hamstringing the tanks\u00a0\u2014\u00a0they appear to have technical issues too. One, parked under a tree, was almost immobile during CNN\u2019s visit, due to an engine problem, the crew say, despite the vehicle having just been shipped in from Poland. They also complain of how, in rain or fog, condensation can fry the electronics inside the vehicle. CNN has reached out to the Pentagon for comment. Ammunition is also a problem, like elsewhere on the Ukrainian frontline. They say they seem to have the wrong type for the fight they are in. \u201cWhat we have is more for direct tank-to-tank fights, which happens very rarely,\u201d Joker said. \u201cMuch more often we work as artillery. You need to take apart a tree-line or a building. We had a case when we fired 17 rounds into a house and it was still standing.\u201d The tank\u2019s poor performance has been mocked by Russian analysts, dubbing them \u201cempty tin cans.\u201d One model was captured by Russian forces and, damaged, paraded in Red Square. The Ukrainian crew expressed frustration the tanks were made for a NATO style of warfare, in which air power and artillery prepare the battlefield before tanks and infantry advance. Kyiv has long bemoaned its lack of artillery and air power. \u201cThey would never do it,\u201d Joker said, of NATO soldiers undertaking the same advances they make without air support. He switched to English to mimic a NATO soldier: \u201c\u2018Call the aviation, call the artillery,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no aviation and artillery. We have only tank. And it\u2019s the problem.\u201d A spokesperson for the Ukrainian defense ministry told CNN that \u201cUkraine is now testing and improving equipment that was not initially prepared for our war.\u201d \u201cWe are asking all countries to support us with equipment of any technical capacity levels. We use all of it accordingly,\u201d the spokesperson added. Biden\u2019s decision to supply the Abrams came after European allies pledged to send their own battle tanks in early 2023 ahead of Ukraine\u2019s failed summer counteroffensive last year, a step that had been deemed unthinkable months earlier. Kyiv\u2019s allies have slowly swallowed the red lines of what equipment they once refused to supply. F-16s may arrive in Ukraine in the months ahead. Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine\u2019s military commander, on Monday said he had signed initial paperwork to permit France to send military trainers into the country to try and reverse an\u00a0urgent manpower problem on the frontlines. France\u2019s\u00a0defense ministry\u00a0declined to\u00a0confirm the plan, but said it, and other ideas, had long been under discussion. The move would mark a significant escalation in the West\u2019s involvement in the war, now in its third year. The Ukrainian defense ministry later appeared to tamp down those expectations, saying in a statement to CNN that it had \u201cstarted internal paperwork to move forward when the decision is taken.\u201d For the Abrams crew, each delay in equipment or assistance costs the lives of friends. \u201cI only have one question,\u201d Joker said of US assistance. \u201cWhy is this taking so long and (comes) partially? We are losing time. It\u2019s death to us.\u201d Victoria Butenko contributed to this report.

The Justice Department, District of Columbia and 10 states involved in the lawsuit announced the proposed agreement with the NCAA on Thursday. The agreement would end the civil suit against the organization over their\u00a0transfer eligibility rule, which required student athletes who transferred more than once to sit on the bench for an entire season before being allowed to compete at their new school. Prosecutors said the rule forced college athletes to either stay in schools they wanted to leave or to transfer and miss out on athletic opportunities. The complaint also alleged the rule \u201cwas anticompetitive because it deterred college athletes from challenging anticompetitive rules in court,\u201d a news release from the Justice Department said. If approved by a judge, the deal would bar the NCAA from enforcing the transfer rule or adopting any similar rules between Division I colleges and universities in the future, the release said. It would also require the NCAA to issue an additional year of eligibility to certain qualifying college athletes who were previously deemed ineligible to play for any length of time because of the transfer rule. \u201cFree from anticompetitive rules that unfairly limit their mobility, Division I college athletes will now be able to choose the institutions that best meet their academic, personal and professional development needs,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter said in the release. \u201cThis resolution is a testament to the benefits of federal and state enforcers working together to ensure free markets and fair competition for all Americans.\u201d The NCAA\u2019s Division II also had a similar rule but revised it to remove the year requirement for transfers, according to the release.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/sport/ncaa-drop-transfer-rule-division-i-athletes-justice-department/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_28_europe_ukraine-french-weapons-russia-macron-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "France and Germany said Tuesday that Ukraine should be allowed to use their weapons against targets inside Russia from which Moscow attacks Ukraine. Speaking at a news conference alongside German Chancellor Olaf\u00a0Scholz on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron outlined that French weapons sent to Ukraine, including long-range missiles, were permitted to target bases inside Russia. \u201cUkrainian soil is being attacked from bases in Russia,\u201d Macron said during his visit to Schloss Meseberg in Brandenburg, Germany. \u201cSo how do we explain to the Ukrainians that we\u2019re going to have to protect these towns and basically everything we\u2019re seeing around Kharkiv at the moment, if we tell them you are not allowed to hit the point from which the missiles are fired?\u201d \u201cWe think that we should allow them to neutralize the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked,\u201d Macron continued. Macron added, however, that \u201cwe must not allow them to hit other targets in Russia,\u201d including civilian or other military targets. Germany\u2019s Scholz echoed Macron\u2019s comments and said that Ukraine was allowed to defend itself as long as it respected the conditions given by the countries that supplied the weapons - including the United States - and international law. \u201cUkraine has every possibility under international law for what it is doing. That has to be said explicitly,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cI find it strange when some people argue that it should not be allowed to defend itself and take measures that are suitable for this.\u201d Western allies of Ukraine have long held the policy that donated weapons should be strictly limited to usage inside Ukrainian territory. The issue is a controversial one, with fears from Western leaders that if their weaponry is used to strike inside Russia, it would escalate the violence and trigger a wider war involving NATO. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly asked permission from his allies to expand the usage of the provided weapons to strike inside Russia. The United States, the largest arms supplier to Ukraine, has previously forbidden Kyiv from firing its weapons inside Russian territory over escalation concerns. However, in comments that appeared to hint at the possibility of a change in policy, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that the US would continue to \u201cadapt and adjust\u201d its support for Ukraine. \u201cAnother hallmark of our support for Ukraine over the last two years has been to adapt as the conditions have changed. Battlefields change. As what Russia does has changed in terms of how it is pursuing its aggression escalation, we\u2019ve adapted and adjusted too. And I am confident we will continue to do that,\u201d he said when asked about the possibility of allowing Ukraine to strike Russian soil. But Blinken also reiterated that at present the US has not enabled Ukraine to strike beyond its borders into Russia with US weaponry. \u201cWe haven\u2019t encouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine. Ukraine, as I\u2019ve said before, has to make its own decisions about the best way to effectively defend itself. We\u2019re going to make sure that it has the equipment that it needs to do that,\u201d Blinken said. When pressed on his remarks about adjusting and adapting, he added, \u201cWe\u2019re always listening. We\u2019re always learning, and we\u2019re always making determinations about what\u2019s necessary to make sure that Ukraine can effectively continue to defend itself.\u201d Shift in red lines? Previous red lines drawn by Western leaders in their support for Ukraine have been crossed, including the provision of tanks, which was agreed in early 2023 to help Ukraine breach enemy defensive lines, and F-16 fighter jets, which European governments agreed to in the summer of 2023 after months of diplomatic pressure. France has supplied Ukraine with an unknown number of SCALP cruise missiles, according to the French Defense Ministry\u2019s website. The SCALP missiles have a range of up to 155 kilometers (96 miles) and carry a 400-kilogram (881-pound) high-explosive penetration warhead, according to the Missile Threat project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The SCALP is the equivalent of Britain\u2019s Storm Shadow, which has also been given to Ukraine, and which British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said earlier this month could be used at Kyiv\u2019s discretion. \u201cIn terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view it is their decision about how to use these weapons, they are defending their country, they were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps,\u201d Cameron said during a visit to Kyiv. \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss any caveats that we put on those things. But let\u2019s be absolutely clear: Russia has launched an attack\u00a0into Ukraine, and Ukraine absolutely has the right to strike back at Russia.\u201d France has also supplied Ukraine with a range of military weaponry, including Caesar self-propelled howitzers with a range of up to 42 kilometers. Macron stressed that the French arms are to be used only against targets from which attacks are launched into Ukraine. \u201cWe must not allow them to hit other targets in Russia,\u201d including civilian or other military targets, the French leader said. But Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed Ukraine could not use the long-range weapons without significant NATO support, and such involvement by the alliance could trigger \u201ca global conflict.\u201d For instance, \u201clong-range precision weapons cannot be used without space-based reconnaissance,\u201d Putin said Tuesday during a state visit to Uzbekistan. \u201cFinal target selection\u201d or \u201claunch mission\u201d for Western systems need to be made by \u201chighly skilled specialists who rely on this reconnaissance data,\u201d Putin said. \u201cSo, these officials from NATO countries, especially the ones based in Europe, particularly in small European countries, should be fully aware of what is at stake,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cThey should keep in mind that theirs are small and densely populated countries, which is a factor to reckon with before they start talking about striking deep into the Russian territory.\u201d Meanwhile, Ukraine got a key pledge of support on Tuesday from Belgium, which said it will supply Kyiv with 30 F-16 fighter jets in the next four years, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The deal was part of a bilateral security agreement signed between the two countries Tuesday in Brussels, according to the Ukrainian leader. The agreement includes at least $1.06 billion in Belgian military aid to Ukraine this year, with Belgium offering its long-term commitment to support Ukraine over the next 10 years, Zelensky detailed in a post on X. The first F-16 jets from Belgium will be delivered this year. \u201cThe agreement guarantees Belgium\u2019s timely security assistance, modern armored vehicles, equipment to meet Ukraine\u2019s air force and air defense needs, naval security, mine clearance, participation in the artillery ammunition coalition, and military training,\u201d Zelensky said. The meeting follows a similar agreement between Ukraine and Spain on Monday, with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announcing a $1.08 billion weapons deal for Ukraine. Alongside Belgium and Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Denmark, Finland and Canada have also signed security agreements.

{"id": "2024_05_25_uk_alderney-british-island-nazi-atrocities-intl-gbr", "text": "Alderney, a quiet British island in the English Channel known for its outstanding natural beauty, was once the site of the only Nazi camps\u00a0on British soil \u2013 and a hell on Earth for its thousands of inmates. A fresh inquiry, ordered by the UK\u2019s Special Envoy for Post Holocaust Issues,\u00a0Eric\u00a0Pickles, and led by a panel of experts, has sought to determine the exact death toll of prisoners and\u00a0laborers\u00a0on Alderney, while also bringing an end to the conspiracy theories and misinformation surrounding the island. The findings were published on Wednesday and determined there were a greater number of deaths than initially documented following liberation, but found no evidence of a \u201cmini-Auschwitz.\u201d The inquiry also explored why the Nazi perpetrators \u2013 most of whom evaded justice \u2013 never stood trial in Britain. Stretching for three square miles, the island was occupied by the Nazis for most of World War II. During that time, three forced\u00a0labor\u00a0camps and a concentration camp called Lager Sylt were built. Nearly eight decades later, the fingerprints of Nazi occupation are still visible on the picturesque island, including bunkers, anti-tank walls and the notorious Water Lane tunnels constructed by the occupying forces to store munitions and fuel. According to its tourist board, the residents of Alderney \u2013 which has a population of just over 2,000 \u2013 gather once a year in May for a memorial service to commemorate the island\u2019s victims. Described by Pickles as housing the \u201cmost westerly concentration camp in the Third Reich,\u201d questions over the scale of horror that occurred on the island have persisted among locals as well as internationally \u2013 and the exact number of dead has never been clear, until now. The Channel Islands were the only British land the Germans occupied during World\u00a0War II.\u00a0Unlike Jersey and Guernsey \u2013 the other Nazi-occupied islands \u2013 Alderney was evacuated of nearly all of its residents, meaning the island does not have extensive war-time records. According to Pickles, the lack of records has led to unsubstantiated claims being made about Alderney and the war crimes that took place there. \u201cClaims of mass murder that anywhere else would be checked carefully have been accepted at face value,\u201d\u00a0Pickles \u2013 who has stressed the importance of historic accuracy regarding the Holocaust \u2013 said. \u201cThird- or fourth-hand testimonies of atrocities, without any supporting evidence, are given as a\u00a0fact\u2026 What\u00a0happened on Alderney was bad enough with its brutality, sadism and murder, without the need for embellishment.\u201d \u2018Unvarnished truth\u2019 Following the island\u2019s liberation from the Nazis, official figures from a post-war investigation put the death toll at 389. This figure has long been disputed. Historians, members of the Jewish community and members of the public have estimates ranging from hundreds to several thousand. Speculation has also been rife that the true scale of what happened on the island may have been deliberately concealed by the British government. The inquiry denies such theories. It found that the number of deaths in Alderney is unlikely to have exceeded 1,134, with a more likely range of deaths being between 641 and 1,027. In addition, at least 97 people died and one disappeared during transit to and from the island. The estimated minimum number of prisoners or\u00a0laborers\u00a0sent to Alderney throughout the German occupation stands between 7,608 and 7,812, the panel found. Alderney\u2019s camps, according to the inquiry, shared many of the traits of those in mainland Europe.\u00a0Laborers\u00a0were kept in atrocious conditions and forced to work long hours carrying out dangerous construction work. They were subject to beatings, maiming,\u00a0torture and\u00a0in some cases executions. The inquiry found that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d for arguing that many thousands of victims died. Assertions that Alderney housed an extermination center and constituted a\u00a0\u201cmini-Auschwitz\u201d\u00a0are also untrue, the panel found. \u201cPrisoners were treated appallingly, and life was cheap, but Alderney did not house a \u2018mini-Auschwitz\u2019; there was no extermination centre on the island,\u201d\u00a0Pickles said. He added, \u201cAnyone who claims so has never visited Auschwitz or understood the extent of the Nazi\u2019s death factories in Eastern Europe.\u201d Pickles believes overestimated death tolls at the hands of the Nazis can be damaging and play into the hands of Holocaust deniers. \u201cAt a time when parts of Europe are seeking to rinse their history through the Holocaust, the British Isles must tell the unvarnished truth,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cNumbers do matter. It is as much of a Holocaust distortion to exaggerate the number of deaths as it is to underplay the numbers.\u201d He added, \u201cExaggeration plays into the hands of Holocaust deniers and undermines the six million dead. The truth can never harm us.\u201d \u2018Egregious injustice\u2019 A separate section of the inquiry focused on the failure to prosecute war crimes committed in Alderney, something that it described as an \u201cegregious injustice.\u201d This was due to the British government\u2019s decision to hand the case over to the Soviet Union after World\u00a0War II\u00a0as the majority of victims were Soviet citizens. Research conducted by Anthony Glees, an academic\u00a0and adviser to Pickles,\u00a0found there had been a \u201csuccession of cover-ups\u201d on the part of the British government, which handed all Alderney\u2019s files of evidence over to the Soviet Union via the United Nations War Crimes commission on September 12, 1945. From there, the USSR decided to \u201cdo nothing with the evidence,\u201d according to Glees, meaning that the majority of perpetrators who had systematically tortured and in some cases murdered their victims escaped trial. Glees believes that this has deliberately been hidden from public view by the British government. He is calling on the government to issue an apology. \u201cIt seems scarcely understandable that Britain, of all countries, declined to try Nazi war criminals for appalling atrocities committed on British soil against citizens of some 30 nations,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, the British authorities passed all the evidence that they had carefully collected in the so-called \u2018Alderney Case\u2019 to the\u00a0USSR\u2026\u00a0despite the USSR not having requested it and so, apparently, directly contravening Britain\u2019s international treaty obligations.\u201d According to Glee, the lack of trials of Alderney\u2019s war criminals has meant that justice was denied to victims and their families. Pickles, meanwhile, said the fact that the perpetrators never faced British justice is a \u201cstain on the reputations of successive British governments.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/uk/alderney-british-island-nazi-atrocities-intl-gbr/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}

With results in from 22% of polling stations at 4 p.m. local time, support for the ANC stood at 43.5%. The official opposition party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), had 24.7% of the vote, while the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) \u2013 a splinter party of the ANC \u2013 had 8.9%, data from the country\u2019s electoral commission showed. The respected research group CSIR modeled the ANC winning less than 45% of the national poll as of mid-morning on Thursday. Officials of the Independent Electoral Commission have stressed that the official tally could take several days and some larger voting wards could take more time to be tallied. In past elections, results from rural areas \u2013 where the ANC has major strongholds \u2013 have come in later, boosting results for the party. Once all the votes are counted, if the ANC remains below 50% it will be forced to enter a coalition with one or more parties. Depending on how low its support dips, it may need to form a deal with one of the larger opposition parties such as the DA or EFF to remain in power. Another ANC splinter party, the uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK), led by former President Jacob Zuma appears to be on course to do well in KwaZulu-Natal, the eastern coastal province where Durban is located. At 10am local time, it had 42.3% of the votes there compared to 20.1% for the ANC.

The authorities in the town of Platja d\u2019Aro, on Spain\u2019s Costa Brava and around 60 miles northeast of Barcelona, have introduced fines for anyone daring to go out in public in costumes depicting genitalia or carrying sex dolls. Individuals could be left with a $811 fine (\u20ac750) for \u201cwalking or standing on a street or public space without clothing, or only in underwear, or for wearing clothing or accessories that represent human genitals, or with dolls of a sexual nature,\u201d a city hall spokesman told CNN Thursday. Higher tolls of up to $1,620 (\u20ac1,500) could also be levied for anti-social behavior which causes more of a disturbance, though the exact nature of these offenses remains unclear. The new measures also prohibit going shirtless or venturing out in nothing more than a bikini in urban areas away from the beach, the spokesman added. They will come into effect around the end of June. Platja d\u2019Aro has a population of 12,500, but on summer weekends it can draw in around 150,000 visitors a day. The town council this week approved the new fines and said it would hire more police to enforce them. Police will issue a penalty, but alleged offenders could appeal and would not have to pay on the spot, the city hall spokesman said. At a press conference earlier this week, the city\u2019s police chief cited a recent celebration in which the groom was taped to a lamp post while his friends played loud music and sang late into the night, annoying local residents, the spokesman said. \u201cThese types of activities are not exclusive to Platja d\u2019Aro. Each town should decide how to change this situation,\u201d the spokesman added. The town\u2019s 48-member police force will get 12 additional officers during the six-month peak tourist season, which includes spring and early summer when there are many weddings - as well as the bachelor and bachelorette parties which precede them. Badly behaved visitors come from across Spain and beyond, according to the spokesman, who added that the town\u2019s permanent residents include citizens from 80 nationalities.

{"id": "2024_05_29_climate_orange-rivers-permafrost-alaska", "text": "Rivers and streams in Alaska are changing color \u2013 from a clean, clear blue to a rusty orange \u2013 because of the toxic metals released by thawing permafrost, according to a new study. The finding surprised researchers from the National Park Service, the University of California at Davis and the US Geological Survey, who conducted tests at 75 locations in the waterways of Alaska\u2019s Brooks Range. The rivers and streams in the range appeared to rust and became cloudy and orange over the past five to 10 years, according to the study published in the journal Communications: Earth & Environment. The discoloration and cloudiness are being caused by metals such as iron, zinc, copper, nickel and lead, the researchers found \u2013 some of which are toxic to the river and stream ecosystems \u2013\u00a0as permafrost thaws and exposes the waterways to minerals locked away underground for thousands of years. \u201cWe\u2019re used to seeing this in parts of California, parts of Appalachia where we have mining history. This is a classic process that happens in rivers here in the continental US that have been impacted for over 100 years since some of the mining rushes in the 1850s,\u201d said Brett Poulin, a co-author of the study and a professor of environmental toxicology at UC Davis. \u201cBut it\u2019s very startling to see it when you\u2019re on some of the most remote wilderness and you\u2019re far from a mine source.\u201d Arctic soils naturally contain organic carbon, nutrients and metals, such as mercury, within their permafrost, the study says. High temperatures have caused these minerals and the water sources around them to meet as permafrost melts. The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, studies have shown. \u201cWhat we believe we\u2019re seeing is this thawing of soil that\u2019s happening faster there than it would happen elsewhere,\u201d said Poulin. \u201cIt\u2019s really an unexpected consequence of climate change.\u201d Researchers used satellite imagery to determine when the change in color happened at different rivers and streams. \u201cAt several of the locations it happened, the most drastic increases were between 2017 and 2018 and they coincided with the warmest years on record at that point,\u201d said Poulin. This discoloration has been linked to \u201cdramatic declines\u201d in aquatic life, raising concerns about how the continued melting of permafrost will affect communities that rely on those waterways for drinking and fishing. In Alaska\u2019s Arctic rivers alone reside a variety of fish that are \u201ccritical for subsistence, sport, and commercial fisheries,\u201d researchers wrote. Poulin said local communities voiced their concerns and observations to study researchers beginning seven years ago. Alaska is not the only state experiencing this phenomenon. Another study, published just a month before researchers in Alaska made their findings public, details how Colorado\u2019s Rocky Mountains are seeing similar effects from, among other things, a warming climate. The study, published by Water Resources Research, notes an increase of metal concentrations \u2013 namely sulfate, zinc and copper \u2013 across 22 of Colorado\u2019s mountain streams in the past 30 years. Researchers found a reduced streamflow accounted for half of the increase, while the other half, they say, is from the thawing of frozen ground that allows for minerals to leach out of the bedrock. These studies have extended beyond the US in the past. Similar research on increases in metal and rare earth element concentrations in mountain rivers and streams has been done in the Chilean Andes, the European Alps and the Pyrenees in northern Spain. Although some of these areas have been exposed to mining sites and thus have seen metal concentrations in rivers and streams over the years, the noted increases raise questions about how climate change will continue to impact mountain water sources. Researchers in Alaska will continue their study in the coming years to determine the location of the metal and mineral sources, and how aquatic and human life will be impacted.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/29/climate/orange-rivers-permafrost-alaska/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_30_weather_hawaii-power-cuts-wildfires", "text": "The main power utility in Hawaii will cut off electricity to some areas in future extreme weather conditions to avoid another wildfire disaster, the state announced Wednesday. The Public Safety Power Shutoff program is in response to last year\u2019s fire that\u00a0killed more than 100 people in Lahaina\u00a0on the island of Maui and left $6 billion in damages. \u201cThis means they may turn off power in high-risk wildfire areas during extreme weather conditions,\u201d the Hawaii Division of Consumer advocacy said in a\u00a0public notice\u00a0Wednesday. \u201cWhile this may create hardships for affected customers, PSPS aims to prevent wildfires caused by downed power lines.\u201d The new program goes into effect July 1. Hawaiian Electric says\u00a0on its website\u00a0that \u201ca best-case scenario\u201d would allow them to give people 24-48 hours\u2019 notice before a shutdown.\u00a0According to the public notice,\u00a0residents would be notified of a potential shutoff through news releases, social media, outage maps or the Hawaiian Electric website. If weather changes suddenly, then a shutoff may occur with little or no notice. High wind and red flag warnings were issued by the National Weather Service on August 8, the day of the devastating Maui wildfires. But during the disaster,\u00a0the community\u2019s siren warning system did not sound. Investigations\u00a0by the state and the Western Fire Chiefs Association said the disaster was exacerbated by lack of preparation and coordination. Maui County\u2019s top emergency management official\u00a0resigned\u00a0days after defending the siren\u2019s silence, citing health reasons. Maui\u2019s government filed a lawsuit in August accusing Hawaiian Electric of causing the wildfires. The lawsuit alleged the electric company\u00a0\u201cinexcusably kept their power lines energized,\u201d despite the National Weather Service\u2019s warning that winds could knock down power lines and cause fires. The utility announced Wednesday it designated\u00a0high-risk areas\u00a0in three of the state\u2019s counties \u2013 including parts of the west coast of Oahu, its most populous island \u2013 where emergency power shutoffs are authorized in a weather emergency. Hawaiian Electric says\u00a0over 48,000 customers\u00a0are in the affected areas. \u201cThis is an action that is a last line of defense,\u201d said Hawaiian Electric vice president Jim Kelly at a news conference. Hawaii\u2019s new power shutoff program is based on a\u00a0similar program\u00a0that has been in place in California since 2012.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/30/weather/hawaii-power-cuts-wildfires/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_24_uk_prime-minister-rishi-sunak-election-intl", "text": "When British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced on Wednesday that the United Kingdom would hold a general election on July 4, many observers wondered: why now? More specifically, why has the PM called an election that is almost certain to lose? For months, polls have placed Sunak\u2019s Conservative Party way behind the opposition Labour Party and, as things stand, Labour leader Keir Starmer is set to not only win power but have a massive parliamentary majority. The answer to that question is simple: it\u2019s very unlikely there will be a better time. Almost everything Sunak tries seems to\u00a0backfire,\u00a0and it\u2019s not implausible that his favorability with the public will get even worse before the end of the year. The past couple of days have been relatively good for Sunak. The economy does seem to be recovering, with the\u00a0International Monetary Fund\u00a0(IMF) updating the UK\u2019s growth forecast and inflation finally returning to something resembling a normal level. Nothing went catastrophically wrong in the last week or so ahead of calling the election. It\u2019s a low bar, but since his time in office, right now he probably has the most stable base to launch a campaign that he\u2019s ever had or ever will have. As one key\u00a0adviser\u00a0to Sunak told CNN: \u201cThe PM came into office facing a series a key challenges: inflation, no growth, migration. And he saw dealing with those as his primary mission. And he\u2019s made genuine and significant progress on that. On Tuesday, the IMF upgraded our growth forecasts, yesterday we saw inflation back to normal levels, today we see migration falling as a result of our reforms. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got a solid foundation to say that things are going in the right direction, and the view was that now was the best time to go to the country and say \u2018here\u2019s what we\u2019ve done, our plan is working, now who do you think has the plan and the capacity to take the bold action to move this country forwards towards a more secure future.\u2019\u201d Sunak had to call the election before the end of this year, constitutionally speaking. The fact he hadn\u2019t until this week allowed his opponents to paint him as a coward, terrified of facing the public. It didn\u2019t help that the country has felt in need of an election for quite a long time, nor that the Conservative Party has looked from the outside like a basket case for a number of years. Their time in office didn\u2019t begin formidably. In 2010, after 13 years of Labour rule, David Cameron won the general election but didn\u2019t win a majority in parliament. He was forced to make a coalition government with the centrist Liberal Democrats. Cameron, against the odds, kept the coalition together until the 2015 election, at which he won a surprise majority and secured the first fully Conservative government since 1997. The celebrations didn\u2019t last long. Holding the 2016 Brexit referendum split his party in two and made governing nearly impossible for his four (yes,\u00a0four) successors. First up was Theresa May. A botched snap election and the inability to pass her Brexit deal because her party hated\u00a0it ended May\u2019s tenure, and she\u00a0was replaced by Boris Johnson in 2019. Johnson blew his own majority when he became so weighed down by scandal \u2013 including the notorious illegal parties in Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 he had to resign in 2022. Liz Truss took over for 45 days, in which time she managed to cause sufficient economic havoc that the pound sank to its lowest ever level against the dollar, interest rates spiked and inflation ballooned. Eventually, the Conservative Party had enough of the chaos and put Sunak in charge as a safe pair of hands. Whether or not he has been that\u00a0is up for debate. Despite what Conservative sources might say about his record in office, his dire poll ratings cannot be denied. His flagship immigration policy, which would see illegal migrants sent to Rwanda to have their asylum claims processed, has already cost millions despite the fact only one person \u2013 voluntarily and given money to do so \u2013 has made the trip. His world-leading smoking ban, which caused Sunak major embarrassment when his own MPs didn\u2019t approve it, has been shelved due to the election. These are just two recent examples of how things seem to go wrong for Sunak. But the most damaging issue around him is the general sense that he is a bit of a loser and that his own party has so little faith in him. No amount of facts, figures or soundbites can change that he has an undeniable stench of failure around him. The sense that something is inevitable is powerful in politics, and for Sunak, defeat seems inevitable. Of course, it isn\u2019t. There is a chance that the polls are misleading us, and there is a chance that the Conservative campaign will work. They are making it personal: a clear choice between Labour leader Starmer and Sunak. Conservatives claim\u00a0Starmer cannot be trusted on national security, is a shameless opportunist with no principles and has no plan. Right now is probably the best time to hammer that message home. Labour will have to rush out its manifesto, which will inevitably be picked apart by commentators. The longer Sunak held off, the more time Labour had to get its house in order. Sunak inherited a mess, no one can deny that. It currently seems unlikely that he has cleaned up that mess enough to earn the Conservatives another term in office. But given the size of the task ahead of him, it makes sense that he seize on this rare period of good news and hope for the best.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/24/uk/prime-minister-rishi-sunak-election-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_27_middleeast_gaza-rafah-displaced-people-camp-israel-strike-mime-intl", "text": "Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday an airstrike that killed dozens of people at a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah, Gaza, was a \u201ctragic error.\u201d \u201cDespite our best effort not to harm those not involved, unfortunately a tragic error happened last night. We are investigating the case,\u201d Netanyahu said in a speech at the Israeli Knesset. At least 45 people were killed and more than 200 others injured after a fire broke out at the camp following the strike, most of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and Palestinian medics. No hospital in Rafah had the capacity to take the number of casualties, the ministry said. Footage obtained by CNN showed the camp in flames, with scores of men, women and children frantically trying to find cover from the nighttime assault. Burned bodies, including those of children, could be seen being pulled by rescuers from the wreckage. \u201cSeveral civilians are still trapped inside the camp, which was attacked without warning,\u201d a Palestinian man filming the fire said. \u201cThis was declared a safe zone.\u201d United Nations Secretary-General\u00a0Ant\u00f2nio Guterres issued a blistering condemnation on Monday. \u201cI condemn Israel\u2019s actions which killed scores of innocent civilians who were only seeking shelter from this deadly conflict,\u201d\u00a0he said on X. \u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop.\u201d A UN diplomat told CNN that the Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Tuesday to discuss the airstrike at the request of Algeria. It will hold private discussions at 3.30 p.m., the diplomat said. A US official told CNN Monday that Israel had told the Biden administration it used a precision munition to hit a target in Rafah, but that the explosion from the strike ignited a fuel tank nearby and started a fire that engulfed a camp for displaced Palestinians and led to dozens of deaths. \u201cWe can\u2019t confirm that but it\u2019s what Israel shared with us,\u201d the official said, \u201cand we assume we will learn more once Israel completes its investigation.\u201d The attack came after Hamas launched rockets at Tel Aviv on Sunday for the first time in months. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that eight rockets were fired from the Rafah area, and that \u201ca number of projectiles\u201d had been intercepted. The IDF said it destroyed the rocket launchers used by Hamas shortly after the strikes. The Israeli military said in a statement earlier on Monday that it had struck \u201ca compound in Rafah in which significant Hamas terrorists were operating.\u201d It said the strike killed two Hamas officials \u2013 West Bank Chief of Staff Yassin Rabia and senior Hamas member Khaled Nagar. CNN cannot verify these claims. The IDF said in a later statement Monday that its Fact Finding and Assessment Mechanism \u2013 an independent body responsible for examining allegations of misconduct in conflict \u2013 will investigate the \u201ccircumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area of the strike.\u201d It was among the deadliest strikes by the Israeli military on Gaza\u2019s southernmost city since Israel began its operation there on May 7. It also came just days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations\u2019 top court, ordered Israel to \u201cimmediately halt\u201d its military operation in Rafah, and any other action in the city, \u201cwhich may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d The IDF said the attack was conducted based on \u201cprior intelligence\u201d indicating that senior officials of Hamas\u2019 West Bank wing were present at the site. The IDF said it had assessed there would be \u201cno expected harm to uninvolved civilians.\u201d More than 36,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military operation there, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave, which started after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. \u2018Hell on earth\u2019 Footage of the aftermath shared on social media showed chaotic scenes. In one video, the lifeless body of a man was seen being dragged by the legs out of the flames. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, he\u2019s dead,\u201d a rescuer says before moving on to find others. In another video, a man wept as he held up the headless body of a toddler for the camera. Women shrieked in grief as children peered into the fire. A man with a bloodied face stood in apparent shock, examining his wounds with one hand, as he held an infant with blood-stained clothes in the other arm. One of the bodies pulled out of the fire was charred-stiff. By Monday morning, the camp was in ruins with small fires still burning. Men and boys gathered around, rummaging through the burned and smoking wreckage for food and their belongings as drones hovered above. One of the structures still standing was a sign that read: \u201cKuwait peace camp 1.\u201d Children and women living in makeshift tents were among those killed, according to a post on X from UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. \u201cThe images from last night are testament to how Rafah has turned into hell on earth,\u201d the commissioner-general said Monday. \u201cOthers were reportedly burnt to death,\u201d Lazzarini said. The reporting is based on open-source photos and videos which were shared with UNRWA, including from social media, UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma told CNN. Mohammad Abu Al Subeh, a displaced Palestinian man who survived the strike, said as he was lying in bed in the evening when he saw \u201crockets fired down at us.\u201d \u201cIt shook the earth like an earthquake,\u201d Abu Al Subeh, who fled his home in Nuseirat some five months ago, told CNN. He had to escape through the window of his makeshift house  in the desert area where the camp is located. \u201cI came here based on the leaflet that was dropped (by Israel) saying go to this humanitarian area,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just civilians here.\u201d Abu Nidal Al Attar, another displaced Palestinian who witnessed the attack, told CNN: \u201cWe were sitting as normal people do\u201d when they suddenly saw strikes and fire. \u201cWe went to see, and they were pulling out burned people.\u201d Hamas called the attack \u201ca horrific war crime\u201d and \u201cterrible massacre.\u201d International outrage International condemnation was swift, with UN agencies, aid groups and governments calling on Israel to respect the ICJ ruling and halt its Rafah operation. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday condemned the airstrike. \u201cThere is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop,\u201d he said in a post on X. \u201cDespite the ICJ binding ruling, Israel struck Rafah and Hamas fired rockets to Israel,\u201d the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, wrote Monday on X. \u00a0On Monday, in a meeting with Arab leaders to discuss Gaza and the Middle, Borrell said that \u201cwhat we have seen in the immediate hours is that Israel continues the military action that it has been asked to stop.\u201d Medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it was \u201chorrified by this deadly event, which shows once again that nowhere is safe.\u201d The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said \u201cGaza is hell on earth,\u201d referring to the Rafah attack. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \u201coutraged\u201d and called for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire.\u201d Critics have pushed back on Israel\u2019s claims. Already worried about an intensifying war right on its border with Gaza, Egypt on Monday condemned Israel\u2019s strike on Rafah, calling on the Jewish state to implement the ICJ ruling of \u201chalting military operations\u201d in Rafah and to \u201ccomply with its responsibilities as an occupying power\u201d. A mediator in the war, Egypt is set to host another round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas on Tuesday. Qatar, another key mediator, said Israel\u2019s strike could \u201chinder\u201d ongoing negotiations, and called the attack a \u201cserious violation of international law.\u201d Over a million Palestinians had been sheltering in Rafah before Israel began its operations there, having fled there from other areas of Gaza after Israel began its military campaign in the territory. Israel has said it had ordered civilians to leave some areas of Rafah, but many remain there, sheltering in what Israel designated as \u201csafe zones.\u201d More than 800,000 people have fled Rafah since May 6, according to UN figures. Israel has vowed to press on with its Rafah operation despite international outrage and a US warning not to proceed. In response to the ICJ ruling last week, Israel said it \u201chas not and will not conduct military actions in the Rafah area which may inflict on the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d Clarification: This story has been updated after additional review of the translation from Hebrew to English, to clarify the wording used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he referred to a deadly Israeli strike on Rafah, Gaza.\u00a0The word\u00a0\u201cerror\u201dwas originally translated as \u201cmistake.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/27/middleeast/gaza-rafah-displaced-people-camp-israel-strike-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "05/31/2024", "section": "world"}}
