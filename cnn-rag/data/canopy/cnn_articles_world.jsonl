On a mission to tackle poaching, the WFA recreates wildlife crimes in a warehouse and students and rangers dressed in hazmat suits are taught how to handle the evidence. Across the world, wildlife crimes \u2013 including animal trafficking and poaching \u2013 are on the rise and are a major threat to the planet\u2019s biodiversity. In Africa, rhinos are a prime target, with around 10,000 lost to poaching in the last decade, the majority in South Africa. Almost 500 rhinos were poached in the country in 2023, with more than 300 from within KwaZulu-Natal province, home to Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park. Yet the province only recorded 49 related arrests and seized just 13 firearms. By providing forensics training, Greg Simpson, co-founder of the WFA, hopes to increase the rate of successful convictions. Often, he says, wildlife crimes happen in remote areas without witnesses and first responders can accidentally disrupt the scene and contaminate evidence. As a result, the culprit isn\u2019t caught or punished. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to give people skills so that they can collect evidence \u2026 that can be used in an investigation and hopefully down the line will end up in a prosecution,\u201d he says. Crime scene simulation The facility tries to make the training experience as realistic as possible. It uses life-size animals preserved by taxidermy, and some are marked with bloody wounds made with red paint. Besides the corrugated iron walls and roof, the warehouse looks like a typical dry African landscape, with sandy terrain and a scattering of plants. There is a poachers\u2019 house and truck, ready to be searched and swabbed for fingerprints, and footprints lie on the ground, ready to be measured and identified. Once the crime scene has been investigated, the students are taught how to chemically analyze the evidence at an on-site laboratory. The lessons culminate in a replica courtroom where they practice presenting the evidence at trial and undergo cross-examination. \u201cThe purpose of cross-examination is to test the credibility, the trustworthiness of evidence. And unless you can survive it, the court might not accept your evidence,\u201d says Phil Snijman, director of education at the WFA and former state advocate and prosecutor. Fingerprints, DNA samples, ballistics (when a weapon is matched to a cartridge), shoe tracks can all be discounted by the court if they have not been correctly sealed, photographed or documented, he explains. And while he does not expect the course to make students and rangers forensic experts, he believes that it will help them to preserve the evidence correctly if they are ever the first responders to a crime scene. Boosting convictions Launched in 2022, the WFA attracts university students, such as those studying veterinary or biomedical sciences, and wildlife rangers from all over the world to its one to four-week courses. This year, it expects to train around 200 people. One of them is Leita Mkhabela, a ranger from the all-female Black Mamba anti-poaching unit that operates in Greater Kruger, a collection of private game reserves in northeast South Africa, who attended a course in April. \u201cThis is something we come across every day, we have a high rate of rhino poaching,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have so many poachers that have walked free in court because rangers didn\u2019t collect enough evidence. It\u2019s really important for rangers to get this knowledge.\u201d Mkhabela plans to take back all that she has learned to her colleagues so that they can implement the techniques in the bush. She believes that increasing the rate of convictions will act as a deterrent for poachers. There are signs that the training is leading to convictions. According to the WFA, a ranger reported that since doing the course, he was able to collect traces of poison at a crime scene involving wild dogs, and police were confident they would be able to arrest and convict the poachers as a result. Other forensic laboratories have been set up across the continent, in countries such as Malawi and Botswana. One initiative, led by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), ran four workshops during 2023 and early 2024, training 80 wildlife rangers, investigators, and intelligence officers from the Kenya Wildlife Service on collecting and presenting evidence in court. In the first quarter of this year, IFAW reported 32 wildlife crime cases being presented in court and 24 people accused of wildlife crimes awaiting prosecution. Previously, these cases would have been dropped due to a lack of sufficient evidence, it says. Kevin Pretorius, director of the Green Law Foundation and a practicing attorney at the High Court of South Africa, who specializes in criminal and environmental law, and is not involved with WFA, says that one of the main hurdles in convicting wildlife crimes is the \u201cadmissibility of evidence,\u201d especially since the charge must be proven \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt.\u201d \u201cThe training of a cohort of people that understand the value of evidence, and that a crime scene tells a story, and that story can assist the investigator in linking the perpetrator to a crime, is always valuable,\u201d he says. For the WFA, assisting law enforcement is its central mission, but it also hopes to raise awareness of the threats presented by the illegal wildlife trade and why it should be treated as a priority. \u201cIt\u2019s a threat to biodiversity, it\u2019s a threat to human health,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cIf we can improve knowledge around this, that would be really valuable.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/world/africa/wildlife-forensics-crime-south-africa-c2e-spc/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_12_style_fumihiko-maki-architect-dies", "text": "Tokyo (AP) \u2014 Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki, who won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for designs praised as smartly and artfully fusing the East with the West, has died. He was 95. Maki, who taught architecture and urban design at Harvard, died June 6, his office, Maki & Associates, said Wednesday. Japanese media reports attributed the cause of death to old age. The office declined to confirm the reports. The National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto is considered one of his classic designs, with floating forms of glass, metal and concrete. Its gray exterior appears simple at first glance but sets off patterns of reflected light on rough and polished marble. In the U.S., Maki\u2019s projects included the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and 4 World Trade Center in New York. He also did the Makuhari Messe exhibition hall in Chiba, Japan, and the Hillside Terrace Complex in Tokyo. Maki in the 1980s designed Tokyo\u2019s Spiral building, whose management mourned his death and thanked him for \u201cthe beautiful slopes and the rich space that envisioned an urban park.\u201d In 2013, Maki\u00a0complained about the then planned spaceship-like design\u00a0of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics stadium, slamming it as too expensive and clashing with its surroundings. He said he had the support 100 other people, including architects, in opposing the size of the proposed design by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. \u201cThe problems I see with the planned stadium all relate to the issue of scale,\u201d he said.That design was eventually ditched for a more modest-looking design by\u00a0Kengo Kuma\u00a0which used pieces of wood for a natural Japanese look. Born in Tokyo in 1928, Maki was educated at the University of Tokyo, the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Before opening his own design firm in 1965 in Tokyo, he worked in various offices including Skidmore Owings and Merrill, or SOM, based in Chicago, and Sert, Jackson & Associates in Cambridge, as well as the campus planning office of Washington University in St. Louis. A devoted educator, Maki, in addition to teaching at Washington University, Harvard and the University of Tokyo, lectured around the world. His essays were published in a collection called \u201cNurturing Dreams\u201d by MIT Press in 2008. In it, he explored the Japanese sense of space called \u201coku,\u201d which Maki described as \u201cthe core of this high-density space organized into multiple layers like an onion.\u201d Utilizing oku allowed the Japanese to deliver a feeling of depth even in a cramped area, according to this theory. \u201cIn the formation of urban space, certain stable concepts that have been sifted and committed to memory by the collective unconscious of the community work automatically,\u201d Maki wrote. \u201cOku, a spatial concept peculiar to Japan, is a good example, and I believe an understanding of this way of perceiving space is important in formulating ideas of what future cities should be like.\u201d Maki was the second Japanese to win the Pritzker, hailed as the Nobel Prize of architecture, after Kenzo Tange, his mentor. Maki, along with fellow Tange students\u00a0Arata Isozaki\u00a0and\u00a0Kisho Kurokawa, were the pillars of Japanese modernism. The Pritzker, in selecting Maki, praised him as part of a new wave of architects rebuilding postwar Japan. \u201cHe uses light in a masterful way making it as tangible a part of every design as are the walls and roof. In each building, he searches for a way to make transparency, translucency and opacity exist in total harmony. He uses detail to give his structures rhythm and scale,\u201d Bill Lacy, a member of the international panel of jurors that selected Maki, said at the time. Maki was honored with other awards, such as the Wolf Prize from Israel in 1988 and the Arnold Brunner Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1999. In 2011, the American Institute of Architects honored Maki with its highest accolade, the AIA Gold Medal. Japanese media reports said a memorial service was planned. His office declined to give details, saying an official announcement was being prepared", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/12/style/fumihiko-maki-architect-dies/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

A woman and man were \u201ckilled on the spot\u201d in the Golan Heights when a projectile directly hit their vehicle, according to Israeli police. \u201cSeveral projectiles were identified falling in the area,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) added in a statement following sirens in the Golan Heights. \u201cTonight what we had been warning and talked about for three months happened; We lost lives of residents from the Golan community,\u201d head of the Golan Regional Council\u00a0Ori Kallner\u00a0said in a statement. \u201cWe call on the government of Israel and the IDF on this difficult evening to protect the residents of the Golan, to stop the policy of restraint, attack our enemies with force and restore security to the residents of the north and the Golan.\u201d \u201cWe will not allow the Golan to be turned into Israel\u2019s security zone. The offensive must be moved into the other side of the border, into enemy territory,\u201d Kallner added. Israel\u2019s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds a position in the country\u2019s Defense Ministry, also called on the Israeli military to \u201cstrike Hezbollah and Lebanon mercilessly.\u201d The Golan Heights is under Israeli government control and is considered to be occupied territory by the international community. Earlier, Magen David Adom paramedics had described responding to a \u201cdifficult\u201d scene at the site of the hit on the vehicle. \u201cWe saw a vehicle that suffered a direct hit, and in its front were an unconscious man and woman who were critically injured. During the medical treatment, additional sirens were activated,\u201d the medics said in a statement. \u201cWe ran to protect ourselves and handled the incident as sirens went off. Military personnel assisted on the scene.\u201d Firefighters said they were responding to at least eight fires following the projectile hits. In a statement, Hezbollah said that they had fired dozens of Katyusha rockets on the Golan Heights \u201cin response\u201d to an alleged Israeli attack in Syria targeting a Hezbollah key member earlier on Tuesday. Hezbollah member Yasser Nemr Qranbish was killed\u00a0in an attack targeting him in an area west of the capital, Damascus, on the old Damascus-Beirut road, the group added, without providing further details. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the strike. The Israeli military said in a statement Tuesday that the Israeli Air Force \u201cstruck Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in the area of Qabrikha from which the projectiles were launched toward the area of the Golan Heights.\u201d \u201cIn addition, the IAF struck Hezbollah military structures in the area of Kfarkela in southern Lebanon,\u201d the IDF statement added. Cross-border fire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah has been an almost daily occurrence since the war in Gaza began. But it has been gradually intensifying, raising fears it could escalate into a full-blown conflict. Hezbollah is one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East, with tens of thousands of fighters and a vast missile arsenal. The group has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support Palestinians in Gaza. Smotrich extended condolences to the families of those killed and said the Israeli military and government should \u201crestore security\u201d for residents of the Golan Heights. \u201cThe time has come for courage and valor also from the leadership of the IDF and the state of Israel, and as I have been demanding for a long time, to strike Hezbollah and Lebanon mercilessly and restore security to the residents of the North,\u201d said Smotrich, who also holds a position in the Defense Ministry, in a statement on Tuesday night. Former Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz also commented on the attack, saying it was \u201conce again a difficult and sad evening.\u201d \u201cThe operative effort should have been transferred to the North in March, as we demanded. Prime Minister Netanyahu hesitated, and refused to add the return of the residents of the north to their homes by September 1 to the objectives of the war \u2013 and we are paying the price. And that price is heavy,\u201d said Gantz, who resigned from Netanyahu\u2019s government in June.

{"id": "2024_05_28_americas_ammo-arrests-turks-and-caicos", "text": "The last of five Americans arrested in recent months in Turks and Caicos under gun control laws that make bringing firearms or ammunition into the territory without prior permission from police a crime has been sentenced. Michael Lee Evans, of Texas; Sharitta Grier, of Florida; Bryan Hagerich, of Pennsylvania; Ryan Tyler Watson, of Oklahoma; and Tyler Wenrich, of Virginia, were all accused of bringing various amounts of ammunition to Turks and Caicos, a 40-island chain southeast of the Bahamas. All have said the ammunition recovered from their luggage was not intentionally packed, according to American lawmakers who went to the British Overseas Territory in May as part of efforts to petition for their expedited release. Though the infractions had carried a mandatory 12-year prison sentence and fine \u2013 with reductions only in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d \u2013 a mid-June revision clarified courts may impose a fine, a custodial sentence or both in exceptional circumstances, a member of the territory\u2019s House of Assembly said June 14. All five Americans arrested under the law have pleaded guilty, been sentenced and headed back to the US. Here\u2019s what we know about the laws in Turks and Caicos and the affected Americans: No constitutional right to carry firearms in Turks and Caicos Though the territory doesn\u2019t manufacture firearms or ammunition, the number of firearms finding their way to the islands has increased \u2013 and that\u2019s a worry, Turks and Caicos Premier Washington Misick said. While it is legal to fly in the US with unloaded firearms and ammunition in checked baggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration, taking firearms or ammunition into Turks and Caicos without prior permission from police is \u201cstrictly forbidden.\u201d The mandatory sentence was in place to protect those on the islands, Gov. Dileeni Daniel-Selvaratnam has said, adding judges could use their discretion to impose reduced sentences in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d But no special treatment should be given to any group, the Turks and Caicos premier said: \u201cThe law must be applied even-handedly.\u201d Even so, the \u201camendment was introduced to address concerns about the rigidity of the previous sentencing framework, which mandated both imprisonment and financial penalties for all firearms offenses, regardless of the specific context or severity,\u201d House of Assembly member\u00a0Edwin\u00a0Astwood said in a statement. \u201cThis often resulted in disproportionately harsh sentences that did not always fit the nature of the crime or the circumstances of the offender.\u201d US citizens are not being targeted, Turks and Caicos officials have said. Of the 195 people sentenced for firearm-related offenses over the past six years, only seven were US citizens, Misick has said, and none got a 12-year sentence. While Turks and Caicos collaborates with the US in battling narcotics, terrorism and money laundering, \u201cour laws and processes are not congruent,\u201d Misick said. \u201cWe are a separate sovereignty. We respect the United States\u2019 laws and we will never think to interfere in its operation.\u201d Sharitta Shinese Grier Grier was sentenced July 11 to a suspended\u00a023-week sentence and fined $1,500 following her\u00a0arrest in mid-May, her attorney Sheena C. Mair\u00a0confirmed to CNN. Grier planned to pay the fine that same day and board a same-day flight from\u00a0Turks\u00a0and Caicos to the United States, Mair said. \u201cIf she behaves for 12 months, nothing will happen. But if she gets in trouble in (Turks and Caicos) in those 12 months, she will serve 23 weeks,\u201d the attorney told CNN. The Florida mother had no idea two rounds of ammunition were at the bottom of her luggage when she traveled to Turks and Caicos, she told CNN affiliate\u00a0WFTV. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen because I couldn\u2019t believe it was in there,\u201d she said in May. \u201cThey went through my bag and said they found rounds at the bottom of my carry-on.\u201d Grier was released on bail but couldn\u2019t leave the island until her case concluded and had to report to a local police station weekly, the station reported. \u201cI\u2019m just broken,\u201d Grier said in May. Bryan Hagerich Hagerich was the first of the five to return to the United States after he received a suspended 52-week sentence in late May, which meant he didn\u2019t face immediate incarceration, his representatives said. He was also given a $6,700 fine. The father of two pleaded guilty to possession of 20 rounds of ammunition, according to the Turks and Caicos government.  Hagerich paid the fine and was allowed to leave the British Overseas Territory. He got home May 24, according to Johnathan Franks, a spokesperson for the Bring Our Families Home Campaign, a group that helps wrongfully detained Americans secure release. Arriving at Pittsburgh International Airport, Hagerich told reporters he was \u201cabsolutely elated\u201d to have his two children jump into his arms, according to CNN affiliate\u00a0WTAE. \u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d Hagerich said. \u201cA lot of memories to make together. Just so elated to see them. They\u2019ve been so strong through all this.\u201d Before Hagerich\u2019s sentencing, his wife had packed two suitcases \u2013 one if he was sentenced to prison and another if he were allowed to return home \u2013 they said in an exclusive interview with \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cIt was dark; you have no concept of time,\u201d Hagerich said about his week-long stay in jail in Turks and Caicos. \u201cI was with three folks that were accused of murder. It was scary.\u201d Tyler Wenrich Wenrich pleaded guilty to possession of ammunition while traveling to Turks and Caicos. He was sentenced May 28 to three weeks time-served in jail and fined $9,000, said Kimo Tynes\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, a Government of the Turks and Caicos Islands spokesperson said that day in a statement. He returned home to Virginia on May 30. The Hon. Justice Davidson Baptiste cited exceptional circumstances in Wenrich\u2019s case, saying, \u201cEnforcing the mandatory minimum would have been arbitrary and disproportionate, and would not serve the public interest.\u201d Wenrich was charged with possession of two 9 mm rounds, according to the Turks and Caicos government. Michael Lee Evans Evans pleaded guilty to possession of seven 9 mm rounds of ammunition and appeared before the court on April 24 via video conference. He was allowed to return to the United States on bail due to a \u201csevere\u201d medical situation and to attend his June sentencing hearing virtually, said his attorney Oliver Smith, King\u2019s Counsel. Evans got a suspended 33-month sentence, and his attorney believes it is unlikely he will have to serve time in jail. \u201cIf he has no problems in (Turks and Caicos) within 12 months, he will not have to do any time,\u201d Smith told CNN on June 24. Ryan Tyler Watson Watson was visiting Turks and Caicos with his wife in April to celebrate several friends\u2019 40th birthdays when he was charged with possession of four rounds of ammunition. He plead guilty in May. The first of the Americans to be sentenced under the amended firearms law, he got a suspended 13-week sentence and a $2,000 fine, or $500 per bullet, a spokesperson for the Turks and Caicos Islands Supreme Court told CNN on June 21. Watson soon returned home and reunited with his family, US Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said on X. US lawmakers tried to free Americans The Americans\u2019 arrest has stoked tension between US officials and their counterparts just a few hundred miles away. A request by a US congressional delegation to the islands in May for charges against the five Americas to be dropped did not yield the desired result. \u201cUnfortunately, despite our willingness to work with Turks and Caicos officials to get our constituents home, we were not able to find a path forward today,\u201d Republican US Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said May 20 in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now, (where) every third week an American is being detained wrongfully (in) Turks and Caicos,\u201d Republican US Rep.\u00a0Guy Reschenthaler told ABC News the same week. Meanwhile, the prison on Turks and Caicos has been flagged by the United Nations for humanitarian concerns, Reschenthaler told CNN. In a House of Assembly address, the islands\u2019 Misick said, \u201cThe (accusations) of congressman (Reschenthaler) against the government and people of the Turks and Caicos Islands are nothing more than diabolic falsehoods.\u201d Reschenthaler, for his part, wanted to see a \u201cresolution here where the Americans get zero amount of jail time. They should be given time served and be sent home to the United States,\u201d the congressman told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on May 20. \u201cThey were innocent mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cAny other nation would handle this with a fine in sending that person back to the country of origin. Here, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d On May 28, Mullin welcomed the news of Wenrich\u2019s release, calling it \u201canother step in the right direction,\u201d according to a post on X. \u201cI again encourage TCI to address the unintended consequences of their law to prevent this from happening again.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

{"id": "2024_07_10_asia_japan-rina-gonoi-sexual-assault-settlement-intl-hnk", "text": "A former soldier who was sexually assaulted while serving in Japan\u2019s military has reached a civil settlement with three of her convicted attackers in a case that exposed a widespread culture of harassment in the country\u2019s self-defense force. The settlement, initiated by the three former soldiers who were found guilty of sexual assault by a Japanese court in December, includes them apologizing and paying a sum of money, Rina Gonoi said on her X account on Tuesday. She did not disclose the amount of money involved. \u201cToday, I would like to announce that a settlement has been reached in the civil trial with the three perpetrators who were found guilty in the criminal trial,\u201d Gonoi said. Gonoi pursued both criminal and civil cases in the courts, including the civil lawsuit in which she is seeking compensation from the government and five former members of the Japan Self-Defense Force (JSDF) for emotional stress caused by sexual abuse, public broadcaster NHK reported. \u201cI am relieved that the three years of fighting came to an end and I\u2019m feeling three years\u2019 worth of exhaustion all at once, but I will take care not to get sick,\u201d Gonoi said on her Instagram account on Tuesday night. She had previously reached a settlement with another of the five former members of the JSDF in the civil case, and the trial will continue against the government and the remaining former members, NHK reported. Yoshiaki Saito, a lawyer representing the three soldiers, told CNN on Wednesday that they had no comment. CNN has also reached out to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Defense and the JSDF for comment. Gonoi said she endured physical and verbal sexual abuse on a daily basis for more than a year while serving in the JSDF, and vowed to bring her tormentors to justice when she left the military in June 2022. Authorities initially seemed unwilling to believe her but Gonoi\u2019s refusal to be silenced eventually prompted prosecutors to reopen investigations in a sweeping probe into sexual harassment across the JSDF. \u201cI wanted to help other people who had also been sexually harassed (in the JSDF). As for the perpetrators, I wanted an apology and for them to admit to what they had done; I wanted to prevent others from going through what I went through; that\u2019s why I spoke out,\u201d Gonoi told CNN last July. The broad investigation led by Japan\u2019s defense ministry found that Gonoi had suffered physical and verbal sexual harassment daily between late 2020 and August 2021. Japan\u2019s struggles with gender inequality, which were highlighted during the #MeToo campaign, are well documented. The country ranks bottom of all G7 nations and 125th out of 146 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s index for gender inequality. Not backing down As a child, Gonoi said she saw JSDF members as heroes. She grew up wanting to be like them after women officers in particular came to her rescue following the deadly 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that decimated her hometown of Higashi-Matsushima in Japan\u2019s northern prefecture of Miyagi. Years later, it would be a posting to a JSDF station in Fukushima \u2013 another area that was decimated by the 2011 disaster \u2013 where she told CNN she first experienced sexual harassment. \u201cThey\u2019d comment on my body and the size of my breasts. Or they\u2019d come up to me in the hallways and suddenly hug me in the corridor. That kind of thing happened daily,\u201d Gonoi recalled of her time in the station. The last straw came in August 2021, when Gonoi said she was pinned to a dormitory floor as several senior male officers simulated sexual intercourse. It was this incident that convinced her to report her assailants. When she reported the alleged abuse to military authorities, two investigations were launched, but both were dropped on grounds of a lack of evidence \u2013 prompting her to take the battle to social media. Going public was a rare move in a country where sexual assault survivors can face backlash for raising their voices. But it paid off, as the social media scrutiny pressured the JSDF into a rethink. The defense ministry eventually launched a broad investigation into sexual harassment across the JSDF that found Gonoi had suffered physical and verbal sexual harassment daily between late 2020 and August 2021. The case reached the highest levels, with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida saying during a parliamentary meeting in October 2022 that he understood sexual harassment cases were handled inappropriately by the JSDF and the ministry. Last December, a Japanese court ruled that the three men had committed forcible indecency against Gonoi. The court sentenced the trio to two years in prison with a suspended sentence, NHK reported, which could allow them to avoid jail time if they do not commit a crime over a two-year period. The landmark decision was an encouraging sign but \u201cthe country still has a long way to go to change both the criminal justice system and the culture of victim-blaming that undermines the credibility of survivors,\u201d according to Amnesty International\u2019s East Asia researcher Boram Jang. \u201cRina Gonoi dared to speak out to break the cycle of impunity for gender-based violence in Japan. This is a rare victory not just for her, but for all victims and survivors of sexual assault in Japan, many of whom suffer in silence,\u201d Jang said in a statement after the ruling.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/asia/japan-rina-gonoi-sexual-assault-settlement-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_sport_stan-smith-tennis-fashion-icon-wimbledon-spt-intl", "text": "Depending on your age, the name Stan Smith probably means one of two things. For younger people, it\u2019s the name of a sleek and stylish leather Adidas sneaker. For those of an older age, it\u2019s the name of a strapping six-foot-four, moustachioed US tennis star. \u201cPeople sometimes are surprised that there is even a person affiliated with that name at all,\u201d Smith tells CNN with a chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s been interesting over the years and it\u2019s been fun in many ways to see people\u2019s reactions \u2026 finding out there was a tennis player named Stan Smith.\u201d It\u2019s rare for somebody to be talented and charismatic enough to become an icon in one field. It is rarer still for somebody to become an icon in two. As sports journalist Cari Champion notes in the documentary \u2018Who is Stan Smith?\u2019, which explores the remarkable life of the two-time grand slam champion, activist and style icon: \u201cHe has his face on a sneaker. Even Jordan\u00a0doesn\u2019t have his face on a sneaker.\u201d The documentary\u2019s Emmy Award-winning director Danny Lee tells CNN \u201cthere\u2019s something very understated and human\u201d about Smith. \u201cHe never, I think, endeavoured to become an icon and I think when it happens organically within culture, and in this respect, sports culture and fashion, it just makes more sense. \u201cSo there\u2019s something of Stan\u2019s personality that\u2019s imbued in the shoe. It\u2019s understated. It\u2019s elegant. It\u2019s stately. And I think that\u2019s why it works.\u201d In the mid to late 1970s, it became increasingly common to see people wearing sneakers casually, outside of the gym and integrating them into their individual outfits. The rise in popularity of the Stan Smith sneaker coincided with a slump towards the end of his tennis career and it began permeating a wide array of cultures in the UK and US. Young soccer fans began wearing them on the terraces in the UK, partly inspired by David Bowie donning the sneaker in the late \u201870s. Then came its impact on hip-hop culture, led largely by the Beastie Boys and RUN-D.M.C.\u2019s world tour in the late 1980s and the release of the single \u2018My Adidas.\u2019 \u201cEvery community embraced that shoe,\u201d Pharrell Williams says in the documentary \u2013 \u201cHustlers, drug dealers.\u201d During the 1972 French Open in Paris, Adidas chairman Horst Dassler, son of the company\u2019s founder, asked for a midnight meeting with Smith and his agent Donald Dell. Adidas wanted to expand into the USA and saw Smith, the newly crowned US Open champion, as the perfect fit. The leather design and perforations on the side of the shoe \u2013 which at the time of its launch was named Adidas Robert Haillet after the French tennis star \u2013 were technological advancements, historian and designer Gary Aspden explains in the documentary. Smith agreed to wear the sneaker at Wimbledon that year, a tournament he went on to win. \u201cIt had Haillet\u2019s name on the shoe for about six or seven years and then they wanted to expand to the US market, so they asked me to be involved,\u201d Smith tells CNN. \u201cI was the number one player in the world at the time, an American, so they put my picture on the tongue and they had Haillet on the side. \u201cThey had several iterations along the way. Then, finally, about four or five years later, they took the Haillet name off the shoe. And as they say, the rest was history.\u201d Arthur Ashe and the Davis Cup The documentary charts Smith\u2019s rise from a working-class family in Pasadena, California, where he was scouted by a club called the Pasadena Tennis Patrons. The club was made up of wealthy parents in the area, who would cover the costs of talented youngsters trying to turn professional. In the 1960s, the Davis Cup \u2013 a team tournament contested by countries from around the world \u2013 was one of the most prestigious tennis tournaments in the world, unlike the lesser status it commands today. In 1963, the USA welcomed Mexico to the Los Angeles Tennis Club for the Americas semifinal and it was there that a young Smith, a ball boy at the time, first caught a glimpse of rising tennis star Arthur Ashe. Ashe being selected for the team was a \u201chuge deal,\u201d Dell says in the documentary. Ashe was the first African American to play on the US Davis Cup team. At that time, a year before US President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, segregation was still rampant in America \u2013 the documentary shows clips of \u201cWhite\u201d and \u201cColored\u201d entrances and waiting areas \u2013 and Ashe couldn\u2019t go everywhere his teammates could go. Smith eventually made the US Davis Cup roster and in 1968, alongside doubles partner Bob Lutz - portrayed as Smith\u2019s early club rival in the documentary - led the team to victory, ending Australia\u2019s four-year chokehold on the title and simultaneously helping to spark a surge in the sport\u2019s popularity across the US \u2013 known as the \u2018tennis boom.\u2019 In the documentary, produced by LeBron James\u2019 Uninterrupted company, Dell calls 1968 \u201can extremely violent year in America.\u201d Activist Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered in April of that year as protests against racial injustice raged across the country, which was also divided about the ongoing Vietnam war. Ashe began using his platform as one of the US\u2019s best tennis players to speak out, saying in a 1968 interview that \u201cthere\u2019s really a mandate that you do something\u201d if you\u2019re Black and in the public eye. Smith witnessed the racism Ashe had to face when traveling around America to play tennis. In the documentary, Smith recounts one incident in Houston, Texas where the tennis club wouldn\u2019t allow Ashe to use the men\u2019s changing rooms, instead making him use the junior facilities. Smith admits in the documentary that his upbringing was \u201cisolated,\u201d which meant he didn\u2019t really \u201cdwell on the racial injustice as a kid.\u201d \u201cBut as we travelled around the United States and the world, I got to see that \u2013 and worse,\u201d he adds. Smith and Ashe, who died in 1993 aged 49, developed a close friendship and deep bond, a running theme throughout the documentary. Smith says he is still close with Ashe\u2019s wife and daughter. \u201cI think the experience of traveling around the world with Arthur and with all the other players on the tour \u2026 it was that way when I first got on it [activism],\u201d Smith says. \u201cSo I got to realize from all this experience that people are more alike than they are dissimilar and therefore looking for the same kind of meaning in life. \u201cI think that that really made an impact on me and realizing that there were things happening around the world that were terrible. \u201c\u201868 was a tumultuous year worldwide with the Vietnam War going on and people protesting, first equal rights and of course in South Africa, things were going on that made our inner-city areas look like Hollywood in Beverly Hills compared to what was going on in Soweto and Alexandria, those townships there.\u201d Lee says Smith\u2019s \u201cNorth Star\u201d in his career and life has been to \u201cpay it forward, to help people that might not have the opportunities that he might have.\u201d That was never more apparent than in the case of Mark Mathabane, a Black South African tennis player that Smith, his wife Marjory and Ashe helped escape apartheid. The two met when Smith practicing for a tournament in Johannesburg in 1977. Smith helped Mathabane get a place at the University of South Carolina. Mathabane later became a bestselling author for his autobiography \u201cKaffir Boy,\u201d the story of his childhood under a brutal regime. Wimbledon turmoil In 1968, star tennis players began leaving what was then an amateur sport and defecting to the professional circuit, which meant they would no longer be eligible to compete in the amateur-only grand slams. However, the International Tennis Federation eventually relented after much turmoil and the Open Era was born. Five years later, Smith arrived at Wimbledon as the defending champion after winning the title in 1972. It was the pinnacle of his career. \u201cIt was one of my goals to win that tournament,\u201d Smith says. \u201cIt was like the world\u2019s championships in a way, even though it wasn\u2019t officially. So I really worked hard and it motivated me in everything I did to try to win that tournament. \u201cSo when I lost in the final in \u201871, getting very close to that goal, winning in \u201872 was even more special.\u201d Ahead of the tournament in \u201873, the Yugoslav Tennis Association was unhappy with its star player, Niki Pili\u0107, after he opted to play in the professional World Championship of Tennis doubles final rather than represent his country in the Davis Cup. Pili\u0107 was suspended for nine months by his country\u2019s tennis association, which then phoned Wimbledon organizers and requested he be banned from competing \u2013 a request that was granted. In protest, the players formed the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and 13 of the 16 seeds \u2013 including defending champion Smith \u2013 withdrew in support of Pili\u0107. \u201cThe history of tennis as it became open and democratized during the \u201860s and \u201870s where revolution was everywhere throughout the world - and that was no different in tennis when Stan defied and boycotted Wimbledon in \u201973,\u201d Lee says. \u201cAnd he led the charge in unionizing the sport with the ATP. So all of that story, when you put on those shoes, a lot of that is imbued in the shoe.\u201d Throughout the film, Smith regularly mentions the four goals he wrote down for himself at the start of his career: Make the US Davis Cup team, become No. 1 in the US, win Wimbledon and then become the world No. 1. Smith accomplished all of that \u2013 and much more.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/sport/stan-smith-tennis-fashion-icon-wimbledon-spt-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_tech_apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets", "text": "Apple has yielded to pressure by European regulators to give rivals access to the contactless payments technology on iPhones, meaning that their users will no longer be limited to the Apple Pay mobile wallet. The development on the tap-to-pay technology underscores mounting regulatory scrutiny of Apple (AAPL) in the European Union, where it is also facing a potential huge fine for allegedly breaching the bloc\u2019s landmark Digital Markets Act. The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, announced this and other changes to Apple\u2019s business practices Thursday, saying they would open up competition in mobile payments on iPhones. \u201ciPhone users will (now) be able to use their preferred mobile wallet for payments in stores\u2026 while enjoying all the iPhone functionalities, including double click, tap-and-go and Face ID,\u201d the EU\u2019s competition chief Margrethe Vestager told journalists. The tech giant has until July 25 to implement the changes, which will remain in force for 10 years and apply throughout the 30 countries in the European Economic Area. Under the agreement, third-party mobile wallet developers will gain free access to the standard technology used for contactless payments with iPhones, known as near-field communication (NFC) technology. Apple will also allow iPhone users to choose which mobile wallet to make the default wallet on their phones. \u201cApple is providing developers in the European Economic Area with an option to enable NFC contactless payments and\u00a0contactless\u00a0transactions for car keys, closed loop transit, corporate badges, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty/rewards, and event tickets\u00a0from within their iOS apps,\u201d Apple said in a statement shared with CNN. \u201cApple Pay and Apple Wallet will continue to be available in the European Economic Area for users and developers.\u201d The European Commission first raised objections against Apple\u2019s tap-to-pay practices in 2022, having opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple Pay two years earlier. The regulators found that Apple had abused its dominant market position by restricting access to the NFC technology needed to make payments on mobile devices. That means rivals wanting to create apps or wallets using the tap-to-pay features on iPhones have been unable to do so and users have been forced to use Apple Pay for mobile payments. \u201cFrom now on, Apple can no longer use its control of the iPhone ecosystem to keep (competing) mobile wallets out of the market,\u201d Vestager said. \u201cCompeting wallet developers as well as consumers will benefit from these changes, opening up innovation and choice while keeping payments secure.\u201d The commitments do not extend to Apple Watches, however. \u201cOur impression was that the number of people who use Apple Watches for payments is rather small,\u201d said Vestager, adding that there was \u201climited harm done\u201d from excluding those devices.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/tech/apple-pay-europe-mobile-wallets/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

Known for its picturesque and well-preserved traditional Korean houses called \u201chanok,\u201d Bukchon Hanok Village is one of Seoul\u2019s most popular tourist hot spots \u2013 attracting thousands of visitors every day. But tourists greatly outnumber residents and complaints about noise, littering and privacy issues in the vicinity have escalated over the years. Located in the Jongno district in downtown Seoul, Bukchon sits near other cultural landmarks like the Jongmyo royal ancestral\u00a0shrine and the grand Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung palaces. In a bid to ease tensions and control crowds, district officials will start to restrict tourist access to the popular village from as early as October this year. It will be designated the country\u2019s first-ever \u201cspecial management area\u201d under South Korea\u2019s Tourism Promotion Act. Strict curfews for non-residents will be reinforced daily between 5 p.m. to 10 a.m. Chartered buses carrying tourists will be restricted in several sections. The aim is to reduce traffic and make Bukchon \u201cfoot-centered,\u201d officials said. Three color-coded zones \u2013 red, orange and yellow \u2013 will also be designated to allow local authorities to control and monitor crowds in the most densely populated areas. Fines will also be imposed on violators, officials said. Following public complaints, signs in four languages warning tourists about noise levels were installed in 2018. The area once served as residential quarters for high-ranking authorities and nobility during the era of the Joseon kings, who ruled Korea from the 1300s until 1910. Today, the area is home to around 6,000 residents as well as businesses like inns, craft stores and cafes \u2013 with several prominent photo spots. However, some of those living and working in the area have dismissed the new measures as being \u201cempty talk.\u201d Cafe owner Lee Youn-hee told CNN that tourists usually leave after sunset anyway, as they\u2019re mostly there to take photos. \u201cIn the winter, visitors are gone by 5 p.m. and during summer maybe by 6 p.m. because the days are longer,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThis won\u2019t make a big difference.\u201d A growing global problem But Seoul isn\u2019t alone. Many global cities are struggling to find a balance between much-needed tourism revenue and maintaining their appeal to residents. Tourists visiting Barcelona this week were sprayed with water by protesters marching through popular areas to demonstrate against mass tourism in the city. Italy\u2019s lagoon city of Venice introduced a\u00a0trial fee\u00a0in April to limit the number of day trippers. Overtourism has long been a problem in Japan, with the situation deteriorating rapidly since the country reopened post-pandemic. The slopes of Mount Fuji have seen increasing human traffic jams, foothills littered with garbage as well as bad tourist behavior. Out-of-control tourists have been especially problematic in Kyoto, one of Japan\u2019s most popular tourist cities, famed for its iconic Gion geisha district. Reports of \u201cgeisha paparazzi\u201d fueled public anger and have prompted city officials to take action. Back in Seoul, about 6.6 million domestic and overseas tourists are believed to have visited Bukchon in 2023, according to government data. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that tourists be respectful to those living here,\u201d Sindere Schoultz, a tourist from Sweden, told CNN. \u201cWe want to come here and have a good time but we don\u2019t want to step on somebody\u2019s toes and be disrespectful.\u201d Another Swedish tourist, Emma H\u00e4gg, said she understood the reasons behind the ban. \u201cI don\u2019t mind it,\u201d she said. \u201cI completely understand why and it\u2019s good that they still want us.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/travel/south-korea-overtourism-bukchon-hanok-village-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

At least 27 people have been killed and 53 have been injured in the strike, which hit the gate of the Al-Mutanabbi school complex, also known locally as the Al-Awda Schools, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. In a video filmed at the scene by a journalist working for CNN in the aftermath of the strike, a remnant of a US-made GBU-39 small-diameter bomb (SDB) is clearly visible. The remnant is the tail section of the munition, according to three explosive weapons experts who reviewed the video for CNN. \u201cBased on the characteristic shape of the fin, the screw housings, as well as the overall shape of the munition fragment\u2026 this remnant is consistent with a GBU-39-series tail actuation system located in the rear of the munition,\u201d Patrick Senft, a research coordinator at Armament Research Services (ARES), told CNN.

{"id": "2024_07_06_americas_argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam", "text": "It was an attack that sent shockwaves through a country long considered a pioneer in LGBTQ rights. In the early hours of May 6, four lesbian women were set on fire\u00a0in Argentina. Only one of them survived. It happened at a\u00a0boarding house\u00a0in the Barracas neighborhood of Buenos Aires, where Pamela Fabiana Cobas, Mercedes Roxana Figueroa, Andrea Amarante and Sof\u00eda Castro Riglo were sharing a room. Witnesses say a man\u00a0broke in\u00a0and threw an incendiary device that set the women on fire. Pamela died soon after. Her partner Roxana died days later of organ failure. Andrea died on May 12 in a hospital. Andrea\u2019s\u00a0partner Sof\u00eda was the sole survivor. She spent weeks recovering in hospital and is alive today only because Andrea threw herself on top of her to shield her from the flames, Sofia\u2019s attorney Gabriela Conder told CNN. \u201cHer partner saved her,\u201d Conder said. Local LGBTQ rights advocates condemned the attack as a hate crime and lesbicide, saying the women were targeted because of their sexual identity. Police have arrested a 62-year-old man who\u00a0lived in the building but, according to Conder, aren\u2019t currently treating the incident as a hate crime as they say the motive is still unclear. For Argentina\u2019s LGBTQ groups \u2013 many of whom are planning to commemorate the four women with a rally this weekend \u2013 the attack represents an extreme manifestation of what they consider a growing wave of hostility against them. Those they blame most for this rising intolerance are the people in power. Chief among them, they say, is the country\u2019s new far-right leader Javier Milei. \u201cThings changed with the new government of Javier Milei,\u201d said Maria Rachid, head of the Institute Against Discrimination of the Ombudsman\u2019s Office in Buenos Aires, and a board member and founder of the Argentine LGBT Federation (FALGBT). \u201cSince the beginning of the new government, there are national government officials expressing themselves in a discriminatory manner and those hate speeches before our communities from places with so much power, of course, what they do is generate \u2013 actually legitimize \u2013 and endorse these discriminatory positions that are then expressed with violence and discrimination in everyday life,\u201d Rachid said. Milei under fire When Milei ran for president\u00a0in 2023, he and his party\u00a0were accused of making offensive remarks against LGBTQ communities which were deemed hate speech by multiple groups, including Argentina\u2019s National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes. In a YouTube interview ahead of the November election, Milei insisted that he does\u00a0not oppose same-sex marriage, but in that same interview, he went on to compare homosexuality to having sex with animals. \u201cWhat do I care what your sexual preference is? If you want to be with an elephant, and you have the consent of that elephant, that\u2019s a problem between you and the elephant,\u201d he said, angering LGBTQ communities, who called the comments dehumanizing. In late October, then-congresswoman-elect Diana Mondino, who would later become Milei\u2019s foreign minister, told an interviewer that she supports marriage equality in theory, but at the same time,\u00a0compared it to having lice. \u201cAs a\u00a0liberal, I\u2019m in favor of each person\u2019s life project. It is much broader than marriage equality. Let me exaggerate: If you prefer not to bathe and be full of lice and it is your choice, that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t complain later if there is someone who doesn\u2019t like that you have lice,\u201d she said. After\u00a0taking office in December, Milei took steps that\u00a0critics say weakened protections for LGBTQ groups. He banned\u00a0the use of\u00a0gender-inclusive language\u00a0in government; replaced the\u00a0Ministry of Women, Gender and Diversity\u00a0with a less powerful undersecretariat within the Ministry of Human Capital; and effectively closed the national anti-discrimination agency, saying the Ministry of Justice would\u00a0absorb its functions. Milei\u2019s administration argued that some of those moves were part of his plan to cut public spending in response to the country\u2019s economic hardships. But critics say his actions have normalized a culture of discrimination toward LGBTQ groups, and in the most extreme cases, have led to violent attacks such as the deadly May 6 arson. \u201cWhen hate speech is enabled by those in power, these sectors start to feel legitimized to attack,\u201d Esteban Paul\u00f3n, a former FALGBT president who was elected to Congress last year, told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cAnd obviously, behind the verbal attacks come physical attacks.\u201d \u201c(Attacks) always happened. That\u2019s the reality. But they increased more in this current government due to the hate speeches constantly maintained on television, including hate speeches that our president Javier Milei exerts,\u201d said Jesi Hern\u00e1ndez, a lesbian and communication member of Lesbianxs Autoconvocadxs por la masacre de Barracas (Self-convened Lesbians for the Barracas massacre). \u201cToday it was Pamela, Roxana, Andrea and Sof\u00eda. And tomorrow it can be me.\u201d CNN\u00a0has repeatedly reached out to the presidency for comment on these allegations but has not received a response. Rise in hate crimes In 2023, an annual report by the National Observatory of LGBTQ Hate Crimes recorded\u00a0133 crimes\u00a0in which the victims\u2019 sexual orientation, identity and/or gender expression were used as a pretext for the attacks. Those numbers rose from 2022 and 2021, when 129 and 120 crimes were recorded, respectively. Rachid points out that the observatory\u2019s numbers only represent attacks that have been officially recorded, and that the real figures are likely much higher. Hern\u00e1ndez, meanwhile, notes that daily life for many people has been impacted in ways not shown by statistics alone. Some now fear they could be targeted next. \u201cThe\u00a0truth is that now, sleeping peacefully in your bed is a privilege,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said, referencing the May 6 attack, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t know if you have a neighbor who will throw something at you or come in. Sleeping is now a privilege for us.\u201d Despite calls from LGBTQ activists, the arson is currently being investigated as an aggravated homicide rather than a hate crime, according to Conder, Sofia\u2019s attorney. Sofia is set to testify at the end of the month, Conder\u00a0said. CNN has reached out to the criminal court investigating the case but has not received a response. Shortly after the May 6 killings, the presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni condemned the attack but\u00a0dismissed\u00a0the notion that it was motivated by hatred toward the sexual orientation of the victims. \u201cI don\u2019t like to define it as an attack on a certain group,\u201d Adorni said at a press conference. \u201cThere are many women and men who are suffering violence and these are things that cannot continue to happen.\u201d Progressives condemned his remarks, insisting that the government should regard lesbicide as a hate crime. Adorni responded on social media with a picture of a Spanish dictionary that said\u00a0lesbicide\u00a0is not a registered word. Progress in Argentina Argentina was once a progressive pioneer in\u00a0Latin America. In 2010, it became the first country in the region to\u00a0legalize same-sex marriage. In 2021, it also became the first to allow nonbinary people to mark their gender as \u201cX\u201d on\u00a0national identity documents. LGBTQ activists fear these historic gains are now being undermined \u2013 and potentially threatened \u2013 by the current government.\u00a0But they also take comfort in surveys that suggest anti-LGBTQ views are the minority in Argentina. According to a public opinion survey conducted in May by the University of San Andr\u00e9s, some 72% of respondents said they are in favor of marriage equality, 70% said they support policies that protect transgender people from discrimination, 75% said they do not consider that transsexuality is a disease that should be treated medically, and 79% said that comprehensive sexuality education in schools is a positive thing. The recent attacks have galvanized activists to fight for new policies and actions that would further protect LGBTQ rights. Congressman Paul\u00f3n told CNN that lawmakers are working with rights groups on various laws that would, among other things, punish discriminatory acts, prevent harassment in schools, and ban efforts to try to \u201ccorrect\u201d people\u2019s sexual orientation, identity and gender. He also said that to reduce attacks on LGBTQ communities, their voices and demands should be amplified in more societal sectors. To that end, Hern\u00e1ndez encouraged LGBTQ groups to push back against hate speech, telling those communities: \u201cThey are not insane, they are not sick, they are not people with lice. Quite the opposite. I would tell them that they are a disruptive person, that they are breaking out of the molds of \u2018normality.\u2019 And that they are very brave \u2026 and that they are whatever they want to be, despite all this.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/06/americas/argentina-lgbtq-milei-fire-deaths-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_style_anant-ambani-wedding-events-intl-hnk", "text": "For better or for worse, days-long wedding events have become common in cultures around the world. Between Friday night cocktail receptions and sore-headed Sunday brunches, what might once have been a half-day affair can now easily envelop three or four days. But a wedding that spans seven months is an outlier \u2014 even in the extravagant world of big Indian weddings. On Friday, Anant Ambani \u2014 the youngest son of Mukesh Ambani, the head of India\u2019s largest private sector corporation, with an estimated net worth of over $122 billion, according to Forbes \u2014 and pharmaceutical heiress Radhika Merchant will finally be married. The couple have been celebrating their betrothal since January, averaging an event every six weeks. From a star-studded engagement party to performances by the likes of Rihanna and Justin Bieber, no expense has been spared. If you\u2019ve lost track of where the Ambanis are at with their nuptial celebrations, and what lavish bashes have already taken place, read on for a full timeline of what\u2019s expected to be the wedding of the year. December: The engagement On December 29, Anant Ambani kept things low-key as he proposed to Radhika Merchant at a temple in the northern Rajasthan state surrounded by family and close friends. January: The engagement party Merchant took part in a traditional \u201cmehndi\u201d ceremony on January 18, when her hands and feet were decorated with henna. The following day the pair threw their \u201cGol Dhana\u201d engagement party, drawing in some of the biggest names in Bollywood. Actors Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh were among the famous faces in attendance. March: Pre-wedding party Don\u2019t be fooled by the name, this get-together preceded the Ambani\u2019s actual wedding by over four months. Staged in the city of Jamnagar, in the western state of Gujarat, the event (which had a guest list of 1,200 people) featured choreographed Bollywood-style dancing, fireworks and a feast of 500 dishes cooked by around 100 chefs. The evening even saw Rihanna perform for only the second time in six years. The event was a who\u2019s who of the rich and powerful. Tech billionaires Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates were there, each dressed in traditional embellished Kashmiri coats \u2014 while Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner arrived with their daughter. Ahead of the party, the Ambani family also hosted a communal dinner for more than 50,000 villagers outside Jamnagar. May: The European cruise party The Ambanis set off on a four-day European cruise aboard a luxury chartered ship, beginning in the Sicilian city of Palermo and ending in Rome. Despite a strict no-phones policy, leaked social media videos showed on-deck concerts from the Backstreet Boys, Pitbull and David Guetta. There were a few stops on the way, too: A masquerade ball at the Chateau de la Croix des Gardes mansion in Cannes featured a performance by Katy Perry, while an evening event in Portofino on the Italian Riviera saw the main square cordoned off to the public, before Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli performed for guests. July 2-5: Mass wedding and musical night On July 2, the couple staged a mass wedding, also known as \u201cSamuh Vivah,\u201d in the town of Palghar, around 70 miles from Mumbai. More than 50 underprivileged couples were invited to receive gifts, ranging from gold ornaments to a year\u2019s worth of groceries. A few days later, at the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Center (a Mumbai arts venue founded by Anant\u2019s mother, Nita), the Ambanis hosted a traditional night of music and dance, known as the \u201csangeet,\u201d which featured a live performance from Justin Bieber. July 8: The Haldi On Monday, the couple took part in a \u201chaldi\u201d ceremony, a pre-wedding ritual that traditionally sees friends and family bless the marrying couple by applying a turmeric paste to their heads, faces or bodies. The pair appear to have kept the event private, though photographs later shared online showed the couple wearing suitably complementary gold and yellow outfits \u2014 a bejeweled Merchant in a\u00a0custom ensemble\u00a0by celebrated Indian designer Anamika Khanna and the groom in a\u00a0kurta and jacket\u00a0by Sandeep Khosla. Friday: Main ceremony The wedding proper is set to commence on Friday at the 16,000 capacity Jio World Convention Center, complete with a red carpet to showcase A-list attendees clad in \u2014 per the dress code \u2014 classical Indian attire. The internet is awash with rumors of the performer lineup, from Adele and Drake to Lana Del Rey, but one thing is certain: There will be no expense spared. Saturday: Divine blessings ceremony The day after the nuptials will see one of the last stages of the Hindu wedding schedule: the \u201cShubh Ashirwad,\u201d or divine blessings ceremony. Here, the couple seeks \u201cAshirwad,\u201d or blessings, from the elders in their community and are usually showered with rose petals or rice when walking down the aisle again. Sunday: The reception The mammoth festivities conclude on Sunday with one final celebration of the couple: the \u201cMangal Utsav,\u201d or reception. Guests have been to dress in \u201cIndian chic.\u201d Saturday and Sunday\u2019s events are expected to take place at the Ambani family\u2019s 27-story residence, Antilia.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/style/anant-ambani-wedding-events-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_05_25_style_zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk", "text": "Above Beijing\u2019s imperial center rises Jingshan, or Prospect Hill. From a pagoda at its modest peak, a panoramic view of the city presents itself. To the south, the dull golden roofs of the Forbidden City crest and fall, pulling the eye southward to Tiananmen \u2014 the Gate of Heavenly Peace \u2014 and the vast square of the same name just beyond. To the east stand the smooth metallic skyscrapers of the city\u2019s business district. To the north, at the top of Beijing\u2019s central axis \u2014 its so-called dragon\u2019s vein \u2014 sit the Bell and Drum Towers, which once acted as the city\u2019s collective timepiece. And stretching all along the western periphery are the calm, tree-lined waters of the manmade lakes, dug by hand for the pleasure of past emperors. It\u2019s this aerial view of \u201cZhongnanhai,\u201d meaning \u201cmiddle and southern seas,\u201d and the surrounding buildings that today\u2019s Chinese leaders prefer you did not see. That\u2019s because the 1,500-acre site of repurposed imperial pavilions and temples, along with gray modern offices has formed the leadership compound for the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  since 1950. As the seat of power, Zhongnanhai is often thought of as China\u2019s equivalent to the White House, or the Kremlin. Synonymous with China\u2019s communist party elite, and among the country\u2019s most secretive places, it is ringed by a centuries-old red ochre wall, with countless CCTV cameras periscoping above it \u2014 and patrolled assiduously by security forces in both plain clothes and uniform. A peaceful getaway For Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial forebears, the site served a somewhat different function. While emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties ruled their vast kingdom from within the Forbidden City, they built temples, halls and living quarters in Zhongnanhai; less grandly ceremonial than those of the palace, they were often oriented to take advantage of the views afforded by the area\u2019s tranquil waters and carefully planned gardens. Many of these emperors came to favor passing their days surrounded by drooping willows in the cool and quiet of this cultivated pleasure garden. A story relayed by the scholar Geremie Barm\u00e9 in his book \u201cThe Forbidden City\u201d tells of the 18th-century Qianlong Emperor\u2019s daily routine at Zhongnanhai: Each morning, after a first breakfast of cold swallows nest soup, he would travel by heated palanquin to the gardens\u2019\u00a0Studio of Convivial Delight,\u00a0a pavilion he built to capitalize on the view of the South Lake, where he would breakfast again on a meal of\u00a018 dishes. As the historian and author of \u201cThe Shortest History of China,\u201d Linda Jaivin, told CNN via email: \u201cThere is something outrageous and yet poetic about the incredible coordination and effort required of a team of bearers, cooks and attendants, just so that an emperor could come, catch a view of the magnificent Ocean Terrace, scoff his food and (leave).\u201d The first ruler to view Zhongnanhai as primarily a place to govern from, not simply relax in, was the Empress Dowager Cixi, who effectively controlled China for almost five decades from 1861. She lived for many years in the gardens\u2019 Hall of Ceremonial Phoenixes, which became the center of political authority in China. She would die there in 1908. The serene surroundings of Zhongnanhai also became, under Cixi, a place of punishment and confinement. In 1898, following attempted reforms that displeased her, Cixi imprisoned her nephew, the Guangxu Emperor, on Yingtai Island, which juts out into the southern lake. Built as a miniature version of the mythical Penglai island, home to the immortals of Chinese legend, the tiny piece of land would become the emperor\u2019s home for most of his life, bar a brief period when the Boxer rebellion of 1900 forced the whole court to flee the capital. He would die on Yingtai Island from arsenic poisoning the day before the Empress Dowager herself. His imprisonment and death, said writer M. A. Aldrich, author of \u201cThe Search for a Vanishing Beijing: A Guide to China\u2019s Capital Through the Ages,\u201d perhaps adds a touch of poignancy for any subsequent resident of Zhongnanhai. \u201cIn addition to being a site that preserves sites of imperial splendor,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cit also functions as a reminder to the political elite about the consequences for stepping out of line.\u201d For Aldrich, however, the Zhongnanhai compound also represents the destructive impulses of the CCP towards its adopted capital in the years after 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the foundation of the People\u2019s Republic. \u201cAs a political symbol of the New China, it has been torn up, rebuilt, expanded, and revamped so many times that its connection with its elegant past has been lost,\u201d Aldrich said. Architectural changes There have been serious revisions to the architecture of Zhongnanhai since the end of imperial rule in 1912. After the last emperor abdicated the throne, China\u2019s new president Yuan Shikai granted him the right to live on the northern section of the Forbidden City \u2014 and then took Zhongnanhai to be his new administration\u2019s headquarters. The changes he made to the imperial gardens were disparaged by many of the Westerners who visited them. \u201cWhatever may be one\u2019s opinion as to whether Yuan Shikai \u2018exalted his aim\u2019 in his political career, he certainly cannot be said to have done so as builder and architect,\u201d wrote L.C. Arlington and William Lewisohn in their 1935 book \u201cIn Search of Old Peking,\u201d \u201cfor all the buildings that have been erected or restored by him are in the worst possible taste.\u201d Most notable of these changes \u2014 at least to ordinary Beijingers \u2014 was the repurposing of a two-story pavilion at the very south of the gardens. Known as the Precious Moon Tower, it had been built decades earlier by the Qianlong Emperor for a homesick lover, a Muslim woman from Xinjiang, taken to Beijing as part of the spoils of war. The concubine would gaze south from the tower toward a mock mosque and bazaar the emperor had especially constructed to assuage her longing for home. Yuan refashioned this pavilion into the main entrance to his presidential compound, and established a tall watchtower just to its east. The gate was named Xinhuamen, or the Gate of New China. Today, the structure remains coated in the same deep red that graces the walls of all Beijing\u2019s imperial buildings, with a roof of glazed yellow tiles and detailing that runs below the roofline, picked out in blue and gold. The gate is now flanked by two red banners that speak to its modern purpose as China\u2019s political and party headquarters: \u201cLong Live the Great Communist Party of China\u201d reads one; and \u201cLong Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought\u201d on the other. On a screen wall recessed behind the entrance way, Chinese characters written in Mao\u2019s own calligraphic style declare: \u201cServe the People.\u201d Facing out onto Beijing\u2019s main east-west thoroughfare, the gate remains the most conspicuous part of Zhongnanhai. The rest of the compound has, since 1989, been firmly off-limits to the Chinese public. Seat of power Initially, after the communist victory in China\u2019s civil war in 1949, Mao Zedong took up residence at Shuangqing Villa in Fragrant Hills, another former imperial garden to the west of Beijing. Though wary of establishing himself in the imperial heart of Beijing \u2014 it is said that he refused ever to enter the Forbidden City, for fear of being associated with the power structures of old, feudal China he had fought to overthrow \u2014 Mao ultimately moved into Zhongnanhai and, in late 1949, he set up in the\u00a0Garden of Abundant Beneficence,\u00a0a large courtyard compound favored by both the Qianlong and Kangxi emperors, where he would hold court with dignitaries\u00a0and live\u00a0until 1966. Having re-established Zhongnanhai as a center of political power in the new China, Mao set about rebuilding the compound according to his tastes. \u201cSince 1949, an assortment of new architecture styles has encroached into Zhongnanhai, with a tennis court, gymnasium, swimming pools and Western buildings topped off with Chinese eave roofs adding a discordant note that would not have been appreciated by its traditionally-minded original owners,\u201d said Aldrich. In 1966, Mao moved from the Garden of Abundant Beneficence to a specially built house beside his beloved indoor swimming pool. He often summoned officials to speak to him as he bobbed in the water \u2014 and famously received Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev at his pool during a 1958 visit. \u201cTheir interpreters had to pace alongside the edge of the pool,\u201d said Jaivin. \u201cThe Russian couldn\u2019t swim and had to wear water wings. Mao loved both swimming and putting Khrushchev in his place. Finally, Khrushchev got sick of it, and clambered out to sit on the edge, dangling his feet in the water.\u201d In the residence next door, Mao lined his rooms with bookshelves housing an extensive library of Chinese classical literature. \u201cIt was here,\u201d noted Aldrich, \u201cwith the background trappings of a scholar, that he met Nixon and Kissinger in 1972.\u201d Most subsequent leaders have preferred to keep a house outside the Zhongnanhai compound. Deng Xiaoping lived, from 1977, in a courtyard house on a nearby lane adjacent to Beihai, the \u201cNorthern Sea\u201d of central Beijing\u2019s chain of lakes. While not officially disclosed, it is believed that more contemporary leaders, including Xi Jinping and his predecessors Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, have maintained homes in an exclusive gated compound in Jade Spring Hill, sometimes called the \u201cback garden\u201d of Chinese politics, out to the city\u2019s west. Aldrich noted that those leaders and party cadres who used Zhongnanhai as their primary residence often attracted unwelcome scrutiny for their activities, particularly during years of political turbulence. \u201cIn his memoirs, Chairman Mao\u2019s physician, Li Zhisui, commented that (the complex\u2019s) residents were always under surveillance,\u201d Aldrich said. \u201cDuring the Cultural Revolution, the simple act of making a fire would bring down the wrath of the security guards on the perpetrator. It was believed that such a fire was proof that incriminating or seditious materials were being destroyed.\u201d The imperial gardens offering vistas of Zhongnanhai\u2019s lakes have, today, been filled in with dozens of gray offices and meeting halls, many of which date to 1970s, when Zhongnanhai underwent significant razing and renovation \u2014 the rebuilding was so extensive that one visitor in 1979 described the grounds resembling a construction site, with muddy roads that were impossible to walk on. The contemporary compound splits roughly in two, with the northern buildings, on the banks of the \u201cmiddle lake,\u201d used as the headquarters of China\u2019s top executive body, the State Council. It is here that foreign dignitaries are admitted. Around the \u201csouthern lake,\u201d meanwhile, are the headquarters of the CCP, including, within Qinzheng Hall (the Hall of Diligent Government), the offices of the general secretary of the party (a post currently held by Xi). Many of the most historically significant political events to occur at Zhongnanhai have taken place in Huairen Hall, or the Hall of Cherished Compassion, on the western side of the Middle Lake. The hall was added to the imperial park during the late Qing dynasty, but was then extensively remodeled by the CCP in the early 1950s to impart a more august socialist grandeur. It is a broad, imposing ceremonial hall with staggered roofs of glazed green tiles falling in curved lines to upturned corners; the facade of austere grey brick is interrupted by red wooden pillars, windows and doors. The building\u2019s capacious interior houses a large auditorium, as well as numerous smaller meeting rooms. The hall has, for decades, served as the main meeting place for China\u2019s Politburo, the party\u2019s decision-making body usually comprising about two dozen members. On occasion, it has also hosted the Politburo\u2019s Standing Committee, the core of China\u2019s political elite, (the power of both bodies has notably dwindled in the era of Xi), though they most commonly meet in Qinzheng Hall, close to the general secretary\u2019s office. During the tumult of the Cultural Revolution vital discussions and debates occurred at Huairen Hall, and, in the months after its conclusion, it was there that three of the so-called Gang of Four \u2014 the political faction that included Mao\u2019s wife held responsible for the worst excesses of the era \u2014 were arrested, tricked into attending a meeting they thought was about the publication of the fifth volume of Mao\u2019s Selected Works. In April 1989, former party head Hu Yaobang suffered a heart-attack during a Politburo meeting at Huairen; his death a week later would trigger the Tiananmen Square protests that the government forcibly cracked down on in early June of that year. However, the compound hasn\u2019t always been so forbidden for the masses following the collapse of China\u2019s imperial dynasty. In the late 1920s, it became a park, with tourists allowed to boat on and swim in the lakes, while in the 1980s, the public could access some of its scenic and historical spots, including\u00a0Mao\u2019s\u00a0former residence, on\u00a0organized weekend tours.\u00a0Even early in 1989, a journalist for the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0was able to casually\u00a0drive\u00a0a senior official into the compound and drop him off inside.\u00a0During a period of warmer US and China relations in 2011, former Chinese president\u00a0Hu Jintao\u00a0invited\u00a0a group of American high school students to Zhongnanhai. Modern security concerns Today, Zhongnanhai is more closely-guarded than ever, though the inexorable development of the city has caused problems in maintaining the compound\u2019s secrecy. When an annex to the nearby Beijing Hotel was built in\u00a01973, authorities were panicked by the realization that from its upper floors one could quite easily see \u2013 and potentially target a sniper rifle \u2013 into Zhongnanhai. A building was hastily erected on the western edge of the Forbidden City to restrict this view. Likewise in 2018, when Beijing\u2019s new tallest building was\u00a0completed\u00a0\u2013 the 528-meter Citic tower, better known as the \u201cZun\u201d \u2013 the country\u2019s national security apparatus reportedly requisitioned the top floors amid fears that visitors or occupants might be able to spy into the compound. Beijing authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the security situation at the time. Zhongnanhai\u2019s entrance, Xinhuamen, has also been the site of repeated demonstrations in recent decades; in 1989, it was a gathering point for students taking part in the Tiananmen protests, whilst in 1999, more than 10,000 members of the since-banned Falun Gong gathered on the sidewalks near Zhongnanhai to protest their treatment at the hands of the government. So, while Zhongnanhai is sometimes compared to the White House, Aldrich argues that the paranoia with which the compound is today guarded makes it more like the imperial palace of centuries past: \u201cSince ordinary people are not allowed to enter Zhongnanhai, it is probably more appropriate to describe it as a \u2018New Forbidden City\u2019 for China\u2019s ruling elite rather than a place with a personal political resonance for the average citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cHeck, even the Kremlin is open to tourists!\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/05/25/style/zhongnanhai-architecture-history-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_06_25_style_australia-mona-museum-picasso-restroom-intl-hnk", "text": "A museum in Australia has moved Picasso artworks to a women\u2019s restroom, skirting a discrimination complaint by a male visitor who couldn\u2019t enter an exhibit where the works were previously hung. Two paintings and a drawing by Pablo Picasso  were originally featured in American artist and museum curator  Kirsha Kaechele\u2019s \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d installation at Tasmania\u2019s Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) \u2013 \u00a0which opened in December 2020 \u2013 \u201cto any and all ladies.\u201d The experiential artwork was billed by the museum as a \u201ctremendously lavish space\u201d where women can indulge in \u201cdecadent nibbles, fancy tipples, and other ladylike pleasures\u201d served by a male butler while they peruse art in a green velvet-draped room. But MONA was ordered to stop refusing entry to \u201cpersons who do not identify as ladies\u201d after the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal ruled in April that the show violated Australia\u2019s 1998 Anti-Discrimination Act. Kaechele told the tribunal that denying men entry to the mysterious room was indeed part of the art \u2014 giving\u00a0them\u00a0a taste of the discrimination and exclusion many women have experienced through history. The Picasso pieces are now displayed in an upgraded restroom with a fully functional toilet dubbed \u201cLadies Room,\u201d located within the art venue, Kaechele said in an e-mail. \u201cWhile the Ladies Lounge undergoes a series of reforms to meet the exemptions required for reopening, I\u2019ve been doing a little redecorating. I thought a few of the bathrooms in the museum could do with an update,\u201d she added. \u201cSome Cubism in the cubicles.\u201d On Monday, Kaechele posted on Instagram a video and images of the relocated works in situ, and pointed out that the gendered restroom was also a first for the museum. She encouraged \u201call ladies\u201d to enjoy the new exhibition. \u2018Ladies Lounge\u2019 closed \u201cWe never had female toilets at Mona before, they were all unisex. But then the Ladies Lounge had to close thanks to a lawsuit brought on by a man. And I just didn\u2019t know what to do with all those Picassos\u2026,\u201d wrote Kaechele, who is also the wife of MONA\u2019s owner, David Walsh. Jason Lau, a visitor from New South Wales was barred from entering the \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d exhibit on April 1 in 2023. Lau, who had paid the $35 AUD ($23 USD) entry fee, believed he experienced direct gender discrimination. \u201cHe felt strongly enough about this to file a complaint with Equal Opportunities Tasmania,\u201d read the tribunal\u2019s notes. After the judgment, Kaechele said she would challenge the court\u2019s decision in the state\u2019s Supreme Court and offered several possibilities to revive the \u201cLadies Lounge\u201d concept. Among those ideas included finding loopholes under Section 27 of the Anti-Discrimination Act which lists exceptions on when discrimination against gender would be permitted. In the meantime the lounge closed so that it wouldn\u2019t have to open to men.

It also issued a notice saying it will be suspending inspections along two roads in Gaza City, in the north of the Gaza Strip, to allow civilians to reach humanitarian zones more easily and quickly as the city \u201cwill remain a dangerous combat zone.\u201d \u201cWe announce to you that Tariq Bin Ziyad and Omar Al-Mukhtar Streets are considered safe passages to cross west to Al-Rashid (Al-Bahr) Street and from there south. Al-Wahda and Khalil Al-Wazir streets are considered safe passages to cross east to the Al-Zaytoun neighborhood and the city roundabout, and from there to Salah Al-Din Street to the south,\u201d an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) flier dropped on the city said. Gaza City experienced shelling overnight on Wednesday. A local journalist told CNN the building he was sheltering in had been struck, forcing him to move with his family once more. Bakeries \u2018completely closed\u2019 Gaza\u2019s Civil Defense spokesman Mahmoud Bassal told CNN he was aware of dozens of deaths in the industrial zone, east of Gaza City, and the financial hub in the center. Bassal added that several Palestinians are besieged in the Jordanian hospital and at Al-Aqsa University in the city, as the situation remains dangerous. \u201cToday, suddenly, all bakeries in Gaza are completely closed. It seems that there are instructions for them to do so, or that they fall in the red zone,\u201d he added. Charity group M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said on Wednesday that it was forced to shut its last health facility in northern Gaza after Israel\u2019s evacuation order. \u201cTeams continued to provide patient care until the last minute, before fleeing the area that came under heavy fire,\u201d MSF said on X.  Residents could be seen walking down Salah Al-Din Street from northern Gaza with their belongings. Some held white flags made of sticks and white shirts. Baraa, a young man pushing a bicycle, said he was staying alone with his brother in northern Gaza, but \u201cthe situation became very difficult, there is no food.\u201d A woman from Shajaiya, one of Gaza City\u2019s biggest neighborhoods, said the area had come under persistent shelling, adding that she saw many people dead in the streets. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned the directive for residents to leave Gaza City threatened to intensify the plight of already displaced communities. The IDF has been issuing evacuation orders affecting large parts of Gaza City since Sunday, urging 250,000 residents to head to \u201csafe zones\u201d further south, in Deir al-Balah and al-Zawaida. The IDF has said that evacuation orders are necessary so that civilians don\u2019t get caught up in its renewed operations in areas where Hamas is seeking to re-establish a presence. The IDF insists it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. Hamas has said the evacuations threaten to return negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage deal to \u201cpoint zero.\u201d \u201cEvery day they would tell us to evacuate and we are displaced from one place to another while quadcaptors are shooting at us,\u201d Mahmoud Al Shaqra, a resident of Gaza City, told CNN as he evacuated southwards. \u201cGaza City is completely destroyed, it is unlivable,\u201d Al Sharqa said. \u201cThere is no food or drink or anything here.

{"id": "2024_07_10_asia_afghanistan-taliban-life-un-report-intl-hnk", "text": "Listening to music, smoking hookah, and getting a Western-style haircut are all punishable acts under the suffocating rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan, according to a new UN report. The Taliban\u2019s so-called morality police have curtailed human rights \u2013 disproportionately targeting women and girls \u2013 creating a \u201cclimate of fear and intimidation,\u201d said the report by the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) published Tuesday. The Ministry of the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (MPVPV), established by the Taliban when it seized power in 2021, is charged with legislating and enforcing the Taliban\u2019s strict interpretations of Islamic law. Those interpretations include a ban on activities deemed to be \u201cun-Islamic\u201d including displaying images of humans and animals and celebrating Valentine\u2019s Day. Moreover, the report said, the Taliban\u2019s instructions are issued in a variety of formats \u2013 often only verbally \u2013 and are inconsistently and unpredictably enforced. When the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021 in a\u00a0lightning takeover\u00a0following the chaotic withdrawal of US-led troops after two decades of war, the radical Islamist group appeared keen to distance itself from its earlier period of rule in the 1990s, presenting itself as more moderate. However, this report found many of the same rules of that era have been revived, despite the Taliban\u2019s earlier pledge to honor women\u2019s rights within the norms of \u201cIslamic law.\u201d Between August 15, 2021, and March 31, 2024, the UN documented at least 1,033 instances where Taliban officers had used violence to enforce their rules. \u201cThe de facto MPVPV reportedly has a broad mandate and various enforcement methods have been used, including verbal intimidation, arrests and detentions, ill treatment and public lashing,\u201d said the report, which was compiled using public announcements and documented reports of human rights violations. The Taliban\u2019s violations against women and girls are so severe that one senior UN official recently said they could amount to \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d This report details how the MPVPV is enforcing rules on the way women dress and access public places. The Taliban has arbitrarily shuttered women-owned businesses, made it illegal for women to appear in movies, closed women\u2019s beauty salons and restricted access to birth control, the UN report said. Women in Afghanistan are not allowed to access parks, gyms and public baths \u2013 sometimes the only way to get hot water in the winter \u2013 and must be accompanied by a male guardian (a mahram) when traveling more than 78 kilometers (48.5 miles) from their homes, according to the report. While women must wear a hijab, men must also follow rules about beard length and hairstyles. In December 2023, the morality police closed 20 barbershops for one night after barbers allegedly shaved and trimmed beards, as well as Western-style haircuts, the report said. The Taliban denied claims two barbers were detained for two nights. The report said they were only released after promising not to give those haircuts again. UN says Taliban is legally obligated to protect human rights Afghanistan is party to seven international human rights instruments and as a result is legally obliged to protect and promote the human rights of its citizens, the UN report pointed out. These rules violate a slew of human rights, from the right to work and attain a living, to the rights of freedom of movement and expression, to sexual and reproductive rights, the report added. In a statement, the Taliban called the UN\u2019s criticism \u201cunfounded\u201d and said the report\u2019s authors were \u201cattempting to evaluate Afghanistan from a Western perspective, which is incorrect.\u201d \u201cAfghanistan should be assessed as a Muslim society, where the vast majority of the population are Muslims who have made significant sacrifices for the establishment of a Sharia system,\u201d the statement said. However, reports from Afghanistan suggest the Taliban\u2019s repressive control over women has led to a sharp rise in suicide attempts. CNN interviewed a 16-year-old girl who drank battery acid to escape life under the Taliban, saying she was \u201coverwhelmed by hopelessness\u201d after spending months at home due to a ban on girls in secondary education. Among the Taliban\u2019s list of prohibitions, according to the report, is the public display of human and animal images, which it deems \u201cun-Islamic.\u201d This law has resulted in the removal of advertising signage and the covering of shop mannequins, the report said. The UN reported some cases where NGOs were told to remove human images from materials meant to alert children or other people with limited literacy about the risk of unexploded artillery and other public health issues. Media is heavily restricted, and residents live in a surveillance state, the report added. \u201cPeople\u2019s right to privacy is violated through searches for prohibited items in their phone or cars, having their attendance at mosques recorded, or being required to show proof of family relationship in public places.\u201d The Taliban met with top UN officials and global envoys in Qatar in June in a two-day conference that excluded Afghan women, sparking outcry from human rights groups. In a press conference after the meeting, Rosemary DiCarlo, the UN\u2019s under-secretary-general for political and peacebuilding affairs, called the discussions \u201cfrank\u201d and \u201cuseful,\u201d and said that the \u201cconcerns and views of Afghan women and civil society were front and center.\u201d This was the third UN meeting about Afghanistan in Doha, but the first the Taliban has attended.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/asia/afghanistan-taliban-life-un-report-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_08_asia_india-narendra-modi-russia-visit-intl", "text": "India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Russia on Monday for his first visit to the country since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a sign that the two nations remain close despite the Kremlin\u2019s deepening dependence on China. During his two-day visit, Modi is expected to attend a private dinner hosted by Vladimir Putin and hold talks with the Russian president, according to India\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal. The summit will \u201cprovide an opportunity to the two leaders to review the whole range of bilateral issues,\u201d Jaiswal told reporters in New Delhi last week, adding that Modi and Putin will \u201calso share perspectives on regional and global developments of mutual interest.\u201d India remains heavily reliant on the Kremlin for its military equipment and has ramped up purchases of discounted Russian crude oil, giving Putin\u2019s nation a major financial lifeline as it faces isolation from the West. Trade between the two countries was worth nearly $65 billion in 2023-24, primarily due to strong energy cooperation,\u00a0but most of that total flowed toward Russia, Jaiswal said. Reducing the trade imbalance would be a \u201cmatter of priority\u201d in Modi\u2019s discussions with Putin, he added. Modi last met with Putin on the sidelines of the 2022 SCO meeting in Uzbekistan, when he told the Russian leader: \u201cNow is not the time for war.\u201d But while India has called for a cessation of hostilities in Ukraine and restoration of peace, it has also abstained from all resolutions on Ukraine at the United Nations and stopped short of condemning Russia\u2019s invasion. \u201cI look forward to reviewing all aspects of bilateral cooperation with my friend President Vladimir Putin and sharing perspectives on various regional and global issues,\u201d Modi said in a statement from his office before departing for Russia. \u201cWe seek to play a supportive role for a peaceful and stable region.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, speaking in the wake of Russia\u2019s deadly attacks on Ukraine Monday, said it was a \u201chuge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy hug the world\u2019s most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day.\u201d Following Modi\u2019s arrival, Putin showed the Indian leader around his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo in the Moscow region. They greeted each other with a hug, chatted over tea and rode around in an electric vehicle. Putin also showed Modi the stables and they watched a horse show. The trip is Modi\u2019s first bilateral visit since winning a third consecutive term in a massive general election last month and is seen as a rare break in convention for an Indian leader who typically travels to neighboring countries such as Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The visit also comes as Russia draws ever closer to China, potentially making New Delhi uncomfortable due to its longstanding Himalayan border dispute with Beijing, which has simmered in recent years. Modi\u2019s trip follows Putin\u2019s return from Kazakhstan, where the Russian leader last week attended the annual leaders\u2019 meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a bloc of Eurasian countries spearheaded by China and Russia, at which he claimed\u00a0Moscow-Beijing relations were experiencing \u201cthe best period in their history.\u201d For India, that burgeoning relationship is \u201ca matter of deep concern,\u201d\u00a0said Nandan Unnikrishnan, a fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. \u201cThat is one of the reasons that Mr. Modi is undertaking this trip because traditionally, the Soviet Union and then subsequently Russia, has been a balancer in our relationship with China, which has been not the best since the late \u201950s of the last century,\u201d he said. Despite India being an SCO member, Modi was visibly absent from the meeting in Kazakhstan, indicating to some analysts that the leader of the world\u2019s largest democracy does not view the bloc as an effective channel through which New Delhi can pursue its interests. Modi\u2019s visit to Russia is also widely seen as the latest dent in efforts by Western leaders to cast Putin aside. Despite undermining Western sanctions by purchasing large quantities of Russian oil, New Delhi has remained close with the United States, a key partner as both countries share concerns over China\u2019s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. Modi met with US President Joe Biden during a\u00a0state visit to Washington\u00a0in June last year, in a trip further cementing their defense, trade and technology partnership. The Indian leader also addressed Congress during that trip, an honor typically reserved for close US allies and partners, and attended a lavish state dinner. India is a member of the Quad security grouping with the US, Japan and Australia. Later that year, Putin did not attend the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in New Delhi, during which leaders delivered a consensus statement criticizing his invasion of Ukraine. Following his Russia trip, Modi will visit Austria in the Indian leader\u2019s first visit to the European nation, according to his office.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/asia/india-narendra-modi-russia-visit-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_asia_pakistan-extends-visas-afghans-intl-hnk", "text": "Pakistan is extending the stay of nearly 1.5 million registered Afghan refugees \u2013 but its mass deportation of \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d will continue, authorities said. Afghan refugees in Pakistan with Proof of Registration (POR) cards will be able to stay in the country until June 30, 2025, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s office said Wednesday. The fate of 1.45 million refugees whose PORs expired at the end of June had previously been in doubt, with many fearing they\u2019d be deported. News of the extension came one day after the United Nations\u2019 high commissioner for refugees visited Afghanistan and urged Pakistan to extend the POR cards. \u201cGlad that Pakistan\u2019s tradition of hospitality is maintained,\u201d Filippo Grandi wrote on X Thursday. But Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs disputed the UN\u2019s claims that Islamabad had put on hold its plan announced last October to deport undocumented Afghan refugees. The \u201c(Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan) remains in place and is being implemented in an orderly and phased manner,\u201d spokesperson Mumtaz Baloch told CNN Thursday. Pakistan is home to one of the world\u2019s largest refugee populations \u2013 most of them from Afghanistan. But the country has not always welcomed Afghan refugees, subjecting them to hostile living conditions and threatening deportation over the years. More than 3 million Afghan refugees, including registered refugees and more than 800,000 undocumented people were living in Pakistan as of March 2024, according to UNHCR data. Some fled their home country decades ago during the Soviet invasion, while other Afghans sought refuge in Pakistan when the Taliban retook Afghanistan in 2021, implementing its oppressive rule. Last October, Pakistan gave undocumented Afghans weeks to leave or face deportation, claiming Afghan nationals carried out 14 of 24 major terrorist attacks in Pakistan last year.\u00a0Between September 15, 2023 and the end of June, about 650,000 Afghans had returned home, according to the UNHCR. Some 32,000 of them were deported. They\u2019re returning to a country under the control of a militant regime that has imposed a form of gender apartheid and where millions live in poverty. A UN report published Tuesday detailed human rights violations by the Taliban\u2019s so-called morality police \u2013 which have disproportionately targeted women and girls \u2013 creating a \u201cclimate of fear and intimidation\u201d in Afghanistan. Moniza Kakar, a lawyer who helps Afghan migrants navigate Pakistan\u2019s legal system, said the POR card extension will not provide stability for all refugees. \u201cAfghan communities that I have spoken to are still concerned since there are many instances of households where a man might have a POR card and his wife and kids would have no documentation,\u201d Kakar told CNN. \u201cThere is still a huge worry amongst families of being split because of these issues of documentation.\u201d Thyagi Ruwanpathirana, regional researcher for South Asia at Amnesty International, said the human rights group had \u201cdocumented extensive delays and barriers refugees face in obtaining POR cards.\u201d The status of 80,000 Afghan Citizen Card holders, another form of registration for Afghan refugees in Pakistan, was also uncertain, Ruwanpathirana added. \u201cWe urge the government of Pakistan to formally suspend its \u2018Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan,\u2019 stop all deportations, and develop a national legal framework to regulate access to refugee status in line with international refugee law,\u201d she said.

{"id": "2024_07_11_americas_panama-darien-gap-barbed-wire-migrants-intl-latam", "text": "Panama\u00a0has placed barbed wire across several routes in the Dari\u00e9n Gap, the country\u2019s Ministry of Public Security said in a statement Thursday, in a bid to block migrants making their way north. At least five passages near Panama\u2019s border with Colombia have been shut using barbed wire installed by\u00a0the country\u2019s border agency (Senafront). Meanwhile, Panama\u2019s navy is patrolling areas in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean. The government said the navy is instructed to stop and detain people traveling by boat with \u201cirregular migrants\u201d and to hand them over to police or immigration authorities from Colombia. On land, border authorities have closed irregular access areas with the goal of rerouting people through established border points. The United States and Panama signed\u00a0an agreement this month on immigration issues that aimed to \u201cclose the passage of illegal migrants\u201d through the Dari\u00e9n Gap. Panama\u2019s President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino has also vowed to stop the Central American country from being a transit route for migrants. \u201cI will not allow\u00a0Panama\u00a0to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,\u201d Mulino\u00a0said at his swearing-in ceremony on July 1. Mulino visited the Dari\u00e9n Gap days before Thursday\u2019s announcement, saying 300 border agents were going to be deployed to monitor the area and declaring that no one would enter\u00a0Panamanian territory without a passport or a valid document. Colombia\u2019s Ombudsman\u2019s Office has criticized Panama\u2019s latest move saying that the barbed wires affect at least one Colombian town\u2019s commercial and cultural exchange with areas in\u00a0Panama. \u201cThe barbed wires in the jungle will only bring drowned people into the sea. Migration is stopped by removing economic blockades and improving the economy of the south,\u201d Colombia\u2019s President Gustavo Petro wrote on X. The Dari\u00e9n\u00a0Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, has seen an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the\u00a0Dari\u00e9n\u00a0Gap\u00a0brings migrants from Colombia to\u00a0Panama\u00a0and is a crucial passage for those \u2013 many of whom come from other Latin American countries \u2013 hoping to reach the US and Canada. Panamanian figures show at least 174,513 migrants crossed the treacherous Dari\u00e9n\u00a0Gap, from January to June 6 of this year. The latest figures are higher than around the same period in 2023, when more than 166,000 crossings were reported, according to\u00a0Panama\u2019s National Migration Service. According to migration service figures, a record 520,000 people crossed the jungle last year. Other countries along the migration route have also taken steps to restrict people\u2019s movement.

{"id": "2024_07_11_europe_macron-france-mainstream-coalition-intl", "text": "Three days after the second round of France\u2019s snap parliamentary election ended in gridlock, President Emmanuel Macron broke his silence to urge mainstream parties to form a solid majority in the National Assembly and shut out the extremes. France\u2019s vote, which Macron unexpectedly called after his party was trounced by Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (RN) party in last month\u2019s European elections, has tipped France into political limbo, after none of the three main blocs came close to forming an absolute majority. In an open letter to the French people published Wednesday, Macron called on parties with \u201crepublican values\u201d \u2013 understood to exclude parties on the far left and far right \u2013 to form a coalition large enough to pass laws in parliament. Macron\u2019s comments suggest he is unwilling to work with the more extreme part of the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition, which secured the most seats in the French parliament in Sunday\u2019s second-round vote, but not enough to govern independently. \u201cI call on all political forces that recognize themselves in republican institutions, the rule of law, parliamentarianism, a European orientation and the defense of French independence, to engage in sincere and loyal dialogue to build a solid majority, necessarily plural, for the country,\u201d wrote Macron. Macron said it was \u201cin light of these principles\u201d that he will decide on the appointment of France\u2019s next prime minister. \u201cThis means giving the political forces a little time to build these compromises with serenity and respect for each other,\u201d he said. The NFP won 182 seats in the National Assembly, making it the largest group in the 577-seat parliament. Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble alliance, which trailed in a distant third in the first round, mounted a strong recovery to win 163 seats. And the RN and its allies, despite leading the first round, won 143 seats. It is customary for the French president to appoint a prime minister from the largest parliamentary group \u2013 in this case the NFP \u2013 and ask it to form a government. But Macron and his Ensemble allies have repeatedly refused to enter into coalition with the far-left France Unbowed, the largest single party within the NFP, and have accused its leader, the 72-year-old firebrand Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, of being just as extreme and unfit to govern as figures on the far right. The NFP formed days after Macron called the snap vote, and chose its name in an attempt to resurrect the original Popular Front that blocked the far right from gaining power in 1936. After tactical voting and political bargaining between centrist and left-wing voters, the NFP managed the same feat in Sunday\u2019s second round. But the NFP does not speak with a single voice. The various parties in the coalition straddle vast ideological ground, from the far-left France Unbowed to the more moderate Place Publique and Socialist parties. When the shock result was announced, each party celebrated separately, and the bloc still has not nominated a leader to become prime minister. M\u00e9lenchon has stated his intention to govern France. In a victory speech Sunday evening near Stalingrad Square in Paris, he said Macron \u201chas the duty\u201d to ask the NFP to form a government. Unlike its neighbors Italy and Germany, France \u2013 with its presidential system \u2013 lacks the culture of coalition-building and compromise, meaning the formation of a new government could take weeks and prove fleeting. Newly-elected members of parliament, called \u201cdeputies,\u201d are scheduled to take their seats for the first time on July 18. But without a clear majority, a minority government faces the risk of no-confidence votes, which could lead to several governments replacing each other in quick succession.

{"id": "2024_07_09_americas_american-mountaineer-body-found-peru-intl-latam", "text": "The body of an American mountaineer has been discovered by a pair of fellow US climbers 22 years after he went missing following an avalanche in the Peruvian Andes. American\u00a0brothers\u00a0Ryan Cooper and Wesley Waren found the body of Bill Stampfl on June 27 on Mount Huascaran,\u00a0according to Joseph Stampfl, Bill\u2019s son. The climbers had been descending the mountain in Peru\u2019s Cordillera Blanca after an unsuccessful attempt to reach its 22,000 ft summit when they found the body, at about 16,500 ft. Cooper told CNN Tuesday they noticed an object that didn\u2019t quite blend into the landscape and decided to investigate. He said the ice had preserved the body and its belongings and Stampfl\u2019s wedding ring, helmet, mountain climbing boots, and jacket were all intact. The brothers managed to identify Stampfl by finding a bag attached to his body, inside which they found his identification card, a camera, passport, wallet, and glasses \u2013 all of which were also intact, Cooper explained. \u201cSomeone loved him and someone wanted him to come home,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cAs soon as I found out he was an American climber I knew we had a responsibility to track down the family and give them the news,\u201d Cooper said. Stampfl and two of his fellow climbers and\u00a0friends, Steve Erskine\u00a0and Matthew Richardson, were all killed by an avalanche on Mount Huascaran on June 24, 2002, his daughter Jennifer Stampfl told CNN on Tuesday. Their bodies were never discovered, except for Erskine\u2019s, she said. Stampfl was 58-years-old at the time. His body was retrieved and brought down the mountain on July 5 by the Peruvian Mountain Rescue Association and Peruvian National Police after coordination with Cooper and Stampfl\u2019s family. His body was taken to a morgue in the town of Yungay for an autopsy, Peru\u2019s National Police posted on X on Tuesday. The US State Department confirmed the death of a US citizen in Peru. \u201cWe offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss and thank the mountaineers and the Peruvian National Police rescue team who have been involved in this operation,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said, adding it was providing assistance to the family. Finding Bill\u2019s family Cooper, a native of Las Vegas, Nevada, called his wife and informed her of his discovery the same day he came across Stampfl\u2019s\u00a0body. He\u00a0asked her for help in finding Stampfl\u2019s\u00a0family, as he was still on Mount Huascaran with limited cellular service. After much online research, Cooper\u2019s wife was able to locate Joseph and called him on June 29. \u201cI told him I know the location of his dad. I told him about the ring and personal items,\u201d Cooper said. His motive was to help the family find closure, Cooper explained. With \u201cno body, there\u2019s no way to find peace with that,\u201d Cooper said. Cooper also spoke to Jennifer and Stampfl\u2019s widow Janet on the phone before sending photos of Stampfl\u2019s ID and other belongings to the family. \u2018My heart just sank\u2019 After so many years, the news came as an emotional shock to Stampfl\u2019s family. \u201cMy heart just sank. After 22 years I had been okay with the fact that he\u2019s there. He\u2019s part of the mountain. Like we\u2019re never going to get him back. The fact that they found him, it opened up all the wounds,\u201d Jennifer told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cThere is no preparation for having your husband killed instantaneously,\u201d Janet said, adding that she never thought her husband\u2019s body would be discovered. \u201cIt\u2019s an answer to so many prayers by so many people.\u201d Janet said her husband loved climbing mountains. \u201cHe enjoyed it so much. He said he always felt closest to God when he got to the top of the mountain,\u201d Janet said. \u201cAfter 22 years\u2026I was a little shocked, it took me a while to process everything,\u201d Joseph said, adding \u201cnow it\u2019s time to bring him home hopefully.\u201d Following an autopsy in Yungay, Stampfl\u2019s body was transferred to the city of Juarez, Joseph explained. Stampfl will be taken to a funeral home in Lima where he will be cremated, and the ashes will be sent to the family in the United States. \u2018A dangerous landscape\u2019 While Cooper is grateful to have finally been able to bring closure to the Stampfl family, the discovery was also tinged with sadness. He had hoped that Richardson\u2019s body might have been attached to Stampfl by a rope, but that was not the case and \u201che\u2019s still missing as of today.\u201d He also fears that global warming may have played a role in his discovery, by thawing the ice on what is considered the world\u2019s highest tropical mountain range. \u201cHe was fully exposed and not in ice anymore. The thawing process happened,\u201d Cooper said. Since the 1950s, almost all of the world\u2019s glaciers have been retreating, according to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. On average, the glaciers in the Andean region \u2013 Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru \u2013 have lost over 50 per cent of their coverage since the 1960s. \u201cThe Andes is deteriorating more than any other mountain range in the region,\u201d Cooper said, adding that the changing conditions were part of what had prevented him from summiting Mount Huascaran. \u201cGlaciers are melting away, the landscape has changed. It poses a dangerous landscape now,\u201d he said.

The power of a Giorgio Armani suit. The designer\u2019s legacy has always been enmeshed in tailoring.

Then in the 1990s he streamlined the puffed-out silhouette altogether \u2014 designing slouchy yet sophisticated pieces in linens and silks still emulated on runways and red carpets today. His oeuvre is also synonymous with another subversion of the norm: Greige, the creamy, earth-toned hue which became a trusted leitmotif throughout the designer\u2019s collections. In his nine decades, the formally untrained Giorgio Armani has worked his way up from humble window dresser to Italian fashion behemoth \u2014 and has collected a number of fabulous moments in between.

Tasmania\u2019s Museum of Old and New Art\u00a0(MONA)\u00a0has been ordered to stop refusing entry to \u201cpersons who do not identify as ladies,\u201d to its Ladies Lounge exhibit within 28 days, after a ruling was made by the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal on Tuesday. The experiential artwork by artist and museum curator\u00a0Kirsha Kaechele\u00a0is billed by the museum as a \u201ctremendously lavish space\u201d where women can indulge in \u201cdecadent nibbles, fancy tipples, and other ladylike pleasures \u2014 hosted and entertained by the fabulous butler.\u201d Jason Lau, a visitor from New South Wales,\u00a0who had paid the museum\u2019s $35 AUD ($23 USD) entry fee, was barred from entering the exhibit\u00a0on\u00a0April 1 last year. According to tribunal documents, Lau believed he experienced direct gender discrimination. \u201cHe felt strongly enough about this to file a complaint with Equal Opportunities Tasmania,\u201d read the notes. During proceedings, Kaechele told the tribunal that denying men entry to the mysterious room is indeed part of the art \u2014 giving\u00a0them\u00a0a taste of the discrimination and exclusion many women have experienced through history. Kaechele said she believed that women\u00a0\u201cdeserve both equal rights and special privileges in the form of unequal rights,\u201d as a means of restitution for historical injustices, \u201cfor a minimum of 300 years.\u201d In its judgment, the tribunal recognized that the art exhibition had \u201ca pointedly participatory component that is intentionally discriminatory, for a good faith artistic purpose that many might not only appreciate but sympathise with or endorse.\u201d However, it also asserted that Australia\u2019s 1998 anti-discrimination act \u201cdoes not permit discrimination for good faith artistic purpose per se.\u201d An extension of the art Throughout the proceedings Kaechele and her supporters treated the tribunal as an extension of her art, wearing matching dark blue suits and synchronizing their movements. In her witness statement to the tribunal, the artist said: \u201cWe are so deeply embedded in the dominion of man that we do not even see the myriad ways in which we adhere to and multiply his reign.\u201d She added this is why the Ladies Lounge was needed as \u201ca peaceful space women can retreat to; a haven in which to think clearly, and relish the pure company of women \u2014 to escape the invisible story woven through history.\u201d Kaechele in an earlier interview with ABC\u2019s The Project, told the program she was \u201cgrateful\u201d for Lau\u2019s complaint, as it gave her the chance to test out the argument legally, but warned that a ruling in Lau\u2019s favor would mean the Ladies Lounge would have to close. \u201cBecause the requirement is that it will have to open to men, and that\u2019s not happening,\u201d she said. After Tuesday\u2019s ruling, MONA\u2019s official spokesperson told CNN that the institution was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the tribunal\u2019s decision. \u201cWe will take some time to absorb the result and consider our options,\u201d they said, adding: \u201cWe request that the artist\u2019s privacy is respected at this time.\u201d The museum\u2019s official Instagram\u00a0account posted a more explicit response: a photo of a velvet-clad hand, adorned with the initials KK, giving the middle finger, to which one user commented, \u201cI visited in 2021 with my husband and loved the novelty of being able to go into a space that no man was allowed into.

{"id": "2024_07_09_asia_korea-ac130j-ghostrider-gunship-biggest-gun-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "As the US Air Force AC-130J flies over South Korea\u2019s towering apartment blocks, its powerful cameras can almost see inside\u00a0windows on the highest floors. Aiming farther afield, the weapons officers on the four-engine aircraft, nicknamed Ghostrider, can pick out objects at 50,000 feet, almost 10 miles away \u2013 all potential targets for the biggest gun ever mounted on a fixed-wing plane. CNN got an exclusive look inside the aircraft, assigned to Air Force Special Operations Command, in early June after it flew from its home base in Hurlburt Field, Florida, for joint drills in South Korea. In a live-fire exercise, the 105-millimeter howitzer pumped out 43-pound shells, into a firing range east of Seoul, the force of each blast so powerful that it pushed the tail of the 80-ton plane six feet to the right. About eight seconds after firing, the shells hit the range 10,000 feet below, sending smoke billowing skyward as the controllers of the big gun watched the results of their handiwork on large video screens in the middle of the aircraft. \u201cAssess two tanks destroyed,\u201d a scratchy voice confirms in the radio headsets of the AC-130 crew. Pilot Capt. John Ikenberry said the AC-130\u2019s presence for drills in South Korea was designed to send a simple message to its belligerent neighbor North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un. \u201cIt shows we are ready,\u201d Ikenberry said. Tensions have been simmering on the peninsula in recent months. The North has been sending balloons filled with trash to areas in and near Seoul and testing missiles, and South Korean troops have fired warning shots as North Korean soldiers from the North have crossed the military demarcation line in the middle of the demilitarized zone. Just this week, North Korea criticized live-fire exercises in the South in late June and early July as an \u201c\u2018inexcusable and explicit provocation.\u201d Meanwhile, Washington has kept a steady stream of hardware heading to the South for land, air and sea exercises leading up to one of their biggest yearly exercises, Ulchi Freedom Shield, set to begin later this summer. Experience they can\u2019t get stateside The AC-130J, the newest version of the US Air Force Hercules gunships, is testing its mettle in Korea for the second year in a row. Maj. Heath Curtis, combat systems officer on the Hercules, says it\u2019s important for the gunship to make the flight across the Pacific because it offers experience training where a conflict could be fought with conditions that can\u2019t be duplicated on firing ranges in Florida or New Mexico that the gunship would use in the United States. The mountain ranges and ridges of the Korean Peninsula present wind conditions not found elsewhere, he says, and that can make a difference even to a projectile traveling more than 800 mph. It also gives the chance for Curtis and a second officer seated at AC-130\u2019s weapons control center the chance to practice alongside South Korean allies they may need to protect in the event of a ground war on the peninsula. The huge television monitors bring the battlefield below up close in both regular and infrared definition. The cameras mounted outside the plane can zoom in on details to ensure weapons fire is accurate. \u201cThe unique thing about the AC-130 is the amount of fire that we bring, the amount of munitions \u2013 the diverse amount of them \u2013 and the amount of loiter time we can provide,\u201d says the mission commander for this gunship, Maj. Josh Burris. Besides the 105-millimeter howitzer, the AC-130J carries a 30-millimeter cannon and can launch precision-guided missiles and bombs from pylons on its wings. With the weapons\u2019 near-pinpoint accuracy, it can fire on enemy positions within shouting distance of friendly troops, earning the aircraft the title of \u201cthe infantryman\u2019s best friend\u201d in some circles. And with air-to-air refueling, it can, in theory, stay on station supporting ground forces as long as the crew and ammunition can last. \u2018Spooky\u2019 history US Air Force gunships trace their lineage back to the Vietnam War, when the service set up 7.62 mm guns to fire out one side of a C-47 transport aircraft. With that configuration, the aircraft could circle a single point and deliver massive, continuous firepower on it, from its guns that could fire 6,000 rounds in a minute, according to Air Force fact sheets. The firepower and the flares they used to light up targets during night missions earned them the nicknames \u201cSpooky\u201d and \u201cPuff the Magic Dragon.\u201d As the war went on, the Air Force looked for a heavier airframe for the gunship role and turned to C-130 Hercules transports. The first conversion of a C-130 to an AC-130 saw action over Southeast Asia in 1967, according to the National Museum of the US Air Force. With their ability to support troops in close combat, AC-130 gunships in different variations have seen action in conflicts including Grenada, Panama, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan and have saved an untold number of lives, according to the Air Force. With the AC-130J model, introduced in 2017, the Air Force removed the machine guns in favor of the more precision-guided munitions. But there have been problems, too, including a 2015 attack on a Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, that killed left 42 patients, staff and caretakersdead. Despite the formidable firepower it carries, the AC-130 flies low and slow, making it vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. And seven AC-130 gunships have been lost over the years, the last being on January 31, 1991, when an Iraqi surface-to-air missile brought down a AC-130H during Operation Desert Storm, according to Air Force news releases. The plane crashed into the Persian Gulf while supporting US Marines during a battle in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, killing all 14 crew aboard. The AC-130\u2019s crew acknowledges the dangers of ground fire to their aircraft, and some analysts question its usefulness in any potential conflict with North Korea. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t be operated within say 100 nautical miles of the border as they\u2019re too vulnerable to North Korean border air defenses,\u201d says Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and former Royal Australian Air Force officer. But Layton says the gunships could be helpful supporting allied troops who might be trying to round up North Korean special forces units that had managed to infiltrate deeper into southern territory. Still, he cautioned, \u201cif a war starts there, try not to be on an AC-130 unless it\u2019s heading out of theater.\u201d Maj. Christopher Mesnard, Special Operations Command Korea public affairs director, said the AC-130J is a suitable weapon system for the Korean Peninisula. \u201cWe have the utmost confidence in our ability to operate weapons systems\u00a0\u200blike the AC-130J in times and places of our choosing and in a way that adequately considers risks, regardless of the region,\u201d he said.

Carol Hunt, 61, wife of BBC horse racing commentator, John Hunt, and their daughters, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, died from injuries sustained in an attack in Bushey, just northwest of London, on Tuesday, according to police and Britain\u2019s public broadcaster. A 26-year-old suspect wanted in connection with the killings, and named as Kyle Clifford, was found by British police in Enfield, north London, on Wednesday, following a sprawling manhunt. There were no previous reports to the force over Clifford, who is in serious condition in hospital and is yet to speak with officers, Hertfordshire Police said in a statement. A crossbow was recovered as part of the investigation, which police believe was used in a \u201ctargeted incident.\u201d Epidemic of violence against women The killings of the three women rocked Britain, where mass murders are infrequent but violence against women and girls has been officially labeled as a national threat. A woman is killed by a man every three days in the UK and one in four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime, the United Nations\u2019 special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, Reem Alsalem,\u00a0said earlier this year. Charities and human rights organizations have subsequently reiterated urgent demands to tackle femicide in the UK. \u201cMale violence against women and girls is at epidemic levels,\u201d said SafeLives, a UK-based charity working to end domestic abuse, adding: \u201cDomestic abuse is a major public health crisis. It should be given the same priority as terrorism.\u201d Refuge, a UK-based non-profit providing support for survivors of domestic abuse, posted on X: \u201cOur thoughts are with Carol, Hannah and Louise Hunt and their family and friends following the devastating incident in Bushey.\u201d British Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called the attack \u201ctruly shocking,\u201d adding that she is \u201cbeing kept fully updated\u201d by authorities. The country\u2019s new Labour government campaigned on a manifesto to \u201ctackle the scourge of violence against women and girls\u201d in Britain, including a review of the sentencing process, and requiring forces to target repeat offenders with tools used for counter-terror and serious organized crime investigations. \u2018His life was ripped apart\u2019 An array of BBC journalists paid tributes to their colleague, in an outpouring of grief across the organization and wider sports industry. BBC Sport presenter Mark Chapman said: \u201cJohn\u00a0Hunt\u00a0is our colleague, and our friend, not just to the current 5 Live Sport team, but to all of those who have worked here with him over the past 20 years. \u201cOn behalf of everybody connected to 5 Live Sport, our love and thoughts and support are with\u00a0John\u00a0and his family,\u201d Chapman said live on air.

I can\u2019t remember feeling so utterly horrified in years. Those poor girls. Truly horrific.\u201d The British Horseracing Authority (BHA)\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0that its thoughts are with\u00a0Hunt, his family, and friends. \u201cIt is impossible to comprehend the horror that has been inflicted upon them by this dreadful event,\u201d Julie Harrington, the BHA chief executive, said. Ascot Racecourse, one of Britain\u2019s most famous horse-racing grounds, said that it echoed the BHA\u2019s words and posted that\u00a0\u201cour thoughts are with\u00a0John\u00a0Hunt\u00a0at this tragic time.\u201d Crossbow legislation in the UK The strength of crossbow laws in the UK was called into question last year, after a British man was incarcerated for breaking into Windsor Castle and planning to assassinate the late Queen Elizabeth II with the weapon in 2021. At the time, the former Conservative government did not change the legislation, despite launching an eight-week review of the rules and the possibility of introducing a licensing scheme. In Britain, it is legal for a person to buy or own a crossbow if they are over 18, though anyone who carries one in public without a reasonable excuse can face imprisonment.  Crossbow attacks in the UK are rare, with fewer than 10 homicides by crossbow between 2011 and 2021, according to the government. The British home secretary is now re-examining the country\u2019s crossbow laws, according to her colleague, security minister Dan Jarvis. \u201cWe are seized by the seriousness and the importance of this,\u201d Jarvis told the BBC\u2019s Today program on Thursday, adding that the new government has \u201cmade a manifesto commitment\u201d to halve violence against women and girls in Britain over a 10-year period. \u201cWe will move as quickly as we possibly can to reach a judgement about whether we do need to amend the existing legislative framework,\u201d he added.

{"id": "2024_07_11_australia_russian-born-couple-charged-australia-intl-hnk", "text": "Australia has charged two Russian-born Australian citizens with preparing for an espionage offense after allegedly obtaining information from the Australian Defence Force (ADF) that they planned to hand to Russian authorities. The citizens, a married couple, had been in Australia for more than 10 years and were arrested Thursday at their home in Everton Park, a northern suburb of Brisbane, according to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). The Russian-born woman, 40, was an army private working as an information systems technician with the ADF for several years, the agencies said in a joint news conference on Friday. She became an Australian citizen in 2016, and her Russian-born husband, 62, a self-employed laborer, obtained Australian citizenship in 2020, they added. \u201cThe AFP will allege the individuals worked together to access Australian Defence Force material that related to Australia\u2019s national security interests,\u201d said AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw. \u201cNo significant compromise,\u201d had been identified and no other individuals appeared to be involved, Kershaw added, though he said the investigation was in its early stages. The couple were not named by authorities, but both are expected to appear in court later on Friday. Australian Federal Police will allege the woman went to Russia without notifying Australian authorities while she was on long-term leave from the ADF last year. \u201cWe allege that while she was in Russia, she instructed her husband, who remained in Australia, on how to log into her official work account from their Brisbane home,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cWe allege her husband would access requested material and would send [it] to his wife in Russia. We allege they sought that information with the intention of providing it to Russian authorities.\u201d Kershaw said a key focus of the investigation is whether that information was handed over to Russian authorities. If it was, the charge could be upgraded to espionage. The investigation will include how the woman obtained security clearance to access sensitive ADF material, and how she was able to bypass systems to apparently travel undetected to Russia. \u201cThere was some misleading on her behalf of where she was allegedly at and what country,\u201d Kershaw said. It\u2019s the first time an espionage offense has been used since new laws were introduced in 2018. The charge of preparing for an espionage offense carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.\u00a0An upgraded charge carries a maximum term of 25 years in prison to life. ASIO Director-General Mike Burgess said the arrests demonstrated the strength of Australia\u2019s national security culture, not its deficiency. \u201cThe espionage threat is real. Multiple countries are seeking to steal Australia\u2019s secrets. We cannot be naive and we cannot be complacent,\u201d he said.

Panama is home to the Dari\u00e9n Gap, a mountainous rainforest region connecting South and Central America, that has seen an increase in the number of migrants willing to risk their lives and safety to cross it. The 66-mile (106-kilometer) hike through the Darien Gap brings migrants from Colombia to Panama and is a crucial passage for those hoping to reach the United States and Canada. News of the agreement comes after Panama\u2019s new President Jose Raul Mulino vowed on Monday that the Central American nation would no longer be a country of transit for migrants. \u201cI will not allow Panama to be a path open to thousands of people who enter our country illegally supported by an entire international organization related to drug and human trafficking,\u201d Mulino said at his swearing-in ceremony. \u201cPanama will no longer be a transit country for illegals,\u201d he said amid cheers from those present. \u201cThe numbers of illegal immigrants passing through the Dari\u00e9n are shocking,\u201d Mulino said, adding that he intends to \u201cappeal to international solidarity regarding the cause that generates the problem and will seek solutions with the countries involved, especially with the United States, which is the final destination of such immigrants.\u201d Mulino said that he\u2019s seen first-hand \u201cthe magnitude of the problem and the dimension of the humanitarian and environmental crisis\u201d that migration causes to the Dari\u00e9n Gap. \u201cThe Dari\u00e9n must continue to be a great green lung, not only for us but for the entire region.

The latest figures are higher than around the same period in 2023, when more than 166,000 crossings were reported, according to Panama\u2019s National Migration Service.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi \u201cstrongly raised the issue of early discharge\u201d to Russian President Vladimir Putin during his two-day trip to Moscow this week, stressing the need to bring all Indians home \u201cas early as possible,\u201d Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra told reporters in a news briefing. \u201cThe Russian side promised the early discharge of all Indian nationals from the service of the Russian army,\u201d he said. Moscow has not commented on the agreement, but New Delhi has been pushing for the release of its nationals from the Russian army for months, telling CNN in April that it was a \u201ctop priority.\u201d\u00a0The Indian Ministry of External Affairs\u00a0previously told CNN it has been in continuous contact with Russian authorities to secure their release. By some estimates, Russia has been sending thousands of foreign men to fight in Ukraine since Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of its southwestern neighbor in February 2022. Many of them are young men from South Asia, enticed by the prospect of steady employment and higher salaries in Russia. In Nepal, prominent opposition lawmaker and former foreign minister Bimala Rai Paudyal told parliament earlier this year that between\u00a014,000 and 15,000 Nepalis were fighting on the front lines, citing testimony from men returning from Ukraine. The Russian government last year announced a lucrative package for foreign fighters to join the country\u2019s military, including a monthly salary of at least $2,000 and a fast track to Russian citizenship \u2013 but the Kremlin has not said how many foreigners it has recruited under the plan. In early March, India\u2019s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said it had busted major human trafficking networks that were duping men into Russian military jobs, with 35 such cases identified. \u201cThe trafficked Indian Nationals were trained in combat roles and deployed at front bases in Russia-Ukraine War Zone against their wishes,\u201d the CBI statement said. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Kwatra said he does know the precise number of Indians recruited to fight for Russia in Ukraine, but anticipates it is between 35 and 50 people. Of those, 10 Indian nationals have already returned to India, he said. \u201cNow, the two sides will work on it and see how expeditiously we can get them back into the country,\u201d Kwatra said. India has no law preventing its citizens from serving in a foreign state\u2019s military. One family from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad recently told CNN they spent two months trying to find out what happened to their brother after he traveled to Russia on the promise of job opportunities. Imran\u00a0Mohammad said an employment agency had enticed his brother Asfan Mohammed with an offer for helper and security jobs in the Russian army, saying he could get a Russian passport and national card within a year. Instead, Asfan was sent to the battlefield in Ukraine and was killed in combat. \u201cThese brokers duped the boys and put their lives in danger,\u201d Imran said, referring to Asfan and other Indians sent to war. In neighboring Nepal, lawmakers have called on the Russian authorities to provide figures for its nationals fighting in Ukraine. Several returned Nepali fighters who spoke with CNN earlier this year blamed Russia for using them as cannon fodder in the war. \u201cIt\u2019s the Nepalis and other foreign fighters that are actually fighting in the front of war zones. The Russians position themselves a few hundred meters back as support,\u201d said Suman Tamang, after he returned from Russia. The Nepalis who fought for Russia said they had received only brief training before being sent into combat. Ramchandra Khadka, who returned to Nepal after suffering injuries in Ukraine, told CNN that after only two weeks of training, he was sent to the front lines in Bakhmut \u2013 a town in eastern Ukraine that saw some of the heaviest fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces \u2013 with a gun and a basic kit. \u201cI didn\u2019t join the Russian military for pleasure. I didn\u2019t have any job opportunities in Nepal. But in hindsight, it wasn\u2019t the right decision,\u201d Khadka said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize we would be sent to the front lines that quickly and how horrible the situation would be.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/india/russia-indian-nationals-fighting-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_europe_french-elections-political-violence-intl-latam", "text": "French authorities have recorded more than 50 physical assaults on candidates and campaigners on the campaign trail, the country\u2019s Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said Friday as concerns mount about political violence ahead of\u00a0France\u2019s high-stakes parliamentary elections. \u201cThis campaign is short, less than three weeks. However, we have counted 51 candidates, deputies, or campaigners who have been physically assaulted. I am not counting verbal aggressions here,\u201d Darmanin told CNN affiliate BFMTV. The attacks have ranged from the less severe to \u201cextremely serious,\u201d Darmanin said, adding that some candidates have been hospitalised for their injuries. Roughly thirty or so people have been taken in for questioning in relation to the attacks, Darmanin added. France has been grappling with high tensions in the run-up to this Sunday\u2019s elections. An additional 30,000 police have been laid on to ensure that neither the far-left nor the far-right succeed in \u201ccreating disorder,\u201d Darmanin said earlier this week. Politicians have\u00a0repeatedly warned that a far-right victory\u00a0could provoke huge protests in the streets, with French President Emmanuel Macron going so far as to say \u201ccivil war\u201d may break out if the extreme left or right wins by a large margin in Sunday\u2019s runoff vote. French government spokesperson Prisca Thevenot and her team came under attack while canvassing on Wednesday night. Meanwhile, National Rally (RN) politician Marie Dauchy, who is running in the southeastern constituency of Savoie, opted to suspend her campaign after she said was physically assaulted while campaigning at a market. In Cherbourg, a center-right candidate from The Republicans party, Nicolas Conquer, made a formal complaint after he claimed he was assaulted by left-wing campaigners on Monday. The terror threat in the country \u201cremains extremely strong,\u201d the interior minister warned on Friday, adding that several arrests had recently taken place in two separate places. Although the two incidents \u201ccould qualify as terrorist\u201d incidents, they need to be formally classified as such by the national anti-terrorist prosecutor, Darmanin added. RN, the party of far-right doyenne Marine Le Pen, led the first round of\u00a0France\u2019s\u00a0parliamentary elections last Sunday, taking it closer to the gates of power than ever before. After an unusually high turnout, the RN bloc clinched 33.15% of the vote, while the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) coalition came second with 27.99% and Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance slumped to a dismal third with 20.76%, according to final results published by the Interior Ministry on Monday. While the RN appears on track to win the most seats in the National Assembly, it may fall short of the 289 seats required for an absolute majority, suggesting France may be heading for a hung parliament and more political uncertainty.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/french-elections-political-violence-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_11_style_picasso-mona-tasmania-australia-fake-intl-hnk", "text": "A museum in Australia has come clean: The Picasso paintings hanging in its women\u2019s restroom were forged by one of its own curators. The American curator and artist Kirsha Kaechele \u2014 who is married to the owner of Tasmania\u2019s Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) \u2014 admitted in a blog post on Wednesday that she produced three fake Picassos which had previously hung in the museum\u2019s \u201cLadies Lounge,\u201d an installation exploring misogyny. The Ladies Lounge first made headlines in 2020 as a female-only space displaying what were presented as original Picassos once owned by Kaechele\u2019s great-grandmother. Last month, as a tongue-in-cheek response to a male visitor\u2019s complaint about being barred from the installation, the paintings were relocated to a female restroom. At the time, CNN asked MONA to provide the paintings\u2019 names, but the museum did not respond. In her blog post, which was titled \u201cArt Is Not Truth,\u201d Kaechele said she painted the works in secret (with the help of her manicurist\u2019s niece) and claimed that even gallery staff were fooled. The curator said she decided to forge the paintings \u2014 after joking about the idea over drinks with a friend \u2014 because she wanted them to match the space\u2019s color scheme and green silk curtains. \u201cI knew of a number of Picasso paintings I could borrow from friends, but none of them were green and I wished for the Lounge to be monochrome. I also had time working against me, not to mention the cost of insuring a Picasso \u2014 exorbitant!\u201d Kaechele wrote. Accusations of misogyny leveled against the Spanish painter and sculptor since his death in 1973 were central to the concept of the installation, she added,\u00a0describing Picasso\u2019s \u201crecord with women\u201d as\u00a0\u201cintense.\u201d \u201cWomen have been pulling him (Picasso) apart lately, questioning his supremacy. They question my selection of his art. And I like that. I liked that a misogynist would dominate the walls of the Ladies Lounge. \u201d Kaechele wrote. \u201cThree years ago I fantasized there would be a scandal: \u2018Fake Picassos Exposed: Art Fraud!\u2019 I imagined that a Picasso scholar, or maybe just a Picasso fan, or maybe just someone who Googles things, would visit the Ladies Lounge and see that the painting was upside down and expose me on social media,\u201d she added. Kaechele also revealed that other works displayed in the Ladies Lounge were not genuine. A collection of New Guinean spears presented as antiques were in fact brand new. A rug presented as once belonging to Queen Mary of Denmark was also a modern creation made from \u201clow-grade polyester,\u201d she said. \u201cI am relieved I have told you because now we can revel together in this madness,\u201d Kaechele added. \u201cAssuming you still want to speak to me. (I hope you can forgive me.)\u201d But why? Explaining the idea behind the Ladies Lounge, Kaechele said she knew it \u201chad to be as opulent and sumptuous as possible.\u201d Including the world\u2019s \u201cvery best\u201d art helped make men \u201cfeel as excluded as possible,\u201d she added. The Ladies Lounge, a green velvet-draped room adorned with gold detailing, opened \u201cto any and all ladies\u201d in December 2020. The installation claimed that women would be \u201csurrounded by priceless works of art including several that demonstrate the genius of Picasso,\u201d whilst being served by male butlers. \u201cSo I filled the Lounge with \u2018invaluable\u2019 objects, framing each \u2014 physically (in gold) and metaphorically (with dubious stories centered around a fictional woman, a version of myself). Stories available only to those on the inside (women), each more absurd than the last,\u201d Kaechele wrote. Kaechele added that \u201ceach of those stories intended to raise questions around gender, freedom, power structures, authenticity, and value.\u201d \u201cAll these illusions built the fantasy for those who are afforded the experience of the Lounge, and, importantly, those who are excluded.\u201d Earlier this year, MONA was forced to allow men into the exhibit after a tribunal ruled that it was \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d The move followed a complaint by Jason Lau, a visitor from New South Wales, who was barred from entering the Ladies Lounge in April 2023. Lau, who had paid the 35 Australian dollars ($23) entry fee, said he had experienced direct gender discrimination. Kaechele told the tribunal that denying men entry to the mysterious room was indeed part of the art \u2014 giving\u00a0them\u00a0a taste of the discrimination and exclusion many women have experienced through history. She subsequently found a loophole by installing the paintings in a female restroom. \u201cWhile the Ladies Lounge undergoes a series of reforms to meet the exemptions required for reopening, I\u2019ve been doing a little redecorating,\u201d she told CNN in an email at the time. \u201cI thought a few of the bathrooms in the museum could do with an update.

{"id": "2024_07_06_uk_britains-keir-starmer-hard-part-gbr-intl", "text": "Keir Starmer\u2019s historic victory in Britain\u2019s general election Thursday hands him a level of power that was unthinkable for a Labour leader just five years ago. To win a working parliamentary majority of over 170 seats just four-and-a-half years after his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, led the party to its worst loss in a generation is nothing short of remarkable. Starmer was arguably elected on a mandate of change rather than on a personal endorsement. It is no secret that a large number of voters were not voting exactly for Starmer himself, but to get rid of a Conservative Party that had been in power for 14 years and led the country through some of its most chaotic days in peacetime. The change the country has voted for could be interpreted in many ways, as there is a lot wrong with the UK right now. Waiting lists for doctors\u2019 appointments are in the millions. The cost-of-living crisis that has plagued Europe left many in Britain having to make unthinkable decisions between heating their homes or eating. Immigration, particularly irregular migration, has become a major issue for voters on the right. There are many more examples but, bluntly, there has been a sense for some time that the UK simply doesn\u2019t function well as a country. If the Brexit vote of 2016 told the British political establishment anything, it\u2019s that large parts of the nation were fed up with the status quo. If nothing else, Starmer has to make the people of Britain feel that they are living better lives with his time in office. But he must do so with some challenges, despite the size of his majority. It is no secret that he doesn\u2019t have a huge amount of public money to spend. He has loosely pledged not to raise taxes. Convincing the public that the Labour Party could be trusted with public finances was a big part of his electoral campaign. This combination of limited public money and a promise to balance the books runs into another of the key challenges facing Starmer: those in his own party who believe he should be radical. Of course, Labour members and activists are pleased to see the back of the Conservative Party after 14 long years in power. But some, especially on the left of the party, don\u2019t want to see a thumping majority squandered on moderate policy that returns right-wingers to power in five years. Their concerns may not be completely unfounded. While the story of this election is Starmer\u2019s landslide, the anti-Conservative vote split in a few different directions. Most notably, the hard-right Reform UK, led by friend of Donald Trump Nigel Farage, secured 14% of the national vote. Reform took a lot of votes from the Conservatives through vicious attacks on its record in government. It\u2019s extremely likely that with Starmer now in power, Farage and his acolytes will turn their attention to tearing chunks out of the Labour Party. If Starmer decides to stick to his moderate guns, it isn\u2019t hard to see how Reform starts labeling this Labour government as virtually the same as the Conservatives, using populist rhetoric that clearly appeals to many in Britain. On the other hand, Starmer cannot afford to spook the center-ground majority that just put him in Downing Street, having believed and trusted his message that he would be stable and responsible. Delivering meaningful change while trying to stand still is not an easy task by any stretch of the imagination. It is likely that Starmer will soon have to make some difficult decisions that will deviate in some way from his pledges made while running for office. This is normal, and most governments have to make some compromises while in power. But it will upset some of his own base. Fortunately for Starmer, he has quite a lot of political capital to spend. What he must now decide is who he spends it on.

Israeli forces targeted the gate of a school housing displaced people in the town of Abasan, east of Khan Younis, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza, which called the attack \u201ca heinous massacre against displaced citizens.\u201d The strike injured another 53 people, the ministry added, including some who are in a \u201cserious and critical\u201d condition. The death toll is expected to increase, as casualties are still being transferred to the nearby Nasser Hospital. The Israeli military said it conducted a strike \u201cnear\u201d Al-Awda school on Tuesday, and that it had targeted \u201ca terrorist\u201d who participated in the October 7 attacks into southern Israel. \u201cEarlier this evening, using precise munition, the IAF struck a terrorist from Hamas\u2019 military wing\u00a0who took part, among other terrorist activities, in the October 7 brutal massacre carried out by the Hamas terrorist organization in southern Israel,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. \u201cThe IDF is looking into the reports that civilians were harmed, adjacent to the Al-Awda School\u00a0in the south of Khan Younis, which is located near the location of the strike. The incident is\u00a0under\u00a0review,\u201d the IDF added. CNN cannot verify the IDF\u2019s statements. Hamas also condemned it in a statement, saying the strike on the school represents \u201ca continuation of the genocidal war and horrific massacres against our defenseless people.\u201d Hamas called for people around the world to \u201cimmediately take to the streets and squares in massive demonstrations and rallies\u201d in support of people in Gaza, as well as called for people in the West Bank to support Gaza and clash with Israeli forces. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed 38,295 Palestinians and injured another 88,241 people, according to the Ministry of Health there. \u2018Why don\u2019t we have the right to live?\u2019 CNN footage from the aftermath of the attack shows bewildered Palestinian children clambering over slabs of broken concrete, with old clothes strewn across blown-out buildings. One survivor told CNN she and other Palestinians were tucked into a local marketplace when \u201ca missile landed on us.\u201d \u201cWe are dying here\u2026 We saw the scene of 30 martyrs piled on top of each other,\u201d said Umm Mahmoud. \u201cOur hearts break with sadness\u2026 They (Israeli forces) want to terrorize us.\u201d Elsewhere, in Nasser Hospital, relatives of the deceased could be seen wailing in horror, their cheeks red and flushed, in CNN video. One woman, whose nephews Ahmad and Omar were killed in the attack, said she had been displaced for nine months. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we have the right to live? Why do our young people die like this?\u201d the aunt told CNN. \u201cWe have been here homeless for nine months and no one cares about us\u2026 We want to live in peace.\u201d Another Palestinian, Jadallah Abu Jamee, said her nine-year-old granddaughter, Rimas Abu Jamee, and cousin were killed in the strike. She told CNN that her daughter, a university student, was in surgery for an amputated hand and a head injury. \u201cA nine-year-old girl, what did she do to deserve this?\u201d said Jamee. The Government Media Office in Gaza condemned the attack, calling it a \u201cmassacre against civilians\u201d by Israel. The government statement also called on the international community, the United Nations, and international NGOs to put pressure on Israel and the United States to stop the war in Gaza. The commissioner-general of the UN\u2019s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNWRA), Philippe Lazzarini, condemned the attack, warning \u201cthe blatant disregard of international humanitarian law cannot become the new normal.\u201d \u201cSchools have gone from safe places of education and hope for children to overcrowded shelters and often ending up a place of death and misery,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cNine months in, under our watch, the relentless, endless killings, destruction and despair continue. Gaza is no place for children.\u201d This comes days after an\u00a0Israeli\u00a0attack killed at least 16 Palestinians and injured dozens more at a school run by the United Nations\u2019 agency for Palestinian refugees in central Gaza, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Saturday. UNRWA\u2019s Al-Jaouni school was sheltering displaced people in al-Nuseirat camp, according to the ministry. The Israeli military said in a statement Saturday that militants were operating in structures in the school area. CNN cannot independently verify the Israeli military\u2019s claim. On July 1, the IDF issued instructions for hundreds of thousands of people in Khan Younis in the south, Shujaya in central Gaza and\u00a0the several neighborhoods of Gaza City to leave. The effect has been to increase the total number of displaced people in Gaza, from 1.7 million in May to an estimated 1.9 million now, according to the UN. Approximately nine out of 10 people in Gaza are now estimated to be internally displaced, many of them multiple times. The IDF has said that evacuation orders are necessary so that civilians don\u2019t get caught up in its renewed operations in areas where Hamas is seeking to re-establish a presence. The IDF insists it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. Human rights bodies have repeatedly criticized Israeli relocation orders. In May, the Norwegian Refugee Council warned the absence of safety assurances and proper accommodation for displaced Palestinians is a form of \u201cforcible transfer, amounting to a serious violation of international law.\u201d Hamas has said the evacuations threaten to return negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage deal to \u201cpoint zero.\u201d Humanitarian agencies say the evacuation orders have had a major impact on the few operational hospitals in Gaza. Besides the obvious dangers in moving from one part of Gaza to another, the constant displacements make it harder for aid agencies to target the provision of food.

{"id": "2024_07_09_middleeast_gaza-famine-un-report-intl-latam", "text": "The recent deaths of more Palestinian children due to hunger and malnutrition in the Gaza Strip indicates\u00a0that famine\u00a0has spread across the entire enclave, according to a United Nations statement, citing independent experts. An estimated 495,000 people in Gaza \u2013 or 22% of the population \u2013 are \u201cexperiencing an extreme lack of food,\u201d according to an Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report last month. Under the IPC system \u2013\u00a0a five-phase scale used as a common standard for classifying the severity of food insecurity \u2013 a famine can only be declared if data shows certain thresholds are met. In the UN statement, published Tuesday, the group of experts said: \u201cIsrael\u2019s intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people is a form of genocidal violence and has resulted in famine across all of Gaza. \u201cWe call upon the international community to prioritise the delivery of humanitarian aid by land by any means necessary, end Israel\u2019s siege, and establish a ceasefire,\u201d they continued. The experts said that deaths of children from a lack of food and water indicate that health and social structures have been critically weakened. \u201cWhen the first child dies from malnutrition and dehydration, it becomes irrefutable that\u00a0famine\u00a0has taken hold,\u201d the experts added. The statement cited the deaths of three Palestinian children \u2014 6-month-old Fayez Ataya, 13-year-old Abdulqader Al-Serhi\u00a0and 9-year-old Ahmad Abu Reida. It said they died from malnutrition and lack of access to adequate healthcare in late May and early June. The experts emphasized that these children had died from starvation\u00a0despite medical treatment in central Gaza, indicating\u00a0that\u00a0famine\u00a0has now spread from northern Gaza into central and southern regions. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israeli Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) for comment. Israel\u2019s permanent mission to the UN in Geneva dismissed the statement, alleging the experts were \u201cspreading misinformation\u201d and \u201csupporting Hamas propaganda.\u201d In June, the IPC reported a deterioration in the humanitarian situation following the launch of Israel\u2019s military operations in Rafah. The Rafah crossing \u2013 a crucial route for humanitarian aid to Gaza \u2013 has been closed since early May. Meanwhile, a much-lauded but ultimately troubled US military pier set up off the Gazan coast will be permanently removed soon, according to US officials. The $230 temporary pier operation \u2013 intended as an alternative aid distribution option to land routes \u2013 based at the Israeli port of Ashdod has faced many challenges since it began operation in mid-May. Last month it was disconnected from Gaza due to inclement weather, but will be reconnected one final time to deliver any remaining aid from Cyprus and from a floating dock that is moored several miles off shore. More than 19.4 million pounds of aid have been delivered via the pier to the collection area in Gaza since it started operations. Humanitarian aid workers continue to face tremendous risks while trying to distribute desperately needed aid to Gaza, the UN said. The majority of the infrastructure supporting humanitarian work in Gaza has been destroyed in Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas, according to the same report. ActionAid, an international campaign group, described the UN experts\u2019 statement as a \u201cstark warning.\u201d \u201cThis is a stain on humanity\u2019s conscience\u00a0and an entirely preventable, human-made crisis. The world cannot sit back and watch any more children die from lack of food: more life-saving aid must be allowed into Gaza immediately,\u201d the group said in a Wednesday statement. \u201cWe call on all states to use every diplomatic lever available to them to bring about a permanent ceasefire, now.\u201d Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has depleted the territory\u2019s health system, leaving staff unable to treat malnourished children. Doctors previously told CNN they are being forced to turn away parents begging for baby milk, unable to even triage young patients with chronic illnesses compounded by severe hunger. And as Israel continues its siege\u00a0on Gaza,\u00a0preventing aid groups getting enough food into the enclave, parents say they have no choice but to watch their children starve to death. At least 34 children have already died of malnutrition in Gaza, the government media office reported on June 22. The true number could be higher, as limited access to the strip has impeded aid agencies\u2019 efforts to fully assess the crisis there.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/09/middleeast/gaza-famine-un-report-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

The unnamed European, described by police as a 43-year-old man, visited the game reserve in South Africa\u2019s North West Province on Sunday, in a private vehicle, according to provincial police spokesperson Sabata Mokgwabone. He was accompanied by his fiancee and two other women, Mokgwabone said in a statement sent to CNN Wednesday. Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia identified the tourist as Carlos Luna, whom it said was from Zaragoza. The Pilanesberg Game Reserve is South Africa\u2019s fourth-largest park and a popular tourist destination. It is also home to more than\u00a07,000 animals, according to its website. Police said that while touring the park, the man and his passengers \u201cspotted three elephants with three calves,\u201d adding that \u201cthe man stopped the vehicle, alighted\u00a0and\u00a0went closer to take pictures\u201d before he was attacked and killed by the herd. The province\u2019s tourism board said in a statement that the Spaniard \u201cdid not heed the warnings\u201d of \u201chis fellow passengers, and occupants from two other vehicles that were at the sighting\u201d before approaching the elephants \u201cthat were feeding a distance from the road.\u201d \u201cAn adult elephant cow charged at the man, who then ran \u2026 (but) was unfortunately not able to escape or evade the elephant, which was now joined by the whole herd, and was caught and trampled to death,\u201d the board said. It added that the elephants left the scene afterward and did not attack anyone. \u201cStatements by witnesses who observed the\u00a0whole\u00a0incident further suggest that the female elephant that charged and attacked might have done so to protect the herd and young ones.\u201d Plans are being made to repatriate the tourist\u2019s body, the Spanish newspaper said, citing officials. Elephant attacks are not rare in South Africa. In 2019, a suspected poacher was attacked and killed by an elephant, and his body\u00a0eaten\u00a0by lions\u00a0in the northeastern Kruger National Park, authorities said at the time. In the same year, a security guard was similarly crushed to death by an elephant at a mine in the country\u2019s Limpopo province. Other parts of Southern Africa have witnessed similar tragedies. Three months ago, an elderly American woman was killed after an elephant charged at a vehicle transporting tourists inside Zambia\u2019s largest national park. The North West tourism board said it was \u201csaddened\u201d by the incident at the Pilanesberg park, urging tourists to \u201crespect distance between vehicles and animals and \u2026 to only alight in specially designated areas.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/africa/elephants-kill-spanish-tourist-south-africa-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_04_10_style_graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers", "text": "Climbing up abandoned, unfinished floors and tightrope walking across balcony ledges, backpacks clanging with cans of alkyd and acrylic, a collective of Los Angeles graffiti artists have transformed their craft beyond urban aesthetics to champion community issues. Their choice of canvas: Oceanwide Plaza in Downtown LA. Occupying over a full square city block, the plaza was imagined as a vast mixed-use building project, offering city residents over 500 lavish condominiums, a five-star hotel, retail spaces, restaurants and a private 2-acre park. However, construction on the $1 billion project, which began in 2015, was shelved after the Chinese-backed contractor Oceanwide Holdings ran out of funding\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 and it has lain unfinished ever since. The plaza\u2019s status \u2014 and potential \u2014 as an eye-catching venue for their work spread by word of mouth within the graffiti community in recent months. Security at the site was known to be lax, an important detail as accessing the plaza\u2019s towers and other buildings constitutes trespassing. (The Los Angeles City Attorney confirmed to CNN that, as of April 3, criminal charges have been filed against 23 individuals, for violations including trespassing and possession of vandalism tools.) \u201cIt was like a gift from the graffiti gods\u2026 A giant canvas in the middle of downtown,\u201d tagger ENDEM told CNN, speaking on behalf of himself and his graffiti crew, NCT. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right. Let\u2019s do it as if the whole world is going to see this.\u2019\u201d Historically, graffiti has often been used as protest art. While the practice dates back thousands of years, it\u2019s most commonly viewed in a contemporary context (within graffiti\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d era, which dates back to the 1960s and 70s) as a creative vehicle for challenging societal norms and inequities \u2014 whether on the Berlin Wall in Germany or subway cars in New York City; whether painted by anonymous artists or well-known figures like Keith Haring or Banksy, even if the latter is, technically, anonymous himself. Still, neither ENDEM nor any of the other artists involved realized how famous their work on the Oceanside towers would become. Sharing his artwork on Instagram on January 31, a video from ENDEM quickly racked up tens of thousands of views: Vibrant images of bright block lettering splayed across the building\u2019s exterior paired with footage from the inside \u2014 the artist posing with shots of his spray paint cans, poised above the cityscape. The viral footage, among other visuals shared on social media, quickly opened the floodgates. Hitting Oceanside became a mark of credibility in the graffiti world; by mid-February, the number of tags and other graffiti pieces there were multiplying overnight. \u201cIt was an open house people going in and out. It was beautiful. It was like graffiti paradise,\u201d ENDEM said. \u201cIt felt exactly like the streets, but concentrated.\u201d Transformed in part into an art installation, Oceanwide became an opportunity for the graffiti artists to leave a message to the city below, and a call-out to policy makers who leave buildings to rot. \u201cGraffiti shows you where the city hurts,\u201d Roger Gastman, owner and founder of the LA-based arts organization Beyond the Streets, told CNN. Renowned for its large-scale exhibitions, immersive educational programs, pop-up events and partnerships, Beyond the Streets works to educate and celebrate the diverse dimensions of graffiti as a medium. To him, the mission of graffiti is clear: to challenge, educate, and redefine public perception of the medium. Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of The Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, a nonpartisan public policy forum\u00a0for civic participation and education,\u00a0sees the abandoned towers as amplifying the social issues of the community they are situated in, connecting the graffiti-laden structures to the urban blight that surrounds them in LA\u2019s Skid Row. Skid Row is a 50-block sector of downtown LA where between 8,000 and 11,000 unhoused people live in challenging, often squalid conditions. \u201cYou\u2019ve got tens of thousands of people displaced because of over urban development. And as a result of that, they\u2019re on the streets,\u201d Hutchinson told CNN, noting that the homeless population in Los Angeles is continuing to grow. (The Los Angeles Housing Services Authority reports a 9% increase in homelessness in LA county in 2023 and a 10% increase in the city from 2022.) \u201cNow, set right in the middle of that, you have\u2026 a development that will never be completed.\u201d \u201cWhat you have here is a classic urban nightmare brought on by very poor policies \u2014 fiscal, financial, budgetary and political problems (in) a city that has just gone off the rails in terms of over-development and lack of affordability,\u201d Hutchinson added. Still, Hutchinson is no fan of the graffiti either. To him, and many other LA residents who have said they disapprove of the \u201cvandalism,\u201d the plaza is a sore sight for eyes. \u201cThe problem is you\u2019re talking about violating public space and with no permission\u2026 that doesn\u2019t fly with me,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, the public has not given you approval. (And) the general public has to pay for the removal.\u201d Costs currently borne by the taxpayer at the Oceanwide Plaza site include the security details provided by the LAPD as well as the graffiti cleanup Hutchinson highlights. (\u201cThis has strained our deployment,\u201d LAPD Chief Michel Moore said during a February meeting of the Los Angeles City Council. \u201cWe have called in some officers on an overtime basis so that we can provide for these added patrols or station them at that site to deter vandals and others from gaining access.\u201d) Clean teams working in the neighborhoods surrounding Oceanwide remove on average some 2,000 square feet of graffiti per week, with that figure growing in recent months. \u201cPeople forget that people live here. People own businesses here and they don\u2019t want to have to spend the time and money to clean it up,\u201d said Blair Besten, executive director of the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles, an organization which works to improve the quality of life in downtown neighborhoods. The Historic Core prioritizes street sweeping, trash collection \u2014 and graffiti removal. \u201cI would hardly call what they\u2019re doing art,\u201d Besten argued of the Oceanwide taggers. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sloppy and quick. They come in fast and they knock it out and they leave.\u201d But to Gastman, graffiti is a powerful form of expression, and a call-to-action \u2014 particularly for those who emanate from struggles within home life, gang life or societal turmoil. Graffiti culture can offer an unexpected support system for those the city has abandoned, Gastman said. It becomes a platform for them to make their voices heard. \u201cIn graffiti culture, a lot of us know each other. We\u2019re all friends. We have the same mentality \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to get up. We\u2019re just trying to get noticed,\u201d explained ENDEM. In the midst of an addiction that led to his rock bottom, graffiti became his lifeline, he explained. \u201cI was at my lowest of lows, still trying to stay sober, I needed some type of outlet,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cGraffiti is something that you can hold on to. Its bigger than me, its everyone, it\u2019s a community.\u201d In this, ENDEM believes that the beauty of Oceanwide isn\u2019t tangible. Rather, it lies in the birth of a new generation of graffiti writers. \u201cThey can erase the graffiti on buildings, but they can never erase the impact that it has on the city of Los Angeles and the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to it. Yes, it\u2019s vandalism. Yes, it\u2019s art, and it\u2019s everything in between,\u201d Gastman concluded. \u201cThis is a real culture. It\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/04/10/style/graffiti-oceanwide-plaza-los-angeles-skyscrapers/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_07_europe_france-second-round-parliament-election-polls-open-intl", "text": "Voters are turning out in high numbers across France to vote in the second round of a snap election called by President Emmanuel Macron, who risks losing swaths of his centrist allies in parliament and being forced to see out the remaining three years of his presidential term in an awkward partnership with the far right. According to data published by the French Interior Ministry, 59.71% of French voters cast their vote by 5 p.m. Sunday (11 a.m. ET) - a level unseen since 1981. It marks a 20-point increase compared to the same time in 2022. After taking the lead in the first round of voting last Sunday, the far-right National Rally (RN) \u2013 led by the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella under the watchful eye of party doyenne Marine Le Pen \u2013 is closer to power than ever before. The RN, whose once-taboo brand of anti-immigrant politics has been given a fresh and more acceptable face by Bardella, won 33% of the popular vote in the first round. The newly-formed left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP), came second with 28%, while Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance trailed in a distant third with 21%. But the prospect of a far-right government \u2013 which would be France\u2019s first since the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II \u2013 has spurred Ensemble and the NFP into action. After a week of political bargaining, hundreds of candidates stood down in particular seats to try to deny the RN an absolute majority. Voting began at 8 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET), as France began the process of electing the 577 members of its National Assembly, in which 289 seats are needed for a party to hold an absolute majority. In the outgoing parliament, Macron\u2019s alliance had only 250 seats, and so needed support from other parties to pass laws. Only those who win more than 12.5% of the votes of registered votes in the first round can stand in the second, meaning it is often fought between two candidates. But this time a record number of seats \u2013 more than 300 \u2013 produced a three-way run-off, in a measure of France\u2019s polarization. In an attempt not to split the anti-far right vote, more than 200 candidates from Macron\u2019s alliance and the NFP agreed to stand down in the second round. While RN\u2019s strong showing in the first round means it could more than triple the 88 seats it had in the outgoing parliament, it is not clear if it will be able to reach an absolute majority. Although it is customary for the president to appoint a prime minister from the largest party, Bardella has repeatedly said he will refuse to form a minority government. In that case, Macron might have to search for a prime minister on the hard left or, to form a technocratic government, somewhere else entirely. Whatever the result of Sunday\u2019s vote, France seems set to endure a period of political chaos, with Macron unable to call another parliamentary election for at least a year. The campaign has already been marred with violence. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said Friday that 51 candidates and campaigners had been assaulted on the campaign trail, leading to some being hospitalized. The vote is being held three years earlier than necessary. France was not due to hold parliamentary elections until 2027, but Macron called the snap vote \u2013 the first time a French leader has done so since 1997 \u2013 after his party was trounced by the RN at last month\u2019s European Parliament elections. Although the European election results need have no bearing on domestic politics, Macron said he could not ignore the message sent to him by voters and wanted to clarify the situation. Some have argued that, with the possibility of the RN winning both the presidency and the parliament in 2027, Macron was keen to expose it to government beforehand, in the hope that it would lose its appeal once in office. If the RN refuses to form a minority government, Macron\u2019s gamble could backfire. An RN-led government would have huge implications for France and the rest of Europe. Its spending plans \u2013 which include cutting value-added tax on electricity, fuel and other energy products \u2013 have alarmed financial markets and could put France on a collision course with Brussels\u2019 restrictive spending laws. On the continental stage, an RN-led government would further Europe\u2019s rightward shift, at a time when the center is trying to remain united on issues like support for Ukraine, migration and climate change. Standing between the RN and an absolute majority is the NFP, comprising more radical figures like Jean-Luc Melenchon, a three-time presidential candidate and leader of the France Unbowed party, as well as moderate leaders like Place Publique\u2019s Raphael Gluckmann. While Macron\u2019s Ensemble allies said they will do everything in their power to stop the RN coming to power, it has refused to collaborate with or endorse candidates from France Unbowed. Gabriel Attal, Macron\u2019s protege and the outgoing prime minister, has vowed never to enter into alliance with Melenchon. Polls will close at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday, with the full results expected early Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/07/europe/france-second-round-parliament-election-polls-open-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

The NATO leaders also elaborated to a greater extent than in the past on concerns over China\u2019s growing capabilities and activities in outer space, and reiterated their previous unease about what they called Beijing\u2019s \u201cmalicious cyber and hybrid activities,\u201d including disinformation, and \u201crapidly\u201d expanding nuclear arsenal. \u201cWe remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to build reciprocal transparency with the view of safeguarding the Alliance\u2019s security interests,\u201d the statement said, referring to China by the initials of its official name. \u201cAt the same time, we are boosting our shared awareness, enhancing our resilience and preparedness, and protecting against the PRC\u2019s coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.\u201d The NATO leaders\u2019 declaration Wednesday comes as the 32-member alliance - historically focused on security in North America and Europe - has in recent years upped its engagement with US allies in Asia and increasingly seen its security as linked to the region, even as member countries have pursued divergent policies toward China. For the third consecutive year, leaders of New Zealand, Japan and South Korea attended the NATO leaders\u2019 summit in another sign of closer ties between the bloc and those countries, as well as Australia. China and Russia\u2019s tightening ties Beijing has deepened political, economic and military ties\u00a0with Moscow since President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in February 2022 declared a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership \u2013 and their shared opposition to what they said was NATO\u2019s expansion \u2013 during\u00a0the Russian leader\u2019s visit to the Chinese capital, weeks before his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. China has surpassed the European Union to become Russia\u2019s top trade partner, offering a crucial lifeline to its economy, which has been heavily sanctioned in the wake of that invasion, while the two\u00a0nuclear-armed neighbors have continued to hold joint military exercises. Meanwhile, China has claimed neutrality in the war and\u00a0sought to posit itself as a potential peace broker, even as the US and European leaders have become increasingly alarmed about what they say is Beijing\u2019s backing of Moscow through\u00a0its economic and diplomatic support, as well as the provision of dual-use goods. On Thursday, China criticized the NATO statement as \u201cfilled with Cold War mentality and belligerent rhetoric,\u201d and said it was \u201cprovocative with obvious lies and smears.\u201d \u201cChina is not the creator to the Ukraine crisis. China\u2019s position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard. We aim to promote peace talks and seek political settlement,\u201d a statement from its mission to the European Union said. The Chinese statement also reiterated Beijing\u2019s position that it has never provided lethal weapons in the conflict and has strict dual-use export controls, defending its trade with Russia as \u201cnormal.\u201d The US and European leaders have in recent months raised alarm that such exports are revitalizing Russia\u2019s defense sector and allowing it to survive despite hefty international sanctions. The US has said that dual-use exports have specifically enabled the production of tanks, munitions and armored vehicles. Both the US and the EU have sanctioned Chinese entities they allege are supporting the war effort. Later Thursday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry also condemned the declaration, with a spokesperson framing NATO as a \u201cgreat threat\u201d to the world and reiterating Beijing\u2019s claim that the alliance was \u201cfanning the flames\u201d of the war in Ukraine. NATO\u2019s increasing focus on Asia The NATO leaders\u2019 declaration is the latest step in what has been the bloc\u2019s gradual hardening of tone on China\u00a0in recent years. NATO leaders first mentioned the need to jointly address \u201copportunities and challenges\u201d posed by China in a 2019 declaration, before moving to refer to \u201csystemic challenges\u201d the country poses in 2021. That shift has come alongside an increased US policy focus on the Indo-Pacific amid a deepening rivalry with Beijing as China under Xi\u2019s leadership has grown increasingly aggressive in the region and\u00a0in its broader foreign policy. NATO\u2019s attention on Asia has also been accelerated over the past two and a half years by hardening geopolitical fault lines in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin\u2019s tightening relationship with not only China but also North Korea and Iran. NATO leaders on Wednesday also said Pyongyang and Tehran were \u201cfueling\u201d Russia\u2019s war through \u201cdirect military support,\u201d and condemned North Korea\u2019s exports of \u201cartillery shells and ballistic missiles\u201d to Russia \u2013 which multiple governments say they have tracked since last year when Putin hosted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the Russian Far East. \u201cThe Indo-Pacific is important for NATO, given that developments in that region directly affect Euro-Atlantic security,\u201d the leaders said in their declaration. \u201cWe are strengthening dialogue to tackle cross-regional challenges and are enhancing our practical cooperation, including through flagship projects in the areas of supporting Ukraine, cyber defense, countering disinformation, and technology,\u201d it said. Beijing has watched warily as NATO\u2019s engagement grows with other powers in the Asia-Pacific.\u00a0China is widely seen by observers as hoping to be the dominant force in the region and to push back on the US presence there, as Washington bolsters its longstanding Indo-Pacific security partnerships and interests. China and Russia have also converged over their shared opposition to NATO, part of a broader aspiration from both to reshape a world order they see as unfairly dominated by the US, and both have blamed the Western security alliance for provoking Moscow to invade Ukraine. In its statement Thursday, Beijing\u2019s EU mission called on NATO to \u201ccorrect its wrong perception of China,\u201d and \u201cabandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum game.\u201d \u201cThe Asia-Pacific region is a place for peaceful development, not a wrestling ground for geopolitical competition \u2026 NATO should not become the disrupter of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific,\u201d the statement said.

{"id": "2024_07_11_weather_us-deadly-heat-summer-climate", "text": "A historically hot summer in the United States is on a July killing spree and the toll will only grow with the hottest days yet to come. It\u2019s been the hottest summer on record to date for around 100 US cities from Maine to California. Heat is suspected in the deaths of least 37 people in the US in July, a number that is likely underestimated given the amount of time it takes to attribute a death to nature\u2019s most prolific weather killer. Many of the deaths have been in the West, where cities have shattered all-time record high temperatures during an unprecedented and long heat wave \u2013 exactly the kind of conditions scientists expect in a world warming due to fossil fuel pollution. Heat is being investigated in the deaths of at least 19 people in Santa Clara County, California, alone, the county\u2019s medical examiner office told CNN. Everyone is vulnerable to heat, but some are more at risk than others. Children, the elderly, pregnant people, people with heart or blood pressure issues, outdoor workers or anyone without access to reliable cooling are more likely to succumb to heat-related illnesses than others. At least three of the people who may have succumbed to heat in Santa Clara County were unhoused without adequate access to cooling. Nine were over the age of 65, the county medical examiner told CNN. At least one person died from heat in Southeast Texas, where more than 1 million people are still without power for the fourth day after Hurricane Beryl. Others have died or been sickened trying to keep cool improperly using generators. At least four children \u2013 a 2-year-old in Arizona; a 2-year-old in Georgia; a 4-year-old in Texas; a 5-year-old in Nebraska \u2013 died after being left in cars during this month\u2019s heat. Another child \u2013 a 10-year-old \u2013 died of a \u201cheat-related medical event\u201d while hiking in a Phoenix park amid searing heat last week, according to the Phoenix Police Department. Phoenix has broken or tied multiple daily heat records since the start of July. High temperatures have climbed above 110 degrees and lows have failed to fall below 90 in the city each day since last Tuesday. Dozens of other deaths are being investigated by Phoenix\u2019s Maricopa County for potential heat-related causes. At least 10 suspected heat deaths are being reported in Oregon. At least six have been in Portland\u2019s Multnomah County. Portland smashed daily high records for at least five consecutive days in the past week, rising into the triple digits on three occasions. The heat has also taken a toll on recreationalists attempting to enjoy the outdoors in hostile weather. A motorcyclist died from heat exposure in Death Valley on Saturday. The high temperature topped out at 128 degrees, setting a daily record and coming within six degrees of the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth. A 50-year-old man also died while hiking on Sunday amid extreme heat in Grand Canyon National Park, the National Park Service confirmed. Some of these deaths are still under investigation, since confirming heat as a cause of death has always been \u201ca complicated process,\u201d David S. Jones, a physician and historian at Harvard University, previously told CNN. A medical examiner or coroner must list a single cause of death, and in some places, those officials are political appointees or elected officials who may not have any kind of medical background. \u201cThe (cause of death) assessment itself is a complicated one,\u201d Jones added. \u201cIf someone is found deceased in an apartment, and you\u2019re trying to figure out what was the top cause of death to list, many medical examiners will say, \u2018well, the person must have died of heart disease in some way because their heart stopped.\u2019\u201d Heat-related deaths will likely rise in the coming weeks as more are confirmed and temperatures stay high. The extreme nature of the heat in the West will start to ease late this weekend, starting a slow return to near- or slightly above-normal summer heat. The region is still typically quite hot in July even without heat reaching record levels daily. Heat will be a consistent companion over much of the US with hotter than average temperatures likely through the end of July and into at least early August, according to the Climate Prediction Center.

{"id": "2024_07_09_europe_yulia-navalnaya-arrest-order-russia-intl", "text": "A court in Moscow has ordered Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of late Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny, to be arrested in absentia, her spokesperson said Tuesday. The Basmanny District Court in Moscow accused Navalnaya, who now lives outside Russia, of \u201cparticipation in an extremist organization,\u201d her spokesperson Kira Yarmysh said in a post on social media. She has also been added to an international wanted list, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. In addition, the court granted a request by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation to detain Navalnaya. The period of detention would be calculated from the moment of possible extradition to Russian territory or from her detention on Russian territory, according to a press release. Navalnaya does not live in Russia. Alexey Navalny died on February 16 in the penal colony in Siberia where he was serving a 19-year sentence after being found guilty of creating an extremist community, financing extremist activists and various other crimes in August. He was already serving sentences of 11-and-a-half years in a maximum security facility on fraud and other charges he had always denied and claimed were politically motivated. Navalny was Russia\u2019s highest-profile opposition leader and spent years criticizing Putin, who has been in power for nearly a quarter of a century, at great personal risk. His death came weeks before the country\u2019s\u00a0presidential elections\u00a0scheduled to begin nationwide on March 15, which is widely seen by the international community as little more than a formality that will secure Putin a fifth term in power. \u2018Putin is a murderer\u2019 Navalny\u2019s death was met with grief and anger across the world as well as inside Russia, where the smallest acts of political dissent carry huge risks. He returned to Russia in 2021 from Germany, where he had been treated after being poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent. On arrival Navalny was swiftly arrested \u2013 on charges he dismissed as politically motivated \u2013 and spent the rest of his life in prison. His wife, Yulia\u00a0Navalnaya, accused Russian President Vladimir Putin in February of being\u00a0responsible for his death\u00a0and indicated she would pick up her husband\u2019s mantle,\u00a0for a \u201chappy, beautiful Russia.\u201d Navalnaya posted an eight-minute video on her dead\u00a0husband\u2019s\u00a0social media outlets, saying Putin \u201ckilled the father of my children, Putin took away the most precious thing that was my closest and most beloved person.\u201d She said Russian authorities were \u201chiding\u201d Navalny\u2019s body in an attempt to disguise the cause of his death \u2013 \u201clying pathetically\u201d and waiting for \u201ctraces of another of Putin\u2019s Novichoks to disappear.\u201d The Kremlin rejected any allegations of involvement in\u00a0Navalny\u2019s death. Reacting to the court\u2019s decision on Tuesday, Navalnaya reiterated claims of Putin\u2019s involvement in the death of her husband. \u201cHis place is in prison, and not somewhere in The Hague, in a cozy cell with a TV, but in Russia \u2013 in the same colony and the same 2 by 3 meter cell in which he killed Alexey,\u201d she said in a social media post. \u201cOh, won\u2019t there be the usual procedure?

{"id": "2024_06_25_style_paris-2024-olympic-village", "text": "When Paris last hosted the Summer Olympics 100 years ago, organizers were so keen to bring athletes under the same roof that they built the first-ever Olympic Village. It was spartan, made up of furnished wood huts, and it was razed shortly after. The competition is back in the City of Lights a century later, but French officials are doing something completely different this time around. As part of their effort to make Paris 2024 the \u201cmost responsible and sustainable games in history,\u201d they\u2019re building something that\u2019s meant to last. \u201cThis village was thought up as a neighborhood, a neighborhood that is going to have a life afterwards,\u201d said Georgina Grenon, the Paris 2024 director of sustainability. \u201cParis 2024 is renting it for a few months.\u201d Instead of rooming in apartments tailor-made for them, athletes in the Olympic Village this summer will be living in what will become someone else\u2019s home or workplace. Once the Paralympics have finished on September 8, the village \u2014 which contains 82 buildings \u2014 will be converted into office space for 6,000 workers and apartments to house another 6,000 people. The hope is that the project will provide a model to alleviate a housing crisis in the French capital, where rising interest rates, surging prices and a supply crunch have made it harder than ever to buy or rent a home. Demand for affordable housing is so intense that when a small 10 square meter (108 square feet) apartment in Paris\u2019 up-and-coming 10th arrondissement hit the rental market last year at a price of 610 euros ($614) per month, it attracted a staggering 765 applicants in less than a week. The site for the Olympic Village was chosen in the hopes it would revitalize some of the city\u2019s historically impoverished northern suburbs. The village lies at the juncture of three suburbs: Saint-Denis, a diverse, working-class neighborhood long associated with crime and insecurity; the rapidly gentrifying Saint-Ouen; and Ile-Saint-Denis, an island on the Seine River. Organizers say post-Olympics, 32% of the new homes in Saint-Denis and Saint-Ouen, and 48% of those in Ile-Saint-Denis built for the Games will be set aside for public housing. There\u2019s a risk, however, that current residents could be priced out. Similar pledges to build affordable housing in east London were made in advance of the 2012 Olympics, but those promises ended up largely falling flat. A BBC report in 2022 found that of the 9,000 homes built within the Olympic Park, less than 200 were offered at the cheapest levels of rent. \u2018It\u2019s a huge test lab\u2019 Like the Olympics themselves \u2014 which organizers say will run 100% on renewable energy \u2014 everything built for the village was done with sustainability in mind. To minimize the amount of construction, organizers temporarily or permanently retrofitted several existing structures on the site, including an old electric factory that\u2019s been turned into a \u201cresident center.\u201d They also rented existing movie studios in the area to be used as training facilities for athletes instead of building new training facilities which has been done at some other Games. The buildings that were erected were built with wood and recycled materials, employing processes that, according to Grenon, reduced the project\u2019s carbon footprint by 30% per square meter \u2014 more than French ecological regulations require. A third of all the rooftops are equipped with solar panels, while another third have gardens meant to bring down the temperature inside, Grenon said. And long, straight openings leading to the Seine were left in between the buildings to form wind tunnels carrying the fresh air near the river as far inland as possible. Temperatures this summer are expected to be warmer than normal, according to France\u2019s national weather service, and there is widespread concern heat could jeopardize athlete safety. But the structures themselves aren\u2019t the only thing that will be recycled. The village will house about 3,000 apartments containing a total of 14,250 beds made with recyclable materials similar to the ones used in Tokyo. The mattresses were manufactured with reused materials and their firmness can be adjusted by flipping them over. Stools were made with cardboard meaning they can be easily recycled after the Olympics. Across the village, organizers are running a handful of experiments to see if new green technologies and construction methods are viable in the real world. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge test lab,\u201d Grenon said. One sidewalk has been made with seashells. In theory, those shells are supposed to absorb rain. On hot days, the stored water should evaporate and help cool passers-by. The village\u2019s main drag features five experimental outdoor air filters. These giant, UFO-like towers are designed like vacuums to suck in the polluted air and filter out dangerous particles. The device can clean \u201c95% of the air of the particulate matter \u2014 all sizes,\u201d its creator, Jerome Giacomoni, told CNN. The five devices can clean the equivalent of the volume of 40 Olympic-sized swimming pools an hour with very little electricity consumption, Giacomoni said. Keeping cool The most scrutinized innovation will likely be the geothermal cooling system, as athletes in Paris could face the same level of sweltering heat and humidity that broiled Tokyo during the Summer Olympics there three years ago. \u201cClimate change should increasingly be viewed as an existential threat to sport,\u201d Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said in a report published last week (June 18) examining the heat risks associated with this summer\u2019s games. While the ground floor of some buildings in the Olympic Village are equipped with traditional air conditioning because they will be converted into shops after the Olympics, the athlete apartments will use geothermal cooling instead of air conditioning. This system takes water cooled to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) from wells as deep as 70 meters (230 feet) underground at a nearby geothermal plant and transports them to pipes under the floors of each apartment. That cold water should be able to cool the building by 6 to 10 degrees Celsius compared to the temperature outside, according to Laurent Michaud, the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Village director. While the system will be controlled at the building level, each apartment has a thermostat that allows them to lower or raise the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius in each unit. The system will also heat apartments in the winter. The human-caused climate crisis has made heat waves more frequent and intense, and they are starting earlier in the year in many parts of the world. Paris is particularly vulnerable \u2014 people in the French capital are more likely to die from extreme heat than any other city in Europe, a study that looked at more than 850 cities showed. As of 2022, just 19% of all households in Europe were equipped with air conditioning, according to the most recent figures from the International Energy Agency. But extreme heat across the world has driven up global demand for AC units, creating a climate Catch-22, as air conditioning systems use large amounts of energy, much of which still comes from fossil fuels that emit carbon dioxide and heats the planet. For delegations concerned about the system\u2019s efficacy during a heat wave, the village will offer them the option to rent individual air conditioning units. Asked about the lack of air conditioning in the Village by news agency Reuters in March, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the village was \u201cdesigned to avoid the need for air conditioning, even in very, very high temperatures.\u201d \u201cWe are on the brink of a precipice. Everyone, including the athletes, must be aware of this,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cWe have to trust the scientists when they help us to construct buildings in a sober way that allows us to make do without air conditioning.\u201d CNN\u2019s Saskya Vandoorne and Derek Van Dam contributed to this report", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/06/25/style/paris-2024-olympic-village/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

The organization, founded by 2011 CNN Hero Yuval Roth, had grown to 1,300 volunteers and was helping about 140 patients a day before the war. On October 7, during Hamas\u2019 brutal attacks on Israel, several of the group\u2019s volunteers were killed. Others were taken hostage. Today, Road to Recovery\u2019s work continues, and Roth feels that it is as crucial as ever. \u201cWe \u2026 believe that patient transportation has far greater value than just humanitarian assistance,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt is an opportunity for us to show our Palestinian neighbors a different face than what they know in their reality. It is a chance for encounters that break down barriers and stigmas.\u201d On October 8, volunteers were waiting at checkpoints at the West Bank to pick up Palestinian patients and their families. The organization currently transports between 40 to 50 patients a day between the checkpoints and Israeli hospitals and medical providers. Roth started this work in 2006 as a way to cope with personal tragedy. In 1993, his brother Udi was kidnapped and killed by members of Hamas. After his loss, Roth channeled his anger into peace. The organization says it has since provided transportation to more than 50,000 sick Palestinians. \u201cEach trip is an opportunity to make a \u2018small hour of peace.\u2019\u201d Roth said. \u201cEspecially now, just to show compassion and love. \u2026 This is the medicine for the hostility and for the hateness.\u201d Sometimes, the Israeli volunteer drivers and Palestinian passengers are able to communicate in Arabic, Hebrew, or English. When there\u2019s no shared spoken language, they communicate through gestures, which Roth finds to be more powerful than words. \u201cIf we really want one day normal life for us and for the Palestinians, we should make effort to achieve it,\u201d Roth said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that you sit and you wait that something will happen. You have to do something. In the Bible, there is a phrase \u2026 that you ask for peace, and you have to run after the peace in order that it will happen.

Blunt vandalism of ministerial cars. Even an apparent, failed bomb plot. Russia has been engaged in a \u201cbold\u201d sabotage operation across NATO\u2019s member states for\u00a0more than six\u00a0months, targeting the supply lines of weapons for Ukraine and the decision-makers behind it, according to a senior NATO official. Multiple security officials across Europe describe a threat that is metastasizing as Russian agents, increasingly under scrutiny by security services and\u00a0frustrated in their own operations, hire local amateurs to undertake high-risk, and often deniable, crimes on their behalf. The NATO official said they had observed \u201can unprecedented escalation and spread of Russia\u2019s hybrid warfare\u201d over the past six months, which included \u201cphysical sabotage\u201d on the supply line of NATO weapons intended for Ukraine. \u201cIt is everything from point of production and origin, to storage, to those who are making decisions, to the actual\u00a0delivery,\u201d the\u00a0senior NATO official said. \u201cIt is bold. Russia is attempting to intimidate\u00a0(our)\u00a0allies.\u201d Russia has dismissed the claims as unfounded but\u00a0Russian sabotage and hybrid warfare will be on the agenda of the NATO 75th anniversary meeting in Washington, DC,\u00a0which began Tuesday. Yet it is unclear how publicly member states will express their outrage at what analysts have called the Kremlin\u2019s new \u201cshadow\u00a0war,\u201d as they may be\u00a0reluctant to provide Moscow with a propaganda win, or foment alarm at a series of security breaches across Europe. Recent high-profile arrests have revealed the ad-hoc, clumsy nature of how the Kremlin\u2019s intelligence operations have evolved since the start of the war in\u00a0Ukraine. Last year, 14\u00a0Ukrainians and two Belarusians\u00a0were arrested in Poland in one case on suspicion of\u00a0working for Russian intelligence. A Ukrainian, who under Polish privacy law can be identified only as Maxim L., 24, was sentenced to\u00a0six\u00a0years\u00a0after weeks of receiving tasks from a Russian handler, Andrzej,\u00a0whom he had never physically met but encountered on the Telegram messaging app in February 2023. Andrzej at first paid him $7 in digital currencies for spraying anti-war graffiti around Poland, Maxim said. Yet the tasks soon became darker. \u2018Easy money\u2026 it seemed so insignificant\u2019 In a rare interview with CNN inside the maximum-security wing of Lublin prison, Maxim said he had fled Ukraine to Poland in a frustrated bid to escape\u00a0unemployment and poverty. \u201cIt was easy\u00a0money,\u201d he\u00a0said of the work Andrzej offered. \u201cI needed money badly.\u201d He said he did not feel an obligation to fight for Ukraine after the Russian invasion\u00a0in\u00a0February 2022. \u201cThat country has never done anything for\u00a0me,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that just because you are born in a certain country, you have to go to war for it. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I am not pro-Russian, I am not pro-Ukraine. I am not pro-anything.\u201d Andrzej soon started sending Maxim location pins where he should plant surveillance cameras along the railway tracks near the border town of Medyka, through which military and humanitarian aid would flow to Ukraine. \u201cI didn\u2019t think any of it could cause any actual harm. It seemed so insignificant,\u201d he\u00a0said. Andrzej later asked him to burn down the fence of a Ukrainian-owned transportation company in the eastern Polish town of Biala Podlaska, he said, which Maxim says he faked,\u00a0taking a photograph of the fence with lumps of coal he had placed to mimic fire damage. Yet Maxim\u2019s slow realization that Andrzej was a Russian agent became complete, he said, when he was told to put cameras outside a base where Poland was training Ukrainian soldiers. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew it could be\u00a0serious,\u201d he\u00a0said. \u201cIt made me feel uneasy. That was when I decided I\u2019d quit. But I never got a chance. I got arrested the\u00a0next day.\u201d Polish internal security agents arrested Maxim on March 3, 2023, after weeks of surveillance, sparked partially by the discovery of a gas station receipt Maxim had accidentally dropped on one of his operations,\u00a0according to a Polish official.\u00a0Multiple other arrests followed this, making it the largest\u00a0known\u00a0Russian espionage operation in Poland of recent times, raising concerns in Warsaw about the extent of Moscow\u2019s infiltration. Two Russian citizens were\u00a0detained\u00a0last August\u00a0on suspicion of\u00a0recruiting to Wagner\u00a0and a Polish\u00a0man and two Belarusians this May for\u00a0alleged\u00a0arson. Another Polish man was arrested in April 2024 for possessing ammunition, and surveilling Rzeszow Jasionka airport, a hub for moving NATO arms to Kyiv, in a suspected plot to assassinate Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky, who also frequently uses the facility. The Polish plots join a series of incidents across Europe which, when viewed together,\u00a0portray\u00a0the widescale ambition of Moscow\u2019s operations.\u00a0Russia was \u201clikely\u201d behind an arson attack that hit Poland\u2019s largest shopping\u00a0center\u00a0in May, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said, and suspicions have been voiced about another fire at an ammunition factory, south of the capital, in June. Czech officials have voiced concerns at Russian involvement in the hacking and disruption of its railways last year. Last month, a suspicious fire hit a metals factory for a defense manufacturer outside Berlin, and a\u00a026-year-old\u00a0pro-Russian\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0was arrested after blowing himself up with a\u00a0homemade\u00a0bomb near\u00a0Paris Charles de Gaulle airport.\u00a0A\u00a0warehouse\u00a0fire in East London in March led to\u00a0two men\u00a0being charged by London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service with arson and assisting a foreign intelligence service, namely Russia. While the incidents have not all been definitively linked to Russian intelligence, they have been unified by the apparent involvement of amateurs, or petty criminality aimed at spreading fear or disruption. A \u2018pretty dangerous game\u2019 The senior NATO official said Russian sabotage on NATO states amounted to a \u201cpretty dangerous game, if\u00a0(Russia believes)\u00a0these things are always below the threshold of armed conflict,\u201d that\u00a0would not trigger the NATO\u00a0Article 5\u00a0stipulation that an attack on one member state is an attack on the entire alliance. \u201cFinding where that line is, is a difficult and dangerous calculation to make,\u201d the official said, adding that\u00a0Russian President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u2019s beleaguered invasion of Ukraine shows the Kremlin head was not always getting good military advice. Russia is using the \u201cfull gamut\u201d of hybrid operations, the official added. \u201cWe see everything from high-end operations in Europe, where we have seen as much as 400,000 euros ($433,000) paid for some type of intelligence activity, to some places where thugs are being hired for a couple of thousand\u00a0euros.\u201d A similar threat\u00a0has grown\u00a0on Russia\u2019s border with NATO, in Estonia, where 10\u00a0suspected Russian agents were arrested\u00a0in February after the interior minister\u2019s car was vandalized. The incident was a high-profile peak in what Estonian officials have said is a years-long campaign by Moscow to destabilize its tiny\u00a0NATO\u00a0neighbor, about a fifth\u00a0of whose population of 1.3 million is Russian-speaking,\u00a0according to a 2021 analysis by the EU. Recent months have seen GPS jamming impede civilian aircraft landings, and even the buoys that demark part of Russia\u2019s border with Estonia disappear, amid a short-lived call from Moscow for the maritime frontiers to be reassessed. Harrys Puusepp, a spokesman for the KAPO, Estonia\u2019s internal security service, told CNN that Russian activities had escalated over recent months. \u201cWe saw a significant rise in their activity in the last autumn, and by winter, we were able to apprehend more than\u00a010 (suspects).\u00a0The number has grown by now \u2013 persons who were involved in their hybrid activities against Estonian security \u2013 in a kind that we hadn\u2019t seen before.\u201d He said the operations were moving \u201ctowards physical attacks\u201d and suggested the war in Ukraine might lead to more aggressive Russian tactics in the months ahead, if operatives were redeployed to the Baltic areas from the war. \u201cWe have to face the facts. Russia is big enough to have resources to fight a war against Ukraine and also maintain its security operations against European countries\u2026 against us. There are people who take part in the war against Ukraine, and then they are rotated to some other region or area. They have more experience. Their mindset is more violent. They are perhaps not so patient anymore trying to get results.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/europe/russia-shadow-war-nato-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_europe_russian-missile-strike-kyiv-hospital-un-intl-hnk", "text": "Ukraine\u2019s largest children\u2019s hospital likely took a direct hit from a Russian missile on Monday, a United Nations assessment has found, as NATO agreed to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s air defenses in the wake of the attack. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting the hospital in Kyiv and alleged, without evidence, that a\u00a0Ukrainian\u00a0anti-aircraft missile caused the blast. But a UN human rights official said evidence suggested Moscow\u2019s forces were responsible for the deadly strike. \u201cAnalysis of the video footage and assessment made at the incident site indicates a high likelihood that the children\u2019s hospital suffered a direct hit rather than receiving damages due to an intercepted weapons system,\u201d Danielle Bell, head of the UN\u2019s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, told reporters Tuesday. Bell said the attack damaged the intensive care, surgical and oncology wards at Kyiv\u2019s Okhmatdyt\u00a0hospital, which has been vital in the care of some of the sickest children from across the country, adding that Ukrainian officials have since transferred 600 children to other hospitals. \u201cThis terrible attack shows that nowhere is safe in Ukraine,\u201d Bell added. The UN assessment tallies with weapons experts, who told CNN that it was highly likely a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile struck the children\u2019s hospital in Kyiv on Monday. Reviewing video footage that CNN had verified and geolocated and images of fragments from the scene, weapons experts said that evidence strongly suggests the hospital was struck by a Russian cruise missile as opposed to a Ukrainian air defense projectile. Justin Bronk, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London, told CNN Wednesday that the flight profile in the footage of the missile hitting the hospital is \u201cexactly correct for the Kh-101, with the right dive angle, under power and not tumbling or falling like a spent air-defence missile might.\u201d The silhouette of the rocket visible in the footage also matches the Kh-101, Bronk said. Two adults were killed in the strike and 16 others - including seven children - were injured, according to Ukrainian officials,\u00a0as Russia launched\u00a0a brazen daytime aerial assault on targets in cities across\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0during morning rush hour, killing at least 43 people in total. The strikes across Ukraine were \u201cstrongly\u201d condemned by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, while the UN\u2019s human rights chief Volker Turk called for \u201cprompt, thorough and independent investigations\u201d into the attacks. The Russian attacks came as NATO leaders gathered in Washington, where the United States and NATO allies agreed to\u00a0give Ukraine more Patriot batteries and additional systems to strengthen\u00a0Kyiv\u2019s air defenses, members of the defense alliance said in a joint statement on Tuesday. US President Joe Biden also announced plans to supply new air defenses to Ukraine in a speech opening the NATO summit \u2013 providing much-needed support for the country at a critical juncture in its defense against Russia\u2019s invasion. During his speech on Tuesday, Biden vowed that \u201cthe United States will make sure that when we export critical air defense interceptors, Ukraine goes to the front of the line.\u201d \u2018Targeted attack by Russia\u2019 Images and video from the aftermath of the strike on the Kyiv hospital show children with cancer being treated outside the facility and an injured toddler with blood on his face and arms. A\u00a0CNN team at the site\u00a0on Tuesday said the level of destruction\u00a0there\u00a0showed how forceful the explosion must have been. A pile of debris could be seen in place of where part of the facility once stood, while underneath a section of flooring lay the remnants of a car that was completely flattened when the building came crashing down. The UN\u2019s monitoring mission said it was likely that a KH-101 cruise missile launched by Russia struck the children\u2019s hospital. It made the determination \u201cbased on video footage, which shows the technical specification of the type of weapon that was used\u201d and that such footage \u201cshows the weapon directly impacting the hospital rather than being intercepted in the air,\u201d Bell said. A military expert who visited the site following the blast said the damage is \u201cconsistent with a direct hit,\u201d according to Bell. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Washington on Tuesday that\u00a0\u201cRussia always knows where its missiles hit. Always.\u201d On Tuesday, Russia\u2019s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia\u00a0reiterated Moscow\u2019s denial that it had targeted the children\u2019s hospital. \u201cWe have not bombed the children\u2019s\u00a0hospital,\u201d\u00a0Nebenzia\u00a0said\u00a0at a special meeting of the UN Security Council (UNSC) convened following the attack. \u201cIf this had been a Russian strike, there would have been nothing left of the building at all. All the children and most of the adults would have been killed, not wounded.\u201d But the US also blamed Russia for the hospital strike. US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield\u00a0told the UNSC meeting that the Russian \u201cattack makes abundantly clear: Putin is not interested in peace.\u201d Kyiv described the strike as a \u201ctargeted attack by Russia,\u201d with the Ukrainian State Security Service (SBU) saying a Russian\u00a0long-range cruise missile struck the facility. \u201cRelevant evidence has already been found at the scene of the tragedy: in particular, fragments of the rear part of the Kh-101 missile with a serial number and part of the steering wheel of the same missile,\u201d the SBU said. SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk vowed the agency would respond to what he said were Russian war crimes. \u201cThis retribution will be both legal and moral,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/europe/russian-missile-strike-kyiv-hospital-un-intl-hnk/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

Microsoft took a\u00a0non-voting, observer position\u00a0on OpenAI\u2019s board in November last year after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took back the reins of the company, which operates the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT. The seat meant it could attend OpenAI\u2019s board meetings and access confidential information but had no voting rights on matters including electing or choosing directors. The observer seat and Microsoft\u2019s more than $10 billion investment in OpenAI have triggered unease among antitrust watchdogs in Europe, Britain and the US over how much control it exerts over OpenAI. Microsoft cited OpenAI\u2019s new partnerships, innovation and growing customer base since Altman\u2019s return to the startup for giving up its observer seat. \u201cOver the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company\u2019s direction. Given all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary,\u201d it said in a letter to OpenAI dated July 9.

In contrast, the\u00a0British\u00a0and US antitrust watchdogs continue to have concerns as well as questions about Microsoft\u2019s influence over OpenAI and the latter\u2019s independence. Microsoft and OpenAI are increasingly competing to sell AI technology to enterprise customers, aiming to generate revenue and demonstrate their independence to regulators to address antitrust concerns.

{"id": "2024_07_11_middleeast_israeli-military-inquiry-kibbutz-beeri-intl-latam", "text": "An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) internal investigation into the failures to protect the kibbutz of Be\u2019eri on October 7 found that the Israeli military \u201cfailed in its mission to protect the residents\u201d and \u201cwas not prepared for the extensive infiltration scenario\u201d by Hamas that day, which involved \u201cmultiple infiltration points by thousands of terrorists attacking dozens of locations simultaneously.\u201d Be\u2019eri, located in southern Israel, was one of the hardest hit communities in the October 7 attacks\u00a0when Hamas militants stormed the kibbutz, killing 101 of its residents, including children. Thirty people were abducted from the kibbutz that day. The inquiry said the military had trained for isolated and specific infiltrations. \u201cAs a result, there were no additional reserve forces in the area that could have been sent to Kibbutz Be\u2019eri,\u201d the inquiry said. Responding to the inquiry\u2019s report, the Chief of the General Staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi said it \u201cclearly illustrates the magnitude of the failure and the scale of the disaster that befell the residents of the south who defended their families with their bodies for many hours while the IDF was not there to protect them.\u201d The inquiry found that \u201cthe IDF struggled to create a clear and accurate situational assessment of what was happening in the kibbutz until the afternoon of October 7,\u201d even though the local emergency team had provided an updated assessment. \u201cCombat in the area during the initial hours was characterized by a lack of command and control, a lack of coordination, and a lack of order among the different forces and units. This led to several incidents where security forces grouped at the entrance to the kibbutz without immediately engaging in combat,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe inquiry found that the security officials did not provide sufficient warning to the residents of Kibbutz Be\u2019eri about the infiltration of terrorists during the initial hours of the terrorist attack,\u201d the report continued. The inquiry concluded that the turning point came only when a senior officer was appointed to coordinate forces in the area, leading to the regaining of operational control of the kibbutz. \u201cDespite operational errors and mistakes in force deployment, the inquiry team noted that the combat in Be\u2019eri included a series of acts of heroism and supreme courage by the fighting forces, commanders, and security personnel who fought in the kibbutz, saving many residents,\u201d the report said. It also said \u201cthe bravery of the Be\u2019eri residents and the members of the kibbutz\u2019s civilian rapid response team is commendable and was crucial in stabilizing the defensive line during the first hours of combat, preventing the attack from spreading to other parts of the kibbutz.\u201d The inquiry also found that the security forces who fought in the area \u201coperated with great bravery and heroism.\u201d 31 security personnel were killed in the area after some \u201c340 terrorists infiltrated the kibbutz,\u201d of whom about 100 were killed, it said. At a briefing Thursday, IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said more findings would be presented in the coming months. \u201cThis investigation is not the end of a process, it is the beginning.\u201d Timeline of attack The inquiry team found that that the attack on Be\u2019eri began at around 7 a.m. local time on October 7 and that Hamas controlled the kibbutz for about four hours. During this period, the \u201cfirst IDF soldiers arrive, are hit, evacuate the wounded, exit the kibbutz, and, positioning themselves at the entrance of the kibbutz, engage in combat with the terrorists who reached the gate.\u201d By 4.15 p.m., the 99th\u00a0Division had established itself at the kibbutz and began organizing command and control. By 6 p.m., \u201cabout 700 IDF soldiers and security forces are operating in the area of the kibbutz,\u201d the inquiry found. The Chief of the General Staff, Lt. Gen. Halevi, accepted the conclusions of the inquiry, and acknowledged that \u201cthe IDF did not fulfil its mission to defend the residents in the most grave manner and failed in its mission.\u201d Halevi noted that \u201cfrom the afternoon hours onwards, forces were waiting outside the kibbutz while the massacre continued inside. This situation is extremely grave and cannot occur.\u201d \u201cThe reasons for this were found to include that commanders who arrived with forces entered the kibbutz with a part of the force to better understand the situation; some forces did not initiate contact since they did not understand the severity of the situation and the lack of adequate forces; some of those waiting outside were support forces providing a perimeter for those engaged in combat inside the kibbutz,\u201d he said. As for prioritizing the evacuation of wounded soldiers, Halevi said that civilian protection was the highest-priority mission. \u201cSoldiers must always give priority to assisting civilians in evacuation, defense and any other need that arises in a combat zone,\u201d he said. Separately,\u00a0Halevi told a graduation ceremony Thursday for new officers that the IDF had worked with all partners \u201cto understand in detail and depth what happened and what we must learn to prevent it from happening again in the future.\u201d Be\u2019eri kibbutz survivors were presented with the findings of the report earlier Thursday. \u201cIt can be said that the investigation was thorough and helped the members of the kibbutz understand a little the depth and complexity of the fighting in the various sectors of the kibbutz,\u201d a statement released by Be\u2019eri spokesperson Michal Paykin said. But he said some important questions remained unanswered. \u201cFor example: Why did the many military forces who gathered at the gate not enter the kibbutz for many hours, when the kibbutz was burning, and its residents were crying for help?\u00a0What caused the intelligence failure that enabled the Hamas invasion plan, and how was the border fence breached without an immediate response from the IDF?\u201d he said. Members of \u201cKibbutz Be\u2019eri did not need the results of the investigation to feel the failure of the IDF\u201d that morning. \u201cThe failure of the army has been burned into our bodies and in our hearts for nine months,\u201d the statement adds. Former residents are now calling for a state commission of inquiry to \u201cexamine the conduct of all the parties and provide us with answers with which we can begin to recover,\u201d the statement added. \u201cFinally, and most importantly, we demand to deal with the abandonment that is happening right now across the border - the abandonment of the hostages to their fate for nine months.\u00a0 The ongoing failure to return them to this day must stop,\u201d the statement ends. Speaking about a state inquiry, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Thursday at the officers\u2019 graduation ceremony: \u201cIt should check all of us: decision-makers and executive officers, the government, the army and the security agencies, in this government, and in the governments of the last decade that led to the events of October 7.\u201d \u201cIt should examine me, the Minister of Defense, it should examine the Prime Minister, the Chief of Staff and the head of the Shin Bet, the IDF, and the national bodies subordinate to the government,\u201d Gallant said. A commission \u201cmust examine the intelligence and operational failure of the events of the 7th October,\u201d as well as examine \u201cthe errors made in assessing the enemy\u2019s capabilities and in warning of its intentions\u00a0 - that culminated on the 7th of October,\u201d Gallant said. Focus on 13 hostages One focus of the inquiry into events at Be\u2019eri on October 7 was the effort to save 13 people held hostage in a house at the kibbutz. There had been speculation that the hostages had been killed by tank fire from the Israeli military as it tried to force entry to the house, but the inquiry found that Hamas operatives at the house probably killed the hostages. \u201cAfter gunfire was heard from within the house and the terrorists communicated their intent to commit suicide and kill the hostages, the security forces decided to breach the house to attempt to save the hostages, and conducted combat operations under difficult conditions,\u201d the inquiry concluded. It said that\u00a0\u201ccommanders and forces made professional and responsible decisions, and fully exhausted negotiation efforts. The tank fire towards the area near the house was carried out\u00a0professionally, with a joint decision made by commanders from all the security organizations after careful consideration\u2026 with the intent to apply pressure to the terrorists and save the civilians held hostage inside.\u201d \u201cThe team determined that, based on the information reviewed and to the best of their understanding, no civilians inside the building were harmed by tank shell fire, except for an isolated incident outside the building where two civilians were injured by shrapnel,\u201d \ufeffit continued. \u201cThe team determined that most of the hostages were likely murdered by the terrorists, and further inquiries and reviews of additional findings are necessary.\u201d Regarding the conclusions, Halevi said,\u00a0\u201cIn such events, the commander on the ground must make difficult decisions with the goal of saving as many civilians as possible. The inquiry revealed that this value guided the decision-making of the commanders on the ground during this event.\u201d Hagari said later Thursday that the IDF had been trying to carry out negotiations with Hamas but those failed. \u201cThe decision to carry out a rescue attempt under fire was made after all attempts to hold negotiations to rescue the hostages were exhausted, and after a long burst of gunfire was heard from inside the house, which raised the suspicion that the hostages were being murdered,\u201d he said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/middleeast/israeli-military-inquiry-kibbutz-beeri-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_05_uk_nigel-farage-reform-party-win-gbr-intl", "text": "Nigel Farage,\u00a0a driving force behind Britain\u2019s Brexit movement and a confidant of former US President Donald Trump, has been elected to parliament for the first time, as his upstart right-wing Reform UK party looks to shake up the country\u2019s politics. Farage becomes a member of Britain\u2019s parliament on his\u00a0eighth attempt after winning with 46.2% of the vote\u00a0in the heavily pro-Brexit Clacton, a seaside town on England\u2019s southeastern coast where Reform UK had polled well. With most of the votes now counted, results indicate Reform UK has won at least five seats in the House of Commons, a comparatively strong showing in Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system where smaller parties often struggle to translate their national support into parliamentary seats. Farage\u2019s Reform UK party attacked the Conservative Party on its failure to bring down rates of legal and illegal migration. That message appears to have won over a considerable number of socially conservative voters, with Reform UK candidates splitting the right-wing vote and contributing to the Conservatives\u2019 losses. Farage, an outspoken and polarizing figure, has long been known for using alarmist and confrontational language when discussing immigration. Since announcing his candidacy, Farage has warned supporters of an \u201cinvasion\u201d of asylum seekers, and last month he sparked outrage from political opponents after saying the West \u201cprovoked\u201d\u00a0Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The veteran Euroskeptic, played a leading role in bringing about Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, and has remained a divisive and disruptive figure in the country\u2019s politics since. Farage is perhaps best-known outside of the UK for his friendship with former US President Donald Trump, recently campaigning alongside him. But he has never been elected to parliament, losing seven elections since 1994 before this victory.\u00a0He won Clacton on a massive swing towards Reform UK, picking up 21,225 votes to the Conservatives\u2019 12,820. Friday\u2019s results now give Reform UK a small but significant base from which to oppose Labour leader and soon-to-be new UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a crucial parliamentary platform. \u201cIt\u2019s not just disappointment with the Conservative Party. There is a massive gap on the center right of British politics and my job is to fill it. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Farage said after winning the seat. He pledged to \u201cchallenge the general election properly in 2029,\u201d and promised to turn his rhetoric toward the Labour Party as it enters government. In many seats around the UK, Reform came second to Labour. Farage said the \u201cLabour government will be in trouble very, very quickly and we will now be targeting Labour votes. We\u2019re coming for Labour \u2013 be in no doubt about that.\u201d His presence during the election campaign upended the Conservative Party\u2019s efforts to win back socially conservative, pro-Brexit voters. His win comes at the same time Europe is broadly in the grip of what some call a right-wing populist surge. Last month\u2019s\u00a0European elections\u00a0saw a historic number of lawmakers from hard-right and far-right parties elected to the European Parliament. In snap French elections, far-right National Rally\u00a0won the first round last week. Speaking to CNN Thursday night, Politico deputy UK editor Rosa Prince said the result showed a \u201cvery widespread disaffection with the Conservative Party\u201d and that Reform UK\u2019s far-right policies \u201creally chime with some parts of the electorate.\u201d \u201cThe big question is going to be whether the Conservative Party tries to draw him in to them and maybe even join forces, or whether they push him away,\u201d Prince said. \u201cBecause what you could have is a total realignment of the right\u2026 I think Nigel Farage is certainly going to be causing trouble in the Houses of Parliament.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/uk/nigel-farage-reform-party-win-gbr-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

{"id": "2024_07_10_middleeast_palestinian-patients-evacutation-gaza-war-uae-floating-hospital-mime-intl", "text": "Aged just four, Julia Abu Zeiter suffers from a rare neurological disease that can be fatal without medication. The nine-month war in Gaza nearly took Julia\u2019s life, as the fighting and displacement cut off her access to treatment. After an arduous journey, she was finally evacuated from the war-torn enclave on June 27, accompanied only by her 21-year-old aunt, Dareen Zeiter. \u201cThe displacement was really difficult, the events in Gaza are very difficult. What Julia saw was very harsh,\u201d Dareen told CNN. Julia suffers from a rare neurological disorder called alternating hemiplegia of childhood, or AHC. It causes recurrent episodes of paralysis and life-threatening seizures. No cure exists for the illness, which is estimated to occur in approximately one in a million births. Its patients are referred to as \u201chuman time bombs\u201d and need to constantly be monitored for signs of an oncoming episode. As soon as it strikes, lifesaving measures must quickly be administered. CNN met with Julia and Dareen aboard a floating hospital run by the United Arab Emirates, where they had been staying for a week after leaving Gaza through Israel\u2019s Kerem Shalom crossing in the south. The two Palestinians were among around a dozen patients leaving the floating hospital to continue their treatment in the Emirati capital Abu Dhabi. Most of those patients are children, including two suffering from Leukemia. Gaza\u2019s \u2018invisible victims\u2019 Moored off the coast of Arish on the north coast of Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula, the hospital is some 40 kilometers from Rafah, the southernmost city in the Gaza strip that now lies in ruins after Israel launched its ground operation there in May. The city also housed the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, a crucial land bridge through which two-thirds of aid entering Gaza passed. The crossing has been closed since it was seized by the Israeli military. The 100-bed UAE ship has received 2,400 injured Palestinians since February, according to the hospital director, Dr. Ahmed Mubarak. Julia is \u201can invisible victim\u201d of the war, Mubarak said, caught up in what M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, also known as Doctors Without Borders, described as Gaza\u2019s \u201csilent killings, the result of deliberate deprivation.\u201d The organization\u2019s head of emergency programs, Mari Carmen Vi\u00f1oles, said in May that Israel\u2019s \u201cblockades, delays, and restrictions on humanitarian aid and essential medical supplies\u201d have made aid deliveries impossible. Julia and Dareen are two of countless Palestinians displaced by the war in Gaza, which Israel launched in response to Hamas\u2019 October 7 attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Israel\u2019s war has killed more than 38,000 people in Gaza, according to the health ministry there. Swathes of the enclave have been turned to rubble and almost the entire strip\u2019s population of two million is internally displaced. Julia and Dareen were forced to leave their home in northern Gaza when the war began. The four-year-old witnessed \u201cexplosions and shelling\u201d throughout, her aunt said. A punishing siege by Israel has choked the enclave, bringing humanitarian aid down to a trickle and preventing Gazans moving in and out. For Julia, this meant running out of her medication, which triggered a series of life-threatening seizures. Around a month into the war, Julia ran out of three of the five medications she was taking, Dareen told CNN. This triggered a state of paralysis for six months. With the help of the Palestine Children\u2019s Relief Fund (PCRF), a US-based non-governmental organization, Julia was able to finally evacuate through Israel\u2019s Kerem Shalom crossing, Dareen said. \u2018Hunger is what destroys us\u2019 Down the hall of makeshift wards from Julia was Ibrahim, who was injured in his family home in Jabalya, northern Gaza, when an airstrike hit their building on November 21. He had turned seven that day. Ibrahim was aboard the ship with his aunt, Alaa, 21. Alaa and Ibrahim were both injured in the airstrike, having survived after being pulled from the rubble, Alaa said. The aunt sustained critical burns, while Ibrahim broke his arm and leg, she said. The boy\u2019s injuries did not heal properly, requiring further treatment. \u201cIbrahim and I were the only two survivors,\u201d Alaa told CNN, adding that the airstrike killed 30 members of their family. They left Gaza on April 28 through the Rafah crossing, just a week before Israeli forces seized control of it. \u201cLook, this is my dad,\u201d Ibrahim said, holding up a photo of his father, who died during the airstrike, on his aunt\u2019s phone. Before losing their home and family, Alaa and Ibrahim remained in northern Gaza until April, when residents were experiencing severe hunger as aid struggled to reach them amid Israel\u2019s military operations and what humanitarian aid officials said was increased lawlessness and looting of trucks there. In mid-March, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) assessed that famine is \u201cimminent\u201d in northern Gaza and said it was projected to occur between then and May. On Tuesday, the United Nations, citing a report by independent experts, said that the recent deaths of more Palestinian children due to hunger and malnutrition in Gaza indicates famine has spread across the entire strip, decrying Israel\u2019s \u201cintentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people\u201d as a \u201cform of genocidal violence\u201d. \u201cThere was unbelievable hunger,\u201d Alaa told CNN, sitting on a hospital bed as Ibrahim stood by. \u201cWe lived through hunger, the main ingredients for food weren\u2019t there,\u201d Alaa told CNN. \u201cHunger was harder on us than the war itself,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThose who have died, died. But hunger is what destroys us.\u201d While Julia and Ibrahim have made it out, millions of others remain trapped in the war zone, with few signs of a ceasefire deal in sight. Nearly 26,000 children have been killed or injured in Gaza in six months, the aid group Save the Children said in April, just over 2% of Gaza\u2019s entire child population. \u201cEven amid the complexities of war, how can we not grasp one universal truth: a child is a child,\u201d UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said last month, calling for \u201ca ceasefire (that) gets hostages home, and stops the killing of children.\u201d Dareen, Julia\u2019s aunt, said the responsibility over her niece was too big to shoulder. \u201cShe needs her mother and father. I can\u2019t be her mother and father at the same time.\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAt the end of the day, I am a child that crossed with a child.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/10/middleeast/palestinian-patients-evacutation-gaza-war-uae-floating-hospital-mime-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_04_uk_uk-election-results-tracker-map-2024-intl", "text": "The tectonic plates of British politics have shifted after Britons resoundingly voted to put an end to 14 years of Conservative rule, and deliver a landslide victory for the Labour Party. Labour\u2019s victory is bigger than the party could have imagined until fairly recently. At the last general election in 2019, it slumped to its worst defeat in more than 80 years and appeared set for a long period in the political wilderness. But the party has since rebuilt itself under the leadership of Keir Starmer, who will now become the next prime minister of the United Kingdom. Under Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post voting system, people in 650 constituencies across the nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have voted to select their member of parliament (MP) to represent the area, producing a flurry of results in the early hours of Friday morning before almost all the results were tallied later that day. The final result of the election will not be announced until Saturday morning, however, due to a recount in the Inverness, Skye and West Ross-shire constituency. A party needs 326 seats to officially win, a milestone that Labour cleared at around 5 a.m. local time on Friday, and the new government will have a commanding majority of more than 170 in the next parliament. Because of its electoral system, Britain can see large discrepancies between the share of seats won by a party and its share of the popular vote. If support for one party \u2013 or antipathy toward another \u2013 is spread fairly evenly across the country, it does not need to win a large share of the popular vote to win a huge majority of seats in parliament. Labour secured its landslide victory even as it won just about a third of the popular vote. The results represent one of the largest swings in British political history, and a stunning defeat for the Conservative Party after 14 years in government, bringing a brutal end to Rishi Sunak\u2019s premiership as his party lost around two-thirds of the 372 seats it was defending. Britain\u2019s traditional third party, the Liberal Democrats, also enjoyed a huge bump, going from just 11 seats won at the 2019 general election to more than 70 \u2013 its best result ever. Nigel Farage\u2019s right-wing, populist Reform UK party won its first five seats and came second in many more, splitting the right-wing vote and contributing to the Conservatives\u2019 losses. Meanwhile, in Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP) suffered a dismal night, with its number of seats slumping to just nine from 48 in 2019, as of Friday morning. Elsewhere across the UK, Sinn F\u00e9in became the largest Northern Irish party in parliament, winning seven of the 18 seats there. Its MPs do not take up their seats, as part of the party\u2019s refusal to recognize British sovereignty over Northern Ireland, given that it advocates for reuniting Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland in the south.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/04/uk/uk-election-results-tracker-map-2024-intl/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_10_weather_beryl-texas-power-outages-heat-wednesday", "text": "Life-threatening heat is gripping southeast Texas, where more than 1.5 million homes and businesses remain without power and air conditioning for a third day after Beryl caused\u00a0major power outages, including\u00a0the largest in one major energy provider\u2019s history. Restoring electricity across the region is expected to take days \u2013 and in some cases weeks \u2013 after Beryl tore through the state as a Category 1 hurricane Monday, flooding coastal communities, shredding homes and ripping down webs of power lines. And what\u2019s left of the storm is still threatening to cause destruction Wednesday in the form of tornadoes and flooding more than 1,000 miles away in the Northeast. So impactful was the storm in Texas that the utility provider responsible for most of the outages said it was a historic event. \u201cWe have never seen an incident of this magnitude \u2013 this is the largest outage in our history,\u201d Brad Tutunjian, CenterPoint\u2019s vice president of Electric Distribution and Power Delivery, said during a Houston City Council meeting Wednesday. The utility has been servicing the area for \u201cover a hundred years,\u201d he noted. As power outages continue to plague Houston, there has been a three-time increase in call volume from residents contacting emergency officials. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over 200 carbon monoxide poisoning calls in the last 24 hours,\u201d Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said during a Wednesday afternoon news conference. Pe\u00f1a cited the improper use of generators at homes and people turning on their cars to charge devices in their garages. He also said they are seeing an increase in medical emergencies related to the heat. Homes have become saunas and food languishes in warm refrigerators, mainly from Galveston to north of Houston, according to\u00a0PowerOutage.us. Phone and internet access has also been cut off in some communities, including Galveston. \u201cNo WiFi, no power, and it\u2019s hot outside. That\u2019s dangerous for people. That\u2019s really the big issue,\u201d Houston resident Robin Taylor told the Associated Press. \u201cPeople will die in this heat in their homes.\u201d Beryl has been blamed for at least 11 deaths in Texas and Louisiana, mainly from fallen trees. Two deaths in Houston\u2019s Harris County were the result of carbon monoxide poisoning, Texas emergency officials said, prompting warnings about the dangers using generators in areas where families are living and sleeping. A 71-year-old woman died in Galveston County Monday after her oxygen machine ran out of battery while her power was out, state Sen. Mayes Middleton, confirmed in a news conference Tuesday. Cooling centers have opened across the region as air temperatures crept into the 90s and the heat index teased 105 degrees. The heat index \u2013 a measurement of how the body feels under both heat and humidity \u2013 will reach triple digits across Texas each afternoon through at least the weekend. Most of the West and South of the country are in the throes of a long-lasting heat wave that has seen dozens of records broken and caused multiple deaths. Prolonged heat exposure poses significant health risks for people without adequate cooling and may be especially dangerous for Texans working outdoors to clear debris or damaged infrastructure. Heat also presents increased risks for the elderly, people with chronic medical conditions, homeless people and children. Hospitals in Houston are at risk of overcrowding as they cannot release patients to homes without power, prompting city officials to organize overflow beds in an indoor sports stadium, Patrick said Tuesday. On Wednesday, the office of Houston City Council Member Joaquin Martinez delivered water to two senior facilities without power in his district. One room had some electricity in one of the facilities, but at the second, people had to gather outside to stay cool, a representative from his office told CNN. \u201cThey were desperate and expressed concern,\u201d the representative said. The power outage also shuttered nine fire stations, as they didn\u2019t have generators, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said Wednesday afternoon. \u201cI get really, really upset when I learn the City of Houston does not have generators at essential services like a fire station,\u201d a frustrated Whitmire said during the news conference. \u201cGreat cities should not operate like that \u2013 it\u2019s neglect, it\u2019s severe neglect and we\u2019re going to fix it as we go forward.\u201d Long lines of cars and residents snaked out of fast food restaurants, food trucks and gas stations in the hopes of getting a few minutes of cool air or a bite to eat, according to the AP. Dwight Yell, 54, had power at his house but took a disabled neighbor, who did not, to Denny\u2019s for some food, the outlet reports. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has stressed to CenterPoint Energy the importance of restoring power as quickly as possible. The utility estimates about 80% of its customers in Houston are without power. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be in the heat. It\u2019s tough not to be able to refrigerate anything and tough not being able to go out and get food,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cI made sure that CenterPoint was aware of that and asked them to pull out all the stops to get power back as quickly as they could.\u201d But CenterPoint officials say it could be several days before power is fully restored to its customers, though it hopes to restore service to 1 million customers by Wednesday night. As of Wednesday afternoon, more than 1.2 million of its customers were still in the dark. \u201cAlmost universally, people have lost patience with CenterPoint,\u201d City Council Member Julian Ramirez\u00a0told CNN Wednesday. While some people are trying to stay with friends and family who have power, many can\u2019t afford to leave their homes, Ramirez said. Food is another concern, as many stores are still closed, he said, so his office, food banks and public services are trying to quickly distribute food to underserved areas. \u201cCenterPoint can\u2019t seem to tell us how long this is going to last,\u201d he said. President Joe Biden on Tuesday approved a federal emergency disaster declaration that will assist with some recovery costs, including clearing debris, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s office said. But before long-term recovery efforts get underway, many frustrated residents are grappling with how to address their immediate needs. \u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic when you lose everything in your fridge and you are living check to check,\u201d Harris County Commissioner Lesley Briones told the AP. Beryl barrels into Northeast Though Beryl has substantially weakened since slamming into Texas as a Category 1 hurricane, its remnants still pose serious flood and tornado threats Wednesday to the northern US. More than 10 million people are under flood watches across parts of the Midwest and Northeast. The watches will begin to expire for the Midwest by the end of the day Wednesday but will last in New England until Thursday morning. Heavy rainfall and a serious tornado threat began Wednesday afternoon in parts of the Northeast. Several tornado warnings occurred simultaneously in parts of New York and northern Pennsylvania. The most significant tornado threat will encompass areas from northern Pennsylvania to southern New Hampshire and Vermont through the evening. That includes Syracuse and Albany, New York, and Scranton, Pennsylvania. Beryl already whipped up more than a dozen tornadoes across Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana on Monday and two in Indiana and Kentucky on Tuesday. One damaging tornado in southwestern Indiana tore through a warehouse in Mount Vernon and shredded the roof and crushed tractor trailers. West\u2019s heat wave stretches to second week Heat alerts engulf more than 140 million Americans on both coasts, but the brunt of the heat is still impacting the West, where communities have been baking under high temperatures for at least two weeks. Extremely dangerous heat has caused several deaths in the West and will persist in the region through Friday, bringing high temperatures well into the 100s in some areas as temperatures reach between 10 to 30 degrees above average to some areas. California\u2019s Death Valley has reached or exceeded 125 degrees every day since July 4, and the streak is expected to continue through Friday, marking its second-longest streak of days above 125, behind 10 days in July 1913. In Nevada, Las Vegas hit 119 degrees Tuesday, which is its fourth straight day of breaking a daily high temperature record. \u201cThe multi-day length and record warm overnight temperatures will continue to cause heat stress to anyone without adequate cooling and hydration,\u201d the National Weather Service warned. Human-caused climate change is driving far more frequent and intense heat waves across the globe, exposing communities to increasingly dangerous temperatures. When a person is unable to cool their body down amid prolonged heat, they\u00a0are at risk\u00a0for damage to the brain and other vital organs, as well as other heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and stroke. The weather service in Houston has advised residents to limit outdoor activities, work early or late in the day, wear light clothing and sunscreen and check on loved ones, neighbors and pets.

At two hours and 51 minutes, it was the longest women\u2019s singles semifinal in Wimbledon history and the win means Paolini is the first woman since Serena Williams in 2016 to reach the final of the French Open and Wimbledon in the same season. \u201cReally tough today,\u201d Paolini, the No. 7 seed, said in her on-court interview. \u201cShe played unbelievable, she was hitting winners everywhere. I was struggling a little bit at the beginning, I was just repeating to myself to fight for every ball and to try to improve a little bit on the court. But I\u2019m so happy with this win, I think this match I will remember forever. \u201cI was trying to think about what to do on the court point by point and repeating to myself that there is no place better than here where to fight for every ball, every point. For a tennis player, this is the best place to play a match like this and really, thank you for cheering for me,\u201d she said to a huge applause from the Centre Court crowd. \u201cThis last month has been crazy for me. I\u2019m trying just to focus on what I have to do on the court, enjoy what I\u2019m doing because I love playing tennis. It\u2019s amazing to be here playing in this stadium. It\u2019s a dream. I was watching Wimbledon finals when I was kid, so I\u2019m enjoying it and just living in the present.\u201d Veki\u0107 \u2013 who was bidding to become the first Croatian woman to reach a grand slam final since Iva Majoli at the 1997 French Open, according to tennis author Bastien Fachan \u2013 broke Paolini twice as she stormed to a one-set lead. But Paolini, who admitted she was \u201cserving really bad\u201d to start the match, soon found her range in the second set. It was a supremely tense affair, with Paolini only breaking Veki\u0107 in her final service game of the set. In a truly memorable third and deciding set, the pair exchanged two breaks of serve to level the scores at 5-5. Veki\u0107, the unseeded world No. 37, then had a break point to take her to the brink of victory, but Hawk-Eye showed her shot was just three millimeters out, allowing Paolini to eventually hold serve. Veki\u0107 began sobbing at the change of ends, but composed herself remarkably well to hold serve and force a tie break, which Paolini won after almost three hours of sublime tennis. At 28 years of age, Paolini has enjoyed by far and away the best season of her career. She has steadily climbed up the rankings since breaking into the top 100 in 2019 and in February this year won the prestigious WTA 1000 Dubai Tennis Championships, only the second title of her career. She then reached her first grand slam final at the French Open last month, where she was beaten by Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.

Archbishop Edgar Pe\u00f1a Parra, who holds the role of \u201csostituto\u201d (\u201csubstitute\u201d), the equivalent of a papal chief of staff, took the witness stand in a dispute over the Holy See\u2019s disastrous investment in a London property, the center of the Vatican\u2019s\u00a0\u201ctrial of the century\u201d. The archbishop\u2019s appearance in court is rare given the Vatican and its senior officials have largely avoided legal actions in foreign courts \u2013 often concerning sexual abuse cases \u2013 under the protection of sovereign immunity. But the London legal action is believed to be the first time the Vatican has stood trial in a foreign jurisdiction, while Archbishop Pe\u00f1a Parra is one of the highest-ranking Vatican officials to give evidence in such a case. The 64-year-old Venezuelan archbishop wore a black clerical suit during his evidence and began by swearing an oath on \u201calmighty God\u201d that he would tell the truth. Although he was occasionally assisted by an interpreter, he answered questions in English. Over more than a day and a half of cross-examination, the archbishop insisted several times that he is a \u201cpriest, and not a specialist in banking\u201d as he explained that the Vatican had been the victim of extortion in the property deal. The case against the Holy See has been bought by Raffaele Mincione, an Italian-British financier who was among those convicted by a Vatican court last December of embezzlement and self-laundering for his part in the London property deal. Mincione has denied all the charges against him and is appealing his convictions. That trial marked the first time a cardinal was convicted and sentenced by a Vatican court for financial crimes and is considered an important moment\u00a0in Pope Francis\u2019 long battle to clean up the Vatican\u2019s finances. But Mincione is now seeking a ruling in the London courts that he acted in\u00a0\u201cgood faith\u201d throughout his dealings with the Vatican, which concerned\u00a0investments in a\u00a0vast property in southwest London\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood,\u00a0originally\u00a0built as a car showroom for the Harrods department store. The Holy See says it spent around $400 million on the deal over several years but ended up with losses of $150 million after eventually selling the asset. In 2014, the Vatican invested $200 million for a 45% stake in the Chelsea property through a fund run by Mincione, whose companies had purchased the building for around $165 million (\u00a3129.5 million) at the end of 2012. Although there was a plan to turn the property into apartments, the Vatican says the property\u2019s value was inflated by Mincione and that it was losing money on its investment. Archbishop Pe\u00f1a Parra, who was not in post at the time of the original investment, sought to exit the deal by buying the building outright and, in the process, the Holy See paid \u00a340 million to Mincione. The Vatican says this was a \u201cfraudulent overpayment.\u201d Helping to broker the exit deal in 2018 from Mincione\u2019s fund was another financier, Gianluigi Torzi, who was also convicted at the Vatican trial last December. He was found to have structured a deal which left him in control of the building and the Vatican purchasing an\u00a0\u201cempty box\u201d. Torzi was then accused of extorting around $16 million from the Vatican as Pe\u00f1a Parra and his office sought to finally gain control of the Chelsea building. The property was eventually sold by the Holy See in 2022 for around $229 million. Under cross-examination the archbishop was questioned repeatedly about the Torzi payments and was accused by Mincione\u2019s barrister of dishonesty because the payments to Torzi involved a false invoice. The archbishop admitted to sending a false invoice but said Torzi had \u201ctrapped\u201d the Vatican and would \u201clie and lie.\u201d Pe\u00f1a Parra told the judge repeatedly that he had been trying to extricate the Holy See from a bad deal and gain control of the building. The archbishop, who became the Vatican number three in October 2018, said he only became aware of Torzi\u2019s schemes later and that some of his staff were \u201csuperficial and na\u00efve.\u201d He insisted that now \u201cI would give Torzi nothing, and I would put him in jail several times.\u201d Mincione\u2019s lawyers have accused the Vatican of an \u201cincoherent and confused allegation of conspiracy\u201d against their client, while the Holy See insist that Mincione did not act in good faith. Mincione was also cross examined during the trial, with lawyers accusing him of producing \u201cgrossly misleading\u201d figures about the Chelsea property\u2019s value. The heart of the dispute concerns the value of the Chelsea property. The Vatican\u2019s legal team said the stated value of \u00a3275 million ($350 million) for the London property in 2018 was a \u201cfraudulent representation\u201d of its market worth, while Mincione\u2019s lawyers denied this, saying it was an \u201caudited valuation.\u201d In his witness statement, Pe\u00f1a Parra said he was told of \u201cconcerns\u201d that the value of the building was less than the Vatican had \u201coriginally thought.\u201d The trial is expected to conclude later this month with a judgment likely to be released later in the year. The archbishop is due to conclude giving evidence on Monday.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/05/europe/popes-chief-of-staff-london-property-trial-intl-latam/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_08_asia_china-monster-coast-guard-ship-philippines-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "China anchored one of its two \u201cmonster\u201d coast guard ships inside the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone (EEZ) last week in what a Philippine official called an act of \u201cintimidation\u201d in the ongoing territorial dispute between Beijing and Manila in the South China Sea. Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Jay Tarriela said the China Coast Guard vessel CCG-5901 anchored near Sabina Shoal in the Spratly Islands, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northwest of the Philippine island of Palawan on July 3, well within Manila\u2019s 230-mile EEZ. Displacing 12,000 tons and with a length of 541 feet, CCG-5901 is three times the size of the United States Coast Guard\u2019s main patrol vessels, the National Security Cutters - leading many observers to refer to the Chinese vessel as \u201cThe Monster.\u201d While at Sabina Shoal, the Chinese ship anchored within 800 yards of one of the Philippine Coast Guard\u2019s newest and biggest ships previously deployed to the area, Tarriela said in a post on X. CCG-5901 is more than five times the size of the Philippine ship, the BRP Teresa Magbanua. \u201cIt\u2019s an intimidation on the part of the China Coast Guard,\u201d Tarriela said during a forum on Saturday, according to a Reuters report. But he said the Philippines would not back down on its South China Sea claims. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to pull out, and we\u2019re not going to be intimidated,\u201d Tarriela added. When asked the Philippine claims during a regular press briefing Monday, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the area in question was part of the Philippines\u2019 exclusive economic zone. \u201cChina\u2019s military and police ships patrolling and enforcing the law in the waters near Xianbin Jiao are in compliance with China\u2019s domestic law and international law,\u201d spokesperson Lin Jian said, using the Chinese term for the Sabina Shoal. China claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the South China Sea, and most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles from mainland China. Multiple governments, including Manila, hold competing claims. In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea. But Beijing has ignored the ruling. Instead it has increasingly pushed its maritime territorial claims, with China Coast Guard ships \u2013 reinforced by militia boats \u2013 involved in multiple clashes over the past year that have damaged Philippine ships and seen Filipino sailors injured by water cannon. A clash near Second Thomas Shoal in June saw Chinese coast guard officers\u00a0brandishing an axe\u00a0and other bladed or pointed tools at Filipino soldiers and\u00a0slashing\u00a0their rubber boat. A Filipino soldier lost a thumb during the confrontation. CCG-5901 wasn\u2019t involved in that incident but has been prowling areas of the Philippines\u2019 EEZ since, according to Ray Powell, a South China Sea expert and director of SeaLight at the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation at Stanford University. \u201cImmediately following the dramatic standoff at Second Thomas Shoal \u2026 The Monster toured nearly every Philippine outpost and key feature in the South China Sea,\u201d Powell said. Powell and other analysts say intimidation is one of the main jobs of the CCG-5901, which is larger than any regular coast guard ship in the world (a specialty US Coast Guard icebreaker is bigger) and even outsizes US Navy destroyers. The Arleigh Burke-class destroyers displace 9,700 tons or less and are about 35 feet shorter than CCG-5901. The US Coast Guard\u2019s National Security Cutters, displace 4,500 tons, a third of the size of CCG-5901. In a firepower comparison, CCG-5901 also betters the US cutters, with two main 76.2-millimeters guns compared to one main 57-millimeter gun on the US ships. \u201cIts massive size enables it to intimidate its neighbors while avoiding the escalatory implications of sending a gray-hulled military vessel,\u201d Powell said, referring to navy ships. Coast guards, known as white-hulled vessels because of their color, are usually assigned to law enforcement and search-and-rescue operations. In most countries, they are not normally expected to participate in military operations. The US Coast Guard, for instance, is part of the US Department of Homeland Security, not the Defense Department, although US Coast Guard vessels can come under US Navy control in certain scenarios. The China Coast Guard is part of the country\u2019s People\u2019s Armed Police, which is under the command of the Central Military Commission. Analysts say that\u2019s a key difference between the two coast guard agencies. \u201cIt is not really intended to carry out traditional coast guard missions, but is primarily used as a central element in China\u2019s paramilitary maritime force,\u201d Powell said of \u201cThe Monster.\u201d Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center, said CCG-5901\u2019s size and crew enable it to be a central command ship for a larger operation. He noted that a Chinese navy aircraft carrier was also operating near the Philippines in recent weeks and that the combination of the two is a coordinated effort to demonstrate overwhelming Chinese naval power to Manila. China has both the world\u2019s largest navy, in terms of sheer ship numbers, as well as the world\u2019s largest coast guard. Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said \u201cThe Monster\u201d shows the Chinese military\u2019s ability for \u201cescalation dominance,\u201d adding that the vessel the Philippines had previously sent to Sabina Shoal, the Teresa Magbanua, was one of its best. The China Coast Guard \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to be outdone thus this monster came along to show who\u2019s got a bigger set of muscles,\u201d Koh said.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/08/asia/china-monster-coast-guard-ship-philippines-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
{"id": "2024_07_09_weather_beryl-storm-texas-power-outages-heat", "text": "Restoring power to millions of Texans slammed by the deadly and destructive storm Beryl could take days or even weeks, posing a dangerous scenario for residents without air conditioning as triple-digit heat index temperatures hit the state. Beryl slammed into southern Texas as a Category 1 hurricane Monday, knocking out power to more than 2.5 million homes and leaving at least eight people dead in Texas and Louisiana. More than 1.7 million customers, mostly in Galveston up through Houston, are still without power Tuesday night, according to PowerOutage.us. At least 34 utilities are experiencing outages. The storm unleashed flooding rains and winds that transformed roads into rushing rivers, ripped through power lines and tossed trees onto homes, roads and cars. President Biden granted a federal emergency disaster declaration for parts of Texas due to Beryl\u2019s destruction, acting Texas Gov. Dan Patrick announced Tuesday. \u201cFEMA\u2019s assistance with these costs will expedite the recovery process and help ensure the safety of Texans impacted by Hurricane Beryl,\u201d Patrick said. The emergency declaration will grant 75% reimbursement for debris cleanup for all 121 impacted Texas counties, Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief W. Nim Kidd said at a Tuesday news conference. What\u2019s left of Beryl is hurtling into the Midwest. Despite having lost strength and its core, it still threatens to trigger more flooding and tornadoes along its path. As difficult recovery and cleanup efforts are underway in southeast Texas, including the Houston area, extreme heat is bearing down on the region Tuesday and will continue for much of the week, creating hazardous conditions for those working outdoors, the elderly, people with chronic medical conditions, children and those without adequate cooling. The heat index in Houston passed 100 degrees on Tuesday. The heat index measures how the body feels under both heat and humidity. Both Houston\u2019s George Bush Intercontinental Airport and William P. Hobby Airport reported a heat index of 103 degrees by early Tuesday afternoon. Air temperatures in the region will climb into the 90s through at least early next week. When a person is unable to cool their body down amid prolonged heat, they are at risk for damage to the brain and other vital organs, as well as other heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and stroke. Heat is the deadliest form of extreme weather in the US, killing more than twice as many people each year as hurricanes and tornadoes combined. With some residents opting for generators in the wake of outages, Kidd noted at least two carbon monoxide poisoning deaths have been reported in Harris County, home to Houston. \u201cIf you have a generator that you\u2019re running, please make sure it is far away from the area that you are living and sleeping,\u201d Kidd explained, adding such deaths are preventable. But restoring power to hard-hit communities will be a multi-day undertaking, according to Thomas Gleeson, the chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Texas. And in the coastal city of Galveston, city officials have estimated it could be as many as two weeks before electricity is restored. Utility company says damage was more severe than expected Texas utility CenterPoint Energy has borne the brunt of the outages, and though the company had braced for Beryl\u2019s impact, it said the damage was more severe than it had expected. As of Tuesday night, CenterPoint still had more than 1.3 million customers without service. \u201cThe storm veered off the originally expected course and more heavily impacted the company\u2019s customers, systems and infrastructure than previously anticipated, resulting in outages to more than 2.26 million customers at its peak,\u201d the utility said. That amounts to 80% of CenterPoint\u2019s Houston region customers, company representative Paul Lock said during a Tuesday evening news conference. Earlier Tuesday, Patrick said he has repeatedly urged CenterPoint Energy to \u201cwork as quickly as they can\u201d to restore power. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be in the heat. It\u2019s tough now to be able to refrigerate anything and tough not being able to go out and get food,\u201d he added. The utility had said they expected to restore power to 1 million customers by Wednesday night. CenterPoint also hopes to complete full damage assessments by the end of the Tuesday, company spokesperson Logan Anderson told CNN Tuesday afternoon. In the evening news conference, Lock said he couldn\u2019t give a timeline for power restoration, \u201cbut it is not going to be tomorrow.\u201d He said the utility will provide a system-wide restoration timeline after the damage assessments are complete. Houston Mayor John Whitmire, whose home was also without power Monday, said CenterPoint and the city are \u201cfully aware\u201d of how pressing electricity restoration is. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of every community. No community is favored over another community. Every Houstonian is important to us. We\u2019ll get your power on as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. In Katy, Texas, just west of Houston, resident Lizzette Varela said her home lost power Monday morning and hasn\u2019t regained it since. Her family is trying to find access to lodging, internet and food storage on a day-to-day basis, she told CNN. \u201cThere is no clear word from CenterPoint. They expect that by Wednesday there will be 1 million more people with electricity, but there\u2019s 2 million people without power. How do you know if you\u2019re part of the 50% with power? It\u2019s like a game,\u201d she said. Mayor Gregg Bisso of Surfside Beach, Texas \u2013 located 60 miles south of Houston \u2013 said he is \u201cmad as hell\u201d at CenterPoint, as 90% of the Gulf Coast destination is without power. \u201cWe are the first to get hit\u2014and hit the hardest\u2014but because we are over the bridge, we are the last ones to get service back,\u201d Bisso said. Bisso said most residents thankfully heeded a voluntary evacuation order, as Beryl brought sustained winds of well-over 90 mph that damaged countless homes \u2013 with some missing whole roofs. Houston residents working through aftermath The Houston Zoo is also working to clean up damage and flooding from Beryl, Jackie Wallace, assistant vice president of communications and public affairs, told CNN Tuesday. All the animals are safe and fared well throughout the hurricane and power outage, Wallace said, as the zoo used generators until power was restored late Tuesday morning. A team of staff spent Sunday and Monday overnight at the zoo to ensure the safety of the animals and take care of any emergency issues on the grounds. The animals spent the nights, as usual, safely in their barns, Wallace said. In recent years, the zoo has undergone extensive upgrades with hurricanes and freezes in mind, which included an office garage being built on campus for staff to ride out storms. The zoo will remain closed until Thursday. Some other businesses are staying open, however. For Crystal Petty, the manager of a Baskin-Robbins in southwestern Houston, business is busier than usual as people clamor for relief from the high temperatures and humidity. \u201cI have a phone call coming in about every 30 minutes with someone asking if we\u2019re open or not,\u201d Petty told CNN. Petty\u2019s store regained power at 7 a.m. Tuesday with most of their products still good to sell \u2013 save the ice cream cake display, which had melted from being in the front window. Scoops were being served a cool four hours later. From her correspondence with other local stores, Petty believes her Baskin-Robbins might be the only one in the city still with power. Beryl\u2019s path through the US At its peak, Beryl was a record-shattering Category 5 storm but has since been reduced to a far less powerful system with winds of 30 mph. Still, what\u2019s left of Beryl will produce flooding and tornadoes in the US as it moves inland through mid-week. Beryl became the first storm in the Atlantic hurricane season to make landfall in the US after tearing a devastating path through the Caribbean, where it caused at least nine other deaths. The storm marks the start to a hurricane season experts say will be far from normal, as fossil fuel pollution contributes to abnormally warm water and rapidly intensifying storms. The center of the storm will continue through Illinois by the end of Tuesday. It is then expected to blow into Indiana on\u00a0Wednesday morning and race through Ohio and Michigan and into Canada by the end of the week. The threat of tornadoes linked to Beryl increased Tuesday, prompting the Storm Prediction Center to upgrade the risk of severe thunderstorms\u00a0to a level 3 of 5 for western Kentucky and southern Indiana. Parts of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys are under a level 2 of 5 severe thunderstorm threat, primarily for tornadoes associated with the storms, according to the\u00a0center. Fourteen tornadoes from Beryl were reported Monday in Texas, Louisiana and southern Arkansas. About 23.4 million people are under flood watches Tuesday. Flash flood warnings were issued along the storm\u2019s path Tuesday morning. Heat sprawls across the West Heat alerts have been issued\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0for about half of the US population, spanning both coasts, but the West coast being hit particularly hard. An oppressive heat wave is blanketing the West and will hover over the region for several more days, likely bringing high temperatures between 10 to 30 degrees above average to some areas. Human-caused climate change is driving far more frequent and intense heat waves across the globe, exposing communities to increasingly dangerous temperatures. Excessive heat warnings, watches and heat advisories are in effect for nearly all of Washington state, Oregon, California, Idaho, Nevada and southwest Arizona. Parts of western Nevada and northeastern California won\u2019t see high temperatures below 100 degrees until next weekend,\u00a0the National Weather Service office in Reno said. In Oregon, four people died of suspected heat-related illnesses over the weekend, and another suspected heat-related death was reported Monday, according to\u00a0news releases\u00a0from Multnomah County. A motorcyclist also died from heat exposure in California\u2019s Death Valley on Saturday, when the high temperature was 128 degrees. In Arizona, a 50-year-old hiker died amid searing temperatures Sunday on the Grand Canyon\u2019s Bright Angel Trail, according to the National Park Service.

{"id": "2024_07_11_asia_south-korea-antidrone-lasers-intl-hnk-ml", "text": "South Korea is beginning the mass production of a low-cost laser weapon that has successfully shot down small drones during testing, the country\u2019s key arms agency said Thursday. The laser weapon, called Block-I, \u201ccan precisely strike small unmanned aerial vehicles and multicopters at close range,\u201d a news release from South Korea\u2019s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) said. The release did not give a cost for the weapon, but said each shot fired would only cost about $1.50. Imagery supplied by the agency appears to show a weapon around the size of a shipping container with a laser mounted on top and what appears to be a radar or tracking device mounted on one side of the platform. DAPA said the unit measures 9 meters by 3 meters by 3 meters (29.5 feet by 9.8 feet by 9.8 feet), and fires laser rays that are difficult if not impossible to detect before impact. \u201cIt is invisible and noiseless, does not require separate ammunition and can be operated only when electricity is supplied,\u201d the DAPA release said. Future versions could be developed to take out much bigger targets, including aircraft and ballistic missiles, which would be a potential \u201cgame changer,\u201d according to the release. DAPA will develop \u201ca laser anti-aircraft weapon (Block-II) system with improved output and range compared to the current one,\u201d the release said. But the Block-I weapon itself comes online at an important time. In Ukraine, the Middle East and elsewhere, small drones - some available off the shelf - have shown the ability to disable or destroy multimillion-dollar pieces of military hardware, including tanks. Militaries have typically responded by trying to take out low-cost drones with defensive systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars per strike. A weapon that could do the same for practically pennies would be a big boost to the country that can deploy it. \u201cLow-cost drones and rockets have swung the economic calculus of offense and defense in favor of those using large volumes of cheap unmanned systems and munitions to overwhelm more-sophisticated air and missile defenses,\u201d James Black, assistant director defense and security for the RAND Europe think tank, wrote in a blog post in January. DAPA said the Block-I weapon has been in development for five years, with more than $63 million invested. The Korea Institute for Defense Analyses led the system development with participation from Hanwha Aerospace, it said. The system was evaluated suitable for combat in April 2023 after achieving 100% success in shooting down targets in live-fire tests, according to DAPA. The agency said South Korea is the first country to publicly acknowledge it will deploy a mass-produced laser weapon. Earlier this year, Britain showed off a new laser weapon that its military says could deliver lethal missile or aircraft defense at around $13 a shot. But no possible deployment date for that weapon had been announced. In 2022, the US Navy successfully tested a high-energy laser system against a target representing a cruise missile. But a Navy account of that test said there was no plan to get it into the hands of warfighters, adding that it \u201coffers a glimpse into the future of laser weapons.\u201d", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/asia/south-korea-antidrone-lasers-intl-hnk-ml/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}

The investigation will look into what the problems were in the utilities\u2019 response to Hurricane Beryl. \u201cI\u2019m sure we will find that there are things they could have done better,\u201d Patrick said. Many residents are sheltering with friends or family who have power, but some can\u2019t afford to leave their homes, Houston City Councilman Julian Ramirez told CNN Wednesday. And while countless families have lost food in their warming fridges, many stores are still closed, leaving government offices, food banks and other public services scrambling to distribute food to underserved areas, he said. As residents desperately try to cool their homes with generators, carbon monoxide poisoning has become a serious concern. At least two people have died in Harris County from carbon monoxide poisoning and fire departments have received more than 200 carbon monoxide poisoning calls in 24 hours, local officials said. Beyond that, a 71-year-old woman died near Crystal Beach after her oxygen machine ran out of battery power and her generator shut down. Heat-related medical emergencies are also spiking in Houston, as 90-degree temperatures blanket southeast Texas, Fire Chief Samuel Pe\u00f1a said. The heat index \u2013 a measurement of how the body feels under both heat and humidity \u2013 could reach 106 degrees in some areas, a life-threatening scenario for people without adequate cooling. The dangerous heat \u2013 driven by\u00a0human-caused climate change\u00a0\u2013 hasn\u2019t been limited to Texas. At least 28 heat-related deaths in the West have been reported since July 1, as a record-breaking heat wave beats down on states including California, Oregon and Arizona. Essential operations, including hospitals and senior living homes, have been prioritizing powering medically necessary equipment. Some Houston hospitals are at risk of overcrowding as they cannot release patients to homes without power, prompting city officials to organize overflow beds in an indoor sports stadium, Patrick, the lieutenant governor, said Tuesday. Nine fire stations in Houston have closed and relocated because they did not have generators, Pe\u00f1a said, even as emergency calls flood in. Animal rescue teams and pet owners have also been working overtime to protect fuzzy companions. Pug Hearts Houston owner Cindy Rothermel said she heard of pug owners sitting in their cars with the A/C running to cool the dogs down in \u201cintolerable\u201d heat. Texans losing patience with utility company More than 1 million CenterPoint customers remain without power as of Thursday afternoon. Beryl\u2019s impact left more than 2.2 million customers without electricity on Monday. By Wednesday night, CenterPoint said it had restored power to 1.1 million customers and hoped to have an additional 400,000 restored by Friday and 350,000 more by Sunday. But roughly 500,000 customers in the Houston area will not have electrical power restored until sometime next week, according to a CenterPoint Energy executive who spoke Thursday before the Texas Public Utility Commission. The homes and businesses most affected by the power outage are in the areas hardest hit by Hurricane Beryl on the southern side of Houston and up through the Interstate 45 corridor, said Jason Ryan, CenterPoint\u2019s executive vice president for regulatory services and government affairs. The private utility says these neighborhoods suffered massive electrical infrastructure damage, with fallen trees and branches dismantling powerlines that now need to be replaced by crews on the ground. \u201cWe know we still have a lot of work to do,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cI know customers are frustrated.\u201d As the miserable conditions persist, anger is spreading among those who say the utility should have been more prepared for the storm. \u201cAlmost universally people have lost patience with CenterPoint,\u201d Ramirez, the councilman, told CNN. \u201cCenterPoint can\u2019t seem to tell us how long this is going to last.\u201d Just north of Houston in Spring, Texas, Elizabeth Garrison, 65, and her husband, 77, are enduring nearly 90 degree temperatures in the house without air conditioning, she told CNN. Now on their fourth day without power, the pair are making do with just two fans, one battery-powered and the other hooked up to a neighbor\u2019s generator. \u201cYou get very very warm, you open the windows and you just try to drink a lot of liquids,\u201d Garrison said. \u201cIt was okay because we heard on Wednesday that a lot of people were going to get their power. So it\u2019s like OK, I can make it Tuesday. But then Wednesday evening comes and you don\u2019t have power and it\u2019s even worse.\u201d In Fort Bend County, southwest of the Houston area, Sheriff Eric Fagan said authorities received a call \u201cthat a CenterPoint Energy worker had a\u00a0gun\u00a0pulled on them.\u201d \u201cWe all need to be calm and patient,\u201d the sheriff said in a\u00a0news conference\u00a0Thursday. \u201cEveryone is working hard out there 24/7\u2026 You have to realize CenterPoint called people outside of the state to help with this emergency.\u201d The sheriff warned, \u201cWe will not tolerate them being abused, let alone having a\u00a0gun\u00a0pulled on them.\u201d Several members of the Texas Public Utility Commission have urged company officials to improve communication as part of \u201crebuilding trust\u201d with customers in the hurricane-damaged areas. \u201cInfrastructure is going to break,\u201d said Thomas Gleeson, chairman of the state commission. \u201cThings are going to happen. But if people feel like they\u2019re being effectively communicated with, it makes it a lot easier to go through.\u201d Just after July 4, about three days before the storm hit the Texas coast, Ryan, the CenterPoint executive, said the utility put out its first request for 3,000 \u201cmutual assistance\u201d workers to pre-position ahead of the storm. As the path of the storm moved east and closer to the Houston area in the final days before landfall, CenterPoint says it increased the request for repair crews to 10,000. The utility said Thursday morning it would begin providing estimated restoration times on its status tracker. CenterPoint Vice President of Operations Darin Carroll told CNN affiliate KHOU the pace of repairs will begin to slow as the community moves deeper into disaster recovery. Additionally, Carroll told the station the utility aimed to improve the accuracy of its power outage map, which has been criticized by residents across social media for having inaccuracies, including saying power is restored where it is not. The city council grilled a CenterPoint executive on Wednesday, asking why the company hasn\u2019t done more to prepare for storms. Brad Tutunjian, CenterPoint vice president of electric distribution and power delivery, said they\u2019ve never seen an incident to this magnitude and described it as the \u201clargest outage in our history.\u201d Three months before Hurricane Beryl hit Texas, CenterPoint Energy estimated it would need $2 billion to harden its system against worsening extreme weather. The company reported it needed to restore power after 15 extreme weather events between 2019 to 2023. The longest restoration time to date was after the deadly winter storm and brutal cold snap in February 2021, when it took 116 hours and 40 minutes to restore power to more than 8 million impacted customers. Much of Texas\u2019s electrical infrastructure was built in the 1970s and 1980s, when weather was less extreme, Joshua Rhodes, an energy research scientist at UT Austin, told CNN. The string of storms Texas has been hit with in recent years is now taking a toll. \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise the infrastructure built for milder weather is failing more often,\u201d Rhodes said. Elder care facilities struggle without power Senior care facilities and residents who rely on electric medical devices are particularly at risk as power outages stretch through at least the end of the week. CrowdSource Rescue, a nonprofit primarily serving as a search-and-rescue group, identified roughly 120 living facilities for seniors that need help. The group has helped deliver generators and supplies to 16 so far. \u201cThe whole city is hurting and suffering. That\u2019s what it feels like right now, from my vantage point,\u201d said Matthew Marchetti, a co-founder of CrowdSource Rescue. \u201cBut I think for the seniors, they\u2019re taking the brunt of it. So we\u2019re trying to do everything we can.\u201d Marchetti said his teams typically set up an AC unit and generator in one part of a facility \u2013 like a community room or a leasing office \u2013 for people to gather and cool off, but the challenge has been moving people down to those rooms from high floors in buildings with no working elevators. After two days of flood-related issues, mold, no power and excruciating heat, 57-year-old Frankie Thibideaux said she left her Houston-area residential building to stay in a hotel. But she remains worried about the mostly elderly residents who occupy the building in Missouri City, just southwest of Houston, Thibideaux told CNN. Many of them live on the third and fourth floor, she said, but several have no way of getting down because they rely on walkers or wheelchairs. \u201cPeople up there are on dialysis,\u201d Thibideaux said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad. They\u2019re trying to keep their medicine cold, but there\u2019s no ice anywhere.\u201d Storm brought tornadoes, flooding to Northeast The National Weather Service in Buffalo, New York, confirmed two tornadoes in the area Wednesday, as the remnants of Beryl tracked across the state. The local weather service issued nine tornado warnings Wednesday \u2013-\u00a0the most ever put out\u00a0in\u00a0a single day. Flash flood warnings were in effect Thursday morning from\u00a0northern\u00a0New\u00a0York\u00a0to central Maine, with early morning flash flooding \u00ad\u00adin Vermont and New Hampshire. As the system continues to move east-northeast, the bulk of the storm\u2019s impacts are expected to be over for most of New England. Over 100 people have been rescued and a body was recovered from floodwaters after Beryl\u2019s remnants swept through Vermont Wednesday, according to state officials. The fatality has not officially been tied to the storm, but officials believe a man was in a vehicle that was swept away in water, according to Public Safety Commissioner Jennifer Morrison.", "source": "http://cnn.com/2024/07/11/weather/texas-heat-beryl-power-outage-thursday/index.html", "metadata": {"scrape_date": "07/12/2024", "section": "world"}}
